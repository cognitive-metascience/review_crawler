The asymmetric crystal structure of trimeric AcrB suggests a functionally rotating mechanism for drug transport. Despite various supportive forms of evidence from biochemical and simulation studies for this mechanism, the link between the functional rotation and proton translocation across the membrane remains elusive. Here, calculating the minimum free energy pathway of the functional rotation for the complete AcrB trimer, we describe the structural and energetic basis behind the coupling between the functional rotation and the proton translocation at atomic resolution. Free energy calculations show that protonation of Asp408 in the transmembrane portion of the drug-bound protomer drives the functional rotation. The conformational pathway identifies vertical shear motions among several transmembrane helices, which regulate alternate access of water in the transmembrane as well as peristaltic motions that pump drugs in the periplasm.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>multidrug transporter</kwd><kwd>multidrug resistance</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>string

multidrug resistance (MDR) is an increasing threat to current antibiotic therapyÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Resistance nodulation cell division (RND) transporters are one of the main causes of MDR in Gram-negative bacteria. These transporters pump a wide spectrum of antibiotics out of the cell by means of proton- or sodium-motive forces, conferring MDR to the bacterium when overexpressed. Understanding the mechanism of the drug efflux process is invaluable for the treatment of bacterial infections and the design of more effective drugs or inhibitors.</p><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the AcrA-AcrB-TolC complex is largely responsible for MDR against many lipophilic antibioticsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2015</xref>). This tripartite assembly spans the periplasmic space between the inner and the outer membranes of the cell, transporting drugs from the cell to the medium. TolC, an outer membrane protein, forms a generic outer membrane channel in which drugs can passively move towards the medium. AcrB is an inner membrane protein, primarily responsible for specificity towards drugs and their uptake, as well as for energy transduction. AcrA acts as an adaptor that bridges TolC and AcrBÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>AcrB is one of the best characterized RND transporters in both experiments and simulations, making it a prototype for studying the drug efflux mechanism of the RND familyÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pos, 2009</xref>). AcrB transports drugs from the inner membrane surface or the periplasm to the TolC channel using the proton-motive force. The structure of AcrB was first solved in a three-fold symmetric formÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murakami et al., 2002</xref>), and later in an asymmetric formÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murakami et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seeger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sennhauser et al., 2007</xref>). AcrB is a homotrimer with a triangular-prism shape, and each protomer is made up of three domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): the transmembrane (TM) domain and an extensive periplasmic portion comprising the porter and the funnel domains. The TM domain transfers protons across the inner membrane down the electrochemical gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The porter domain is made of four subdomains, PN1, PN2, PC1 and PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and is responsible for drug transportation. The funnel domain has a funnel-like shape with an exit pore that indirectly connects to TolC via AcrAÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31715.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of AcrB and simulation setup.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simulation box and a side view of AcrB embedded in a palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) lipid bilayer.

The A state has entrances (an open cleft between PC1 and PC2, and a groove between TM helices, TM8 and TM9) for drug uptake. The B state has aÂ bindingÂ pocket (called the distal binding pocket) formed by PN1, PN2 and PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This pocket contains many hydrophobic residues, as well as several charged and polar residues, contributing to broad substrate âpolyspecificityâÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takatsuka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vargiu and Nikaido, 2012</xref>). The E state has a drug exit pathway to the exit pore formed by an inclined central helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The tilt of the central helix is achieved by rigid body motions of a PC2/PN1 repeat (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This motion also closes the PC1/PC2 cleft, leading to contraction of the binding pocketÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pos, 2009</xref>).</p><p>These findings from the asymmetric structure and other biochemical data led to the proposal of the functional rotation mechanismÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murakami et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seeger et al., 2006</xref>). Hereafter, followingÂ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yao et al. (2010</xref>), we use a three letter notation to represent the state of the trimer. For example, the BEA state represents a trimeric state inÂ which the protomer I is in the B state, the protomer II in the E state, and the protomer III in the A state (where protomers are numbered in a counterclockwise order). In the functional rotation mechanism, for example starting from the BEA state, drug efflux is coupled with a conformational transition to the EAB state. Viewed from the top, this transition is a 120 degree rotation of functional states (not a physical rotation). This mechanism is supported by both biochemical studiesÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seeger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takatsuka and Nikaido, 2007</xref>) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studiesÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schulz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zuo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The three functional states satisfy the conditions required in the alternate access modelÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jardetzky, 1966</xref>): the A state (and possibly also the B state) corresponds to an inward-facing state, the E state represents an outward-facing state, and the B state is an occluded state. However, despite this excellent correspondence between the structures and states, theÂ dynamical picture of functional rotation remains unclear. Specifically, how are the conformational changes (functional rotation) and the energy source (proton translocation) synchronized and coupled dynamically? In contrast to drug effluxÂ throughÂ small transporters, where substrate efflux and energy transduction are spatially coupled in the TM domainÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drew and Boudker, 2016</xref>), drug efflux by AcrB occurs in the periplasmic space, whichÂ isÂ spatially separate (~50 Ã apart) from the proton translocation sites in the TM domain. To understand the whole process of drug efflux of AcrB, the energy transduction mechanism between the two distant sites should be clarified, which is the purpose of this study.</p><p>The TM domain of each protomer contains twelve Î±-helices (TM1â12, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Essential residues for proton translocation are in the middle of the TM helices, D407 and D408 on TM4, K940 on TM10, and T978 on TM11. AcrB mutants inÂ which these residuesÂ are substituted by alanine are inactiveÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guan and Nakae, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Takatsuka and Nikaido, 2006</xref>). In the asymmetric structure, K940 shows a distinct side chain orientation in the E state compared with that in the A and B states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Specifically, K940 tilts away from D408 and towards D407 and T978 in the E state, suggesting that transient protonation of D408 contributes to the TM conformational change. Recently, all-atom MD simulation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamane et al. (2013</xref>) showedÂ that the protonation of D408 stabilized the E state, whereas deprotonated D408 induced the conformation change of the TM domain toward the A state. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eicher et al., (2014</xref>)Â showed, by X-ray crystallography of AcrB mutants combined with MD simulations, that these conformational changes in the TM domain were related to the alternate access of water, and in turn to the functional rotation.</p><p>Although these studies provide invaluable insights into the energy transduction mechanism, the difficulty in experimental observation of the protonation states and the time-scale limitation in all-atom MD simulations preclude direct characterization of the energy transduction process. The most direct characterization would be the observation of the functional rotation in various protonation states. To achieve this, we conducted extensive MD simulations with state-of-the-art supercomputing. Using an explicit solvent/lipid all-atom model (480,074 atoms), we identified conformational transition pathways in one step of the functional rotation for the complete AcrB trimers with different protonation states.</p><p>Here, the physically most probable pathway for the functional rotation was searched with the string method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maragliano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2008</xref>). In this method, instead of running a long MD simulation, a pathway connecting two known structures is optimized using multiple copies of a simulation system. The pathway is represented in an important subspace (called âcollective variablesâ) with discretized beads (called âimagesâ). The optimization is carried out by updating the coordinates of the images through multiple simulations toward the minimum free energy pathway. ToÂ date, the string method has been successfully applied for finding the conformational transition pathways of various protein systems, such as c-Src kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gan et al., 2009</xref>), myosin VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ovchinnikov et al., 2011</xref>), ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu and Hummer, 2010</xref>), adenylate kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsunaga et al., 2012</xref>), Î²2-microglobulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stober and Abrams, 2012</xref>), V<sub>1</sub>-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Singharoy et al., 2017</xref>), calcium pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das et al., 2017</xref>), and membrane transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moradi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moradi and Tajkhorshid, 2014</xref>). Extensive samplings around the images are necessary for accurate estimates of theÂ energetics or free energy changes of the whole system along the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsunaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moradi and Tajkhorshid, 2014</xref>), where free energy changes were evaluated by performing umbrella samplings around the images. InÂ addition, to evaluate the impacts of protonation and drug binding, we conducted alchemical free energy calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klimovich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chipot, 2014</xref>).</p><p>By conducting these calculations, we compared theÂ conformational pathways and energetics of two simulationÂ systems, each with different protonation state, to clarify the causal relationship between the protonation and the functional rotation. Free energy evaluation along the pathways shows that theÂ protonation of D408 in the B state induces the functional rotation. Structural analysis along the conformational pathway reveals that vertical shear motions in specific TM helices regulate the alternate access of water in the TM domain, as well as the peristaltic motions pumping a drug in the porter domain.

From the observation of the crystal structure, we postulated that the protonation of D408 in the B state induces the conformational change toward the E state. This hypothesis was tested with the setup of two different simulation systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>): System 1 has a protonated D408 (hereafter, denoted by D408p) in protomer II, which undergoes a transition from the E to the A state. System 2 has D408p in protomer I, undergoing transitionÂ from the B to the E state. If the hypothesis is correct, then system 1 should be stable at the initial BEA state, whereas the system 2 would trigger the functional rotation. A drug (minocycline) was explicitly included in both systems. It is bound in protomer I (the B state) at first, and then transported to the exit pore during the functional rotation. No additional drugÂ for uptake was included in order to keep the drugâAcrB interaction as simple as possible. For the string method calculation, we first generated an initial pathway in a targeted MD simulation (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods), in which the structure of AcrB was guided from the BEA state to the EBA state by means of steering forces, simultaneously with the drug being directed toward the exit pore. TheÂ collective variables (Cartesian coordinates of CÎ± atoms in the porter domain and TM helices, see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) used in the string method were carefully chosen according to previous simulation studiesÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yao et al., 2010</xref>).

Thirty images were used toÂ represent the pathway.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the free energy profiles along the pathways obtained by the string method, illustratingÂ the convergence towards the minimum free energy pathway. The impact of protonation is revealed when the converged pathways of the two systems are compared (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). While system 1 has an energy minimum close to the initial BEA state (at image 5), the minimum of system 2 is shifted towards the final EAB state (at image 15), indicating that the protonation state in system 2 drives the functional rotation. The structure and protonation state of the final EAB state of system 2 is identical to that of the initial BEA state of system 1, when the molecule is rotated by 120 degrees and the bound/unbound drug is ignored. This relation suggests that the release of theÂ drug is the main factor for the increase in free energy in the late stage (images 20â30) of system 2. The molecule may need a new drug molecule to progress to the next step of rotation.

To address this question, we first investigated the impact of the protonation on the minimum free energy state (image 5) of system 1 by alchemically transforming it towards system 2, thatÂ is, byÂ protonating D408 of protomer I and deprotonating D408p of protomer II (see Materials and methods). Electrostatic potential energy maps before and after the transformation of the protonation state reveal that the TM domain of protomer I is destabilized by the protonation because of a strong positive electrostatic potential bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). This bias is caused by theÂ surrounding positively charged residuesÂ R971 and K940, whose side-chains orient towards D408p. The relaxation of the potential bias can be seen when inspecting image 15 of system 2, the minimum free energy state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The side-chain of R971 (on TM11) reorients downwards (towards the cytoplasm), as does D408p (on TM4) due to repulsion from K940 (on TM10). These motions involve the downshift of TM4 and TM11, whereas TM10 remains at the original position.

The electrostatic potential map after the protonation shows a local positive change around D924, which may stabilize the system throughÂ interactions with the oxygens of the phosphate groups of lipids, and whichÂ mayÂ help to recruit water molecules for proton uptake (see the next subsection). However, the impact of the protonation at D924 is spatially localized compared to that of D408, and the change in the electrostatic potential was not propagated to the transmembrane region. The protonation at E346 scarcely changed the electrostatic potential. Therefore, these protonation sites may not have a strong impact on the functional rotation.</p><p>By monitoring the centers-of-mass for the other TM helices along the conformational pathway, we found that downshifts occur not only in TM4 and TM11 but also in TM3, TM5 and TM6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>).Â BasedÂ onÂ their analysis of crystal structures,Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eicher et al. (2014</xref>) recognized two rigid assemblies in the TM domain, R1 (TM1 and TM3 to TM6) and R2 (TM7 and TM9 to TM12), which change their mutual arrangement during the transitions among B, E and A states. In terms of R1/R2 rigid body motions, the downshift motions of the TM helices can be interpreted as a vertical shear motion of R1 against R2. Tight packing of the helices within R1, and rather weak interactions on the interface between R1 and R2 may facilitate such a large rearrangement. TM11 in R2 is the exception, because it moves downwards together with R1. Previous structural studies mostly focused on lateral shear motions and rocking motionsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eicher et al., 2014</xref>) of R1 and R2, whereas our observations clarify that protonation mainly induces a vertical shear motion. Indeed, downshifts of the specific TM helices, including TM11, can be discerned in the crystal structures when the TM helices of different states are properly aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Vertical shear motion in TM domain regulates the alternate access of water</title><p>The next question is how D408 becomes protonated. Because proton translocation across the TM domain requires theÂ access of water molecules to supply protons, we investigated the distribution of water molecules in protomer 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5</xref> for other protomers). At image 5 of system 1 with D408, a water wire channel is clearly observed from periplasmic D924 (a possible transient proton binding site to facilitate proton uptake on TM10Â [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eicher et al., 2014</xref>]) to the space in the middle of the helices (called the conflux spaceÂ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer and Kandt, 2011</xref>]) surrounded by hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Also, a minor water pathway comes from E346 (another possible transient proton-binding site on TM2), which merges into the conflux space. At the cytoplasmic end, the side chain of R971 breaks the channel, preventing the leakage of protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eicher et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, water distribution at image 15 of system 2 with D408p is completely different due to the vertical shear motion in the TM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). There is no water channel coming from the periplasm, resultingÂ from the collapse of the conflux space by the downshifts of TM4 and TM11; distances between residue pairs L400âT933 andÂ L937âF982 decrease, preventing water molecules from entering the conflux space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). On the other hand, the side chain of R971 opens towards cytoplasmic bulk water, exposing the protonation site and providing a possible proton release pathway. Thus, R971 is an electrostatic gate for proton diffusion to the cytoplasm, analogous to the selectivity filter of aquaporins as discussed in previous studiesÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eicher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eriksson et al., 2013</xref>).

Here, residue pairs whose mutual information is larger than a threshold are plotted. In protomer I (BâE), high correlations were observed between TM4âTM6, TM8 and TM11, and PN1 and PC2 (and also weakly with PN2). As identified above, these TM helices (except for TM8) are involved in the downshift motions induced by D408p. To see how the TM helices and the porter domain are correlated, we visualized the structures along the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). In particular, the coil-to-helix transition of TM8, which leverages the rigid body motion in PN1/PC2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), is sterically hindered by the sidechain of F459 on TM5 in the B state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Downshift of TM5 causes the F459 sidechain to flip, allowing the coil-to-helix transition of TM8. Thus, the downshift of TM5 reduces the barrier for the extension of TM8, expediting the PN1/PC2 rigid body motion to open the exit gate for the drug.</p><p>Protomer I also exhibits weak linkage between PN2 and several TM helices. These weak correlations may arise from PN2âs rearrangements relative to PC1 due to the shrinkage of the distal binding pocket (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> for the binding pocket location). The downshift ofÂ the TM helices decreases contacts between the TM domain and PN2, and may accommodate the rearrangement of PN2. Previous studies indicated that a slight tilting of TM2 is coupled to PN2 motionÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eicher et al., 2014</xref>), which is also observed here as weak correlations between TM2 and PN2.</p><p>Unlike protomer I, protomer II (EâA) has only a local correlation network between TM5 and TM8 (and weakly with TM10)Â and PN1 and PC2.Â This relatively weak correlation is associated with the reverse helix-to-coil transition of TM8, whichÂ closes the drug exit gate. Also, weak correlations can be seen in TM1, TM4, and TM10, which are consistent with the scenarioÂ describedÂ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamane et al. (2013</xref>) for the EâA transition: twisting motions of TM4 and TM10 interfere with TM1, PN1, and PN2. Protomer III (AâB) has rather weak correlations between PN2 andÂ the TM helices, which may be related to the rearrangement of PN2/PC1 on distal binding pocket formation and the influence of rising TM helices onÂ contactÂ with the PN2 domain. These local and weak correlations in protomers II and III suggest that the minor coupling either occurs indirectly via interfacial interactions between protomers or is mediated by drug binding, not beingÂ harnessed by proton translocation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the light of our results andÂ thoseÂ of previous studiesÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eicher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seeger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takatsuka and Nikaido, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yao et al., 2010</xref>), we propose the cycle of the functional rotation summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Coupling of the TM and the porter domains during BâE is the energy-consuming process. Protonation of D408 in the B state drives a vertical shear motion in the TM domain, which regulates the alternate access of water (the conflux space closes, R971 opens towards the cytoplasm) as well as the motion of the porter domain. In this process, the TM8 works as a transmitter. Itâs extension induces the rigid body motion of the PN2/PC1 tandem, opening the drug exit gate and shrinking the distal binding pocket. In the EâA step, the porter domain of E relaxes towards A without systematic couplings with the TM domain, perhaps driven mainlyÂ by cooperativity (interfacial interactions) between protomers. Cross-linking experimentsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seeger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takatsuka and Nikaido, 2007</xref>) and coarse-grained model simulationsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yao et al., 2010</xref>) suggested that steric clashes occur between the E protomers, making two or more E-state protomers in the trimer energetically unfavorable, andÂ making the EâA transition occur spontaneously.

After an initial energy minimization, the system was gradually heated to 300 K for 1 ns. Then, the system was equilibrated for 8 ns under NPT ensemble (300 K and 1 atm). Throughout the minimization and equilibration, positional harmonic restraints were imposed to the nonhydrogen atoms of AcrB.

Starting from the BEA trimeric state, a targeted MD simulation of 10 ns was conducted towards the EAB state. A force constant per atom of 1.0 kcal/Ã<sup>2</sup> was used for the harmonic restraint on the root-mean-square displacement (RMSD) variable measured with the nonhydrogen atoms of AcrB. The target structure (EAB state) was created by rotating the initial structure by 120 degrees around the <italic>z</italic>-axis (perpendicular to the membrane plane). As shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schulz et al. (2010</xref>), drug efflux towards the exit pore in the targeted MD when pulling only the atoms of AcrB was not observed in 10 ns because the drug extrusion process is diffusion limited. Thus, in order to extrude minocycline toward the exit pore, minocycline was also pulled in our simulation. Starting from the bound form in the distal binding pocket, (the RMSD variable of) minocycline was pulled to 5 Ã above the exit gate (Y758) for 10 ns using the same force constant as that of AcrB. The same protocol was applied to both system 1 and 2, yielding very similar trajectories. The trajectories were post-processed for the string method calculation: snapshots were interpolated by piece-wise linear fitting in the collective variable space and 30 equidistant points (called images) were defined as the initial pathway. Image 1 corresponds to the BEA state, and image 30 represents the EAB state. Then, the all-atom coordinates (and corresponding velocities and box size) closest to each image were chosen for the initial structure of the string method.</p><p>Collective variables for the string method were carefully chosen according to previous simulation studies. We chose Cartesian coordinates of CÎ± atoms in the porter domain (PN1, PN2, PC1 and PC2) and selected TM helices (TM4, TM5, TM6, TM8, TM10 and a loop connecting TM5 and TM6) of all protomers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

According to recent studies, which investigated the impact of collective variable choice on pathway accuracy, it is important to choose such mobile domainsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsunaga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pan et al., 2014</xref>). We also chose theÂ CÎ³-atoms of D407 and D408 and theÂ CÎµ-atom of K940 as collective variables in order to monitor local side-chain motions (as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

After defining 30 images along the initial pathway from the targeted MD trajectory, atomistic structure around each atomic structure was relaxed by 35 ns equilibration imposing positional harmonic restraints on the collective variables to its image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). After the relaxation, the mean forces type string methodÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maragliano et al., 2006</xref>) was conducted by using positional harmonic restraints with a force constant of 0.1 kcal/Ã<sup>2</sup>. Mean forces were evaluated every 4 ns of simulation and images were updated according to the calculated mean force, then reparameterized to make the images equidistant from each other (also a weak smoothing operation was applied). In order to eliminate external components (translations and rotations) in the mean forces, theÂ CÎ± atoms of TM helices in snapshots were fitted to the reference structureÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Branduardi and Faraldo-GÃ³mez, 2013</xref>) before mean force estimation. The reference structure was created by averaging the crystal structures of theÂ BEA, EAB (120 degrees rotation about the <italic>z</italic>-axis from BEA) and ABE states (240 degrees rotation), thus resulting in a 3-fold symmetric structureÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu and Hummer, 2010</xref>). The least-squares fittings of structures were performed only in the <italic>xy</italic>-plane.Â z-coordinates were kept the same as in the original snapshots because the free energies of membrane proteins are symmetric only in the <italic>xy</italic>-plane. The terminal images (images 1 and 30) were kept fixed during the first 36 ns (nine cycles in the string method), and then allowed to move to relax subtle frustrations in the crystal structure that might result from detergent molecules or crystal packing. In order to avoid any drifts of the terminal images along the pathway, tangential components to the pathway were eliminated from the mean force when updating terminal imagesÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu and Hummer, 2010</xref>). Convergences of the images were monitored by RMSDs of images from those of the initial pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

Umbrella samplings, each of 30 ns length, were performed around the images of the initial pathway, then over 30 ns around the images after the 9th cycle in the string method, over 10 ns after the 14th cycle, over 15 ns after the 19th cycle, and over 100 ns after the 24th cycle (the final converged pathway). The positional harmonic restraints with a rather weak force constant of 0.01 kcal/Ã<sup>2</sup> were used to achieve sufficient phase space overlaps between adjacent systems.

Changing the cutoff radius to 1500 or 3000 Ã<sup>2</sup> did not alter the results qualitatively. Statistical uncertainties (standard errors) in the free-energy profiles were estimated from block averages. For analysis of the converged pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), only samples from those images were used in order to eliminate any biases arising from the pathways of earlier cycles.</p><p>For the simulations with NAMD under NPT ensemble (300 K and 1 atm), Langevin dynamics and Nose-Hoover Langevin pistonÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feller et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martyna et al., 1994</xref>) were used.

Because of the restraints on the collective variables, this calculation mainly evaluates the contribution of protonation to the freeÂ energy differences. Transformations were carried out in both forward and backward directions, with 36 intermediate Î»-states for each direction, resulting in a total simulation length of 58 ns.

Then, mutual information of reactive trajectories was computed for pairs of residues, one from the TM and the other from the porter domains by,<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>â«</mml:mo><mml:mo>â«</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mi>ln</mml:mi><mml:mo>â¡</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where Cartesian coordinates of the center-of-masses of sidechains were used for <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub> because they better capture correlated motions involving semi-rigid regionsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McClendon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vanwart et al., 2012</xref>) than didÂ the dihedral angles often used in this kind of analysisÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McClendon et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>p</italic>(<italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub>) and <italic>p</italic>(<italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub>) are a probability density of <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub>, and a joint probability density of <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub>, respectively.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Yibing Shan (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Aiming to elucidate the detailed structural mechanism of AcrB RND transporter, this study applied the string method for conformational free-energy calculations on a supercomputing platform to identify the minimum free energy pathway of the functional rotation of AcrB. The all-atom simulations follow the conformational change of the transporter including the travel of the drug molecule (minocycline) from the binding pocket through the gate and finally release of the drug molecule, showing that the protonation of Asp408 in a transmembrane helix of the Binding protomer drives the process. This work represents potentially important progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanism of the transport process in AcrB.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>Given the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, the manuscript should include a brief and high level description of the simulation techniques (the string method, the umbrella sampling, and the alchemic free energy calculation) in the main text in terms that a reader unfamiliar with molecular dynamics simulations can relate to. What are the basic ideas and premises behind the approach? The manuscript should explain the free energy reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, stating clearly that this is the free energy for the whole system if that's the case.</p><p>The specific procedure should also be explained in more detail as is it is difficult to follow. It would also help if the references to the string method in the last paragraph of the Introduction were made in a more structured way â with explanations, rather than the current lumping together of a large number of very diverse papers ranging from mathematical principles all the way to practical applications.</p><p>This work only attempts to distinguish two possible schemes. In realty the process of the functional rotation is probably more complicated, possibly involving protonation of not only Asp408. For instance, Asp924 is located in a quite hydrophobic local environment and its protonation is conceivable. The proton could even be passed from Asp408 to Asp924 by the single water file connecting them. Ideally some new simulations should be performed to address this. At the very least this possibility should be more carefully discussed.</p><p>The explanation for the increase in free energy after the minima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) invoking drug release without uptaking new drug molecule without offering any reasoning or evidence seems casual. The reviewers suggest that the apparent high free energy might be due to the fact that any change of protonation state is not accounted for in the simulations. The authors should consider deprotonation of Asp408, which should occur at the end of the extrusion phase according to the proposed scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The authors should also consider, as aforementioned, protonation of other residues (e.g. Asp924) following Asp408 deprotonation (a single water file seems to connect Asp408 and Asp924).</p><p>Why is the drug released from the BEA complex in System 1, if the protonation of the original E protomer stabilizes the whole complex, as shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">image 5</xref> of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>? How is the BEA configuration changed to EAB after protonation of the second protomer as suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>?</p><p>The analysis concerning the dynamics coupling of the transmembrane domains and the porter and the funnel domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is too preliminary and very unintuitive. Some abstract metric of share conformation may show that the coupling is present, which is hardly surprising, but biologically it is much more interesting to discuss/demonstrate what interactions are behind the coupling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31715.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>Given the readership of eLife, the manuscript should include a brief and high level description of the simulation techniques (the string method, the umbrella sampling, and the alchemic free energy calculation) in the main text in terms that a reader unfamiliar with molecular dynamics simulations can relate to.

We agree with the reviewers that other protonation schemes (e.g., Asp924) should be considered. Actually, proton translocation occurs from the periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> top, the side of Asp924) to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> bottom) in the secondary transporter, there is a possibility that protons are passed from Asp924 to Asp408 at the initial state (proton uptake event in the BEA complex). Therefore, we simulated a protonated Asp924 of protomer I at the initial state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) for both system 1 and system 2 in this revision, as well as another possibility of protonation at Glu346. Glu346 was chosen because the pKa calculations by Eicher et al., 2014 suggested protonation at this residue. Results were added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>. The electrostatic potential map after the protonation at Asp924 shows a local positive change around Asp924, which may stabilize the system by the interactions with the oxygens of the phosphate groups of lipids, and help to recruit water molecules for proton uptake. However, the impact of the protonation at Asp924 is spatially localized compared to that of Asp408, and the change in the electrostatic potential was not propagated to the transmembrane region. The protonation at Glu346 scarcely changed the electrostatic potential. Considering these results, we believe that the protonation of these sites do not change the story of our study on the energetics of the large-scale conformational change of the whole protein. We added the discussion in the first paragraph of the subsection âProtonation induces a vertical shear motion in the TM domainâ.</p><p>As for the increase in free energy at the end state (the EAB complex), we would like to point out that the end state of system 2 (the EAB complex with protonated Asp408 in protomer I) is identical to the initial state of system 1 (the BEA complex with protonated Asp408 in protomer II) by a 120Â° rotation, if we ignore the drug binding/unbinding. Since our free energy calculations already showed that the initial state of system 1 is stable with the bound drug (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we consider that the drug unbinding is the main cause for the unstability of the end state of system 2. We added the discussion in the second paragraph of the subsection âEnergetics of functional rotation under two different protonation statesâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why is the drug released from the BEA complex in System 1, if the protonation of the original E protomer stabilizes the whole complex, as shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">image 5</xref> of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>? How is the BEA configuration changed to EAB after protonation of the second protomer as suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>?</p></disp-quote><p>The methods were not clearly explained. Before optimizing the pathway with the string method, we generated the initial guess for the conformational transition pathway using targeted molecular dynamics from the initial structure (the BEA complex) toward the end structure (the EAB complex). During the simulation, the drug was also forced toward the exit gate. In response to the first comment, we briefly explained the procedure also in the main text, including how we created the initial pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The analysis concerning the dynamics coupling of the transmembrane domains and the porter and the funnel domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is too preliminary and very unintuitive. Some abstract metric of share conformation may show that the coupling is present, which is hardly surprising, but biologically it is much more interesting to discuss/demonstrate what interactions are behind the coupling.</p></disp-quote><p>The description on the dynamical coupling is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and 5. First, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> exhibits a coupling between the TM domain and the porter domain. Then, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, to identify the interactions behind the coupling, we presented the results of the exhaustive correlation analysis (based on mutual information) for all residue pairs of the porter and TM domains. The figure reveals that the coil-to-helix transition of TM8 (caused by the sidechain flip of Phe459) is the very interaction causing the coupling, and regulates the closing motion of the porter subdomains, PN1/PC2, which extrudes the drug. We believe that the coil-to-helix transition of TM8 transmits the events occurred in the TM domain to the porter domain, and produces the biological function, the extrusion of a drug.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that mutual information is not necessarily intuitive compared to other metrics such as linear correlation or distance. However, the protein contains different types of motions, the closing rotational motion of the porter domain and the translational downward motion of the TM helices. It was thus not possible to capture such complicated nonlinear motions with the linear metrics. Mutual information is one of the major metrics to treat nonlinear relations. More or less, other nonlinear metrics are also nonintuitive. Thus, we have tried to improve the readability of the text by changing the way of the presentation instead of changing the analysis method. Since the description of the mutual information given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is too detailed, we moved it to a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> supplement. Instead, we moved Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 to new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which compares the crystal structures of TM8 for different states as well as the sidechain positions of Phe459. Now, the readers can readily understand how the coil-to-helix transition of TM8 occurs. According to the updates of the figures, the main text was modified.</p></body></sub-article></article>
