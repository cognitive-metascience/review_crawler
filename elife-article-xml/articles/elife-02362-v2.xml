Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) antagonizes BST2 through viral protein u (Vpu), which downregulates BST2 from the cell surface. We report the crystal structure of a protein complex containing Vpu and BST2 cytoplasmic domains and the core of the clathrin adaptor protein complex 1 (AP1). This, together with our biochemical and functional validations, reveals how Vpu hijacks the AP1-dependent membrane trafficking pathways to mistraffick BST2. Vpu mimics a canonical acidic dileucine-sorting motif to bind AP1 in the cytosol, while simultaneously interacting with BST2 in the membrane. These interactions enable Vpu to build on an intrinsic interaction between BST2 and AP1, presumably causing the observed retention of BST2 in juxtanuclear endosomes and stimulating its degradation in lysosomes. The ability of Vpu to hijack AP-dependent trafficking pathways suggests a potential common theme for Vpu-mediated downregulation of host proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02362.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02362.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02362.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>HIV is a retrovirus that attacks the immune system, making the body increasingly susceptible to opportunistic infections and disease and eventually leading to AIDS. While antiretroviral drugs have allowed people with AIDS to live longer, there is no cure or vaccine for HIV.</p><p>Two types of HIV exist, with HIV-1 being much more common and pathogenic than HIV-2. Like other ‘complex’ retroviruses, the HIV-1 genome contains genes that encode various proteins that allow the virus to disrupt the immune response of the host it is attacking. Viral protein u is a protein encoded by HIV-1 (but not HIV-2) that counteracts an antiviral protein called BST2 in the host. BST2, which is part of the host's innate immune response, prevents newly formed viruses from leaving the surface of infected cells. By counteracting BST2, viral protein u allows the virus to spread in the host more efficiently.</p><p>Like many proteins, newly produced BST2 is packaged inside structures called vesicles in a part of the cell called the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network, and then sent to its destination. Complexes formed by various proteins make sure that the vesicles take their cargo to their correct destinations within the cell. Two adaptor protein complexes—known as AP1 and AP2—are thought to be involved the transport of BST2. However, it is not known how viral protein u stops BST2 from reaching the cell surface, or how it decreases the amount of BST2 in the cell as a whole. Jia et al. show how viral protein u and BST2 jointly interact with AP1. This interaction leads to the mistrafficking and degradation of BST2 and the counteraction of its antiviral activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02362.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02362.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>BST2</kwd><kwd>vpu</kwd><kwd>tetherin</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>membrane trafficking</kwd><kwd>AP1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI102778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guatelli</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The James B.

BST2 has a short cytoplasmic tail at the N-terminus followed by a single transmembrane (TM) helix, a long coiled-coil extracellular domain, and a C-terminal glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kupzig et al., 2003</xref>). The availability of two membrane anchors connected by a long coiled-coil allows BST2 to efficiently inhibit viral transmission by tethering newly formed virions at the infected cell surface and preventing their release to the surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hinz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schubert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). The short intracellular, N-terminal tail of BST2 has been implicated in the natural trafficking of this antiviral protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rollason et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Masuyama et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>HIV-1 overcomes restriction by BST2 using the viral protein Vpu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Neil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Van Damme et al., 2008</xref>). The mechanism by which Vpu antagonizes BST2 appears to be multifaceted, involving both degradation and mistrafficking within the endosomal system. Vpu (about 81 amino acids in most viral isolates) is a transmembrane protein consisting of an N-terminal transmembrane α-helix, followed by a cytoplasmic domain that is likely to be flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Strebel et al., 1988</xref>). Vpu associates with BST2 through an anti-parallel interaction between the transmembrane domains of each protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mangeat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Skasko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McNatt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vigan and Neil, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kobayashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vigan and Neil, 2010</xref>). This interaction is species-specific and essential for the antagonism of BST2 by Vpu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McNatt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Skasko et al., 2012</xref>). Part of Vpu's activity against BST2 can be explained by the viral hijacking of the β-TrCP-associated ubiquitin–proteasome degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Van Damme et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goffinet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iwabu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mangeat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref>). A component of the ESCRT-0 machinery, HRS, has also been suggested to recognize ubiquitinated BST2 and target it for lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janvier et al., 2011</xref>). However, these degradation pathways are only partially responsible for the antagonism of BST2 by Vpu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Van Damme et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iwabu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mangeat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref>). Efficient BST2 downregulation from the cell surface can occur in the absence of BST2 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dube et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goffinet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tervo et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, Vpu induces the mistrafficking of BST2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dube et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hauser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>), causing the accumulation of BST2 at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN). Both recycled and newly synthesized BST2 are retained at the TGN, blocking the resupply of BST2 to the plasma membrane and eventually leading to its depletion at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dube et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, mutations in the juxta-membrane hinge region of Vpu that interfere with the localization of Vpu to the TGN impair the antagonism of BST2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dube et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vigan and Neil, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Clathrin-dependent trafficking pathways have been suggested to be involved in the Vpu-mediated mistrafficking of BST2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kueck and Neil, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ruiz et al., 2008</xref>). Such pathways regulate the trafficking of cellular membrane proteins by selectively packaging these membrane cargos into clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canagarajah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Traub, 2009</xref>). The clathrin adaptor protein (AP) complexes mediate this cargo selection. Two canonical sorting motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of the membrane cargo proteins are recognized by the AP complexes: a tyrosine-based Yxxϕ motif (ϕ represents a large hydrophobic residue; x for any amino acid) and an acidic dileucine motif, [E/D]xxxL[L/I]. Five AP complexes exist in the cell and each is responsible for trafficking by distinct routes. For example, AP1 traffics cargo between the TGN and sorting endosomes, while AP2 selects cargo for transport between the plasma membrane and early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canagarajah et al., 2013</xref>). In the absence of Vpu, the natural trafficking of endogenous BST2 depends on the clathrin-associated pathways, and the involvement of both AP1 and AP2 has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rollason et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Masuyama et al., 2009</xref>). An unusual double-tyrosine motif, YxY, in the BST2 cytoplasmic domain (BST2<sub>CD</sub>) is critical for this natural trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rollason et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Masuyama et al., 2009</xref>). In Vpu, a putative clathrin-sorting motif, ExxxLV (ELV), located in the membrane-distal half of the protein's cytoplasmic domain (Vpu<sub>CD</sub>) was shown to be important for BST2 antagonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kueck and Neil, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McNatt et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, Vpu-induced virion release and removal of BST2 from the cell surface are inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of AP180, a protein required for the assembly of the CCV at the lipid membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kueck and Neil, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lau et al., 2011</xref>). However, the critical question remains as to whether any AP complexes, and if so which, are hijacked by Vpu for the downregulation of BST2.</p><p>To understand the mechanisms of Vpu-mediated mistrafficking of BST2, we examined the interaction of the cytoplasmic domains of these proteins with recombinant AP complexes and their subunits. Moreover, we determined the crystal structure of a three-component complex containing AP1, the cytoplasmic domain of BST2 (BST2<sub>CD</sub>) and the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu (Vpu<sub>CD</sub>). The structure shows that Vpu mimics a membrane cargo by occupying the acidic dileucine-binding site of AP1, while BST2 is bound at the tyrosine-binding site of AP1. This, together with biochemical and functional evidence, suggests that HIV-1 Vpu is a virally encoded modulator of clathrin-dependent trafficking pathways and supports the involvement of AP1 in the Vpu-mediated mistrafficking of BST2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BST2 specifically binds μ1 of AP1, but not μ2 of AP2 or μ3 of AP3</title><p>To identify the AP complexes involved in the trafficking of BST2, we investigated their ability to bind BST2. BST2<sub>CD</sub> contains a putative tyrosine motif that is believed to bind to the μ subunits of AP complexes, and intracellular interactions between BST2 and the μ subunits of either AP1 or AP2 have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rollason et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Masuyama et al., 2009</xref>). We tested interactions between BST2<sub>CD</sub> and the C-terminal domains (CTD) of the μ subunits of three AP complexes (AP1, AP2, and AP3). The purified μ1-CTD of AP1 bound BST2<sub>CD</sub> as the two co-migrated as a higher molecular weight complex on a size exclusion column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, no such binding was observed for either the μ2-CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or μ3-CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These observations were further confirmed by a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Consistent with the in vitro binding assay, BST2<sub>CD</sub> exhibited binding to μ1, but not μ2 or μ3, in the Y2H assay. As controls, the TGN38 peptide containing a canonical YxxΦ motif displayed binding to all three μ subunits, and a mutant μ1 subunit (μ1 D174A) with a disrupted binding pocket for tyrosine-based motifs bound neither TGN38 nor the BST2<sub>CD</sub>. Furthermore, this binding was abolished by the double alanine mutation of the YxY motif (Y6/8A) in BST2<sub>CD</sub>. These results indicate that BST2<sub>CD</sub> not only contains a tyrosine-based motif to allow for AP binding, but also a specificity determinant to select specifically for μ1.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02362.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BST2 interacts with µ1 but not µ2 or µ3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Size exclusion chromatograms and SDS PAGE analysis of purified MBP-BST2<sub>CD</sub> (purple curve), MBP-µ CTD (green curve), and their mixture (red curve).

As the functionally active ELV motif in Vpu<sub>CD</sub> is a putative acidic dileucine sorting signal, we hypothesized that Vpu binds AP1 at the acidic dileucine-binding site located at the γ and σ1 subunits. To test this, we created a truncated AP1 core with the μ1-CTD removed. Such a truncation construct (AP1t) mimics the open conformation of AP1, exposing the dileucine binding site on AP1 for interaction with cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>).

BST2 and Vpu each have a transmembrane (TM) helix through which the two proteins associate.

However, the observed interface differs from the canonical tyrosine peptide (YxxΦ) binding in that the interaction is achieved with an unusual double-tyrosine motif (YxYxxΦ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>). Y8 of BST2<sub>CD</sub> forms the canonical interactions with μ1 residues and inserts into the conserved tyrosine-binding pocket on μ1. Unlike the canonical cases in which a leucine or isoleucine residue is found at the Y+3 position, V11 in BST2 only partly fills the corresponding hydrophobic pocket on μ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This pocket would be better satisfied by a larger hydrophobic residue. This observation is consistent with results from a previous combinatorial screen of tyrosine-based µ-binding sequences: for µ1, valine was disfavored at the Y+3 position, whereas leucine was favored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ohno et al., 1998</xref>). The relatively modest interaction mediated by V11 is presumably compensated by Y6, which stabilizes the binding through hydrogen-bonding interactions with N308 and E381 of μ1 and through stacking interactions with μ1 P383 and Y384. Consistent with the notion that Y6, Y8, and V11 each contribute to the overall binding, substitution of any of these single residues with alanine was sufficient to disrupt the interaction between BST2<sub>CD</sub> and µ1 as detected using the Y2H assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>The structure also explains why BST2, specifically the YxYxxV sequence, has a preference for μ1, but not μ2 or μ3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). An overlay of the BST2<sub>CD</sub>-bound μ1 structure to the μ2 structure shows that μ2 lacks a tyrosine residue, corresponding to μ1 Y384, which provides a stabilizing stacking interaction with BST2 Y6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, the presence of μ2 Q318, in place of the smaller N308 of μ1, disrupts a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the side chain of BST2 Y6 and potentially causes steric hindrance. In the case of μ3, the structural difference is much more pronounced: severe steric clashes appear to prevent the binding of BST2 Y6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Overall, these results not only explain a critical feature of Vpu-mediated hijacking of the AP1-dependent CCV pathway for BST2 antagonism, but also serve as the first structural example of a cellular YxY-based sorting signal bound to the μ1 subunit of AP1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Vpu binds to AP1 by mimicking a canonical acidic dileucine motif</title><p>Opposite to the BST2-binding site on the activated AP1 core, Vpu<sub>CD</sub> associates with the γ and σ1 subunits of AP1 by mimicking the canonical acidic dileucine-sorting motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

When the BST2/Vpu-activated AP1 structure was overlaid with the Arf1-activated AP1 structure using the β1 subunits, a twisting of the γ and σ1 subunits was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), which further exposes the dileucine-binding pocket at the γ/σ1 interface in AP1. The conformational change involves a ∼20° rotation of γ/σ1 around an axis at the base of γ where it contacts β1, with the largest Cα movement of ∼35 Å at the tip of γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Of note, however, the relative positions either between β1 and μ1 or between γ and σ1 are well maintained. As a result of the γ/σ1 movement, new interactions occur between the μ1-CTD and the N-terminal portion of γ.

The R44A:L45A mutation significantly impaired the ability of Vpu to reduce the amount of BST2 at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). It also greatly impaired the ability of Vpu to enhance virion release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Interestingly, the effect of the R44A:L45A mutation on virion release was additive with the S52/56N mutation, which ablates the binding of Vpu to β-TrCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,G</xref>), despite that both mutations impair the apparent degradation of BST2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). These data are consistent with the proposed role of R44 and I45 in the binding of Vpu to AP1 rather than to β-TrCP. Indeed, the R44A:L45A mutation did not affect the interaction with β-TrCP as measured by immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Together, the impaired abilities of Vpu R44A:L45A to bind AP1 and to decrease the steady-state expression of BST2 suggest that AP1 is important for the Vpu-mediated endo-lysosomal degradation of BST2.</p><p>We note that to achieve the interaction of R44, L/I45 with µ1 and the interaction of the ELV sequence with γ-σ1, Vpu<sub>CD</sub> must adopt an extended conformation.

Furthermore, these secondary structures were observed under conditions that induce helix formation. Specifically, the helical feature of the first half of Vpu<sub>CD</sub> was shown to be relatively more pronounced, whereas the latter helix, harboring the ELV sequence, exhibited low helical content and was more likely to be unstructured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wittlich et al., 2009</xref>).

The mutation Y6/8A in BST2<sub>CD</sub> markedly impaired the ability of Vpu to promote virion release, supporting a critical role for this trafficking motif in antagonism of BST2 by Vpu. Since the BST2 YxY motif is not likely required for the β-TrCP-dependent degradation pathway, which functions via ubiquitination, its importance likely comes from its affinity to AP1 and clathrin-dependent pathways. Of note, the Y6/8A mutant was better expressed than wild-type BST2 and restricted virion release more effectively both in the presence and absence of Vpu. Alanine mutation of Vpu ELV also impaired virion release, to a degree similar to that of the S52/56N mutation of the β-TrCP binding site. Notably, mutation of the ELV sequence in Vpu and the YxY sequence in BST2 increased the steady-state expression of BST2, presumably by inhibiting endo-lysosomal degradation either as it occurs natively or as stimulated by Vpu. This scenario is consistent with our structural and biochemical observations that both BST2 YxY and Vpu ELV motifs interact with AP1, and it further supports the hypothesis that this interaction is part of the endo-lysosomal degradation mechanism that supports Vpu-activity.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02362.014</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The BST2 YxY as well as the Vpu ELV and di-serine motifs are each important for Vpu-mediated reduction in BST2-expression and for optimal virion release.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HEK293T cells were co-transfected to express the indicated BST2 variants, provirus lacking <italic>vpu</italic>, and the indicated codon-optimized Vpu proteins.

Nef also engages AP2 to remove the primary viral receptor, CD4, from cellular membranes to avoid super-infection, interference with virion release and infectivity, and the exposure on the cell surface of CD4-induced epitopes within the viral Env glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia and Miller, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foti et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Craig et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaudhuri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Veillette et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pham et al., 2014</xref>). In SIV, Nef uses AP2 to remove BST2 from the cell surface to allow for the efficient release of progeny virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Serra-Moreno et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the HIV-2 Env protein antagonizes BST2 through an AP2-dependent mistrafficking mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hauser et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The work presented herein reveals that HIV-1 Vpu is another viral modulator of host membrane trafficking pathways, specifically, for the AP1-mediated mistrafficking of BST2. This is conceptually similar to the HIV-1 Nef-mediated MHC-I downregulation but occurs through different interaction mechanisms with AP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In each case, the HIV-1 protein, Nef or Vpu, causes the retention of its cellular target, MHC-I or BST2, at the TGN and eventually leads to lysosomal degradation through late endosomal pathways. Nef builds upon an incomplete tyrosine-based sorting motif in the MHC-I cytoplasmic domain (CD) and promotes a cooperative three-protein interaction involving MHC-I CD, Nef and μ1 of AP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Noviello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wonderlich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Singh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jia et al., 2012</xref>). The binding mode for the three-component complex involving BST2, Vpu and AP1, is different, with no three-protein interface. The complex is instead stabilized by pair-wise binary interactions: BST2 and Vpu bind through the transmembrane regions, BST2<sub>CD</sub> binds the AP1 μ1 subunit, and Vpu<sub>CD</sub> binds the AP1 σ1/γ/μ1 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). This model is consistent with the previous findings that the transmembrane interaction between BST2 and Vpu is of pivotal importance in determining the activity of Vpu against BST2. The BST2/Vpu/AP1 interaction also causes an open conformation of AP1 that has not been observed before. This new AP1 conformation might only be induced by Vpu or alternatively it might exist as a physiologically functional state that Vpu selectively uses to its advantage.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02362.017</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Schematics of hijacking of AP1 by HIV-1 Vpu to target BST2 (left) and by HIV-1 Nef to target MHC-I (right) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jia et al., 2012</xref>).</title><p>Transmembrane helices are represented by cylinders and the Nef myristoyl anchor is represented by a cyan sphere.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02362.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02362.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02362-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>The Vpu-mediated antagonism of BST2 appears to be a multifaceted process. Besides AP1-mediated mistrafficking and degradation, Vpu can also induce the degradation of BST2 through β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination and the ESCRT machinery. Abolishing either the ubiquitination pathway by the S52/56N mutation in Vpu or the mistrafficking pathway by the ELV/AAA mutation each led to defects in the enhancement of virion release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kueck and Neil, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McNatt et al., 2013</xref>). Combining the two sets of mutations, however, appeared to cause the most substantial loss of Vpu function, suggesting a potentially parallel nature for these pathways. How these pathways, ubiquitination and AP1-mediated mistrafficking, might work together to enable the antagonism of BST2 by Vpu remains to be further elucidated in finer temporal and spatial details.</p><p>The complexity of these trafficking and degradation mechanisms may have prevented a clear identification of the AP complex(es) responsible for the Vpu-activity in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kueck and Neil, 2012</xref>). Despite the evidence supporting the involvement of clathrin-associated pathways, neither AP1, 2 or 3 knockdown in 293T cells and HeLa cells nor AP1 γ knockout in mouse fibroblasts had any apparent effects on the ability of Vpu to antagonize restriction by BST2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kueck and Neil, 2012</xref>), although we previously reported a role for AP2 in the Vpu-mediated surface-downregulation of BST2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref>). Conceivably, the individual roles of a given pathway are obscured by compensation from overlapping parallel pathways, such as the involvement of multiple AP complexes or the monomeric clathrin adaptor HRS. Another possibility is redundancy in the composition of an individual AP complex. A specific subunit of AP could be knocked down or out only to be replaced by a different isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boehm and Bonifacino, 2001</xref>). Substitution might also happen between two related subunits from different AP complexes as they have highly conserved structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keyel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Another level of complexity might come from the potential for the mechanism of Vpu activity to be at least partly cell-type dependent. For example, BST2 in some cell types appears to be equally vulnerable to β-TrCP-dependent degradation and to mistrafficking, whereas in others the role of β-TrCP-dependent degradation is less important, possibly due to lower levels of BST2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schindler et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The intrinsic, structural flexibility of Vpu may enable its functional versatility and underlie the complexity of BST2-antagonism. A shared feature of retroviral accessory proteins including Vpu, Nef, Vif, Vpr and Vpx is the presence of long and flexible loops that provide the structural basis for their multifunctional nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xue et al., 2012</xref>). These unstructured regions can adopt different conformations to facilitate binding to different host target proteins. These regions often harbor motifs mimicking functional host sequences, enabling the virus to hijack the desired host machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kadaveru et al., 2008</xref>). The binding of the Vpu ELV motif to AP1 revealed in our structure, as well as that of the di-phosphoserine motif of Vpu to β-TrCP shown before, serve as two excellent examples of this viral strategy.</p><p>The ExxxLV motif is conserved in the Vpu of subtype B of group M HIV-1, to which both NL4-3 and HV1S1 strains of HIV-1 used in this study belong. However, in the Vpu sequence from the subtype C of the group M HIV-1, the motif is replaced by the consensus sequence ExxxMV, which might or might not be functionally equivalent to the ExxxLV sequence. Interestingly, while subtype B Vpu localizes predominantly within internal membrane compartments, subtype C Vpu is substantially expressed at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pacyniak et al., 2005</xref>). In addition to the sequence variation in the ELV region, subtype C Vpu contains another putative acidic dileucine motif in the membrane-proximal region of its CD, mutation of which affected the trafficking of Vpu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ruiz et al., 2008</xref>). Conceivably, subtype C Vpu hijacks AP complexes using residues distinct or partly overlapping with those used by subtype B Vpu.</p><p>The intrinsic affinity of Vpu to AP1 and AP2 suggests that Vpu has the ability to hijack clathrin-dependent trafficking pathways to target other cellular proteins with which it interacts simultaneously. Besides BST2 and CD4, HIV-1 Vpu also modulates the surface expression of two other important immune factors, NTB-A and CD1d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sandberg et al., 2012</xref>). NTB-A is a co-activator for natural killer (NK) cells, and the Vpu induced downregulation of NTB-A enables infected cells to evade lysis by NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shah et al., 2010</xref>). This involves the mistrafficking of NTB-A, which phenotypically resembles Vpu-mediated BST2 mistrafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolduan et al., 2013</xref>). Although degradation is not induced, Vpu causes retention of NTB-A in a perinuclear compartment. Like BST2, the downregulation depends on an interaction between the transmembrane domains of Vpu and NTB-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shah et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, residues other than the conserved phosphorylated serines in Vpu<sub>CD</sub> are critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolduan et al., 2013</xref>). In the case of CD1d, an antigen-presenting molecule in dendritic cells, downregulation by Vpu occurs through interference with the recycling of CD1d in the endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moll et al., 2010</xref>). A critical residue of CD1d, Tyr331 in a canonical sorting motif, is key for both the natural trafficking and the Vpu-mediated CD1d downregulation. Whether CD1d also interacts with Vpu in the transmembrane or other regions remains to be determined. Given the similarities between these systems, we speculate that the modulation of NTB-A and/or CD1d by Vpu may also involve clathrin-dependent trafficking pathways.</p><p>Finally, we consider the question of why BST2 interacts on its own with AP1, since this must relate in some way to the protein's natural function. One possibility is that the interaction with AP1 allows BST2 that is internalized from the cell surface to recycle to the plasma membrane, where it acts to trap nascent virions. Another possibility derives from the ability of BST2 to induce the activity of the NF-κB family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cocka and Bates, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tokarev et al., 2013</xref>); this signaling function could occur from an endosomal compartment that BST2 reaches via AP1-dependent trafficking. Yet another possibility is that BST2 uses AP1 to divert tethered virions to late endosomal compartments in antigen presenting cells, thus facilitating the presentation of viral antigens in the context of class II or class I MHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neil et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miyakawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moffat et al., 2013</xref>). Whether these or other processes underlie the physiologically relevant function of the interaction between BST2 and AP1 remains to be determined.</p><p>In conclusion, our biochemical and biological data support, and our crystal structure elucidates in atomic detail, how HIV-1 Vpu hijacks the AP1-dependent membrane trafficking pathway to antagonize the host restriction factor BST2. These results not only help unravel the perplexing mechanism of Vpu-mediated antagonism of BST2 but also suggest a potentially evolutionarily conserved function of Vpu in antagonizing other host immune targets. This function might be critical in understanding the full capacity of Vpu in promoting the infectivity and pathogenesis of the primate lentiviruses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, expression and purification of proteins used for in vitro studies</title><p>The BST2<sub>CD-</sub>Vpu<sub>CD</sub> fusion consisted of BST2 (1-21) and Vpu (HV1S1, 28-80), connected by a linker peptide of 10 amino acids: GSDEASEGSG. The encoding gene was cloned into the pMAT9s expression vector containing a N-terminal 6xHis tag followed by the maltose binding protein (MBP) and a SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xue et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">2008</xref>). To introduce phosphorylation on Vpu S52 and S56, this plasmid and a pCDFDuet vector encoding both the α and β subunits of the casein kinase II (CK2) were co-transformed into the <italic>E. coli</italic> NiCo21(DE3) competent cells (New England Biolabs) for expression in the Terrific broth. Cells were induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.8 and grown at 16°C overnight. The protein was first purified with the Ni-NTA affinity column. For crystallization, the 6xHis-MBP tag was cleaved off by the SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> protease. Protein was subsequently purified on a HiTrap Q anion exchange column and a Superdex 75 size exclusion column, which yielded homogenous monomeric protein. Double phosphorylation of the protein was confirmed by using MALDI mass spectrometry. For GST pull-down experiments, the 6xHis-MBP-tagged proteins, either wild-type or mutants, were purified through Ni-NTA, HiTrap Q and Superdex 200 size exclusion columns. The unphosphorylated form or the S52/56N (Vpu) mutant of the fusion was produced similarly except that the pCDFDuet-CK2 plasmid was not included during expression. 6xHis-MBP-Vpu<sub>CD</sub> (phosphorylated) and 6xHis-MBP-BST2<sub>CD</sub> were expressed and purified similarly.</p><p>For the AP1 core used in the crystallization, the genes encoding residues 1-613 of mouse γ and 1-158 of human σ1 were subcloned into the pCDFDuet vector, while genes encoding residues 1-584 of human β1 and 1-423 of mouse μ1 were subcloned into the pETDuet vector. Non-cleavable 6xHis tags were included at the N-termini of both the γ and β1 subunits. The heterotetrameric AP1 core was expressed overnight at 22°C in the NiCo21(DE3) cells in Terrific broth after induction by 0.1 mM IPTG. The complex was purified sequentially through Ni gravity, HiTrap Q, and Superdex 200 size exclusion columns. The μ1-CTD-truncated AP1 core was created by introducing a stop codon after residue 145 of the μ1 subunit in the pCDFDuet vector carrying both the γ and μ1 subunits. The truncated AP1 core was expressed and purified similarly. The AP1 core used in the GST pull-down experiments further included a GST tag at the C-terminus of the γ subunit. The AP1-GST complex was expressed similarly as above. The complex was purified by Ni gravity and GST columns, followed by buffer-exchange to remove the glutathione for its subsequent use in the GST pull-down assays.</p><p>MBP-μ1-CTD and MBP-μ2-CTD were created previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jia et al., 2012</xref>). MBP-μ3-CTD was created by subcloning the gene encoding residues 166-418 of rat μ3 into the pMAT9s expression vector. These proteins were overexpressed and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jia et al., 2012</xref>). The hemicomplex of AP2, α398-σ, was created by subcloning the rat α (1-398, with three surface mutations I370A:I374S:L393A) and human σ into the pCDFDuet vector. The heterodimer was expressed similarly as the BST2<sub>CD-</sub>Vpu<sub>CD</sub> fusion above and was purified sequentially on a Ni-NTA affinity column, a HiTrap S cation exchange column, and a Superdex 200 size exclusion column.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Crystallization and data collection</title><p>Crystallization was carried out using the microbatch under-oil method.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor (John Kuriyan), a Reviewing editor (Wes Sundquist), and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors report the crystal structure of the core of the AP1 clathrin adaptor complex (AP1) in complex with a designed fusion construct that comprises the HIV-1 Vpu and BST2 cytoplasmic domains. The structure reveals that both Vpu and BST2 bind AP1. BST1 binds the tyrosine binding site on the μ1 site of AP1 via an unusual YxYxxV interaction that seems to explain the observed preference for μ1 (vs. μ2 or μ3). Vpu uses an “ELV” motif to bind the γ and σ1 subunits of AP1 through a canonical acidic dileucine-type interaction. The R44 and L/I45 residues of Vpu also appear to make an additional contact adjacent to a novel AP1 interface formed between the μ1 and γ subunits, although this interaction is not well defined by the electron density. The new μ1-γ interface can form because the AP1 core adopts a more open conformation that has been seen in previous structures. Thus, Vpu provides additional interactions that enable the viral protein to augment an intrinsic interaction between BST2 and AP1, and the interactions apparently function together to help retain BST2 in juxtanuclear endosomes and to stimulate lysosomal degradation. Qualitative in vitro binding and mutational analyses support the importance of the observed interactions for Vpu-BST2-AP1 complex formation in vitro. Presented experiments also support the relevance of these interactions for formation of functional BST2-Vpu-AP1 complexes in cells, although the effects are not dramatic in all cases (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A-C</xref>), and the analyses are complicated by the fact that Vpu appears to downregulate BST2 through multiple different mechanisms.</p><p>Overall, the structural studies are technically strong and represent an elegant use of crystallography to establish an unexpected mechanism whereby HIV Vpu induces BST2 mistrafficking by hijacking the cellular AP1 complex. Thus, the work reveals one molecular mechanism of HIV-1 Vpu-induced downregulation of BST2 and is an important advance in our understanding of a key component in the battle between HIV and the innate immune system.</p><p>The most important outstanding issue is the relative importance of AP1 in Vpu function. The studies presented here support and extend previous observations that: 1) the acidic-dileucine motif in Vpu is essential for trafficking of BST2 for endosomal degradation, 2) this signal works additively with an endocytic recycling motif in BST2 itself, and 3) a role for AP1 is likely, but is difficult to prove definitively owing to potential redundancy/compensation in clathrin transport pathways and to other mechanisms of Vpu action. The studies presented here (and previously), however, fall short of unequivocally demonstrating the role of AP1 in Vpu function. Quantitative analyses of the different Vpu-BST2-AP1 interactions are also lacking, as are experiments that establish a definitive role for the novel interaction between the Vpu(R44/I45) motif and AP1. The current studies are already very strong and informative and the missing experiments may be technically challenging so we have divided them into issues that must be addressed prior to publication vs. issues that would significantly enhance the impact of the paper if they can be addressed.</p><p><italic>Issue that must be addressed prior to publication</italic>:</p><p>The virological and cellular phenotypes of the R44/I45 mutation should be tested in light of the newly observed μ1 interaction. The referenced paper that is currently used to justify the phenotypic importance of these residues is fairly rudimentary and this is unsatisfactory given that the Vpu-μ1 interaction interaction is one of the important new findings in the current study. The authors may also want to note that a very recent publication by Pickering et al identified naturally occurring mutants in these residues has having impaired function.</p><p><italic>Issues that the authors should seriously consider addressing prior to publication</italic>:</p><p>1) Efficient AP1 knockdown is challenging, but the molecular interactions between Vpu, BST2 and AP1 are have now been identified. Single point mutations in these interactions – V64 in Vpu for example, or the R44, I45 mutations – might be expected to weaken (but not abolish) the AP1 interaction. It may therefore be possible to reveal a “synthetic lethal” AP1 knockdown phenotype for BST2 counteraction under these conditions. This would add considerably to the manuscript.</p><p>2) Along a similar line, BST2 degradation is easily measured in infected cells, but this has not yet been tested under AP1 knockdown conditions. This phenotype may be more amenable to study than antagonism (because partial knockdowns may have a magnified effect on final BST2 degradation, rather than on antagonism, where ultimate traffic to late endosomes is probably not required).</p><p>3) Studies of the type being presented usually report ITC, SPR, or other quantitative binding data. Given the well-behaved reagents in hand and the skills of the authors, they should consider quantitating the affinities of the following interactions: Vpu tail with AP1 (Δ-μ1 CTD) and full AP1 core; BST2 tail with μ1 CTD and full AP1 core; and Vpu-BST fusion with the full AP1 core.</p><p><italic>Other points</italic>:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>. The different panels showing raw flow cytometry data are not visually informative. Consider showing just the quantified data (i.e., the far right panels).</p><p>2) The authors should discuss possible functions of the AP1-BST2 interaction in uninfected cells (i.e., in the absence of Vpu).</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and text: It is difficult to discern differences between the overall domain orientations and those seen in the Jackson and Ren structures, except for the new μ1-γ interface. It would be helpful to have a more quantitative comparison of the subunit orientations, say in terms of Euler angles relating the domain positions to one another.</p><p>4) Given that the ELV motif of Vpu binds canonically to the sigma pocket, can the authors definitively rule out possible interactions between the BST2(CD)-Vpu(CD) fusion construct and AP2? Any evidence that Vpu ELV can occupy the sigma site in AP2 could imply a level of redundancy that would explain the difficulty in ascribing a phenotype to the AP1 knockdown alone, and would provide a plausible explanation for the observation that exclusion of budding virions at the plasma membrane is dependent on helix 2 (of particular relevance because some of the co-authors have previously described a partial phenotype for an AP2 knockdown).</p><p>5) In HIV-1 clades C and F, the acidic dileucine in Vpu is positioned close to the membrane in helix 1.

We have now included such data in the results section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D-G</xref>). We indeed observed that the RL/AA mutation impaired the abilities of Vpu to downregulate the surface level of BST2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) and to promote virion release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The RL/AA mutation has an additive effect on top of the S52/56N mutation on virion release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that the motifs affect separate pathways for antagonizing BST2. We also thank the reviewers for directing us to the work by Pickering et al, where the phenotypes from naturally occurring mutations on L/I45 support our findings. We have now included this reference in the manuscript.</p><p>Issues that the authors should seriously consider addressing prior to publication:</p><p><italic>1) Efficient AP1 knockdown is challenging, but the molecular interactions between Vpu, BST2 and AP1 are have now been identified.

This would add considerably to the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We agree that it could be a good idea to combine mutations in Vpu that collectively and specifically abolish its binding with AP1 and look at the phenotypes for the “synthetic” AP1 knockdown. However, as Vpu interacts with both AP1 and AP2, it is possible that such Vpu mutations may also interfere with the binding between Vpu and AP2 and associated trafficking pathways. We would very much like to test these ideas. However, due to the complex nature of the experiments and the time constraints for resubmission, we are not able to address these questions in the detail that they deserve for this manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Along a similar line, BST2 degradation is easily measured in infected cells, but this has not yet been tested under AP1 knockdown conditions.

We devoted substantial effort to the quantification of binding affinities of the interactions using ITC. However, due to the relative low interaction affinity, multiple steps involved in the binding process (conformational changes in AP1 and subsequent binding), and the poor solution behavior of the interactions components (such as μ1 CTD), our repeated attempts have not yielded reliable data.</p><p>Other points:</p><p><italic>1)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9D</italic></xref><italic>.

In addition, we have changed the representation in the figure overlaying the structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) so that the structure by Ren et al. (surface representation) can be clearly distinguished from the current structure (ribbon representation). We believe the figure is substantially improved to show the differences in domain orientations.</p><p><italic>4) Given that the ELV motif of Vpu binds canonically to the sigma pocket, can the authors definitively rule out possible interactions between the BST2(CD)-Vpu(CD) fusion construct and AP2?

We have now added new data showing that Vpu also interacts with AP2 subunits (α398-σ and μ2-CTD), but not with μ3-CTD of AP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-F</xref>). This points to the ability of Vpu to hijack multiple AP complexes, adding to the argument that redundant usage of AP complexes might contribute to the complexity of the BST2 antagonism by Vpu.</p><p><italic>5) In HIV-1 clades C and F, the acidic dileucine in Vpu is positioned close to the membrane in helix 1. Can the authors speculate on possible mechanistic differences given that clade C Vpu's have been reported to localize differently</italic>?</p><p>Indeed the ELV motif is not well conserved in HIV-1 clade/subtype C, and another putative acidic dileucine motif is found in the juxtamembrane region of the cytoplasmic domain of the clade C Vpu. It has been reported that mutation of this motif affected the cellular localization of Vpu. As suggested, we have now discussed that subtype C Vpu may hijack AP complexes using residues distinct or partly overlapping with those used by subtype B Vpu.</p><p><italic>6) Both Dube et al and Vigan and Neil should also be referenced for the determinants of BST2/Vpu interactions (in addition to the references that are cited)</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for directing us to the two references.
