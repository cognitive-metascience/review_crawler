However, mechanisms of gradient formation remain controversial. Here we characterized the distribution of fluorescently-tagged signaling proteins, FGF and FGFR, expressed at physiological levels from the genomic knock-in alleles in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. FGF produced in the larval wing imaginal-disc moves to the air-sac-primordium (ASP) through FGFR-containing cytonemes that extend from the ASP to contact the wing-disc source. The number of FGF-receiving cytonemes extended by ASP cells decreases gradually with increasing distance from the source, generating a recipient-specific FGF gradient. Acting as a morphogen in the ASP, FGF activates concentration-dependent gene expression, inducing <italic>pointed-P1</italic> at higher and <italic>cut</italic> at lower levels. The transcription-factors Pointed-P1 and Cut antagonize each other and differentially regulate formation of FGFR-containing cytonemes, creating regions with higher-to-lower numbers of FGF-receiving cytonemes. These results reveal a robust mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific gradient contours through feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated dispersion.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38137.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When an embryo develops, its cells must work together and ‘talk’ with each other so they can build the tissues and organs of the body. A cell can communicate with its neighbors by producing a signal, also known as a morphogen, which will tell the receiving cells what to do. Once outside the cell, a morphogen spreads through the surrounding tissue and forms a gradient: there is more of the molecule closer to the signaling cells and less further away. The cells that receive the message respond differently depending on how much morphogen they get, and therefore on where they are placed in the embryo.</p><p>How morphogens move in tissues to create gradients is still poorly understood. One hypothesis is that, once released, they spread passively through the space between cells. Instead, recent research has shown that some morphogens travel through long, thin cellular extensions known as cytonemes. These structures directly connect the cells that produce a morphogen with the ones that receive the molecule. Yet, it is still unclear how cytonemes can help to form gradients.</p><p>Du et al. aimed to resolve this question by following a morphogen called Branchless as it traveled through fruit fly embryos. Branchless is important for sculpting the embryonic airway tissue into a delicate network of branched tubes which supply oxygen to the cells of an adult fly. However, no one knew how cells communicate Branchless, whether or not Branchless formed a gradient, and if it did, how this gradient was created to set up the plan to form airway tubes. It was assumed that the molecule would diffuse passively to reach airway cells – but this is not what the experiments by Du et al. showed.</p><p>To directly observe how Branchless moves among cells, insects were genetically engineered to produce Branchless molecules attached to a fluorescent ‘tag’. Microscopy experiments using these flies revealed that Branchless did not diffuse passively; instead, airway cells used cytonemes to ‘reach’ towards the cells that produced the molecule, collecting the signal directly from its source. The gradient was created because the airway cells near the cells that make Branchless had more cytonemes, and therefore received more of the molecule compared to the cells that were placed further away. Genetic analysis of the airway tissue showed that Branchless acts as a morphogen to switch on different genes in the receiving cells placed in different locations. The target genes activated by the gradient instruct the receiving cells on how many cytonemes need to be extended, which helps the gradient to maintain itself over time.</p><p>Du et al. demonstrate for the first time how cytonemes can relay a signal to establish a gradient in a developing tissue. Dissecting how cells exchange information to create an organism could help to understand how this communication fails and leads to disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>FGF</kwd><kwd>morphogen gradient</kwd><kwd>cytonemes</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>FGFR</kwd><kwd>branching morphogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM124878</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roy</surname><given-names>Sougata</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00HL114867</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roy</surname><given-names>Sougata</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>FGF morphogen gradient self-generates a recipient tissue-specific contour by feedback-regulating its cytoneme-mediated dispersion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diverse tissue shapes and patterns are created by conserved paracrine signaling proteins such as Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ), Hedgehog (Hh), Wingless (Wg/WNT), Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and Fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Irrespective of the diversity of the functions and forms created, a universal mode by which these signals coordinate responses in a large population of cells involves the generation of concentration gradients. For instance, morphogen gradients induce concentration-dependent gene activities that regulate tissue growth and patterning (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bier and De Robertis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christian, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Restrepo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rogers and Schier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolpert, 2016</xref>)). Similarly, growth factor and chemokine gradients are thought to control cell migration during vasculogenesis, neurogenesis, wound healing, and immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai and Montell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Majumdar et al., 2014</xref>). Despite advances in our understanding of signal transduction pathways, how signals disperse and how the dispersion mechanism is dynamically modulated to shape gradients in three-dimensional tissue structures are poorly understood. Moreover, the formation of signal gradients is unexplored in most morphogenetic contexts, so we do not know how dispersion of the signals through extracellular space can generate the required diversity in gradient shapes and contours for a multitude of tissue architectures.</p><p>Several models primarily based on free/restricted/facilitated extracellular diffusion of signals were proposed previously to explain the establishment of signal gradients, but the proposed mechanisms are highly controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Majumdar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Müller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolpert, 2016</xref>). Recent advancements in live imaging technology facilitated the discovery of a radically different mechanism of signal dispersion, where signals move directly from producing to recipient cells through actin-based specialized filopodia or cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eom and Parichy, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roy et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stanganello and Scholpp, 2016</xref>). Cytonemes and cytoneme-like projections are now known to be required for cell-cell communication mediated by many families of signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kornberg, 2014</xref>). For instance, a cytoneme-dependent mechanism was shown to be essential for generating concentration-dependent signaling responses to the Hh and Dpp morphogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roy et al., 2014</xref>). However, how local cytoneme-mediated cell-to-cell communication might create long-range signal gradients to regulate tissue morphogenesis was unknown.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to address these fundamental questions by characterizing gradient formation of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> FGF family protein, Branchless (Bnl). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Bnl is the primary signal that guides the branching morphogenesis of tracheal epithelial tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sutherland et al., 1996</xref>). At the third instar larval stage, Bnl produced from a restricted group of wing imaginal disc cells induces budding and growth of a wing disc-associated tracheal branch, the air-sac primordium (ASP), from the disc-associated transverse connective (TC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sato and Kornberg, 2002</xref>). ASP tracheoblast cells are precursors of adult air-sac, an organ that is analogous to the vertebrate lung. Traditionally, all paracrine signals such as FGF family proteins are thought to function as diffusible signals and form a gradient by passive extracellular dispersion. In accordance with the same line of thinking, one hypothesis predicts that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Bnl diffuses from its source to form an extracellular gradient and that the gradient guides directional migration of the tracheal branches such as the ASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horowitz and Simons, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ochoa-Espinosa and Affolter, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A’</xref>). However, whether Bnl forms a gradient and if so, how Bnl is transported and modulated in the extracellular space to form a gradient remain unexplored. Moreover, all tracheal cells express the Bnl receptor, Breathless (Btl), and develop under the guidance of the same Bnl signal, but different embryonic and larval tracheal branches adopt different developmental stage-specific morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sato and Kornberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sutherland et al., 1996</xref>).

Genome-edited Bnl:GFP and Btl:Cherry constructs generated in this study revealed Bnl distribution with high sensitivity and precision, allowing direct visualization of an endogenous signal and signaling gradient. We showed that Bnl moves target-specifically from the producing cells to the ASP through cytonemes and forms a long-range concentration gradient by dynamically adopting the recipient ASP-specific shapes and contours. We also demonstrated that Bnl functions as a morphogen and, most importantly, we uncovered a novel self-regulatory mechanism of cytoneme-mediated signaling by which the Bnl morphogen gradient forms. Thus, these findings showed an example of morphogenesis in which cytoneme-dependent signaling can provide precision and adaptability in shaping long-range positional gradients and tissue architectures in space and time.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A concentration gradient of Bnl:GFP adopts the recipient ASP-specific contour</title><p>To visualize Bnl dispersion without affecting normal tracheal morphogenesis, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing technique to generate flies that harbor an in-frame insertion of a superfolder-GFP (sfGFP) sequence within the third coding exon of the <italic>bnl</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>; Materials and methods).

Under sensitive confocal microscopy (see Materials and methods), endogenous Bnl:GFP molecules were visualized as fluorescent puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,C’</xref>). The distribution patterns of these Bnl:GFP puncta revealed several unexpected features. In the wing disc source cells that were marked by CherryCAAX expression, Bnl:GFP puncta were faint, hardly detectable, and homogeneously distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D’</xref>). As a paracrine signal, Bnl was expected to disperse and form a continuous gradient surrounding the wing disc source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A’</xref>). However, all of the detectable bright fluorescent Bnl:GFP puncta outside of the source cells were asymmetrically distributed only in the recipient ASP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D’</xref>). Thus, although Bnl:GFP moved from the wing disc source to the ASP, the punctate signal did not localize in the non-specific wing disc cells surrounding the signal source or in the myoblast cells located between the disc source and the ASP (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>).</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-38137-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38137.010</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Asymmetric distribution of Bnl:GFP produced from the wing disc source.</title><p>Serial Z-stacks of the CD8:Cherry-marked ASP and underlying wing disc Bnl:GFP producing cells shown from lower to upper optical sections; only the green channel is shown to highlight asymmetric Bnl:GFP localization; genotype: <italic>btl-Gal4, UAS-CD8:Cherry/+; bnl:gfp<sup>endo</sup></italic>.</p></caption></media><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-38137-video2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38137.011</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>A recipient ASP-specific Bnl:GFP distribution. </title><p>Same sample and Z-stacks of the CD8:Cherry-marked ASP as shown in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, but now with both red and green channels to highlight that the asymmetric Bnl:GFP distribution was due to dispersion of Bnl:GFP only in the recipient ASP epithelium; genotype: <italic>btl-Gal4, UAS-CD8:Cherry/+; bnl:gfp<sup>endo</sup></italic>.</p></caption></media><p>To ensure that the GFP-marked puncta in the ASP were actual Bnl molecules, we performed an immunohistochemistry assay (IHC) with αBnl antibody on the homozygous <italic>bnl:gfp<sup>endo</sup></italic> larval tissues. The Bnl antibody recognized all of the Bnl:GFP puncta in the larval ASP, confirming that they represent the Bnl protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,A’</xref>). To further validate whether the Bnl:GFP distribution in the ASP represented a functional distribution of the ligand, we knocked-down <italic>bnl:gfp<sup>endo</sup></italic> expression in the wing disc source. Since Bnl is essential for tracheal/ASP growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sutherland et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sato and Kornberg, 2002</xref>), loss of a functional Bnl:GFP distribution was expected to abrogate ASP development. As expected, overexpression of <italic>bnlRNAi</italic> from the disc <italic>bnl-</italic>source in the <italic>bnl:gfp<sup>endo</sup></italic> larvae knocked down both Bnl:GFP expression and ASP growth in most samples, indicating that the tagged signaling protein is functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>). However, due to incomplete <italic>RNAi</italic>-mediated knock-down of <italic>bnl:gfp<sup>endo</sup></italic>, a few samples still contained low levels of Bnl:GFP. Importantly, these samples also had small, stunted ASPs with a shallow range of Bnl:GFP distribution. This correlation between Bnl:GFP levels/distribution and ASP growth suggested that the levels and distribution of Bnl:GFP in the ASP have a significant developmental role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>).</p><p>Contrary to what was predicted earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A’</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horowitz and Simons, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ochoa-Espinosa and Affolter, 2012</xref>)), our imaging results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D’</xref>) suggested that a pre-existing Bnl:GFP gradient surrounding the wing disc signal source was not formed. Instead, the Bnl:GFP puncta appeared to distribute in a graded pattern along the distal-to-proximal (D-P) axis of the recipient ASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,D’</xref>). Measurement of Bnl:GFP intensities along the longest D-P axis of the late third instar larval ASPs revealed a long-range exponential gradient spanning ~100–120 μm in range. The distal ASP tip, which is nearest to the disc <italic>bnl-</italic>source, received the highest levels of Bnl:GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The signal concentration decreased exponentially toward the proximal ASP stalk as the distance from the source increased. Thus, although Bnl:GFP is produced in the wing disc, its gradient is formed in the recipient ASP.</p><p>The Bnl:GFP gradient shapes were variable, and developed concomitantly with the growth of the recipient ASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In the early third instar larval stage (18–26 hr after third instar larval molt), the ASP was hardly detectable. At this stage, only a few TC cells proximal to the <italic>bnl-</italic>source had received Bnl:GFP. In the later stages, as the ASP budded from the TC and then elongated, the Bnl:GFP gradient shapes adopted the variable shapes of the recipient ASP. These results suggested that the shape of the Bnl:GFP gradient is adaptable and its formation is coordinated with growth of the recipient ASP. We further examined the relationship of the slope of the Bnl:GFP gradient with the length of the D-P axis of the recipient ASP. In the shorter early third instar larval ASPs (~35–40 hr after third instar larval molt), Bnl:GFP formed relatively steeper and narrower gradients (slope of a straight line joining C<sub>max</sub> to C<sub>1/2max</sub> =~3.14) compared to the larger/longer late-stage ASPs (slope =~0.71) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,G</xref>). A strong negative correlation of the gradient slopes with the length of the ASP D-P axis was also observed in a population of randomly harvested wandering third instar larval ASPs, which showed natural developmental variations in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These results showed that the range and slope of the Bnl:GFP gradients are dependent on the ASP morphology and that the gradient did not pre-exist, but instead developed dynamically in coordination with the recipient tissue morphogenesis.</p><p>Although 2D Z-projected images were sufficient to visualize the gradient in the X-Y plane, the ASP epithelium has a complex three-dimensional tubular morphology. As shown in the cross-section diagram of the ASP and wing disc in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A”</xref>, the relative distance of the ASP cells from the disc source can be measured along the D-P axis as well as in the upper and lower layers across the vertical Z-axis. Across the Z-axis, most of the cells in the upper ASP layer (ventral face) were situated away from the underlying <italic>bnl-</italic>source. In spite of the physical distances, Bnl:GFP distribution was not restricted to the ASP cells that were immediately juxtaposed to the <italic>bnl-</italic>source. Instead, Bnl:GFP distributed in both layers formed a continuous long-range gradient, adopting the complex 3D tubular contour of the epithelium (~300 μm long, equivalent to 30 cells in just a single medial cross-section) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–I”</xref>). When we probed for the expression of a Bnl-signaling target gene <italic>pntP1</italic>, an ETS family transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sutherland et al., 1996</xref>), overlapping signal and signaling gradients were revealed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–E”</xref>). Interestingly, in a digitally straightened continuous epithelium, the signal and signaling gradients had a bilateral symmetric distribution, where the positions with highest concentrations corresponded to the ASP cells nearest to the disc <italic>bnl</italic>-source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I’,I”,J</xref>). Tubular contours of the ASP epithelium were variable among different samples, but irrespective of the differences in 3D morphologies, the Bnl:GFP distribution consistently adopted the recipient ASP-specific contours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–E”</xref>). Collectively, these results showed that formation of the Bnl gradient depends on the ASP growth, and that the shapes of the gradient can dynamically adapt to the changing morphologies of the growing tissues.</p><p>A trachea-specific Bnl:GFP gradient might reflect a receptor-bound signal distribution. To examine this possibility, we created animals harboring a <italic>btl:cherry<sup>endo</sup></italic> knock-in allele using genome-editing technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>; Materials and methods). As expected, Btl:Cherry expressed at physiological levels marked all tracheal cells, but formed a concentration gradient along the D-P axis of the ASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This observation is consistent with an earlier report describing activation of <italic>btl</italic> transcription by Bnl signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ohshiro et al., 2002</xref>). In trans-heterozygous <italic>btl:cherry<sup>endo</sup></italic>/<italic>bnl:gfp<sup>endo</sup></italic> animals, all the Bnl:GFP puncta in the ASP colocalized with Btl:Cherry and the receptor gradient coincided with that of the ligand gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E,E’</xref>). Most of the colocalized receptor-ligand puncta were compartmentalized apically in early- (αRab5 IF; ~76% of total puncta/ASP examined) and late- (αRab7 IF; ~90% of total puncta/ASP) endosomes, but not in recycling endosomes or lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–E”’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). These results suggested that the branch-specific Bnl:GFP gradient is receptor-bound, and mostly intracellular. Notably, a small number of receptor-ligand puncta were found at the basal side of ASP cells (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). They were located mostly at the distal ASP tip cells and did not colocalize with any of the endosomal markers we examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These puncta on the exposed basal side of the ASP might represent Btl:Cherry-bound Bnl:GFP molecules prior to their receptor-mediated endocytosis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38137.012</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A receptor-bound Bnl:GFP gradient.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic map of <italic>btl:cherry<sup>endo</sup></italic> knock-in allele; orange box, coding exon; grey box, non-coding exon; line, introns.

Instead, they were asymmetrically localized and only detected on the surfaces of signal producing cells and of the recipient ASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,A’</xref>). Bnl:GFP<sup>ex</sup> were highly enriched on the ASP and appeared to form a gradient on the recipient surface, in exactly the same way as the endocytosed Bnl:GFP<sup>in</sup> molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A”</xref>). In contrast to the asymmetric Bnl:GFP<sup>ex</sup> distribution, a secreted-GFP construct containing a sfGFP tag and an N-terminal signal peptide derived from the Bnl sequence (secGFP; see Materials and methods) randomly dispersed in the extracellular space surrounding the disc <italic>bnl-</italic>source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–B”</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results showed that Bnl:GFP moved target-specifically in polarized fashion.</p><p>The polarized distribution pattern of Bnl:GFP<sup>ex</sup> was consistent with a potential cytoneme-mediated direct transport of the molecules. Previous studies showed that ASP cells project receptor-containing cytonemes to establish direct membrane contacts with the wing disc Bnl source. These cytonemes were shown to be essential for induction of pMAPK signaling in the ASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roy et al., 2014</xref>). However, Bnl transport through cytonemes was never visualized before. To examine if Bnl:GFP<sup>ex</sup> molecules localized on the surface of the ASP cytonemes, we carried out EIF assays with either αGFP or αBnl antibody on CD8:Cherry-marked ASPs of <italic>bnl:gfp<sup>endo</sup></italic> homozygous larvae. These assays showed that the EIF-stained Bnl:GFP<sup>ex</sup> puncta were highly enriched on cytonemes emanating from the distal ASP tip (N &gt; 50 ASP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–B”</xref>).</p><p>However, as observed earlier, many of these puncta were poorly fluorescent under standard confocal fluorescence imaging conditions. Therefore, to clearly visualize the endogenous Bnl:GFP molecules on cytonemes, we employed an enhanced gain super-resolution detection method (see Materials and methods). This imaging method revealed that the surfaces of the ASP and ASP cytonemes were densely populated with a high concentration of Bnl:GFP molecules, which appeared as small sub-resolution-sized puncta of &lt;200 nm in diameter (henceforth referred as nanopuncta due to their sub-resolution size; arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–F”</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–A”’</xref>). These nanopuncta were also enriched on the source cells, especially around the bouton-like sites of contact between the cytonemes and the source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). An αGFP EIF staining assay in combination with super-resolution imaging showed that these Bnl:GFP nanopuncta included both surface-bound molecules (EIF-stained) and intracellular molecules (non-EIF stained) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B,B’</xref>). Occasionally, several nanopuncta aggregated to form bright punctal clusters on the cytonemes, the fluorescence of which was likely to be easily detectable under our standard confocal fluorescence imaging conditions (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F’,F”</xref>). Although the molecular and cellular nature of the nanopuncta and their clusters on the cytonemes are unclear, these results provided substantial evidence for a selective distribution of Bnl:GFP molecules along the surface of cytonemes.</p><p>Native, untagged Bnl could also be detected on cytoneme surfaces using the αBnl antibody. The αBnl EIF assay showed that a high concentration of externalized Bnl (Bnl<sup>ex</sup>) molecules selectively decorate actin-rich ASP cytonemes and the ASP surface of <italic>w<sup>-</sup></italic> wild-type larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The distribution of Bnl<sup>ex</sup> was asymmetrical, exactly as observed for Bnl:GFP on CD8:Cherry-marked ASPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggested that Bnl molecules, irrespective of the presence or absence of fluorescent tags, specifically localize on the surface of the ASP cytonemes for inter-organ transport. Since efficient inter-tissue movement of Bnl molecules along the surface of the recipient cytonemes might require receptor binding, we imaged ASP cytonemes in <italic>btl:cherry<sup>endo</sup></italic> larvae. Densely packed Btl:Cherry molecules were visualized on the surface of the ASP cytonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). An αBnl-EIF assay in <italic>btl:cherry<sup>endo</sup></italic> larvae showed that the native Bnl<sup>ex</sup> puncta colocalized with the Btl:Cherry puncta on the cytonemes and on ASP surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Receptor-bound Bnl:GFP puncta were also observed on cytonemes during live imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B–C’</xref>; N = 30). Thus, Bnl is transported by cytonemes from the source to the ASP in a receptor-bound state.</p><p>Cytonemes exchange signals by establishing direct physical contacts between the source and recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">González-Méndez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang and Kornberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roy et al., 2014</xref>). These signaling contacts between the ASP and the <italic>bnl</italic> source were originally discovered using a membrane GFP-reconstitution method (GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners, GRASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang and Kornberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roy et al., 2014</xref>).

To estimate the contact-dependency of the cytoneme-mediated Bnl reception, we combined the <italic>syb</italic>-GRASP experiment with the αBnl EIF assay. This experiment showed that the actin-rich (phalloidin-stained) ASP cytonemes that contacted the disc <italic>bnl</italic>-source received a significantly higher number of Bnl<sup>ex</sup> puncta in comparison to the non-contacting cytonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,I’</xref>). These observations, together with the previous reports on the effect of loss of cytoneme contacts on pMAPK signaling in the ASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roy et al., 2014</xref>), provided substantial evidence that cytoneme-mediated Bnl exchange is contact-dependent.</p><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-38137-video3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38137.024</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>3D rendered views of the CD8:Cherry-marked ASP showing that each of the ASP cytonemes established multiple physical contacts (green dots) with the underlying wing disc <italic>bnl</italic> source (unmarked).</title><p>Cytoneme contact sites were marked by <italic>syb</italic>GRASP, a GFP-reconstitution method, where the ASP expressed CD4:GFP<sup>11</sup> and the wing disc <italic>bnl-</italic>source expressed <italic>syb:GFP<sup>1-10</sup></italic>; genotype: <italic>btl-Gal4, UAS-</italic>CD8:Cherry<italic>/LexO-syb:GFP<sup>1-10</sup>, UAS-</italic>CD4:GFP<sup>11</sup><italic>; bnl-LexA/+</italic>.</p></caption></media><p>Molecular reconstitution of split GFP between ASP cytonemes and source cells suggested that the signaling contacts between the cytoneme and source cell membranes juxtapose within a 20 nm gap distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</xref>). To directly visualize and resolve Bnl exchange at these cytoneme contacts, an αBnl EIF assay was combined with super-resolution imaging (see Materials and methods) of the tissues that had both the source and recipient ASP cells marked with distinct membrane-tagged proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). The images revealed that ASP cytonemes traverse along the surface of the source cells, with each cytoneme establishing contacts with multiple signal-producing cells. Although the producing cells occupy a large area, the externalized Bnl proteins were specifically enriched at the cytoneme contact sites. This observation suggests that the producing cells selectively release Bnl at these contact sites. These ASP cytonemes also localized Bnl<sup>ex</sup> puncta on their shafts, suggesting that the signal might be transported from the contact sites to the ASP along the surface of the cytonemes. A similar retrograde movement of Dpp was previously observed through ASP cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roy et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cytoneme-mediated transport is essential for generation of the Bnl gradient</title><p>To examine whether cytoneme-mediated reception of Bnl:GFP is essential for generating the long-range Bnl:GFP gradient in the ASP, we generated mosaics of marked cytoneme-deficient mutant clones within the ASP of <italic>bnl:gfp<sup>endo</sup></italic> larvae by knocking down several known cytoneme-regulator genes such as <italic>diaphanous</italic> (<italic>dia</italic>), a formin homolog, <italic>neuroglian</italic> (<italic>nrg</italic>), an L1-cell adhesion molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roy et al., 2014</xref>), and <italic>singed</italic> (<italic>sn</italic>), a Fascin homolog and a regulator of tracheal filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Okenve-Ramos and Llimargas, 2014</xref>).

Note that an autonomous reduction in intracellular Bnl:GFP (non-EIF stained) was also observed in the mutant clones, but such reduction in intracellular Bnl:GFP levels was expected irrespective of the mechanism of signal dispersion, and did not affect our conclusions.

In contrast, our results suggested that Bnl activated multiple target genes at its various concentrations similar to a morphogen. To further examine whether the target genes were differentially expressed in response to different Bnl concentrations, we overexpressed cDNA-derived Bnl constructs either from the wing disc <italic>bnl-</italic>source or from small clones of cells within the recipient ASP. Remarkably, even while highly expressed from the wing disc source, Bnl:GFP moved only target-specifically from the disc source to the ASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H,H’</xref>). In comparison to the normal range of endogenous Bnl:GFP distribution and Bnl (pMAPK) signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), the spatial range of the overexpressed signal and the signaling expanded to all parts of the ASP, including the stalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). The expanded range of signal led to retraction of the Cut and Yan expressing zone from within the stalk to only the farthest region in the TC, which received little or no Bnl:GFP from the disc source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–I</xref>). Moreover, ectopic clones of either Bnl:GFP or Bnl in the ASP stalk non-autonomously induced <italic>sty</italic> and <italic>pntP1</italic> and suppressed <italic>cut</italic> in the surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J,K,L</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results showed that Bnl acts as a morphogen to induce concentration-dependent expression of different genes.</p><p>It was previously reported that PntP1 and Yan antagonize each other’s expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ohshiro et al., 2002</xref>). To examine whether Cut and PntP1 also antagonize each other, we induced ectopic <italic>pntP1</italic> and <italic>cut</italic> mutant clones in the ASP. Reduction of PntP1 levels in the mutant <italic>pntP1</italic> LOF (<italic>pntP1 RNAi</italic>) clones in the ASP tip autonomously upregulated Cut expression within the clones, whereas overexpression of PntP1 in the ectopic <italic>pntP1 </italic>GOF clones in the ASP stalk suppressed <italic>cut</italic> in the mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M,N</xref>).

Thus, PntP1 and Cut reciprocally inhibit each other’s expression. Notably, although PntP1 is a known inducer of <italic>btl</italic>, <italic>pntP1 </italic>GOF/LOF clones showed only cell-autonomous effects on <italic>cut</italic>.

All these results provided evidence that Bnl acts as a classical morphogen to induce <italic>sty</italic> at a high level and <italic>pntP1</italic>, <italic>cut</italic>, and <italic>yan</italic> gradually at lower levels in the ASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Target genes of Bnl signaling differentially feedback regulate cytoneme numbers</title><p>To examine whether the different target genes of Bnl signaling may regulate cytoneme formation, we focused on <italic>pntP1</italic> and <italic>cut</italic>, the two transcription factors that formed counteracting gradients from two opposing poles of the ASP and antagonized each other’s expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B,C,E,M–P</xref>). When we induced ectopic <italic>cut</italic> GOF clones in the distal tip/mid-ASP regions, the mutant cells produced significantly fewer long and oriented cytonemes compared to the <italic>wt</italic> clones at an equivalent position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,A’</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A’’,C</xref>). This cytoneme deficiency in the <italic>cut </italic>GOF clones correlated with the autonomous reduction of Bnl:GFP uptake in the mutant clones from the mid/tip of the ASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B’</xref>). On the other hand, the orientation and number of cytonemes from the ASP stalk cells, which generally had high levels of Cut and produced randomly oriented short cytonemes, remained unaffected by <italic>cut </italic>GOF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A’</xref>).

These results showed that PntP1 elicits positive-feedback on Btl synthesis and Bnl-receiving cytoneme production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A’</xref>). Interestingly, PntP1 and Cut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M–P</xref>) or PntP1 and Yan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ohshiro et al., 2002</xref>) can reciprocally inhibit each other’s expression. Therefore, a ratio of the levels of PntP1 to Cut or to Yan could determine the number of cytonemes and Btl receptors in a cell. Based on our results, we propose that the counteracting activities of PntP1 and Cut/Yan and their expression from two opposite poles in response to the high-to-low Bnl levels in the ASP establish a steady-state gradient of numbers of Btl-containing cytonemes. Signaling through these cytonemes would self-generate the shape of a robust signal and signaling gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A’</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Dynamic, recipient tissue-specific shapes of an FGF morphogen gradient</title><p>Prior to this study, branching morphogenesis of tissues such as vertebrate lung or vasculature was proposed to be induced by exogenous, diffusible signal gradients. For instance, a mesenchymal FGF10 gradient induces branching in the vertebrate lung, and a Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/VEGF gradient induces vascular sprouting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Affolter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spurlin and Nelson, 2017</xref>). Although the paracrine functions of these signals were well characterized, our demonstration and detailed characterization of the Bnl gradient represents the first example of an inductive gradient for branching morphogenesis. In contrast to the traditional idea of a preexisting diffusible gradient, we showed that the shapes of the inductive Bnl gradient are dynamic, adaptable, and form only in a receptor-bound state within the recipient tissue. Moreover, we showed that the Bnl gradient self-generates its variable recipient branch-specific shapes by regulating its cytoneme-mediated transport. Self-generation of tissue-specific gradients may be a common and essential strategy for sustaining the robust, yet variable gradient shapes in dynamically migrating tissues. Consistent with this view, the chemokine Cxcl12a also forms a self-generating gradient to regulate dynamic migration of the Zebrafish lateral line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donà et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, inductive signals such as Bnl or VEGF were previously thought to induce chemotactic migration by inducing binary signaling responses in the recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ochoa-Espinosa and Affolter, 2012</xref>). Therefore, identification of an organizer-like morphogenetic role of Bnl brings a critical shift to our understanding of branching morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cytoneme-mediated, tissue-specific Bnl dispersion</title><p>Several earlier reports, including biophysical analyses of vertebrate FGF8 and its distribution patterns in tissues, proposed a free or restricted diffusion-based dispersion mechanism for gradient formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bökel and Brand, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Toyoda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). An alternative model proposed that the FGF8 morphogen gradient is also formed by gradual decay of <italic>fgf8</italic> mRNA and its translation in a growing vertebrate embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubrulle and Pourquié, 2004</xref>). In contrast, all of our genetic analyses and direct imaging results show that the Bnl gradient is formed by cytoneme-mediated direct transport. An earlier study showed that ASP cells project Btl-containing cytonemes to establish contact with the disc Bnl source, and fail to induce pMAPK signaling without these cytoneme-mediated contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roy et al., 2014</xref>). In this study we extended those initial findings. By generating endo-tagged Bnl:GFP and Btl:Cherry constructs expressed at physiological levels, utilizing an EIF assay to detect externalized Bnl molecules, and by applying high resolution visualization techniques, we obtained reliable and unbiased evidence for Bnl dispersion via cytonemes. We showed that ASP cytonemes receive Bnl molecules by establishing direct membrane synapses with the signal producing cells. Super-resolution imaging of membrane-marked ASP and source cells documented these synaptic sites and showed a selective enrichment of externalized Bnl molecules only at these signaling contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). At this point, we do not know why and how Bnl is released from producing cells only at cytoneme-source membrane contact sites. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this process is an important new direction for future investigations.</p><p>Antibody-based EIF analysis under detergent-free conditions and super-resolution imaging of endogenously expressed Bnl:GFP showed that at a steady state, a high concentration of the signal moves along the surface of the cytonemes in receptor-bound forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–H</xref>). It is likely that receptor-bound Bnl ligands move along the surface of the cytonemes by an energy-dependent motor transport and are endocytosed when they reach the ASP cell body. Super-resolution imaging also revealed a previously uncharacterized sub-resolution distribution of Bnl:GFP nanopuncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–F’’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—supplement figure 2</xref>), suggesting the existence of novel cellular and molecular events that regulate the cytoneme-mediated signaling process. Each of these individual cellular and molecular mechanisms would influence the levels of Bnl signaling in a cell and thereby would contribute to the essential feedback mechanisms by which the cytoneme and the morphogen gradients are formed.</p><p>Contact-dependent Bnl exchange implies that the ASP cells can interpret the direction from where (and from whom) they receive the Bnl signal, in addition to its levels. We do not know how ASP cytonemes find the <italic>bnl-</italic>source and establish the signaling contacts. A recent study had shown an important regulatory role of the components of the extracellular matrix, which interact with the signal-specific cytonemes and stabilize their directionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang and Kornberg, 2016</xref>). Another possible mechanism could be that the cells in the disc Bnl source extend Bnl-containing cytonemes to establish an initial contact with the recipient cytonemes to provide them the necessary pathfinding information. In fact, Hh is known to be delivered by the source cytonemes to the recipient cytonemes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc and vertebrate limb buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">González-Méndez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>). However, the imaging conditions used in this study could not detect Bnl-containing source cytonemes. Future live imaging analyses are required to elucidate the mechanisms of cytoneme pathfinding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A self-regulatory mechanism for gradient formation</title><p>How morphogen gradients are produced in tissues is a long-standing central question. Based on our experimental results, we propose a model for the mechanism by which cytonemes can create and maintain a morphogen gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A’</xref>). We uncovered that ASP epithelial cells extend a graded number of cytonemes that reach out and contact the disc <italic>bnl</italic> source to receive the signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D’’</xref>). Recipient cells close to the source have many long polarized cytonemes, but their numbers gradually reduced as the distance from the source increases. Clonal GFP-reconstitution analyses suggested that the number of cytoneme-contacts an ASP cell makes is inversely proportional to its distance from the signal source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–D”</xref>). Since reception of Bnl is contact-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,I’</xref>), these features of patterned cytoneme formation in the recipient ASP explain how cytoneme-mediated signal reception can generate the recipient tissue-specific shapes of the gradient. These observations led us to address a very important question: how are the cytoneme patterns developed and maintained in the tissue? Answering this question was expected to provide the basis by which cytonemes create and regulate gradient shapes and tissue patterns.</p><p>A key finding providing insight into this question came from our analysis of the spatial domains of targets of Bnl signaling in the ASP. One of the target genes, <italic>pntP1</italic>, is induced by high Bnl levels in the distal region of the ASP and positively regulates the formation of cytonemes and Btl synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,E</xref>). On the other hand, surprisingly, the target gene <italic>cut</italic>, which is induced by gradually lower levels of Bnl in the ASP stalk region away from the source, negatively controls cytoneme formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,E; 7A,A’; 8A'</xref>) and Btl synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pitsouli and Perrimon, 2013</xref>). Moreover, the transcription factors Cut and PntP1 feedback-inhibit each other’s expression to maintain their zones of expression in response to Bnl levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M–P</xref>). The consequence is a regulatory loop that controls the generation and reinforcement of different numbers of cytonemes and levels of Bnl signaling, making the contours of the Bnl gradient robust, precisely tissue-specific, and self-sustaining.</p><p>The roles of these target genes might also explain how variable shapes of Bnl gradients are sculpted in coordination with the growth and development of recipient tissues. One current morphogen model proposes that the signal gradients are generated and scaled to the size of the recipient tissue by the ratio of two diffusible molecules, a morphogen and a contractor/expander, which emanate from opposite poles of the tissue and elicit non-autonomous global feedback to control each other’s distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barkai and Shilo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Zvi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Restrepo and Basler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shilo and Barkai, 2017</xref>). Although Cut and PntP1 are intracellular transcription factors that function cell autonomously, their counteracting feedback activities, regulating where and when signal-specific cytonemes are made as a function of the levels of signal received, can self-generate gradients adopting any recipient-specific shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F; 8A'</xref>).</p><p>This mechanism implies an interesting systemic feedback where the gradient shape is a result of the growth and patterning of the recipient tissue, which it controls. However, this mechanism also implies that to initiate such a self-sustaining gradient, initial physical contact of a part of the recipient epithelium with the signal source is required. In fact, each tracheal cell is capable of inducing either PntP1 or Cut/Yan expression irrespective of its position within the recipient epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Thus, an ectopic new <italic>bnl</italic> source near a pre-existing tracheal branch can initiate a local gradient of cytoneme contacts leading to polarized signal and signaling gradient formation as well as neo-branch organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In agreement with this view, spatiotemporal expression of Bnl surrounding the embryonic tracheal placode is known to induce new branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sutherland et al., 1996</xref>). Moreover, if the Bnl response genes are not the same or are not regulated in the same manner at all sites and at all times, different patterns of cytoneme formation can be generated leading to changes in spatial patterns of signal distribution and tissue morphology. Given the commonality of fundamental signaling events mediated by conserved signaling proteins, feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated transport may offer an explanation for why signal gradients are so precise, yet adaptable and for how diverse tissue morphologies can result from just one signal transduction pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated transport self-generates a tissue-specific FGF morphogen gradient&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Bruce Edgar as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviews in full are appended below. While it is not necessary to address all these comments, many are simply editorial and should be straightforward to address. Indeed both reviewers felt that the manuscript and figures were more complex, and more difficult to read than necessary, so you should spend some time simplifying it according to their suggestions. In addition, reviewer #2 felt that it was quite important that you state the ambivalences concerning the Bnl ligand solubility, and noted that the data you present suggest direct ligand uptake from producer cell membranes, rather than uptake from freely dispersed molecules within the extracellular matrix. GRASP experiments using cell membrane markers from both producer and receiving cells could further clarify this issue, and would be a strong addition to the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, Du et al. describe inter-organ signaling between the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc and the air-sac, a tracheal tissue. They generate flies with GFP and RFP tagged Bnl and Btl, FGF and FGFR homologs used in tracheal morphogenesis, and use these to visualize how Bnl from the disc signals to Btl in the air sac via cytonemes from the air sac cells. The tagged proteins prove to be very informative, and careful imaging shows that there is a gradient of Bnl signaling to the airsac that depends on graded cytoneme density from the airsac cells, which in turn depends upon the response of the cells to Bnl, mediated by the transcription factors Cut and PntP1. The imaging in the paper is done at a very high level (cytonemes are small, dynamic, and tough to fix) and is quite convincing, and a requisite number of genetic tests are included to support the gradient model convincingly. The paper is well written and thoroughly referenced, though somewhat complex. A very interesting aspect of the Bnl signaling gradient is that, through the feedback interactions of its components, it is self-reinforcing. I found the paper quite elegant and have only two general comments.</p><p>First, even though the paper is well organized and written, with clear logical conclusions, it is nevertheless complex and difficult to digest. This is in part just because the model, despite its elegance, is unavoidably complex, as are the experiments supporting it. Nevertheless I think the authors should strive to simplify and clarify their delivery as much as is possible. More self-explanatory labels in the figures, and any other possible simplifications should help the reader.</p><p>Second, regarding the gradient model, it is easy to understand how it maintains itself (more cytonemes give more Bnl:Btl signaling, more signaling causes more cytonemes), but it is not so clear how it is set up in the first place. The authors' Discussion suggests that they believe they understand gradient establishment (during its development) but how this works was not at all clear to me from the tests shown, or from the summary diagram in Figure 7. It seems there may be more to it, for instance pre-exisiting positional information in the air sac, or direct interactions between the air sac cells, that influence the relative activities of Cut and PntP1 and consequently establish the gradient. Alternatively, maybe the initial guiding factor is just physics – cells closer to the Bnl source get more signaling from the start, even before the graded distributions of Cut, PntP1, Btl, and cytonemes arise. Although it is not necessary for the authors to resolve this issue with more data here, I feel they should discuss the issue of gradient formation more adequately, and perhaps indicate what is possible in their summary figure. In addition, if they can't really explain how the gradient initially forms (as opposed to sustaining itself), then they should change their title.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Lijuan Du et al. certainly presents innovative concepts to the field of morphogen function and regulation during tissue organization in development. First, it experimentally establishes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> the existence of a concentration gradient of the FGF molecule Bnl, able to determine the differential activation of target genes in a morphogen-like manner and with direct developmental outcomes. Second, it describes the mechanisms that sustain the establishment of the gradient, which include the involvement of cytonemes. These structures have been increasingly gaining strength as a mechanism for the spatially regulated distribution of signalling molecules. Third, it also initiates the study of cytoneme formation by determining a self-founded positive and negative feedback from the pathway targets towards the regulation of Bnl loaded cytonemes, which in turn regulates target activation. In general the manuscript is well written and presents a coherent development of ideas sustained by experimental work. However, there are a number of major points that could help to clarify the manuscript.</p><p>1) It is important to clarify if the ligand Bnl is a soluble molecule or not. The authors should state the ambivalences of the published data in the field concerning solubility of the molecule. The present manuscript and the experimental data presented suggest an uptake of ligand directly from producer cell membranes, rather than an uptake from freely dispersed molecules in the extracellular matrix. Also the authors should attempt to clarify their interpretation regarding the different size of the visualised puncta (&lt;≈2μm and &lt;200nm).</p><p>2) The use of the GRASP technique mediated by the Snare protein Syb to illuminate contact points also strongly suggests membrane-membrane contact. The authors fail to discuss this point that would go against the stated solubility of the ligand. The GRASP technique has indeed been reported to mark membrane-to-membrane contact points for the reception of morphogen Hedgehog (González-Méndez et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017).</p><p>3) Finally the understanding of this contact mechanisms, signal transfer and transport of the ligand would benefit from additional experimental data regarding whether cytonemes from the producer cells at the wing disc matter at all. 1) Additional imaging of membranes from ligand-producer cells would aid this crucial point. 2) Cytoneme disruption experiments in the wing disc might clarify this point if no change in distribution is observed. 3) An experiment using the Syb-GRASP technique but reversing the components at each side (producer and receptor sides); or equally one where each half of the molecule GFP is attached to a membrane marker (CD4) on both sides would also clarify this point.</p><p>4) In general, presentation of figures needs a more logical arrangement to help with their interpretation. The manuscript would really benefit if figures always included a control beside images and data of mutants. Further labelling is also needed, especially in all the supplementary figures where labelling of different antibodies and reporters within the photo panels would really help their interpretation. In addition, most fluorescent intensity profiles presented don't include information about the sample size used.</p><p>5) Particularly the section and corresponding figure regarding the analysis of extracellular and intracellular Bnl ligand (Figure 4 and Figure 4—Figure supplements 1-4) is very confusing. Sometimes contradictory data are presented without further discussion (e.g. lack of Bnl signal-GFP during in vivo imaging).</p><p>6) Data comparison between the different mutant conditions that authors intend to correlate not always follow the same parameters; e.g. in Figure 4I and K' data for BnlGFP density is presented for LOF of cytoneme cytoskeleton regulators while density of extracellular Bnl versus intracellular Bnl is presented for Btl GOF. Clarity of the work would be improved if same or equivalent parameters are presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38137.059</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviews in full are appended below. While it is not necessary to address all these comments, many are simply editorial and should be straightforward to address. Indeed both reviewers felt that the manuscript and figures were more complex, and more difficult to read than necessary, so you should spend some time simplifying it according to their suggestions. In addition, reviewer #2 felt that it was quite important that you state the ambivalences concerning the Bnl ligand solubility, and noted that the data you present suggest direct ligand uptake from producer cell membranes, rather than uptake from freely dispersed molecules within the extracellular matrix. GRASP experiments using cell membrane markers from both producer and receiving cells could further clarify this issue, and would be a strong addition to the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these important suggestions! We rewrote most of the parts of the manuscript and simplified the figures and descriptions of the results as suggested by the reviewers.</p><p>We agree that contact-dependent Bnl signaling and its regulation is the key to the mechanism of FGF gradient formation by cytonemes. To further strengthen and clarify this point with experiments, we now show selective localization of the native externalized Bnl at the sites where the ASP cytonemes established direct contacts with the source cells (Figure 3J). In this experiment, super-resolution imaging of the source and recipient cells both labeled with membrane-tethered fluorescent proteins provided an unprecedented resolution of the sites of intimate membrane contact. Amazingly, although the source cells cover a large tissue area compared to the 200 nm thin cytonemes, externalized Bnl puncta were selectively enriched only at the cytoneme contact sites. This experiment shows that Bnl is selectively released at the sites of cytoneme contacts.</p><p>We chose to demonstrate this point in this manner instead of using the GRASP technique, because this is a relatively unbiased experimental approach that allows us to preserve the natural membrane affinity and composition of the contact sites while answering the main question – whether Bnl is externalized/released from the source only at these contact points. The <italic>syb</italic>-GRASP or membrane-GRASP is an excellent technique to map and quantify the steady-state number of contact sites. But GFP-reconstitution is also an irreversible reaction, which may (or may not) bias the molecular/signaling composition of the cell/cytoneme membranes at the contact sites. In this context, the experimental results shown in Figure 3J is significant and confirms the GRASP results.</p><p>We also provided a quantitative analysis showing that the cytonemes that had stable GRASP contacts with the signal source received higher levels of Bnl than the other cytonemes from the same ASP that did not touch the source. In an earlier paper (Roy et al., 2014), GFP-reconstitution technique was used in the ASP system to thoroughly map the signaling contacts established between the ASP cytonemes and the wing disc <italic>bnl</italic> or <italic>dpp</italic> sources. This study also demonstrated that the cytoneme contacts are essential for both Bnl and Dpp signaling. Several genetic conditions, that removed either the cytonemes or the cytoneme contacts without affecting cytoneme formation from the <italic>btl</italic>-expressing tracheal cells, reduced pMAPK signaling in the mutant ASP cells. However, Bnl dispersion through cytonemes was not visualized earlier, which limited our understanding of the mechanism of Bnl transport and gradient formation. Now, collectively, the results from previous and current work provide substantial evidence that the Bnl exchange is contact-dependent.</p><p>We elaborated on the contact-dependence of Bnl signal exchange in our revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] I found the paper quite elegant and have only two general comments.</p><p>First, even though the paper is well organized and written, with clear logical conclusions, it is nevertheless complex and difficult to digest.

We provided more explanation in the Discussion and in the summary figure (Figure 8). Previously, it was known that the Bnl source remains close to the growing tip of a tracheal branch, and the source changes its position concomitantly with the growing tip. An earlier paper (Du et al., 2017) showed that Bnl sources in the embryo co-migrate in synchrony with the growing tracheal tips. Based on this prior knowledge, we predicted that it is the close association of the source and the recipient cells that provides the initial positional information.</p><p>In brief, the feedback mechanisms that we found to regulate the cytonemes operate within a single cell, autonomously. We predict that this mechanism provides a modular control and an interesting mechanism of gradient formation in coordination with the growth and patterning of the ASP. At an early stage prior to ASP budding, a few cells in a preexisting tracheal branch (the disc-associated TC) that are juxtaposed to the Bnl-source could establish cytoneme-contacts with the signal source to induce signaling feedback (PntP1). The TC cells at increasing distance from the source will upregulate Cut or Yan. Thus, the signal and signaling gradients we observed in the ASP could be formed, but their shapes and dimensions are very different and TC specific. With ASP budding and increase in cell number in the growing ASP, as well as with movement of the <italic>bnl-</italic>source, the dimensions of the signal and signaling gradient change. The gradient shape becomes more ASP-specific.</p><p>This mechanism implies an interesting systemic feedback where the gradient shape is a result of growth and patterning of the recipient tissue, which it controls. Following the same line of thinking, although it is apparent that an initial physical association is required to initiate the signaling feedback and the gradient, our data might also imply for a self-sustaining feedback between the physical contacts and chemical signaling. Physical contacts of cytonemes are needed for exchange of the chemical signals, whereas the chemical signaling increases the physical connections through feedback on cytoneme formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] In general the manuscript is well written and presents a coherent development of ideas sustained by experimental work.

As described earlier, we added new experimental results (new Figure 3J) that show selective localization of Bnl at the sites where ASP cytonemes contact the source cells. We also showed that the cytonemes from the ASP that contacted the source received significantly more signal than the ones that did not contact the source. These experiments, along with previous results published in Roy et al., 2014, provide clear evidence that Bnl exchange is contact-dependent.</p><p>For comments 1) and 2): the focus of our study was to characterize the mechanisms for formation of the shapes of the Bnl morphogen gradient, which is recipient tissue-specific, dynamic and adaptive. Our source and recipient membrane-marked images showed that the ASP cytonemes directly contact the source cell surface and exchange the signal. We could not visualize the source cytonemes under the imaging conditions we used. Therefore, we did not perform the experiments involving removal of the source cytonemes. We would like to investigate the possibility of source cytonemes and their roles in the future. We added a discussion on cytoneme-mediated signaling mechanisms.</p><p>Although we did not perform this experiment, all our experiments suggest that signaling through a gradient of number of cytonemes across the recipient ASP epithelium and their spatial regulation by two counteracting feedback of Bnl signaling generate recipient tissue-specific shapes of the morphogen gradient. In this study, we identified only a small set of molecules and events that might regulate these core feedback processes. We anticipate additional unknown cellular and molecular events that feed into the central feedback loops. Unknown mechanisms might be involved in guiding the recipient cytonemes to find the target and establish contact with the source, assisting in signal exchange and transport via motor proteins, or endocytosing/exocytosing the signal. An example of such cellular and molecular event could be the source cytonemes, which might deliver Bnl to the recipient cytonemes. According to this hypothesis, a mechanism of cytoneme-mediated signal delivery directly to the recipient cytonemes would contribute to the levels of Bnl in recipient ASP cells, and thereby to the feedback processes inducing/suppressing cytoneme formation and signal uptake. A loss of source cytonemes would jeopardize the whole feedback response mechanism that creates the gradient, and is expected to yield an effect similar to the <italic>bnl</italic> knockdown experiment, leading to a simultaneous loss of both the ASP-specific gradient and the ASP development (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B-C). We would like to test this possibility in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In general, presentation of figures needs a more logical arrangement to help with their interpretation.

To detect Bnl:GFP molecules, we imaged Bnl:GFP distribution using various technologies such as super-resolution imaging as well as detergent-free immunostaining (EIF) to identify the population of post-secretion Bnl:GFP. Using standard confocal imaging in combination with the EIF assay, we found that a large amount of Bnl:GFP is localized on the surface of the ASP and on the ASP cytonemes. However, the externalized molecules present on the cytonemes were hard to detect only with GFP fluorescence due to the low levels of the fluorescence emitted from endogenous signal. With a high-gain super-resolution imaging we overcame this technical challenge.
