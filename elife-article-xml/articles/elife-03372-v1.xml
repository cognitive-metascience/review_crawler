functions, including cell division, intracellular transport, and brain development. The dynein regulator Lis1 is known to keep dynein bound to microtubules; however, how this is accomplished mechanistically remains unknown. We have used three-dimensional electron microscopy, single-molecule imaging, biochemistry, and in vivo assays to help establish this mechanism. The three-dimensional structure of the dynein–Lis1 complex shows that binding of Lis1 to dynein's AAA+ ring sterically prevents dynein's main mechanical element, the ‘linker’, from completing its normal conformational cycle. Single-molecule experiments show that eliminating this block by shortening the linker to a point where it can physically bypass Lis1 renders single dynein motors insensitive to regulation by Lis1. Our data reveal that Lis1 keeps dynein in a persistent microtubule-bound state by directly blocking the progression of its mechanochemical cycle.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03372.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03372.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03372.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells use motor proteins to move ‘cargo’ from one location to another inside the cell. This cargo can range in size from a single macromolecule to something as large as the nucleus of the cell. A motor protein called dynein is the largest and least understood of the motor proteins found in cells.</p><p>Dynein molecules work in pairs to take ‘steps’ along tracks called microtubules. Dynein contains two domains: a motor domain, which is responsible for generating movement, and a ‘tail’ domain to which the cargo is attached. The motor domain is composed of a ring-like shape and two appendages—the stalk and the linker. The linker undergoes large-scale movements relative to the ring that transmits force to the tail domain.</p><p>Dynein also interacts with various accessory proteins to do its job inside the cell. One of these is a protein called Lis1 that is found across a wide range of species from yeast to humans. Defects in the gene for Lis1 result in brain developmental disorders in humans. However, it is not clear how the Lis1 protein influences the activity of dynein.</p><p>Now Toropova, Zou et al. have visualized the structure of dynein bound to Lis1 and compared it with the structure of dynein on its own in order to work out if dynein changes its shape as a result of binding to Lis1. These experiments show that when Lis1 binds to dynein, it physically blocks the linker, preventing it from making contacts with the ring-like shape that are important for the normal function of the motor.</p><p>To test the idea that this physical block is responsible for dynein molecules spending a relatively long time attached to their microtubules, Toropova, Zou et al. shortened the linker to a point where the Lis1 protein could no longer block it: this resulted in a dynein motor that was no longer sensitive to Lis1. A challenge for the future is to understand, at a molecular level, how the Lis1-mediated slowing down of dynein affects the multiple functions the motor carries out in a cell.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03372.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03372.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>Lis1</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Charles A.

The N-terminal region of each monomer forms the ‘tail’ domain, which mediates dimerization and cargo attachment via adaptor proteins. Removal of the tail yields the ‘motor’, the minimal portion of dynein that can exert force. At the core of the motor are six AAA+ modules (AAA1–6) that fold into a ring. AAA1 is the main site of ATP hydrolysis for motility but AAA2, 3, and 4 can also bind ATP, and AAA3 and 4 can hydrolyze it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibbons et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kon et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>).

We and others have shown that Lis1 induces a slow-moving microtubule-attached state in dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Torisawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, Lis1 can accomplish this without substantially affecting dynein's overall ATP hydrolysis rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). This led us to propose that Lis1 acts as a ‘clutch’, uncoupling dynein's engine (AAA+ ring) from its track-binding region.</p><p>Our previous 2D EM data, which indicated that Lis1 binds in the vicinity of AAA3/4, raised at least two possibilities for how Lis1 can affect dynein's mechanochemistry. On the one hand, Lis1 may regulate dynein allosterically, influencing the structure or motions of AAA3 or AAA4 in the ring, and thus preventing the propagation of a signal for microtubule detachment to the stalk. Alternatively, because the linker domain lies close to AAA4 in certain nucleotide-states, Lis1 may regulate dynein sterically, affecting the linker's movement directly, and thus dynein's mechanochemistry. Establishing Lis1's mode of regulation is not possible without three-dimensional (3D) data, as it is not known if Lis1 binds on the same face of the AAA+ ring as the linker, as would be required for direct Lis1–linker interactions to occur. Moreover, it is not clear to what extent the Lis1 binding site encompasses AAA3, AAA4, or both of these modules. Thus, 3D structural information is critical to understanding the mechanistic basis of Lis1's regulation of dynein.</p><p>We set out to establish how Lis1 induces a persistent microtubule-bound state in dynein. We obtained the 3D structure of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> dynein bound to Lis1 to determine which elements of the motor Lis1 directly affects. Our structure revealed that Lis1 sterically prevents the linker from reaching its normal post-powerstroke locations on the ATP hydrolyzing ring that are involved in its conformational cycle. Structure-based mutagenesis also allowed us to identify residues in Lis1 responsible for binding to dynein. Single molecule analysis of a dynein motor with a shortened linker that can physically bypass Lis1 indicated that removing the steric block renders dynein insensitive to Lis1. Our combined data show that Lis1 directly blocks dynein's mechanochemical cycle, inducing a persistent microtubule-bound state, by acting on its linker domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of the dynein–Lis1 complex</title><p>In order to visualize the spatial relationship between Lis1 and dynein's multiple structural elements and to better understand the mechanism by which Lis1 regulates dynein, we used cryo-negative stain (cryo-NS) EM and single-particle image processing to obtain the 3D structure of the dynein–Lis1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Cryo-NS combines the structural preservation of vitrification with the high contrast provided by the negative stain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Carlo and Stark, 2010</xref>). We found this increased contrast to be instrumental to our ability to computationally sort the different conformations that co-existed in most of our samples. We also determined a 3D map of dynein alone, as a reference, to establish whether Lis1 alters dynein's structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We used a well-characterized monomeric dynein construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>) but chose to use dimeric rather than monomeric Lis1 for our reconstructions. We previously showed that while a Lis1 monomer is sufficient to slow down dynein, a much higher concentration of it is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>), presumably due to the high local concentration of the β-propeller in the context of a Lis1 dimer. Using a Lis1 dimer at much lower concentrations allowed us to minimize the background in our images.</p><p>Both dynein and Lis1 were expressed from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> at their genomic loci (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We imaged dynein–Lis1 and dynein alone in the absence of nucleotide and obtained structures at resolutions of 21 Å for the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) and of 15 Å for dynein alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).

First, a prominent donut-shaped density is resolved in contact with the dynein ring, adjacent to the stalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, brown arrowhead). This extra density matches the dimensions of a β-propeller, including the hole at its center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,G,H</xref>). We thus conclude that the density corresponds to Lis1. The second, and striking difference between the two maps is in dynein itself: Lis1 binds on the same face of the ring where dynein's linker domain is located and the linker is displaced by ∼44 Å in the dynein–Lis1 map relative to the dynein alone reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>One dynein ring binds one Lis1 β-propeller</title><p>Our previous 2D image analysis of the dynein–Lis1 complex did not allow us to determine whether their interaction involved one or both of Lis1's β-propellers or whether Lis1's N-terminal LisH dimerization domain was part of the interaction as well.

Consequently, the rest of Lis1 would be expected to adopt a wide range of positions relative to the dynein-bound propeller domain. In agreement with this, we did not resolve density beyond that of the single β-propeller in our dynein–Lis map. 2D image analysis of dynein–Lis1 complexes with either monomeric or dimeric Lis1 showed the same density and location for Lis1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>), further supporting a stoichiometry of one Lis1 propeller to one dynein motor domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Dissection of the dynein–Lis1 interface</title><p>Our structure of the dynein–Lis1 complex shows that the Lis1 β-propeller contacts dynein primarily at a surface-exposed helix at the junction of AAA3 and AAA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>), explaining why mutagenesis of four conserved, charged residues (KDEE) on this helix virtually abolished Lis1 binding and dynein regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>).

Consistent with this idea, the docked β-propeller showed a better qualitative fit and a slightly higher cross-correlation coefficient with our density map when the top face is placed at the dynein interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To test this docking orientation, we mutated highly conserved residues on the top face of the propeller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Our previous finding that the KDEE residues in dynein are critical for Lis1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>) suggested that interactions between Lis1 and dynein have an electrostatic component. We therefore targeted four positively charged residues on the top propeller face, as well as a surface tryptophan, all of which are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We mutated these residues to alanine, both singly and in combination.</p><p>We first used size-exclusion chromatography to test the ability of the Lis1 mutants to interact with a functional dimerized dynein construct (GST-dynein<sub>331kDa</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>).

These assays, where the motion of single, fluorescently labeled dynein molecules along microtubules is monitored over time, are more sensitive than size-exclusion chromatography for detecting dynein–Lis1 interactions. Therefore, we expected that some of the Lis1 mutants that did not co-migrate with dynein might still exhibit weak but measurable regulation of the motor. The Lis1<sup>5A</sup> mutant showed no reduction in dynein velocity, consistent with an inability to bind dynein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The Lis1<sup>R378A</sup> mutant, on the other hand, showed a slight reduction in dynein velocity compared to dynein alone, suggesting that its binding to the motor is compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the effect of the Lis1 mutations on dynein binding correlates with the ability of the Lis1 mutants to regulate dynein at the single-molecule level.</p><p>Lastly, we tested our model for the dynein–Lis1 complex by measuring the effect of disrupting the dynein–Lis1 interface in vivo. In yeast, spindle pole bodies (SPB) span the nuclear envelope and coordinate microtubule minus ends that emanate from its nuclear and cytoplasmic faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaspersen and Winey, 2004</xref>). Lis1 assists in concentrating dynein at the plus ends of cytoplasmic microtubules, from where dynein is offloaded to the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roberts et al., 2014</xref>). Cortically anchored dynein exerts a pulling force that results in displacements of the entire mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moore et al., 2009</xref>), giving rise to a brief series of oscillations across the bud neck. Deletion of dynein eliminates these oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yeh et al., 1995</xref>). We quantified the effect of the Lis1<sup>5A</sup> and Lis1<sup>R378A</sup> mutants on spindle movement in cells treated with hydroxyurea, which prolongs the period of oscillations, by tracking fluorescently labeled SPBs over the course of 20 min. We found that disruption of the dynein–Lis1 interface resulted in a decrease in the number of bud neck crossings to a level similar to that caused by the deletion of Lis1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results indicate that the dynein–Lis1 interface identified in our structural model is crucial for dynein's biological function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Lis1 sterically blocks the position adopted by the linker under ADP and no nucleotide conditions but does not prevent it from reaching the pre-powerstroke position at AAA2</title><p>The end of the linker domain is displaced ∼44 Å in the dynein–Lis1 structure relative to the dynein alone map, mainly along the plane of the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).

This is consistent with a model where Lis1 regulates dynein motility through a steric mechanism, by physically blocking the linker's normal position in the no nucleotide state.</p><p>We next sought to test if Lis1 sterically blocks the linker in other nucleotide states. As the main mechanical element of dynein, the linker is thought to adopt at least two additional conformations during the ATPase cycle. In the presence of ATP (or ATP plus V<sub>i</sub>, which leads to the formation of the transition state analog ADP.V<sub>i</sub>), the linker is displaced across the ring to a position near AAA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roberts et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2012</xref>) (the ‘pre-powerstroke’ position). In the presence of ADP the linker lies over AAA4 in the crystal structure of the <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kon et al., 2012</xref>), a ‘post-powerstroke’ position slightly different from that seen in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> dynein crystal structure in the absence of nucleotide, where the linker is docked onto AAA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). However, since dynein from the same species had not been visualized in both the no nucleotide and ADP states, and because different constructs were used in the studies cited above, it was uncertain whether the AAA4 and AAA5 linker positions corresponded to distinct mechanochemical states or were due to differences between dynein species and/or constructs.</p><p>To address this, we first obtained the structure of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> dynein alone in the presence of ADP. Conformational sorting revealed that the linker adopts two positions in this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). One is over AAA4, coinciding with that observed in the <italic>D. discoideum</italic> crystal structure. The other is the AAA5-docked position seen in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> dynein with no nucleotide. The AAA4 position was seen only in the presence of ADP and was not detectable in no nucleotide conditions. These results suggest that the linker docks at AAA5 in the absence of nucleotide but can coexist in the AAA4- and AAA5-interacting states in the presence of ADP. Importantly, both the AAA4 linker position in the ADP state and the AAA5 position in the no nucleotide state are sterically incompatible with the presence of Lis1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, we conclude that binding of Lis1 to the dynein ring results in a displaced linker, away from its normal docking sites under both no nucleotide and ADP conditions.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03372.014</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Lis1 sterically blocks the linker domain's normal position on dynein's ring in ADP and no nucleotide conditions but does not prevent it from reaching the pre-powerstroke position at AAA2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cryo-NS maps of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> dynein in 100 μM ADP displaying the linker next to either AAA5 (left) or AAA4 (right).

This dynein construct (GFP-dynein<sub>FRET/A2</sub>) slides microtubules robustly, with gliding rates ∼90% of wild-type dynein (GFP-dynein<sub>331kDa</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), showing that the tags are compatible with motor function. Under no nucleotide conditions, and in the absence of Lis1, this construct showed a low FRET efficiency (∼2%), as expected when the linker is docked at AAA5 (post-powerstroke position) and the FRET donor and acceptor are far apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In the presence of ATP and vanadate (V<sub>i</sub>), which trap dynein as an ADP.V<sub>i</sub>-bound complex after hydrolysis, FRET increased to ∼26% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Under these conditions, the linker is biased towards the pre-powerstroke position at AAA2 and the fluorophores lie closer together. When Lis1 was added to ADP.V<sub>i</sub>–dynein, there was no significant change in the FRET efficiency relative to ADP.V<sub>i</sub>–dynein alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). When dynein was incubated with Lis1 before adding ATP and V<sub>i</sub>, the FRET efficiency decreased somewhat but remained close to that observed for ADP.V<sub>i</sub>–dynein alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results suggest that Lis1 does not affect the linker pre-powerstroke AAA2 position (ATP + V<sub>i</sub> added before Lis1) and has only a minor effect on linkers undergoing the AAA5 to AAA2 transition (Lis1 added before ATP + V<sub>i</sub>).</p><p>As a second method to determine if Lis1 affects the linker's ability to reach the AAA2 position under ADP.V<sub>i</sub> conditions, we determined the EM structure of the ADP.V<sub>i</sub>–dynein–Lis1 complex (Lis1 added before ATP + V<sub>i</sub>). We could resolve the linker in the expected pre-powerstroke position towards AAA2 and the density for the Lis1 β-propeller at the AAA3/4 junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). In summary, these results indicate that the presence of Lis1 does not interfere with linker movement towards its pre-powerstroke position at AAA2. In contrast, Lis1 occludes the linker binding sites at its two post-powerstroke positions (AAA4 and AAA5).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ATP turnover in the presence of Lis1 requires a hydrolysis-competent AAA1 and a functional AAA5 linker-docking site</title><p>We and others have shown that Lis1 reduces dynein's velocity without significantly affecting the motor's overall ATPase rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>).

We also tested whether shortening the linker affects the microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity of dynein monomers. Monomers with a short linker showed ATPase levels comparable to those seen with a full-length linker, both in the context of a wild-type set of AAA+ modules and in the linker docking-deficient AAA5 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As a monomer, the short linker construct can bind Lis1 as shown both by their co-migration in size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and by our ability to obtain a 3D reconstruction of the short linker dynein–Lis1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Central to our testing the steric block hypothesis, our 3D structure of the short linker dynein–Lis1 complex shows the same conformation for the linker in the presence of Lis1 as we had observed for the full-length linker in the absence of Lis1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Therefore, the short linker is functional and able to physically bypass Lis1.</p><p>To directly test whether Lis1 was capable of regulating dynein with a short linker, we used a single-molecule microtubule release assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In this study, the duration of single monomeric dynein's attachments to microtubules can be measured by kymograph analysis in a flow chamber by TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Addition of ATP triggers a low-affinity state in dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Imamula et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>) and the dynein monomers release from microtubules, resulting in a loss of fluorescence signal. Microtubule rebinding events are short lived, likely corresponding to single turnovers of ATP. In the presence of a full-length linker, Lis1 converted dynein to a state of persistent microtubule attachment and dynein monomers stayed bound in the presence of ATP for extended periods as previously shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Strikingly, shortening of dynein's linker eliminated Lis1's ability to induce this persistent microtubule-bound state. We quantified the durations of microtubule attachments after the addition of ATP and found the same short-lived attachments seen with dynein in the absence of Lis1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>). Thus, Lis1 is not capable of regulating microtubule attachment in the short linker construct. These data support a steric mode of dynein regulation where Lis1 physically blocks the linker.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We previously described Lis1 as a ‘clutch’ for dynein, based on its ability to uncouple the cycles of ATP hydrolysis, which take place in the motor domain, from the cycles of microtubule binding and release at the microtubule binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). One of the functional consequences of the dynein–Lis1 interaction is that Lis1 keeps dynein in a persistent microtubule-bound state. In this study, we have determined six 3D EM structures of dynein and dynein–Lis1 in different nucleotide states. By combining these structures with single molecule motility experiments, we have established that Lis1 regulates dynein's microtubule attachment by sterically blocking its linker domain.</p><p>Together, our data suggest the following model of dynein regulation by Lis1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In the current view of dynein's mechanochemical cycle, the motor domain encounters the microtubule with ADP.P<sub>i</sub> bound at AAA1, with the linker in a pre-powerstroke position at AAA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roberts et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2012</xref>). Strong microtubule binding stimulates P<sub>i</sub> release, inducing the linker to swing to AAA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kon et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, linker docking at AAA5 is thought to promote the release of ADP from AAA1, resetting the mechanochemical cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). Our data suggest that when Lis1 is present, the linker retains its ability to adopt the pre-powerstroke AAA2 position but is prevented from reaching its normal post-powerstroke positions at AAA4 and AAA5 on dynein's ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This blocking of the linker by Lis1 is critical for motility regulation; its removal by shortening dynein's linker renders the motor Lis1 insensitive.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03372.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for the regulation of dynein by Lis1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>G</bold>) Current view of dynein's mechanochemical cycle.

One possibility suggested by our structures is that Lis1 disrupts the interaction between the linker and AAA5, preventing normal progression through the mechanochemical cycle. Consistent with this notion, when linker docking at AAA5 is abolished by mutagenesis, dynein displays reduced velocity and prolonged microtubule attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>), reminiscent of Lis1's effects. However, while Lis1 has little effect on dynein's ATPase, AAA5 linker docking mutants display severely reduced ATPase rates, both in the absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>) and the presence of Lis1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Given these results, it is not clear at this point what the mechanistic basis is for dynein's continuing ATPase in the presence of Lis1. On the one hand, it is possible that the AAA5 mutations may, in addition to preventing linker docking, disrupt dynein's mechanochemical cycle and thus also prevent ATP hydrolysis. A method to reversibly block linker docking at AAA5 (e.g., via a small molecule) would be required to determine if AAA5 docking is truly required for dynein ATPase activity. On the other hand, Lis1 may uncouple ATP hydrolysis from linker docking at AAA5 through an allosteric effect on the ring. In this scenario, the linker–AAA5 interaction, which is blocked by Lis1, would be required for the conformational changes that ultimately shift dynein's microtubule-binding domain to its low-affinity state, but not for dynein's continuing ATPase activity. Higher resolution structures of the dynein–Lis1 complex will be required to establish whether Lis1 has an effect on the structure of dynein's ring.</p><p>It is conceivable that blocking of the normal linker-docking sites by Lis1 might induce a new interaction between the linker and the AAA+ ring. Similarly, Lis1 may interact specifically with the linker itself. Either (or both) of these scenarios could in turn be responsible for preventing microtubule release. However, current evidence does not favor these possibilities. Low sequence conservation in the portion of the linker facing Lis1 argues against a specific Lis1–linker interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Likewise, a specific interaction between a Lis1-displaced linker and dynein's ring is not supported by the apparent conformational heterogeneity of the N-terminus of the linker in the presence of Lis1, where 3D sorting is required to resolve linker positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>). Also mutating five amino acids on AAA4, proximal to the linker's displaced position (the most likely candidates to interact with the displaced linker), had minimal effect on Lis1-mediated motility regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A direct test of whether specific interactions exist among these different elements will also require a higher resolution structure, where the rotational orientation of the Lis1 homology model within its density in the EM map is unequivocal and specific interactions between the linker and Lis1 as well as the linker and the dynein ring can be distinguished from physical proximity.</p><p>In conclusion, our data show that Lis1, a conserved dynein regulator, directly disrupts dynein's mechanochemical cycle by physically blocking conformations that are required to couple the cycles of ATP hydrolysis taking place in the motor domain from those of track binding and release happening at the microtubule binding domain. This allows Lis1 to keep dynein in a persistent microtubule-bound state. This modulation of dynein's interaction with its microtubule track likely contributes to dynein's ability to carry out the variety of cellular functions it performs in different organisms, given the conservation of the amino acids at the dynein–Lis1 interface. For example, Lis1 is involved in initiation of cargo transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lenz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moughamian et al., 2013</xref>), in transport of high load cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>), and in targeting dynein molecules to the cell cortex via the microtubule plus end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roberts et al., 2014</xref>). The displaced linker observed in the presence of Lis1 in our 3D dynein–Lis1 reconstruction may contribute to this latter task, generating an ‘unmasked’ tail domain that has been shown necessary for cortical dynein localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Markus and Lee, 2011</xref>). In the case of the mammalian proteins, dynein and Lis1 were previously shown to form a stable complex only in ATP and V<sub>i</sub> conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>). Our 3D reconstruction of dynein–Lis1 under those conditions suggests that this might be a consequence of the linker's moving to its pre-powerstroke site at AAA2, where the linker and Lis1 are no longer sterically incompatible.</p><p>The work presented here has helped dissect the molecular mechanism by which Lis1 regulates a single dynein motor domain. The next challenge will be to understand the interactions between Lis1 and dynein dimers and of those with other regulatory factors. Future structural studies with full-length dimeric dynein–Lis1–Nudel complexes, free and bound to microtubules, will be required to answer these exciting questions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strain construction</title><p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

Prior attempts at getting dynein reproducibly in open holes for standard cryo-EM were unsuccessful. Furthermore, cryo-EM on continuous carbon gave micrographs where individual dynein particles were difficult to see above the noise. The high reproducibility we were able to achieve with cryo-NS allowed us to sample a much greater range of constructs/nucleotide conditions in the same time frame than we would otherwise have been able to do in unstained, unsupported conditions. Most importantly, the improved contrast was instrumental in allowing us to sort the different dynein conformations that were present in most of our data sets. 4 μl of monomeric dynein (80–120 nM), or monomeric dynein pre-incubated for 10 min with Lis1 dimer at a 1.5-fold excess (120–180 nM), was applied to a glow discharged, continuous carbon coated, C-flat EM grids (Protochips, Raleigh, NC). Dynein samples stated to be prepared in no nucleotide conditions were treated with apyrase (0.14 U/ml) for 15 min prior to grid application to hydrolyze residual ADP left over from the dynein purification procedure. Dynein samples stated to be prepared in ADP and ATP + V<sub>i</sub> conditions contained 100 μM ADP and 500 μM Mg-ATP/NaVO<sub>4</sub>, respectively. For the latter, nucleotide was added after the dynein–Lis1 pre-incubation step. Once applied to the grid, the samples were stained with 2% uranyl formate by floating the grid sample face down on a pool of stain. Samples were then sandwiched with a thin layer of freshly evaporated carbon, and grids were lightly blotted from the non-sample containing side and plunged into liquid nitrogen. Grids were then stored at liquid nitrogen temperatures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>EM data collection</title><p>Samples were imaged at liquid nitrogen temperatures using a Gatan 626 cryo holder (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA) on a Tecnai F20 TEM microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR), operating at 120 kV, equipped with a US4000 4k × 4k CCD camera (Gatan).

Although the resolutions of the reconstructions are moderate (in the 15-20Å range), the resolvable structural details were more than adequate to identify the key interactions that were involved in Lis1 regulation of dynein.</p><p>This group had a breakthrough paper in 2012, determining the Lis1-binding domain on the dynein motor domain, and using elegant single molecule studies to develop a clutch model for Lis1-mediated regulation of dynein motility. This work is a logical follow-up, with 3-D structures that support their previous binding data, and a clever short-linker mutant to test their more refined steric-blocking model.</p><p>Comparing the structure of the dynein head in the absence and presence of Lis1, the authors noticed that Lis1 binding induces a significant displacement of the dynein linker arm, a critical component of the mechanochemical cycle. Based on this finding, the authors carried out a series of well-designed biochemical and biophysical experiments to probe the mechanical relationship between bound Lis1 and the linker arm. By docking in previously determined atomic coordinates, the resulting pseudo-atomic models served as a framework for the mutagenesis and FRET experiments, which provided insight into the relationship between Lis1, nucleotide state, and the linker arm position. Truncation of the linker arm, single molecule motility experiments, and in vivo assays were performed to confirm the author's model for Lis1 regulation. Ultimately, the authors conclude that Lis1 serves as a molecular barricade, sterically preventing ATP hydrolysis from being converted into the conformational rearrangements that weaken microtubule binding.</p><p>Some of the important insights into how Lis1 works that emerge from this work are as follows:</p><p>1) That Lis1 occludes to normal position of the dynein linker in the ADP and nucleotide free (APO) conformations of dynein. In the presence of Lis1, the linker is deflected from its normal position. This EM work also provides a nice confirmation that the two conformations observed in yeast(APO) vs Dictyostellium(ADP) crystal structures can both exist in one (yeast) dynein.</p><p>2) That the motor can still enter the pre-powerstroke conformation when Lis-1 is bound. This was demonstrated by both an EM structure in the presence of ATP.vanadate and a FRET assay.</p><p>3) That the ability of Lis-1 to block release of dynein from microtubules is abolished when the linker is shortened (from the 331kD to 314kD construct). This shows that the N-terminal part of the linker is required for Lis1 function.</p><p>The EM work is expertly done, particularly in exploring the conformational variability that exists within a set of particles. The dynein motor is relatively small for detailed structural analyses by EM, and the authors' ability to distinguish between conformational subtleties in the motor arm is an impressive example of their expertise.</p><p>In general, the consensus among the reviewers is that this work is an important step forward in understanding dynein motor regulation, and provides a direct view of the conformational rearrangements that are necessary for dynein movement along the microtubule surface. The reviewers have, however, raised a number of points that you should address in preparing a revised manuscript.</p><p>1) There is some concern that much of this work follows directly from the outstanding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al. 2012</xref> paper published by this group. In this paper, the authors further refine the model developed there, and while the three-dimensional structure adds knowledge, it is limited in detail because the docking of Lis1 is not fully resolved in terms of rotational alignment. The couple of new mutants examined here could also have been predicted based on the previous structure.</p><p>The most novel idea here is that the binding of Lis1 provides a steric block to the linker swing. This is tested with a single construct with a truncated linker, and the results support their model. But there is concern that this is a single approach; the paper would have more impact if the authors could demonstrate this key point in a complementary way. The reviewers recognize that this might be a tall order, but it would be good if the authors could respond to this issue.</p><p>2) The authors interpret their data with a model in which the linker needs to get to AAA5 in order for the cycle of ATP hydrolysis to continue and so blocking access to AAA5 prevents ATP binding and therefore release from microtubules (which is thought to occur on ATP hydrolysis). The problem with this model, as the authors discuss, is that it would predict that Lis1 would inhibit the dynein ATPase. The data, however, are clear that this is not the case. It is suggested that the authors reduce the emphasis on the model that Lis1 blocks the linker from getting to AAA5. Instead the data could be presented and then this discussed as an option.</p><p>More specific points to consider:</p><p>Specific issues raised by the reviewers are given below. The authors should use their judgement in how to respond to these points, but if they choose to not address any particular issue they should explain their reasons in the cover letter accompanying the resubmitted manuscript.</p><p>1) The authors employed cryo-negative staining for their EM analysis. This involved and tedious technique is not commonly used by EM labs, as it is difficult to master. Surely the authors had a reason to employ this technique; a sentence or two explaining their rationale would be of interest to other structural labs interested in studying similarly sized macromolecular complexes.</p><p>2) A final summarizing cartoon outlining the relationship of Lis1 to the mechanochemical cycle of the dynein motor, and how it translates to MT affinity would strengthen the impact of this manuscript.</p><p>3) No mention is made of deposition of the 5 EM densities to the EMDB. It is important that these are made available to the community.</p><p>4) The authors state in their Abstract that how Lis1 regulates dynein is unknown, but in light of their previous work as well as that of the Vallee lab, this is a clear over-statement. This continues on through the Introduction, where they underplay their previous work determining the binding interface of Lis1 on dynein. This should be revised.</p><p>5) The authors set up an either/or model that seems overly simplistic, and the terms ring-centric and linker-centric are clunky and not very clear.</p><p>6) The authors report that their dynein alone map “accommodates the crystal structure of the dynein motor domain well”. While there is an overall match, there are also clearly discrepancies between the structures. How was the fit assessed quantitatively? Can anything be learned from the discrepancies?</p><p>7) The authors report that the 3D structure allows them “to hone in on the region of dynein interacting with Lis1”, but other than the displacement of the linker, they do not go further with this approach. Are there any other changes? It would be good to discuss this, and the Lis1-dynein interface in more detail.</p><p>8) It is unclear what new is learned from the section on “one dynein ring binds one Lis1 beta-propeller” Isn't this what they studied in their previous paper?</p><p>9) Did they intend to reference Carragher et al?</p><p>10) Vanadate is not so much a phosphate analog as a transition state analog. Similarly, calling the ADP-V complex a “dead-end” is awkward and imprecise terminology.</p><p>11) The authors suggest that the differences in AAA4 and AAA5 linker positions previously noted might correspond to either distinct mechanochemical states or different dynein species. But isn't it also possible that they may result from different constructs used in the different studies, some of which were truncated or chimeric?</p><p>12) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> would be stronger if the authors included parallel studies with the W419A mutant and provided more complete analysis of the motility data. Based on what is shown here, the R378A mutant effectively blocks formation of the dynein-Lis1 complex as judged by gel filtration, but only partially blocks the effects of Lis1 on dynein motility. Shoring up this point with an additional single point mutation would strengthen the point.</p><p>13) The authors report that two structures are seen in the presence of ADP and one in the presence of no nucleotide, so they conclude that the AAA4 linker position is the ADP state. This may be true, but kinetic analysis has indicated that there is isomerization between 2 ADP-bound states, so it is also possible that the two observed structures correspond to different ADP-bound states. Both should be shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>. Didn't the authors perform FRET analysis of the dynein-Lis1 complex alone? How come this is not included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>?</p><p>14) The authors report the ADP-V-dynein-Lis1 complex. Wouldn't it be useful to directly compare this to the ADP-V-dynein complex?</p><p>15) The experiments described in the text and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> yield results that are predictable. Three papers, including work from this same group, have already shown that Lis1 does not significantly affect dynein's ATPase rate, so it is unclear what new is learned from this work. It could all be removed from the text, or at least moved to supplemental information. If it does remain, experiments need to be performed in triplicate, and error bars should be reported for all points.</p><p>16) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, for the short linker construct, why are there fewer events, including fewer rebinding events? Does this construct have a weaker affinity for microtubules? If it does, how might this affect the interpretation of the results?</p><p>17) Use of dimeric Lis1. It is not clear how an avidity effect would explain how dimeric Lis1 would bind more tightly to monomeric dynein than monomeric Lis1. The avidity effect should require two binding sites for Lis1. In Huang et al there does not seem to be a direct demonstration that dimeric Lis1 binds monomeric dynein better than monomeric Lis1. Please clarify.</p><p>18) If the Lis1 purely displaces the linker by a steric mechanism, would the authors not expect to see the linker closely connected to Lis1? Instead <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> suggests that the linker is making a tight connection to the AAA+ ring. Should this connection be discussed? Might it suggest that Lis1 has some allosteric effect on the AAA+ ring which, together with sterically blocking its normal position, allows the linker to dock onto the ring? Alternatively is the resolution too low to say this?</p><p>19) The authors try to draw the parallel between mutations in AAA5 and the effect of Lis1. The reviewer's reading of the data is that these two effects are different as the first abolishes ATPase activity, while the second has no effect on it.</p><p>20) One section states that the lack of conservation in the very N-terminus of the linker suggests it does not interact directly with Lis1 (which seems reasonable) and therefore that the Lis1 is acting as a steric block. The contact between the linker and the AAA+ ring in the Lis1:APO-Dynein structure appears to involve a more conserved part of the ring. This comes back to the question about whether Lis1 is acting on the AAA+ ring to allow the linker to bind to a place it normally would not.</p><p>21) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>. The blue color is difficult to distinguish from the black in the gel filtration trace.</p><p>22) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>/g. This EM map looks as though the contacts between the AAA+ ring and the Lis1 are different from in the Apo form. This may just be the different resolution of the structure, but it might be useful to discuss this somewhere.</p><p>23) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. It would be helpful if the type of mutation made was specified on this figure. b &amp; c are E-Q mutations (residue number?). d) AAA5 mutant is not in the ATP binding site, but on the linker binding site. Specifying this on the figure (&amp; res numbers?) would be helpful.</p><p>24) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>. These figures show release from microtubules is blocked by Lis1, but not if the linker is shortened. The shortening does not affect the motors activity or ability to bind Lis1. Did the authors test if the velocity of the shorter linker was affected by Lis1?</p><p>25) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> d ii: The cartoon uses the stop sign, which suggests it has a mutation in AAA5 (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Is this true? If not then another symbol might be more appropriate.</p><p>26) <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>:</p><p>The units of Km, kbasal and kcat should be given.</p><p>One of the reviewers has the following thought which they would like to share with you:</p><p>Another mechanism that could be mentioned in the Discussion is that Lis1 has an allosteric effect on the AAA+ ring that allows the linker to move and the AAA1 site to exchange nucleotide without triggering the conformational change in the stalk that releases dynein from microtubules. This model is also not completely satisfactory as it is harder to explain the requirement for the N-terminus of the linker.</p><p>Perhaps one (explanation would be that the transition from high to low affinity is most likely to occur before the linker moves from a post to pre-powerstroke position. That is, ATP binds to a high affinity, post-powerstroke dynein. A rearrangement occurs that leads to a low affinity, post-powerstroke dynein (that releases from MTs). This is followed by a transition to the ADP.Vi like state with a low affinity, pre-powerstroke conformation. The ATP bound, post-powerstroke, low affinity conformation could be altered so that it no longer releases from microtubules by a combination of Lis1 AND linker binding to the AAA+ ring.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03372.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) There is some concern that much of this work follows directly from the outstanding</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23"><italic>Huang et al. 2012</italic></xref> <italic>paper published by this group.

The reviewers recognize that this might be a tall order, but it would be good if the authors could respond to this issue</italic>.</p><p>To further test the steric block model of Lis1 regulation of dynein we chose to explore if the specific sequence of the N-terminal portion of the linker (the part that is removed in the short linker dynein) is important for Lis1 regulation of dynein (as opposed to its simply being a linker-like protein mass that can be blocked). We chose two different sequences to add back to the short linker dynein to restore the wild type linker length: (1) The sequence from <italic>S. pombe</italic>, which appears to lack a Lis1 homolog; and (2) The sequence from an axonemal dynein from <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> (dynein-c), which does not bind axonemal Lis1. Our goal was to then use single-molecule microtubule binding/release assays on these chimeric dyneins, alone and in the presence of Lis1, to test if Lis1 regulation was restored. Unfortunately, the chimeric axonemal dynein failed to express. The chimeric <italic>S. pombe</italic> dynein did not express well, either, but we were able to purify amounts that were sufficient for single-molecule studies. However, this chimeric dynein showed a disrupted mechanochemical cycle: it was unable to release from microtubules in the presence of ATP even in the absence of Lis1. We agree that additional evidence for the steric block hypothesis would have strengthened our model; unfortunately, given the results described above, this does seem to be too tall an order to be accomplished in a reasonable time frame.</p><p><italic>2) The authors interpret their data with a model in which the linker needs to get to AAA5 in order for the cycle of ATP hydrolysis to continue and so blocking access to AAA5 prevents ATP binding and therefore release from microtubules (which is thought to occur on ATP hydrolysis).

It is suggested that the authors reduce the emphasis on the model that Lis1 blocks the linker from getting to AAA5. Instead the data could be presented and then this discussed as an option</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this suggestion and have made the appropriate changes in the last Results section and the Discussion.</p><p><italic>More specific points to consider:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors employed cryo-negative staining for their EM analysis. This involved and tedious technique is not commonly used by EM labs, as it is difficult to master. Surely the authors had a reason to employ this technique; a sentence or two explaining their rationale would be of interest to other structural labs interested in studying similarly sized macromolecular complexes</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion; we have added text to both the Results and Methods sections to explain our choice.</p><p><italic>2) A final summarizing cartoon outlining the relationship of Lis1 to the mechanochemical cycle of the dynein motor, and how it translates to MT affinity would strengthen the impact of this manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We have added a model figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) No mention is made of deposition of the 5 EM densities to the EMDB. It is important that these are made available to the community</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for accidentally not making our intent regarding EMDB submission clear. Final maps as well as raw half maps for each reconstruction have been deposited with the EMDB. This is now also stated in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) The authors state in their Abstract that how Lis1 regulates dynein is unknown, but in light of their previous work as well as that of the Vallee lab, this is a clear over-statement. This continues on through the Introduction, where they underplay their previous work determining the binding interface of Lis1 on dynein. This should be revised</italic>.</p><p>We’ve discussed this point extensively among us and feel we disagree with this assessment. What we state in our Abstract is that “The dynein regulator Lis1 is known to keep dynein bound to microtubules; however, how this is accomplished mechanistically remains unknown”. We feel this statement is correct; the key distinction here is between “what” Lis1 does (which we established in our 2012 paper), and “how” it does it (which we did not). Our Introduction summarizes how much is known, from both our and the Vallee lab’s work, about what Lis1 does to dynein. However, we feel there is a clear difference between what are ultimately descriptions of biochemical effects from a more detailed understanding of the mechanism behind them. While we have not yet answered all the questions in this regard, we think the work presented here has gone a long ways towards explaining the “how”.</p><p>Similarly, our previous work did not address the binding site on Lis1 for the dynein-Lis1 interaction but rather only residues in dynein. Some other important aspects of the dynein-Lis1 interface that were not addressed by our previous work include the face of the ring to which Lis1 binds (which would determine whether the linker might be directly affected), and which side of the Lis1 propeller interacted with dynein (even if sequence conservation had already made a strong argument for what we saw in our structure).</p><p><italic>5) The authors set up an either/or model that seems overly simplistic, and the terms ring-centric and linker-centric are clunky and not very clear</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for the comment. We now use “steric” and “allosteric” models, and do not present them as being mutually exclusive.</p><p><italic>6) The authors report that their dynein alone map “accommodates the crystal structure of the dynein motor domain well”. While there is an overall match, there are also clearly discrepancies between the structures. How was the fit assessed quantitatively? Can anything be learned from the discrepancies?</italic></p><p>We have carried out a Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) between the dynein alone map and the crystal structure of the dynein motor domain (PDB ID: 4AKG). We see an FSC of 0.143 at a resolution of 18.8 Å. We deposited an XML file of the FSC plot in the EMDB as a supplementary file to the dynein alone submission (EMDB-6013). This is briefly mentioned in Results and the deposition is noted in the Accession Numbers section in Materials and methods.</p><p>With regards to discrepancies between the EM map and the crystal structure in some regions, we felt a rigid body fit of the entire motor domain into the density was most appropriate at the resolution of our map. Although we are very interested in whether these differences exist and what they might be, we feel we do not yet have the resolution that would be required to fit individual AAA+ motifs in the density (and comment on that fit).</p><p><italic>7) The authors report that the 3D structure allows them “to hone in on the region of dynein interacting with Lis1”, but other than the displacement of the linker, they do not go further with this approach. Are there any other changes? It would be good to discuss this, and the Lis1-dynein interface in more detail</italic>.</p><p>The displacement of the linker is the most striking difference in the dynein-Lis1 map compared to that of dynein alone. We are also very curious to see whether there are further changes in dynein’s ring upon Lis1 binding and will pursue this in future work. However, we feel that at the current ∼21 Å resolution we cannot trust, and comment on, any changes less apparent than the displaced linker domain.</p><p>With respect to the Lis1-dynein interface, we were able to directly visualize that dynein contacts Lis1 via the AAA3-AAA4 connector helix. Unfortunately, as we state in the paper, we did not have the resolution to determine Lis1’s rotational fit in the density. We therefore feel that we cannot currently go further than the view of the interface we present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. We worry that any additional details might lead readers into assuming the interface is fully established.</p><p><italic>8) It is unclear what new is learned from the section on “one dynein ring binds one Lis1 beta-propeller” Isn't this what they studied in their previous paper?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this up, as we did not clearly highlight what was new in our current findings.</p><p>In our previous study, we used 2D classification of dimeric Lis1 in complex with a dimeric dynein. We observed extra density in a difference map that we could assign to Lis1 (thus establishing where on dynein Lis1 bound) but we couldn’t determine whether the density accommodated one or two propeller domains, or indeed any of the N-terminal domain of Lis1. It was not until we had the 3D map reported here that we could resolve the channel at the center of the propeller and thus were able to unambiguously show that a single propeller (and that domain alone) contacts the dynein motor domain.</p><p>We have modified this section of the Results to make the new findings stand out more clearly.</p><p><italic>9) Did they intend to reference Carragher et al?</italic></p><p>Thank you for spotting this error, we have replaced it with the correct reference.</p><p><italic>10) Vanadate is not so much a phosphate analog as a transition state analog. Similarly, calling the ADP-V complex a “dead-end” is awkward and imprecise terminology</italic>.</p><p>We now refer to ADP.Vi as a transition state analog and have removed the term “dead-end”. Thank you for these suggestions.</p><p><italic>11) The authors suggest that the differences in AAA4 and AAA5 linker positions previously noted might correspond to either distinct mechanochemical states or different dynein species. But isn't it also possible that they may result from different constructs used in the different studies, some of which were truncated or chimeric?</italic></p><p>Thank you for pointing this out; we have added this possibility to the text.</p><p><italic>12)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>would be stronger if the authors included parallel studies with the W419A mutant and provided more complete analysis of the motility data. Based on what is shown here, the R378A mutant effectively blocks formation of the dynein-Lis1 complex as judged by gel filtration, but only partially blocks the effects of Lis1 on dynein motility. Shoring up this point with an additional single point mutation would strengthen the point</italic>.</p><p>To give a more detailed account of the effects of the Lis1 mutants on dynein velocity we have added a histogram of velocity distributions for the motility experiments (new figure; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>). We have not added additional analysis of run length data because we have previously found that velocity analysis is the most sensitive measure of Lis1’s effect on dynein. Run length analysis provides little information; since Lis1 both slows dynein down and prolongs its microtubule encounters, which have opposing effects on run length, its addition results in little change in the average travel distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>].</p><p>With regards to the interpretation of the R378A mutant and analysis of mutant W419A, gel filtration is not a very sensitive measure of the dynein-Lis1 interaction; we would not expect a weak interaction to be detected in this assay. This is why we stated in the paper that “binding is severely weakened” for the R378A mutant rather than that this interaction does not exist (particularly given that the motility data still show that it does, albeit in a limited way). While doing the experiments with the W419A mutant suggested was feasible, these experiments would have been fairly time-consuming as the yeast strains needed for this analysis were not already available. Since we were not confident that the time investment would yield new information (given that this mutation is already encompassed in the Lis1<sup>5A</sup> quintuple mutant), we chose to invest our time in experiments that would test the major mechanistic hypothesis of the paper, as suggested in general point #1 (even if those experiments were unsuccessful in the end). We have reworded the manuscript to address the apparent discrepancy between the gel filtration and single-molecule assays for R378A, making it clear that the single-molecule assays are more sensitive in terms of detecting an interaction and that not seeing co-migration by gel filtration is not an indication of a complete abolishment of that interaction.</p><p><italic>13) The authors report that two structures are seen in the presence of ADP and one in the presence of no nucleotide, so they conclude that the AAA4 linker position is the ADP state. This may be true, but kinetic analysis has indicated that there is isomerization between 2 ADP-bound states, so it is also possible that the two observed structures correspond to different ADP-bound states. Both should be shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3a</italic></xref><italic>. Didn't the authors perform FRET analysis of the dynein-Lis1 complex alone? How come this is not included in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>?</italic></p><p>Thank you for pointing this out, we have added the AAA4 linker position structure and FRET analysis of dynein-Lis1 (no nucleotide conditions) to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>14) The authors report the ADP-V-dynein-Lis1 complex</italic>. <italic>Wouldn't it be useful to directly compare this to the ADP-V-dynein complex?</italic></p><p>We are indeed very curious to see the structure of ADP.Vi-dynein (in the absence of Lis1) and compare it to the one we reported for the complex (ADP.Vi-dynein-Lis1) but feel this is beyond the scope of the current paper. The goal of the ADP.Vi-dynein-Lis1 structure was simply to establish (visually, in this case) whether the linker domain could reach AAA2 in the presence of Lis1.</p><p><italic>15) The experiments described in the text and in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>yield results that are predictable. Three papers, including work from this same group, have already shown that Lis1 does not significantly affect dynein's ATPase rate, so it is unclear what new is learned from this work. It could all be removed from the text, or at least moved to supplemental information. If it does remain, experiments need to be performed in triplicate, and error bars should be reported for all points</italic>.</p><p>While it has indeed been shown before that Lis1 does not significantly affect dynein’s ATPase rate, no one had addressed the question of which AAA+ domain was responsible for the continued ATP turnover. In the work we report here we measured, for the first time, what happens to ATP hydrolysis in the presence of Lis1 when AAA1 or AAA4 are rendered hydrolysis deficient or AAA5 is linker-docking deficient. The experiments we present are therefore the first to probe which of dynein’s AAA+ domains are responsible for the observed nucleotide hydrolysis in the presence of Lis1 and, for that reason, we feel they belong in the main text.</p><p>Regarding the error bars, as the number of experiments was ≤ 3 (triplicate for experiments showing an activated ATPase rate, and duplicate for those that are ATPase deficient), we plotted each of these points separately. Error bars are not robust and can be misleading for such sample sizes [Krzywinski &amp; Altman (2013) Nature Methods 10, 921–922]. Plotting individual data points is recommended practice in this situation, as it explicitly shows the spread in the data.</p><p><italic>16) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>, for the short linker construct</italic>, <italic>why are there fewer events, including fewer rebinding events? Does this construct have a weaker affinity for microtubules? If it does, how might this affect the interpretation of the results?</italic></p><p>The full-length and short linker constructs appear to have a similar affinity for microtubules based on the similar concentration of microtubules required for half-maximal activation of their ATPase rates [K<sub>m</sub>(MT)] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The density of the full-length and short linker constructs on the microtubule in the release assays is also similar (0.289 ± 0.080 and 0.226 ± 0.081 dynein molecules per micrometer of microtubule, respectively). Small differences in density likely arise from different dilutions used. Regarding rebinding events, apart from cases where Lis1 triggers a clear persistent microtubule attachment state in dynein (i.e. full-length linker dynein with Lis1), comparative measurements are not very meaningful as rebinding events are in part dependent on the buffer flow rate through each flow chamber, which guides the rate of clearance of dynein molecules released from microtubules. This flow rate is manually driven via a syringe; so, it too can vary slightly between assays. Therefore, we do not base any of our conclusions on rebinding frequency. In summary, the data suggest that the short linker dynein has a similar microtubule affinity as the full-length linker dynein, and so our interpretations are not affected.</p><p><italic>17) Use of dimeric Lis1. It is not clear how an avidity effect would explain how dimeric Lis1 would bind more tightly to monomeric dynein than monomeric Lis1. The avidity effect should require two binding sites for Lis1. In Huang et al there does not seem to be a direct demonstration that dimeric Lis1 binds monomeric dynein better than monomeric Lis1. Please clarify</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity on this point. Previously we showed that a much greater concentration of monomeric Lis1 is needed to achieve the same effect on dynein motility observed with dimeric Lis1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>]. This is the reason why we chose to use dimeric Lis1 in our EM work: it allowed us to use a much lower concentration of it, keeping the background in the images low. We have changed the wording for this section in the Results to discuss this in terms of local Lis1 β-propeller concentration rather than avidity.</p><p><italic>18) If the Lis1 purely displaces the linker by a steric mechanism, would the authors not expect to see the linker closely connected to Lis1? Instead</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1e</italic></xref> <italic>suggests that the linker is making a tight connection to the AAA+ ring. Should this connection be discussed? Might it suggest that Lis1 has some allosteric effect on the AAA+ ring which, together with sterically blocking its normal position, allows the linker to dock onto the ring? Alternatively is the resolution too low to say this?</italic></p><p>It is indeed difficult at the resolution of the dynein-Lis1 map to discriminate between physical proximity to the AAA+ ring and a specific interaction. However, the fact that the linker is flexible in its position relative to the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>) we think argues against a tight interaction; in that case, we would have expected to be able to resolve the linker at AAA4 without having to use 3D sorting.</p><p>Despite this circumstantial evidence, we wanted to test a possible linker-AAA4 interaction directly. We mutated 5 residues on AAA4 that appear, based on our map, to be good candidates for a contact with the linker (new figure added; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>). While this mutant (where all 5 residues were changed to alanine) showed a statistically significant difference in the extent to which Lis1 reduced its velocity relative to wild type, the difference was small and the AAA4 mutant was still regulated by Lis1. Taken together, the EM analysis and mutagenesis data argue strongly against a specific interaction between the linker and AAA4.</p><p><italic>19) The authors try to draw the parallel between mutations in AAA5 and the effect of Lis1. The reviewer's reading of the data is that these two effects are different as the first abolishes ATPase activity, while the second has no effect on it</italic>.</p><p>While it is true that there is a difference in the ATPase activity between the two effects, there are also two similarities; a decrease in dynein velocity and a persistent attachment to the microtubule. We therefore feel that the comparison is useful in terms of trying to understand how Lis1 brings about a slow-moving, microtubule-attached dynein. However, we do agree that Lis1’s effect on the ATPase rate is still very much an open question, perhaps involving a secondary mechanism of allostery through the AAA+ ring. We have added new text to the Discussion to address this unresolved question.</p><p><italic>20) One section states that the lack of conservation in the very N-terminus of the linker suggests it does not interact directly with Lis1 (which seems reasonable) and therefore that the Lis1 is acting as a steric block. The contact between the linker and the AAA+ ring in the Lis1:APO-Dynein structure appears to involve a more conserved part of the ring. This comes back to the question about whether Lis1 is acting on the AAA+ ring to allow the linker to bind to a place it normally would not</italic>.</p><p>We have addressed this in point 18 above.</p><p><italic>21)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2c</italic></xref><italic>. The blue color is difficult to distinguish from the black in the gel filtration trace</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out.

This EM map looks as though the contacts between the AAA+ ring and the Lis1 are different from in the Apo form. This may just be the different resolution of the structure, but it might be useful to discuss this somewhere</italic>.</p><p>It is likely that the AAA+ ring undergoes structural rearrangements in the ATP.Vi state that could change the position of Lis1’s binding site. However, as we pointed out, the resolutions of the two structures (apo vs. ATP.Vi) are different; since the ATP.Vi map is the lowest resolution structure we present we do not feel confident about commenting on possible differences in the AAA+ ring and/or contacts with Lis1.</p><p><italic>23)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>. It would be helpful if the type of mutation made was specified on this figure. b &amp; c are E-Q mutations (residue number?). d) AAA5 mutant is not in the ATP binding site, but on the linker binding site. Specifying this on the figure (&amp; res numbers?) would be helpful</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion. All mutations and residue numbers were originally given in the figure legend because we felt that adding them directly to the figure itself would clutter it, particularly since the AAA5 linker-docking mutant is a triple mutation. In the current version we have modified the headings for each plot to make the mutation type clear without making reading the figure legend necessary.</p><p><italic>24)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1"><italic>Figure 5–figure supplement 1</italic></xref>. <italic>These figures show release from microtubules is blocked by Lis1, but not if the linker is shortened. The shortening does not affect the motors activity or ability to bind Lis1. Did the authors test if the velocity of the shorter linker was affected by Lis1?</italic></p><p>It is not possible to test the effect of Lis1 on velocity in the context of a monomer gliding assay because it is known that the short linker dynein monomer moves slowly in gliding assays ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), but moves with wild type speeds as a dimer in single-molecule assays ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The slow gliding by the short linker monomer is likely due to motor-glass interactions. Examining how Lis1 affects the velocity of dimeric short linker dynein is also problematic; once the short linker dynein is dimerized with GST its linker is no longer “short” (as it is extended by GST) and its ability to bypass Lis1 is now blocked by the dimerization.</p><p><italic>25)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>d ii: The cartoon uses the stop sign, which suggests it has a mutation in AAA5 (as in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>).

This model is also not completely satisfactory as it is harder to explain the requirement for the N-terminus of the linker</italic>.</p><p><italic>Perhaps one (explanation would be that the transition from high to low affinity is most likely to occur before the linker moves from a post to pre-powerstroke position. That is, ATP binds to a high affinity, post-powerstroke dynein. A rearrangement occurs that leads to a low affinity, post-powerstroke dynein (that releases from MTs). This is followed by a transition to the ADP.Vi like state with a low affinity, pre-powerstroke conformation. The ATP bound, post-powerstroke, low affinity conformation could be altered so that it no longer releases from microtubules by a combination of Lis1 AND linker binding to the AAA+ ring</italic>.</p><p>We agree that dynein is normally likely to detach from the microtubule before the linker moves to AAA2 (there is kinetic evidence that this is the case in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> dynein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Imamula et al., 2007</xref>]), and that the transition from the high-to-low microtubule affinity (before the linker has moved) is the most-likely transition to be regulated by Lis1. However, our short linker experiments do suggest that steric regulation via the linker is critical for this regulation (i.e. it cannot be purely allosteric).</p></body></sub-article></article>
