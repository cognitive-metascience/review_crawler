methylation is an essential epigenetic mark whose role in gene regulation and its dependency on genomic sequence and environment are not fully understood. In this study we provide novel insights into the mechanistic relationships between genetic variation, DNA methylation and transcriptome sequencing data in three different cell-types of the GenCord human population cohort. We find that the association between DNA methylation and gene expression variation among individuals are likely due to different mechanisms from those establishing methylation-expression patterns during differentiation. Furthermore, cell-type differential DNA methylation may delineate a platform in which local inter-individual changes may respond to or act in gene regulation. We show that unlike genetic regulatory variation, DNA methylation alone does not significantly drive allele specific expression. Finally, inferred mechanistic relationships using genetic variation as well as correlations with TF abundance reveal both a passive and active role of DNA methylation to regulatory interactions influencing gene expression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00523.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00523.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00523.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Variations occur throughout our genome. These variations can cause genes to be expressed (switched on) in slightly different ways among individuals. Moreover, the same gene can also be expressed in different ways in different cells within an individual. A third level of variation is supplied by epigenetic markers: these are molecules that bind to the DNA at specific points and can have profound effects on the expression of nearby genes. One such epigenetic marker is the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine base, a process that is known as DNA methylation.</p><p>DNA methylation usually happens when a cytosine base is next to a guanine base, forming a CpG site. In mammals, most CpG sites have methyl groups attached, although regions with a lot of CpG sites (called CpG islands) are mostly unmethylated. Initial studies suggested that methylation prevented particular genes from being expressed, but more recent work has indicated that methylation can be associated with both reduced and increased expression of genes. Moreover, it is not clear if this association is active (i.e., changes in methylation drive changes in gene expression) or passive (DNA methylation is the result of gene regulation).</p><p>Now, Gutierrez-Arcelus et al. have carried out a large-scale study to clarify the relationships between three different types of gene-related variations among individuals. They extracted fibroblasts, T-cells and lymphoblastoid cells from the umbilical cords of 204 babies, and analysed them for variations in DNA sequence, gene expression and DNA methylation. Their results show that the associations between the three are more complex than was previously thought.</p><p>Gutierrez-Arcelus et al. show that the mechanisms that control the association between the variations in DNA methylation and gene expression in individuals are likely to be different to those that are responsible for the establishment of methylation patterns during the process of cell differentiation. They also find that the association between DNA methylation and gene expression can be either active or passive, and can depend on the context in which they occur in our genome. Finally, where the two copies or alleles of a gene are not equally expressed in a given cell, the difference in expression is primarily regulated by DNA sequence variation, with DNA methylation having little or no role on its own. Equally complex interactions and effects are expected in further studies of genetic and epigenetic variation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00523.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00523.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>methylation</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>genome variation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antonarakis</surname><given-names>Stylianos E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dermitzakis</surname><given-names>Emmanouil T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antonarakis</surname><given-names>Stylianos E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dermitzakis</surname><given-names>Emmanouil T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Louis-Jeantet Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dermitzakis</surname><given-names>Emmanouil T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Blueprint</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antonarakis</surname><given-names>Stylianos E</given-names></name><name><surname>Dermitzakis</surname><given-names>Emmanouil T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Detailed analysis of umbilical cord cells shows that the associations between DNA methylation, gene expression and genetic variation are complex and context-dependent.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA methylation is an essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 1992</xref>) epigenetic mark whose role in gene regulation and its dependency on genomic sequence and environment is not yet fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schubeler, 2012</xref>). DNA methylation in vertebrates occurs most commonly in cytosines that are adjacent to guanines (CpG sites). Mammalian DNA methylation levels are generally high, although CpG rich regions, called CpG islands (CGI), appear mostly unmethylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bird, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lister et al., 2009</xref>). The mechanisms of de novo methylation and maintenance of methylation patterns are well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shoemaker et al., 2011</xref>), and alterations of these can cause severe diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robertson, 2005</xref>). Even though it was originally reported to be involved in gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holliday and Pugh, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Riggs, 1975</xref>), more recent studies have found that DNA methylation can also be positively correlated to gene transcription when found in gene bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hellman and Chess, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lister et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, its participation in gene expression is proving to be highly variable, ranging from marking alternative intra-genic promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maunakea et al., 2010</xref>), to being affected by transcription factors (TFs) at enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>) or it-self affecting the binding of TFs such as MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prendergast and Ziff, 1991</xref>). Hence, whether DNA methylation is a consequence of gene regulation, or whether it controls gene expression changesâthat is, whether it plays a passive or an active role in gene regulationâstill remains a topic of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schubeler, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, DNA methylation can be affected by environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaminsky et al., 2009</xref>) but it has also been proven that regions in the genome can autonomously determine DNA methylation states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lienert et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, studies looking at natural DNA methylation variation in human populations have shown that genetic variation influences DNA methylation levels in different cell-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gibbs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell et al., 2011</xref>), but the mechanisms by which this occurs are far from clear. In these and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kulis et al., 2012</xref>), the association between DNA methylation and gene expression in a population context, where the same gene and same methylation site can be compared across multiple individuals, has been reported to be both positive and negative. Overall, the nature of the relationships among genetic variants, DNA methylation and gene expression are still unclear despite some initial efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Eijk et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study we dissect the mechanistic relationships between inter-individual DNA methylation and gene expression variation using DNA sequence variability and TF abundance measured by RNA-Seq. By assaying in a high resolution and genome wide level these three layers of information in three different cell-types originating from the same set of individuals, we are able to study the role of DNA methylation variation in different dimensions. Our results reveal a picture where DNA methylation variable sites are mechanistically associated to gene expression in complex and context dependent ways that can be of passive or active nature. We further highlight some of the mechanisms by which passive DNA methylation may occur and how this role can interplay with genetic variation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Associations of genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression</title><p>We use the GenCord collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dimas et al., 2009</xref>) of umbilical cord samples from 204 newborn babies of central European descent, from which we derived three cell-types: fibroblasts (primary cells), T-cells (primary cells) and lymphoblastoid cells (immortalized cell lines, LCLs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The across individual methylation-gene expression associations (eQTMs) however appear to be either positive or negative, even for DNA methylation sites in promoter regions.

Hence, we asked whether differentially methylated sites across the three cell-types are more likely to be functionally relevant when variable within a population, hence more often associated to gene expression (eQTMs) or genetic variation (mQTLs) than non-differentiated sites across cell-types. We measured the level of differentiation for each site by calculating its median methylation level in each cell-type and then calculating the coefficient of variation between those three medians, which is a measure of variability that controls for the mean level of methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). We find that as differentiation per methylation site increases, a higher proportion of eQTMs and mQTLs are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This is statistically supported by the fact that the tissue differentiation level of methylation sites involved in eQTMs and mQTLs is significantly higher than for non-eQTM and non-mQTL sites, respectively (all p values&lt;2.2 Ã 10<sup>â16</sup>, Wilcoxon test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3B,C</xref>). These results show that the same methylation sites marking or contributing to tissue differentiation are participating in inter-individual variability that is highly determined by genetic variation and associated to gene expression. This could indicate that the establishment of differentially methylated regions during development could be delineating a backbone where local inter-individual changes may occur.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Context-specific DNA methylation</title><p>In order to further understand the nature of these inter-individual changes we analyzed their participation in different genomic contexts. We find a significant increased presence of negative compared to positive eQTMs in CTCF binding sites, enhancers and promoters, with this increase being higher in non-CpG island (CGI) promoters compared to CGI promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, we discover a significant depletion of mQTLs in CGI promoters, and a significant enrichment of mQTLs in non-CGI promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This shows that methylation sites in non-CGI promoters are under a stronger genetic control than at CGI promoters, where methylation is in general robustly maintained at low levels. Nevertheless, genetic variation in CpG islands commonly affects gene expression, since we find that eQTLs are significantly enriched at these genomic regions (all p values&lt;0.03). Overall, these results suggest that the role of DNA methylation can be highly dependent on the genomic and functional context.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DNA methylation and allele specific expression</title><p>Allele specific expression (ASE), seen as a signal of regulatory difference between two haplotypes of an individual, can in theory be driven either by genetic regulatory variation or epigenetic (in)activation of one of the two alleles, for example, by DNA methylation. In order to test whether ASE is caused by genetic variation or differential DNA methylation, we compared the magnitude of allelic imbalance in eQTL genes between individuals who are heterozygous for the eQTL and their respective homozygotes. Similar to other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dimas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pickrell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Montgomery et al., 2010</xref>), at a genome-wide level a significantly greater allelic imbalance is associated with heterozygote eQTLs in all three cell-types (p values&lt;3.0 Ã 10<sup>â8</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In order to test whether ASE is driven by haplotype differences in DNA methylation alone, potentially represented by semimethylated sites (partially methylated, Î²-value &gt;0.3 and &lt;0.7), we analyzed the genes having eQTM methylation sites that are not associated with SNPs (filtered out SNP-methylation correlations with nominal p&lt;0.01). A comparison of allelic imbalance between individuals with semimethylated eQTMs, and homomethylated (i.e., fully methylated, Î²-value &gt; 0.7, or unmethylated, Î²-value &lt; 0.3) eQTMs, revealed no significant differences (p values&gt;0.42, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, ASE driven by heterozygote eQTLs is significantly higher than that of semimethylated eQTMs (p values&lt;7.5 Ã 10<sup>â3</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, as a positive control, we observe that allelic imbalance in imprinted genes, known to be driven by allelic DNA methylation, is significantly higher than in homomethylated eQTMs (p values&lt;9.7 Ã 10<sup>â4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, while ASE is shown to be significantly driven by genetic variation (or by DNA methylation in imprinted genes), we find no evidence in our data of methylation alone contributing to ASE. This argues that DNA methylation is rarely allele-specific in the absence of DNA sequence variation effects, and while we cannot exclude other possible epigenetic sources of ASE, the results suggest that the widespread ASE across the genome may be primarily driven by common and rare genetic regulatory variants.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00523.017</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>DNA methylation associated to gene expression is not significantly allelic and can interact with genetic variation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In green are depicted the distributions of allelic imbalance (i.e., absolute distance from the expected 0.5 ratio) of assayable heterozygote sites in eQTL genes of individuals that are homozygous (HOM) or heterozygous (HET) for the eQTL.

In purple are shown the distributions of allelic imbalance of assayable heterozygote sites in eQTM genes (excluding methylation sites affected by genetic variation) of individuals that are homomethylated (HOMOMETH, i.e., fully methylated, Î²-value &gt; 0.7, or unmethylated Î²-value &lt; 0.3) or semimethylated (SEMIMETH, i.e., Î²-value &gt;0.3 and &lt;0.7) for the eQTM site. The difference between distributions is not significant in any cell-type, with p=0.79, p=0.42 and p=0.49 in F, L, T, respectively.

Under the âINDEPâ (independent) model, a SNP affects independently gene expression and DNA methylation (passive role of methylation). Under the âSMEâ (SNP-methylation-expression) model, the SNP affects methylation, which then affects gene expression (active role). The âSEMâ (SNP-expression-methylation) model requires that a SNP affects gene expression, and expression then affects methylation (passive role). We tested the relative likelihood of these models choosing a non-biased approach where at least two of the three pairwise correlations between genetic variation, gene expression and DNA methylation are significant, yielding 831â2928 SNP-methyl-exon triplets tested per cell-type. All three models occur, depending on cell-type and sign of correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The INDEP model, that reflects a passive role for DNA methylation, is the most likely model in fibroblasts and LCLs. However, in T-cells the SME model, where methylation takes an active causative role, is the major contributor. Note that in the SEM model, where methylation is passive being influenced by gene expression levels, a higher likelihood of pos-eQTMs is found compared to the SME model. Overall, these results suggest that DNA methylation can be both active, by being a likely cause of gene expression variation levels, or passive, by being a consequence or an independent mark of gene expression levels.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00523.018</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Passive and active roles of DNA methylation in gene regulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the three possible causative models tested of mechanistic relationships between genetic variation (SNP), DNA methylation (methyl) and gene expression (expr).

From the total number of tests, 61%, 36% and 27% were called as high confidence (HC) in fibroblasts, LCLs and T-cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplement-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4âsource data 1</xref>). The relative frequencies of these HC calls look similar to the general relative likelihood space of the models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). As an example of a HC INDEP model, we identified in fibroblasts a case occurring at the promoter of gene <italic>DPYSL4</italic> and involving a methylation site associated to age and age rate in blood samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hannum et al., 2013</xref>). In this example, SNP rs12772795 affects independently the DNA methylation status of site cg05652533 and the expression level of gene <italic>DPYSL4</italic>, possibly via an effect on the binding of CTCF nearby (given binding peak reported), which is a factor known to alter DNA methylation levels locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>). As an example of an SME model, we have identified in T-cells SNP rs1362125 that could be affecting the binding of SP1 (overlapping peak reported), which is a factor shown to confer methylation protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boumber et al., 2008</xref>). This could then alter the methylation state of site cg24703717 (78bp away) that falls in a YY1 binding peak, a factor whose binding is known to be sensitive to DNA methylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2003</xref>). Hence methylation could actively alter binding of YY1, negatively affecting the expression of the gene <italic>HLA-F</italic>. Finally, we would like to highlight in LCLs an SEM scenario in which SNP rs3733346, located in a DNAse hypersensitive site, affects the expression of gene <italic>DGKQ</italic>, whose transcriptional activity could then be influencing positively DNA methylation levels of site cg00846425 located in its gene body, as has been suggested to be a possible phenomenon for gene body DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hahn et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>DNA methylation associated to transcription factor abundance</title><p>To understand potential molecular causes for the passive role of methylation in the INDEP model we postulated that SNPs could be influencing binding levels of DNA-binding factors (hereon called transcription factors or TFs), which in turn affect the methylation status of a site in parallel to their effect on gene expression. It has been shown in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>) that TFs can influence DNA methylation levels near their binding sites (TFBSs). In addition, by correlating expression levels of TFs with DNA methylation at their TFBSs in different cell-types, this pattern has also been observed for some TFs in human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thurman et al., 2012</xref>). In order to test whether human inter-individual differences of TF expression levels would affect DNA methylation that is itself associated to gene expression we used the ENCODE dataset of TFBSs based on ChIP-seq assays for 111 TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerstein et al., 2012</xref>), and correlated their expression levels with eQTM methylation levels found at their reported binding sites. We found a strong enrichment of significant TF-methylation associations, with Ï<sub>1</sub> being 18%, 9% and 25%, in fibroblasts, LCL, and T-cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). At 10% FDR, we find significant associations for 27, 47 and 99 different TFs in fibroblasts, LCL and T-cells, respectively. A strong enrichment of significant associations can also be appreciated for each TF individually as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. We further tested whether genetic variants that could potentially alter TF binding would interact with TF abundance on their effect on DNA methylation levels (see âMaterials and methodsâ). Despite the limited number of cases that could be tested (N = 114), we find an enrichment of low p values for such interactions, with Ï<sub>1</sub> estimated at 15% of true positives, and the top interaction involving the TF c-Jun in T-cells (p=1 Ã 10<sup>â4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). These results suggest that TF levels could be influencing DNA methylation and gene expression levels simultaneously. It is possible that in some cases this could occur via the interaction with DNA sequence variation. This could illustrate a realistic model for passive but at the same time correlated levels of DNA methylation with gene expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have shown that inter-individual DNA methylation changes are mechanistically associated to genetic variation and gene expression in complex and context dependent ways that can be of passive or active nature. DNA methylation levels can depend on TF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>). TF binding levels in turn can be determined by both inter-individual differences of TF abundance and genetic variants at their binding sites. This picture shows how DNA methylation can be linked to genetic variation, and can participate in gene regulation in a passive manner. This scenario is quite different from the often-assumed simple model of genetic variation affecting the epigenome, which in turn affects the transcriptome, and furthermore these relationships can be of different nature depending on tissue and genomic region. This is likely to be true for other epigenetic mechanisms as well, and properly characterizing these relationships will enhance our understanding of genome function and complex disease.</p><p>Additionally, our results suggest that non-genetically determined DNA methylation is rarely allelic but rather defined at the whole cell level. That is, when we observe a population of cells to be semimethylated the most likely scenario is that only a fraction of the cells are fully methylated rather than one of the alleles in each of the cells is methylated. Nevertheless, given the limitations of our data, further studies addressing this question are needed to confirm our results.</p><p>Further, we show that methylation sites that represent a repressive state with respect to tissue differentiation can also participate in positive and negative associations with gene expression when looking at inter-individual variability. DNA methylation as a whole emerges both as marker and determinant of cellular identity and may provide a platform by which genetic variation and other variable factors among individuals (e.g., TFs) exert their effect to differentially influence cellular processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample collection and cell growth</title><p>Fifty-six of the 204 newborn umbilical cord and cord blood samples are part of the 85 samples collected previously in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dimas et al.

RNA samples were quantified with NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and Qubit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and analyzed with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Samples were prepared for sequencing with the Illumina mRNA-seq and TruSeq sample preparation kits (Illumina, San Diego, CA) as indicated by manufacturerâs instructions. In these library preparation procedures, poly-A RNA is selected using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads; then the RNA is cleaved, converted to first strand cDNA and after RNA digestion and second DNA strand synthesis, the fragments are end repaired and ligated to the adapters containing specific primer indexes. The cDNA libraries are then PCR amplified. Libraries were sequenced in either sets of 6 samples per lane in the Genome Analyzer II machine or 12 samples per lane in the HiSeq2000 machine, randomly pooling in the same lane samples from different cell-types and individuals. Afterwards, the 49-bp sequenced paired-end reads were mapped to the reference genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lander et al., 2001</xref>) GRCh37 with BWA v0.5.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). Using SAMtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2009</xref>), we kept reads mapping uniquely to the genome, with MAPQ â¥ 10 and properly paired. In order to quantify exons in a non-redundant way, we created a set of merged exons from the GENCODE v10 annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harrow et al., 2006</xref>). In more detail, we took all protein coding and lincRNA transcripts and merged any overlapping exons into new exon units. We then counted the number of reads mapping to each exon unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Technical outliers having less than 5M exonic reads or extremely low insert size mode were removed from the study. In order to keep only the set of exons that we considered expressed in each cell-type, we filtered out exons that had no reads mapped in 10% or more of the samples per cell-type. This yielded sets of 70,800â76,870 exons belonging to 12,265â12,863 expressed genes depending on the cell-type and analysis. Afterwards, we normalized the raw exon counts by scaling all libraries to 10 million reads, based on the total number of exonic reads per sample. In order to remove technical variance from our samples, we tested the effect of many different covariates on our scaled exon counts in each cell-type by linear regression. We decided to correct for mean GC content per library, run date, primer index and insert size mode, using a random effects model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

The starting quantity of DNA was 1000 ng and after BC we normalized all our samples to have a final concentration of 40 ng/Î¼l or the closest possible amount. BC-DNA was then processed through the 450K Illumina Infinium HD Methylation Assay (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturerâs instructions. In brief, this is an assay that involves whole genome amplification, specific hybridization capture, and allele-specific single-base primer extension. Samples from the three cell-types were processed in a randomized manner. The controls available in the methylation assay for verifying the efficiency of our bisulfite conversion indicated that none of our samples had bad efficiency of bisulfite conversion. We removed three technical outliers that didnât cluster well with any cell-type in a principal component analysis. From the 482,421 CpG sites assayed, we filtered out probes with 1000 genomes SNPs or indels at European minor allele frequency &gt;5% and then any other probes that had any of the final set of SNPs used in our study. This yielded a total of 416,118 CpG sites to work with. We quantile normalized the data in the following way. The Illumina 450k array is composed of two probe types. Probe type 1 reads the methylated signal and unmethylated signal in the same channel (red or green) and probe type 2 reads the methylated signal in the green channel and the unmethylated signal in the red channel. The distribution of Î²-values before any normalization is quite different for each probe type, thus the two probe types were normalized separately. For probe type 1, the intensity for the methylated and unmethylated signals were quantile normalized across individuals for each color channel separately. As the density of signal intensities showed that there was a color bias (at least for the unmethylated probe), the color channels were quantile normalized within individuals for the methylated signal and unmethylated signal separately. For probe type 2, the methylated signals and unmethylated signals were quantile normalized across individual. As for this probe the methylated signal is always in green and the unmethylated signal is always in red. The color bias needs to be corrected before computing Î²-values. In order to correct the color bias, the methylated (unmethylated) signal probe type 2 normalized across individuals is quantile normalized with the methylated (unmethylated) signal of probe type 1 that was previously quantile normalized across individuals and within for color correction. In a final step, the Î²-values of the two probe types were quantile normalized together leading to the final Î²-values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5 fig1s6 fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplements 5â7</xref>). The Î²-value is defined as the proportion of fluorescent signal from the methylated allele over the total fluorescent signal (methylated and unmethylated alleles); this represents the percentage of methylation per site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bibikova et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Association analyses and multiple testing correction</title><p>We performed Spearman rank correlations (SRC) between (<italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> variables): SNP genotypes and exon expression levels (eQTLs) in 183â185 samples using a 1-MB window to either side of the TSS, SNP genotypes and CpG site methylation levels (mQTLs) in 66â111 samples using a 5-kb window to either side of the CpG site, CpG site methylation levels and exon expression levels (eQTMs) in 66â118 samples using a 50-kb window to either side of the TSS.

These expected REF/TOTAL ratios (typically 0.494â0.517 as measured by 10th and 90th quantiles across samples) correct for remaining slight genome-wide mapping bias as well as GC bias in each individual. Finally, for all the sites covered by â¥16 reads in each individual, we calculated the absolute distance from the expected 0.5 ratio described above. Because our genotypes included imputed data, we verified the genotype from the RNA sequencing data by requiring the observation of both of the SNP alleles in at least one cell type per individual.</p><p>The number of genes in the homozygote and heterozygote eQTL analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> are 1473 and 1453 in fibroblasts, 2197 and 2177 in LCLs, and 1288 and 1284 in T-cells, respectively.

For each round of permutations a Ï<sub>1</sub> was calculated, creating a null distribution of Ï<sub>1</sub> from which an empirical p value can be inferred (as reported in the main text). Additionally, the 95% confidence intervals were calculated from the 1000 permutations of all tests in each cell-type. False discovery rates of the reported significant results were calculated using the QVALUE R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Storey and Tibshirani, 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Causative model analysis</title><p>Bayesian networks (BN) are directed acyclic graphs where nodes represent random variables and edges represent the conditional dependences among nodes. The direction of the edges between two nodes can be interpreted as a causal relationship. BN have been used before to infer causality in genetic problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schadt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). Likelihood methods are commonly used to estimate the most likely networkâthat is, the set of causal relationships among the different variables that better agrees with the data.</p><p>In a BN every node has an associated probability function and, together with the conditional dependencies represented by the edges, they conform the joint probability density of the network. BN satisfy the local Markov propertyâthat is, each variable is conditionally independent of its non-descendants given its parent variables. The Markov property defines the decomposition of the joint probability density of the network into a set of local distributions. Thanks to the Markov property it is easy to calculate the likelihood of a given BN. Since different networks have different complexities, it is common to use a score that takes into account the network complexity instead of the raw likelihood to compare the networks. We used the R package bnlearn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scutari, 2010</xref>) to calculate the maximum likelihood of the networks and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) score. AIC = 2k â 2ln(L), where k is the number of parameters and L is the maximum likelihood. To calculate how much better one network is compared to another, we used the relative likelihood of one network with respect to the other. If we have two networks, N1 and N2, with fixed parameters and AIC(N1) â¤ AIC(N2), then the relative likelihood of N2 with respect to N1 is defined as: exp((AIC(N1)âAIC(N2))/2). The networks we have compared (mentioned in main text) have five parameters each.</p><p>To test the networks, we selected three datasets that were then merged and normalized for size in order to calculate the relative frequencies of the inferred best network. In the first dataset we selected the best eQTM and for that methylation site the best mQTL, not requiring statistical significance for the eQTL (n = 219, 1074 and 1128 in fibroblasts [F], LCLs [L], and T-cells [T], respectively), which would enrich for the SME model since the eQTL is the most distant association. In the second dataset, for each exon we selected its best eQTL and its best eQTM; not requiring significance for the mQTL (n = 287, 1316 and 871 in F, L, T), which would enrich for the SEM model since the mQTL is the most distant association. And in the third, for each exon we selected its best eQTL and kept the cases where the SNP was the best mQTL for a methylation site; not requiring significance for the eQTM, which would enrich for the INDEP model since the eQTM is the most distant association (n = 413, 726, 775, in F, L, T).</p><p>In order to create a list of high confidence calls, we have made use of a semi-parametric method, the Causal Inference Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Millstein et al., 2009</xref>), that requires a level of significance for calling two out of the three models. The CIT makes SME and SEM calls if either has a p&lt;0.05, makes no call if p&lt;0.05 for both models (highly infrequent) and makes a call for the INDEP if neither SME or SEM has a significant p-value. We have decided to call a high confidence set of SME and SEM models when they are called as such by both the BN and the CIT methods. Since the INDEP calls in the CIT do not require significance, we called a high confidence INDEP if 1) it is called INDEP by both methods, and 2) its BN relative likelihood (RL) to the second best model is equal or higher to the median RL of the SME and SEM high confidence calls to their second best prediction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Transcription factor expression to methylation level analyses</title><p>As explained in the text, the transcription factor (TF) expression levels were Spearman rank correlated to methylation levels of eQTM sites falling in their reported TF binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerstein et al., 2012</xref>), excluding any sites within 1 Mb of the TF gene transcription start site. The number of expressed TFs in each cell-type is 94, 106 and 105, comprising 666, 851 and 776 exons in fibroblasts, LCLs and T-cells, respectively. The number of targeted eQTM methylation sites in each cell-type is 459, 3832 and 3497 in fibroblasts, LCLs and T-cells, respectively. The number of tests performed is 17,747, 209136 and 152263 in fibroblasts, LCLs and T-cells, respectively.</p><p>To show the expected uniform distribution of p values for these correlations and compare it with the (highly enriched) observed, we have permuted once the TF expression values for each TF-meth correlation in each cell-type and plotted the p-value distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). To call significant cases for the target sites of each TF, the false discovery rate was calculated for each using the QVALUE R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Storey and Tibshirani, 2003</xref>).</p><p>We tested the interactions between SNPs and TF abundance on their effect on DNA methylation by taking the top mQTL SNPs that fell in TF peaks and whose associated methylation site correlated significantly with the TF expression level of that peak (10% FDR for both types of associations). We excluded cases in which the SNP and the TF abundance were correlated (p&lt;0.05) and in which the number minor allele homozygotes was less than four. This yielded a total set of 114 SNP-TF-meth triplets for which the interaction between SNP and TF abundance was tested by linear regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Data availability</title><p>Genotyping, RNA-seq and DNA methylation data have been submitted to the EMBL-EBI European Genome-Phenome Archive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/</ext-link>) under accession number EGAS00001000446.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The study tackles an important and timely set of questions in the nexus of DNA methylation, gene regulation, and genetic variation. The genomics dataset collected in this study is exemplary and, indeed, is one of the first of the next generation of âgeneticsâgenomicsâ studies, with three cell types (two of them primary) isolated from over 200 newborns, all genotyped, and profiled for expression (RNA-Seq) and DNA methylation.</p><p>In this sense, all of us would be delighted to see the data published, and with the appropriate analytics and conclusions this could be an important paper, well within the scope of <italic>eLife</italic>. Indeed, it is precisely because the dataset is likely to be broadly used, because the design could be deployed in many other contexts by other groups, and because the conclusions address fundamental questions in gene regulation, that we feel that it is critical that the analytics underlying the conclusion be very carefully and very strongly supported.</p><p>In this respect, unfortunately, we found the current manuscript lacking in two important ways:</p><p>1) Very strong and broad conclusions were drawn as we detail below, but they were not equally strongly supported in the actual analyses/data. These should be toned down to the appropriate level, with some probably removed or replaced with hypothesis level assertions; and</p><p>2) In multiple places throughout the work, the statistics need to be performed more carefully, with appropriate controls, which we detail specifically below.</p><p>3) Next, once the statistical analyses are done appropriately, the authors are likely to remain with a far fewer number of significant loci/genes, but those would be individually significant, and the authors should highlight some of those specific examples, instead of focusing solely on aggregate numbers as currently written.</p><p>4) Finally, since some of the studyâs inherent value is as a resource, it is critical that the manuscript provides processed results in summary tables (as source data files), listing all genes, associated SNPs, and other traits. It is also critical to state clearly within the manuscript where and how the data can be obtained by others (with the expected constraints associated with human genotype data).</p><p>We further detail below how to address points 1 and 2, in the context of each of the seven major claims of the paper. We emphasize that without a serious analytic revision, the manuscript will not be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We identify seven major claims in the paper. We list each here and its extent of support, and make specific suggestions for how to address each analytic shortcoming.</p><p>* Claim 1 addresses eQTMs, the relation between variation in methylation and expression. The authors draw the conclusion that eQTMs are mostly independent of the mechanism involved in the repressive effect of DNA methylation on expression across genes. This is a strong conclusion, but is currently poorly supported. Specifically, the eQTMs were partitioned into only two bins (positive and negative effect). It might be, however, that most of the pos- and neg-eQTM effects are insignificant (around 0) and therefore some important inter-relations are masked within a sea of noise. Instead, the same plots should be regenerated for eQTMs split into a larger number of bins (e.g., 5 bins: very-neg, neg, no-sign, pos, very-pos-eQTMs), to show whether the negative correlation holds in all of these 5 bins, and more generally is not an artifact of the binning.</p><p>* Claim 2 addresses differentially methylated regions (DMRs) across cell types and asked whether DMRs are more often associated to eQTMs and mQTLs than non-DMRs.</p><p>First, the relation between DMRs and eQTMs might be a byproduct of their relation with the average methylation. This is because the higher the average, the higher the variance, and thus we may get a higher differentiation per methylation. To control for this possibility the authors should use a 'normalized differentiation in methylation' (i.e., use the residuals of differentiation per methylation after removing the effect of the methylation average), and then use these normalized (residual) values to repeat the same test relating (residual) differentiation with mQTLs and eQTMs.</p><p>Second, regardless of the validity of the test, the additional biological conclusions are over-stretched and should be toned down.</p><p>* Claim 3 associates mQTLs and eQTMs with different features. The differential association of mQTLs to CGI and non-CGI promoters is intriguing and well supported. The analysis of pos- and neg-eQTMs should be repeated with finer binning (as claim 1, above), but is otherwise satisfactory.</p><p>* Claim 4 shows lack of support for a contribution of methylation to allele specific expression, independent of sequence variation. This is a strong assertion, but is also a negative result. Our main concern is that it is hard to devise an appropriate control here. We urge the authors to remove this result, unless they can provide additional support.</p><p>* Claim 5 tests for synergistic interactions between genetic variants and DNA methylation on gene expression. Although the authors note that they âcontrolledâ for artificial inflation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> shows that there is a clear inflation in the resulting <italic>P</italic>-values. What is the reason for this inflation? Without correcting for this, it is impossible to judge the number of significant relations. We advise that the authors use at least bootstrapping for some empirical correction, and preferably correct for population structure and other confounders.</p><p>* Claim 6 concerns different causality models and their proportions in the different cell types. Each of the three models has a different number of parameters, and the correction with AIC is based on theoretical considerations and hence might not compensate for the different degrees of freedom. In addition, there is no evaluation of the significance of the resulting predicted models (which then precludes the authors â and future readers â from following up on individual findings). To correct for such potential artifacts, we suggest applying a direct evaluation of the distribution of relative likelihood for each pair of models based on data reshuffling (permutation test). Based on such tests, it is possible to (A) get a threshold for each of the likelihood comparisons using a common <italic>P</italic>-value threshold. This would allow comparing results from different cell types and models using a common systematic threshold; and (B) discriminate significant vs. non-significant relative likelihood scores. Once this is done the authors should report how many of the results are significant and what the statistics are when using significant predictions only, and, finally, they should highlight specific examples, which would enhance the paper's impact and biological relevance.</p><p>* Claim 7 tries to couch the findings in a mechanistic setting, claiming that TF levels modulate the effect of DNA sequence variation. This is an intriguing and important direction, but it has to be done carefully.</p><p>First, as above, it is not clear whether the reported <italic>P</italic>-values are corrected for the special characteristics of the data. Applying a permutation test and deriving a corrected <italic>P</italic>-value based on such an analysis would allow evaluating the statistical significance of the reported results. Furthermore, while we do not require the authors to conduct follow up biological experiments, in the absence of such follow up, the conclusions should be toned down significantly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00523.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Very strong and broad conclusions were drawn as we detail below, but they were not equally strongly supported in the actual analyses/data.

The authors draw the conclusion that eQTMs are mostly independent of the mechanism involved in the repressive effect of DNA methylation on expression across genes. This is a strong conclusion, but is currently poorly supported. Specifically, the eQTMs were partitioned into only two bins (positive and negative effect). It might be, however, that most of the pos- and neg-eQTM effects are insignificant (around 0) and therefore some important inter-relations are masked within a sea of noise. Instead, the same plots should be regenerated for eQTMs split into a larger number of bins (e.g., 5 bins: very-neg, neg, no-sign, pos, very-pos-eQTMs), to show whether the negative correlation holds in all of these 5 bins, and more generally is not an artifact of the binning</italic>.</p><p>We believe that there has been some misunderstanding since the assessment of positive and negative eQTMs is only done for statistically significant eQTMs. Specifically, due to our multiple testing corrections, in order to call an eQTM, we require a high level of nominal significance (as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) controlling for multiple testing with an FDR of 10%. As a consequence, the strength of the correlations of eQTMs as measured by the Spearman correlation coefficient are far from zero (see histograms below: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1</xref>), the minimum of the absolute value being 0.368, 0.308, and 0.407 in fibroblasts, LCLs, and T-cells, respectively. Furthermore, for the effect size of eQTMs as the slope of the linear regression of expression explained by DNA methylation, we also obtain values far from zero. The minimum of the absolute effect size is 3.16 and 7 in fibroblasts and T-cells, and LCLs have only 6 eQTMs with effect size below 1. Hence, our eQTMs do not contain insignificant associations, and thus the further binning is not necessary.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="elife-00523-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>Moreover, although we are dealing with 1140 pos-eQTMs and 5112 neg-eQTMs at promoter regions, these involve only a limited number of genes (703 and 1758 for pos and neg-eQTMs, respectively). Hence, binning our eQTMs would lead to a smaller number of genes per bin and consequently a lower dynamic range of gene expression levels, which would not allow a proper assessment of across gene expression.</p><p>Finally, we would like to highlight that the reported strength of the negative correlation of pos and neg-eQTM median methylation with across gene expression (rho = -0.11 and -0.10 for pos and neg-eQTMs, respectively) is comparable to the strength of the correlations between promoter DNA methylation and across gene expression measured per individual for all expressed genes, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>. Hence, the correlation we report in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is as robust as that found at a genome-wide level.</p><p>Specific points in the paper have been clarified to reflect these issues.</p><p><italic>* Claim 2 addresses differentially methylated regions (DMRs) across cell types and asked whether DMRs are more often associated to eQTMs and mQTLs than non-DMRs</italic>.</p><p><italic>First, the relation between DMRs and eQTMs might be a byproduct of their relation with the average methylation. This is because the higher the average, the higher the variance, and thus we may get a higher differentiation per methylation. To control for this possibility the authors should use a ânormalized differentiation in methylationâ (i.e., use the residuals of differentiation per methylation after removing the effect of the methylation average), and then use these normalized (residual) values to repeat the same test relating (residual) differentiation with mQTLs and eQTMs</italic>.</p><p><italic>Second, regardless of the validity of the test, the additional biological conclusions are over-stretched and should be toned down</italic>.</p><p>The measure of DNA methylation differentiation that we are using (coefficient of variation, CV) already controls for the bias that the reviewers point out, that of a higher mean having a higher variance. We calculate the CV by measuring the standard deviation among the three medians of the methylation level per site in each cell-type divided by the mean of these three medians. In this manner, our differentiation measure is not positively correlated with average methylation as shown in the plot below (in fact, it is negatively correlated: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 2</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="elife-00523-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>We would also like to emphasize that by using the median methylation level per site for each cell-type, our differentiation measure is estimating the between cell-type variation only, not taking into account the within cell-type variation. We have clarified these points in the main text, and in Materials and methods by including a section called âDNA methylation differentiation metricâ. Additionally, we have toned down the conclusion of this analysis in the main text.</p><p><italic>* Claim 3 associates mQTLs and eQTMs with different features. The differential association of mQTLs to CGI and non-CGI promoters is intriguing and well supported. The analysis of pos- and neg-eQTMs should be repeated with finer binning (as claim 1, above), but is otherwise satisfactory</italic>.</p><p>As explained above that the eQTMs are statistically significant and of substantial effect size, binning is not meaningful in this analysis.</p><p><italic>* Claim 4 shows lack of support for a contribution of methylation to allele specific expression, independent of sequence variation. This is a strong assertion, but is also a negative result. Our main concern is that it is hard to devise an appropriate control here. We urge the authors to remove this result, unless they can provide additional support</italic>.</p><p>We understand the reviewersâ concern and have re-arranged the figure and added an additional positive control in order to better support our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We are of the opinion that this result is important and while not definitive it is still worth presenting with the necessary caveats.</p><p>As pointed out by the reviewers, our results show a lack of support for a contribution of methylation to allele specific expression, independent of sequence variation when comparing homomethylated eQTMs versus semimethylated eQTMs. This is contrary to the expected genetic effect, which leads to a significantly higher allelic imbalance in heterozygous compared to homozygous eQTLs. While the results as presented previously appeared as a ânegativeâ result, we would like to point out that the allelic imbalance of heterozygous eQTLs is significantly greater than the allelic imbalance of semimethylated eQTMs (<italic>P</italic> = 7.50E-03, <italic>P</italic> = 3.40E-07, <italic>P</italic> = 1.1E-13 in fibroblasts, LCLs and T-cells, respectively), hence it is a positive result. Furthermore, we have incorporated a positive control of methylation effects on allelic imbalance, by measuring the allelic imbalance in genes reported to be imprinted, which represent a direct measure of ASE caused by an allelic signal of DNA methylation. As seen in the white boxplots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, allelic imbalance in imprinted genes is significantly higher than in homomethylated eQTMs (with <italic>P</italic> = 6.93E-34, <italic>P</italic> = 9.66E-04, <italic>P</italic> = 8.48E-05, in fibroblasts, LCLs and T-cells, respectively).</p><p>We have integrated these results into the main text, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, and the Materials and methods. Moreover, we have highlighted in the Discussion the need for further studies to confirm these findings. We hope the reviewers find this additional support satisfactory and we remain open to any further suggestions that may arise.</p><p><italic>* Claim 5 tests for synergistic interactions between genetic variants and DNA methylation on gene expression. Although the authors note that they âcontrolledâ for artificial inflation,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref> <italic>shows that there is a clear inflation in the resulting</italic> P<italic>-values. What is the reason for this inflation? Without correcting for this, it is impossible to judge the number of significant relations. We advise that the authors use at least bootstrapping for some empirical correction, and preferably correct for population structure and other confounders</italic>.</p><p>We understand the reviewersâ concern on the observed inflation in the resulting <italic>P</italic>-values and thank them for pointing that out. We can discard population structure confounders since we have already corrected for it (in all our analyses involving genetic variation) by excluding the genetic outliers depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, as determined by multidimensional scaling genetic clustering using several HapMap populations. However, although we eliminated from our analyses any SNP-methyl correlation with <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, there could still be low levels of correlation that could potentially still inflate our <italic>P</italic>-values.</p><p>In order to better control for this, we have permuted the expression values of all the triplets tested, 1000 times, keeping SNP and methyl pairs of values in their original form. This allows us to maintain the correlation structure between the SNP and the methylation site and any inflation due to that, while randomizing the expression. From these permutations, we have derived the 95% confidence intervals and incorporated them into the qqplots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. The interaction <italic>P</italic>-values for fibroblasts fail to cross the upper 95<sup>th</sup> confidence limit, while for T-cells and LCLs the observed <italic>P</italic>-values remain mostly or entirely above the upper 95<sup>th</sup> confidence limit, respectively. Additionally, for each round of permutation of the tested triplets, we have calculated the Ï1 statistic. Hence, by creating a null distribution of Ï1 we can assess how different it is to the observed Ï1. The observed Ï1 of each cell-type was highly significant (all <italic>P</italic>-values &lt; 0.001) with the top permuted Ï1 being 7.2, 8.5 and 2 times smaller than the observed Ï1 in fibroblasts, LCLs and T-cells, respectively.</p><p>We have included these results in the main text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, and clarified the details in Materials and methods under âInteraction permutation analysisâ.</p><p><italic>* Claim 6 concerns different causality models and their proportions in the different cell types. Each of the three models has a different number of parameters, and the correction with AIC is based on theoretical considerations and hence might not compensate for the different degrees of freedom. In addition, there is no evaluation of the significance of the resulting predicted models (which then precludes the authors â and future readers â from following up on individual findings). To correct for such potential artifacts, we suggest applying a direct evaluation of the distribution of relative likelihood for each pair of models based on data reshuffling (permutation test). Based on such tests, it is possible to (A) get a threshold for each of the likelihood comparisons using a common</italic> P<italic>-value threshold. This would allow comparing results from different cell types and models using a common systematic threshold; and (B) discriminate significant vs. non-significant relative likelihood scores. Once this is done the authors should report how many of the results are significant and what the statistics are when using significant predictions only, and, finally, they should highlight specific examples, which would enhance the paperâs impact and biological relevance</italic>.</p><p>We are not sure why the reviewers suggest that there is a different number of parameters for each model. The number of parameters of a discrete Bayesian network is defined as the sum of the number of logically independent parameters of each node given its parents (Chickering, 1995). We have 5 parameters in each of our three models, which we have now specified in the Materials and methods. Furthermore, in order to test an exon-SNP-methyl triplet we require that at least two of the three pair-wise correlations are significant; hence, permuting the data would break these prior requirements and would not truly assess the confidence of the called model. However, we understand the reviewersâ concern on better grasping the relative likelihood space between the models and reporting the number of significant predictions. In order to do this we have: 1) presented the general landscape of relative likelihoods of the models, 2) created a list of high confidence calls based on the overlap of two distinct methods.</p><p>For point (1), instead of calling the best model and then presenting the relative frequencies of each (previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), we present directly the relative likelihood space for the three models across all exon-SNP-methyl triplets tested. As seen in the new plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the relative contribution of the three models remains very similar to the one obtained before, with a slight general increase of pos-eQTM likelihood.</p><p>For point (2), creating a list of high confidence calls, we have made use of a semi-parametric method, the Causal Inference Test (CIT; Millstein et al. 2009), that requires a level of significance for calling two out of the three models. The CIT makes SME and SEM calls if either has a <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, it makes no call if <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 for both models (highly infrequent), and it makes a call for the INDEP if neither SME or SEM has a significant <italic>P</italic>-value. We have decided to call a high confidence set of SME and SEM models when they are called as such by both the Bayesian Networks (BN) and the CIT methods. Since the INDEP calls in the CIT do not require significance, we called a high confidence INDEP if 1) it is called INDEP by both methods, and 2) its BN relative likelihood (RL) to the second best model is equal or higher to the median RL of the SME and SEM high confidence calls to their second best prediction.</p><p>From the total number of tests, 61%, 36%, and 27% were called as high confidence (HC) in fibroblasts, LCLs, and T-cells, respectively (see details in table below). The relative frequencies of these HC calls have been added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4â figure supplement 1B</xref> (they look similar to the general landscapes). We have reported these results in the main text and we have described the details in the Materials and methods. Additionally, we provide text file tables of the high confidence calls in a zipped file as <xref ref-type="supplement-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4âsource data 1</xref>, in which the exon-SNP-methyl triplets are reported, as well as the Spearman rho value for inferring the sign of the correlation between expression and DNA methylation, and a column indicating the RL of the inferred model over the second best BN prediction, so that users can further filter by confidence if needed.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td>Cell-type</td><td>Num Tests</td><td>HC SME</td><td>Median RL to 2nd</td><td>HC SEM</td><td>Median RL to 2nd</td><td>HC INDEP</td><td>INDEP RL threshold</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><bold>L</bold></td><td>2928</td><td>193</td><td>4.5</td><td>139</td><td>6.1</td><td>717</td><td>5.1</td></tr><tr><td><bold>F</bold></td><td>831</td><td>44</td><td>2.8</td><td>36</td><td>4.6</td><td>428</td><td>3.5</td></tr><tr><td><bold>T</bold></td><td>2584</td><td>292</td><td>5.1</td><td>67</td><td>3.1</td><td>345</td><td>5.0</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Finally, we have described in the main text specific examples of a high confidence call for each of the three models.</p><p><italic>* Claim 7 tries to couch the findings in a mechanistic setting, claiming that TF levels modulate the effect of DNA sequence variation. This is an intriguing and important direction, but it has to be done carefully</italic>.</p><p><italic>First, as above, it is not clear whether the reported P-values are corrected for the special characteristics of the data. Applying a permutation test and deriving a corrected P-value based on such an analysis would allow evaluating the statistical significance of the reported results. Furthermore, while we do not require the authors to conduct follow up biological experiments, in the absence of such follow up, the conclusions should be toned down significantly</italic>.</p><p>The correlations between TF abundance and DNA methylation at their binding sites are calculated with Spearman rank correlation and therefore the P-values are expected to behave appropriately. However, for our and the reviewersâ peace of mind, we have permuted the TF expression values for each TF-methyl correlation in each cell-type. We now present the expected null P-value distribution (under permutation), which as expected was uniform, and the one we observe (with their associated Ï1 statistics) in the histograms added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>. We have also specified in the Materials and methods the usage of Spearman rank for these correlations and included a description of the permutation procedure.</p><p>Finally, we have also toned down the conclusions in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
