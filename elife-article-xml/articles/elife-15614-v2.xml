studies had shown that the integration of genome wide expression profiles, in metabolic tissues, with genetic and phenotypic variance, provided valuable insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms. We used RNA-Seq to characterize hypothalamic transcriptome in 99 inbred strains of mice from the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), a reference resource population for cardiovascular and metabolic traits. We report numerous novel transcripts supported by proteomic analyses, as well as novel non coding RNAs. High resolution genetic mapping of transcript levels in HMDP, reveals both <italic>local</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) demonstrating 2 <italic>trans</italic> eQTL 'hotspots' associated with expression of hundreds of genes. We also report thousands of alternative splicing events regulated by genetic variants. Finally, comparison with about 150 metabolic and cardiovascular traits revealed many highly significant associations. Our data provide a rich resource for understanding the many physiologic functions mediated by the hypothalamus and their genetic regulation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15614.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15614.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15614.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Metabolism is a term that describes all the chemical reactions that are involved in keeping a living organism alive. Diseases related to metabolism ‚Äì such as obesity, heart disease and diabetes ‚Äì are a major health problem in the Western world. The causes of these diseases are complex and include both environmental factors, such as diet and exercise, and genetics. Indeed, many genetic variants that contribute to obesity have been uncovered in both humans and mice. However, it is only dimly understood how these genetic variants affect the underlying networks of interacting genes that cause metabolic disorders.</p><p>Measuring gene activity or expression, and tracing how genetic instructions are carried from DNA into RNA and proteins, can reliably identify groups of genes that correlate with metabolic traits in specific organs. This strategy was successfully used in previous studies to reveal new information about abnormalities linked to obesity in specific tissues such as the liver and fat tissues. It was also shown that this approach might suggest new molecules that could be targeted to treat metabolic disorders.</p><p>A brain region called the hypothalamus is key to the control of metabolism, including feeding behavior and obesity. Hasin-Brumshtein et al. set out to explore gene expression in the hypothalamus of 99 different strains of mice, in the hope that the data will help identify new connections between gene expression and metabolism.</p><p>This approach showed that thousands of new and known genes are expressed in the mouse hypothalamus, some of which coded for proteins, and some of which did not. Hasin-Brumshtein et al. uncovered two genetic variants that controlled the expression of hundreds of other genes. Further analysis then revealed thousands of genetic variants that regulated the expression of, and type of RNA (so-called &quot;spliceforms&quot;) produced from neighboring genes. Also, the expression of many individual genes showed significant similarities with about 150 metabolic measurements that had been evaluated previously in the mice.</p><p>This new dataset is a unique resource that can be coupled with different approaches to test existing ideas and develop new ones about the role of particular genes or genetic mechanisms in obesity. Future studies will likely focus on new genes that show strong associations with attributes that are relevant to metabolic disorders, such as insulin levels, weight and fat mass.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15614.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15614.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>RNA-Seq</kwd><kwd>trans-eQTL</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>high fat diet</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>eQTL</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM098273</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hasin-Brumshtein</surname><given-names>Yehudit</given-names></name><name><surname>Khan</surname><given-names>Arshad H</given-names></name><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Calvin</given-names></name><name><surname>Petyuk</surname><given-names>Vladislav A</given-names></name><name><surname>Piehowski</surname><given-names>Paul D</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Richard D</given-names></name><name><surname>Lusis</surname><given-names>Aldons J</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Desmond J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM103493</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petyuk</surname><given-names>Vladislav A</given-names></name><name><surname>Piehowski</surname><given-names>Paul D</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Richard D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>W.R.

Genome wide association studies have shown that DNA sequence variants significantly contribute to variation in metabolic traits both in humans and mice. However, in most cases the connection between genetic variant and final phenotype remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suhre et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teslovich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lappalainen et al., 2013</xref>). In an effort to better understand how genetic variation results in phenotypic differences, many projects in the last decade have focused on genome wide characterization of sequence variants regulating gene expression in different tissues and organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lappalainen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Majewski and Pastinen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grundberg et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">, 2012</xref>). These studies showed that up to 80% of genetic variants associated with complex traits likely act through the¬†regulation of gene expression rather than changing protein sequence and function. Such genes, termed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), offer useful insights into the mechanistic links between genotype and phenotype, providing the eQTLs are characterized with sufficient power and resolution in phenotypically relevant tissues and states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pickrell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Min et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaulton et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Mouse is the primary model organism for many cardiovascular traits, including atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, obesity, the neural control of metabolism, and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lusis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allayee et al., 2003</xref>). Dozens of loci contribute¬†genetically to metabolic traits have been identified in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parks et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lusis, 2012</xref>). Indeed, we and others have extensively characterized eQTLs in metabolically relevant tissues of mice, suggesting potential new genes related to obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Nas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aylor et al., 2011</xref>). Integration of transcriptomic data from liver and adipose with genetic mapping and phenotypes led to mechanistic insights into the complexity of metabolic phenotypes. Yet, hypothalamus, which is not a readily accessible tissue, lacks such high resolution expression data. In fact, only one previous study examined eQTLs in mouse hypothalamus, using mice from 39 inbred strains fed chow diet, using microarray data and 5000 SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McClurg et al., 2007</xref>). The lack of extensive transcriptome data, which allows mapping of eQTLs and the linking of traits and transcripts, is a major impediment in integrating the hypothalamus with a systems biology of metabolism. In this study, we used RNA-Seq to characterize the hypothalamic transcriptome in 99 inbred strains of mice from the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghazalpour et al., 2012</xref>]) fed a high fat, high sugar diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parks et al., 2013</xref>). The advantage of the HMDP is that these strains have all been densely genotyped and carefully phenotyped for about 150 metabolic traits, allowing high resolution genetic mapping of QTLs and eQTLs. We identified thousands of novel isoforms and hundreds of new genes that were not previously annotated, and that may represent variants or transcripts specific to the hypothalamus. The HMDP also allowed us to map QTLs with high resolution and power, identifying both <italic>local</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> acting variants. The RNA sequencing data permitted examination of a much broader spectrum of transcriptional features and facilitated analysis not only at the gene level, but also of genetic variants affecting specific isoforms, coding sequences or transcription start sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we explored the transcriptional landscape of mouse hypothalamus using RNAseq from 282 mice, representing 99 inbred and recombinant inbred strains from the HMDP. We first focused on quantifying gene expression in a transcript specific manner, the discovery of novel expressed regions and isoforms, and the contribution of genetic factors to expression variance. We also sought qualitative support for translation of new isoforms and genes. We then examined and quantified RNA modifications, such as alternative splicing events and editing in our data and used the data to map genetic variants affecting these events. Finally, we used the extensive phenotyping available for the HMDP, to look for associations between the expression of genes and transcripts, and physiologic phenotypes. All of the expression data and transcriptome assembly are publicly available from the¬†Gene Expression Omnibus database, accession number GSE79551.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hypothalamic gene expression and proteomic data reveal multiple new isoforms and novel genes</title><p>Similar to other large-scale RNAseq studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mutz et al., 2013</xref>) we identified thousands of novel transcripts, with the vast majority of them only expressed at low levels in a small subset of samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Nevertheless, in the robust set of transcripts that are expressed at appreciable levels (FPKM &gt;1 in 50+ samples and FPKM&gt;0 in 100+ samples), we still identified 21,234 novel isoforms and 485 transcripts originating from 407 novel expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

First, the 407 novel genes expressed in our data potentially constitute transcripts that are unique to the hypothalamus. Second, the GENCODE M2 annotation used in this study was the most recent available when we started to analyze the data. Since then, however, the annotation has been augmented based on more recently published datasets and improved prediction pipelines. Thus, while the 407 genes are novel relative to the M2 version, they may have been added later. To explore that possibility, we compared our assembly to the latest version of annotation released by GENCODE ‚Äì M10 (released January 2016, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gencodegenes.org/">http://www.gencodegenes.org/</ext-link>) and find that 193 out of 407 loci are still novel. Some of the genes may also represent genomic DNA contamination. However, we consider this possibility less likely since we used stringent filtering criteria based on the¬†number of samples that the genes were expressed in.</p><p>In terms of genomic properties, such as putative open reading frame length, transcript length or splicing complexity, the novel genes seem to resemble known non-coding genes, suggesting that the¬†majority of the novel genes likely belong to this class. On the other hand, the properties of novel isoforms are consistent with known coding transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To explore the translational potential of newly identified isoforms and genes, we compared our RNA-Seq data to proteomic data generated from additional hypothalamus samples from the HMDP. Specifically, we translated all known and newly identified transcripts in 6 potential open reading frames, and compared this dataset to the hypothalamic peptide sequences. As expected, &gt;95% of the identified peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) matched at least one known transcript with the¬†vast majority of these (&gt;99%) corresponding to known protein coding transcripts, suggesting high accuracy of the peptide data. In addition, 430 peptides matched either novel isoforms (n¬†=¬†401), or novel genes (n¬†=¬†29) exclusively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Since the genomic properties of the novel genes hint that the majority of them are likely non coding, we do not find their low representation in peptide data surprising. Moreover, manual in-depth characterization of the 29 peptides matching novel genes, with UCSC and NCBI database revealed that almost all of them represent processed pseudogenes, rather than proteins with novel functions. This finding both supports the previously published reports of wide spread transcription of pseudogenes, and their translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tay et al., 2015</xref>), while strengthening the suggestion that the majority of novel genes identified in this work are not protein coding.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15614.004</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genomic properties of novel genes are similar to known non coding genes.</title><p>Novel genes and isoforms are defined by Cufflinks class code 'u' and 'j' respectively.

For that purpose, we re-quantified 3 samples from C57BL/6J strain, using uniquely mapping reads only (mapping quality =¬†255), and compared the quantification of the novel genes between the two approaches. Not surprisingly, the proportion of uniquely mapped reads contributing to the expression of the genes matched very well between the 3 samples, suggesting that it is an intrinsic gene property and not unique to the individual samples. Importantly, while the¬†low uniqueness of mapping reads may indicate false results, we also noted that among the 29 peptides matching to the novel genes exclusively and uniquely, 18 match genes that do not pass our threshold. In fact, many of gene families share sequence motifs and are homologues, and as such some of the reads would be multi-mapping between them. Thus we chose not to remove these genes from the annotation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Genetic regulation of gene expression</title><p>We examined expression QTLs in terms of type of the affected features and identified SNPs affecting expression of all transcripts at a locus (eQTL), specific transcript isoforms (isoQTLs), transcription start sites (tssQTLs) or open reading frame (cdsQTLs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hasin-Brumshtein et al., 2016</xref>). Since the linkage disequilibrium (LD) is extensive in the mouse genome, we distinguish between three types of QTLs: <italic>local</italic> (within 2 Mb of the gene), <italic>distant</italic> (on the same chromosome as the gene, distance &gt;2¬†Mb) and <italic>trans</italic> (SNP and gene reside on different chromosomes). The number of identified interactions, and genes affected by such regulation depends on the statistical cutoff of p-value for the interaction one chooses. We examined a set of thresholds ranging from very liberal to stringent. The liberal threshold was previously established by permutation from microarray expression data in the HMDP, i.e. p&lt;1.4E‚Äì3 for <italic>local</italic> variants and p&lt;6E‚Äì6 for <italic>distant</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>. The most stringent threshold used a Bonferroni corrected threshold (i.e 0.01 divided by the number of tests, p&lt;1E-12). As expected, different thresholds resulted in different numbers of QTLs, with <italic>local</italic> and <italic>distant</italic> QTLs being more robust to threshold stringency than <italic>trans</italic> QTLs. However, 85‚Äì95% of the genes regulated by <italic>distant</italic> variants, were also regulated by <italic>local</italic> variants, suggesting that most of the <italic>distant</italic> QTLs reflect <italic>local</italic> signals emulated at a distance as a result of wide-ranging LD, rather than independent regulatory elements. In contrast, 70% of the <italic>trans</italic> interactions involved genes lacking <italic>local</italic> signal over the entire set of thresholds. Since <italic>distant</italic> regulation was mostly redundant to <italic>local</italic>, and it would be very difficult to determine whether that signal is a result of independent regulation versus extended LD, we chose to focus our analysis on <italic>trans</italic> and <italic>local</italic> interactions only, defining <italic>trans</italic> as trans-chromosomal interactions. If we look at regulation types over a¬†wide range of thresholds, the <italic>local</italic> signal predominates at the more stringent thresholds reflecting the larger typical effect size in this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We identified <italic>local</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> QTLs for all expressed feature types, with the most common being eQTLs and isoQTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, while we used kinship matrix specific for our strains, still several genes in our dataset show extensive <italic>trans</italic> regulation (horizontal lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) suggesting a residual influence of population structure on our mapping results. We also note that regulation of gene expression often occurs at the gene level, than at transcript specific levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15614.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Genetic regulation of expression in the mouse hypothalamus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Number of genes affected by t<italic>rans</italic> (blue), <italic>local</italic> (yellow) or both (striped) variants as a function of statistical threshold.

Recently, several studies have exploited the single base resolution of RNA-Seq to examine this assumption. RNA-Seq permits the identification allele expression (ASE), a hallmark of functional <italic>cis</italic> acting regulation, in heterozygotes, such as humans or in mouse F1s. Notably, these studies generally show poor concordance between ASE ratios and previously identified <italic>local</italic> eQTLs, which had been attributed mostly to different technical aspects of RNAseq and ASE analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hasin-Brumshtein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lappalainen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grundberg et al., 2012</xref>). To examine the concordance between <italic>local</italic> eQTLs obtained from ASE and genome-wide association, we performed RNA-Seq on brain tissue from 20 mice representing two F1 crosses between three of the classical inbred strains used to construct the HMDP. The parental strains were C57Bl/6 (B), A/J (A) and C3H (H), and the F1 offspring were BxA and HxB. We compared the effect size of ~2600 <italic>local</italic> eQTLs, to the average ASE effect in both crosses. While <italic>local</italic> eQTLs were significantly positively correlated with ASE (p&lt;2E-16) correlation estimates were modest (R<sup>2¬†</sup>=¬†0.2), and lower than between the ASEs in the two sets of F1 mice (R<sup>2¬†</sup>=¬†0.4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>RNA-Seq shows extensive alternative splicing in the hypothalamus, with complex regulation pattern</title><p>Using a previously established pipeline for analysis of alternative splicing events, SUPPA (see Materials¬†and¬†methods), we identified 7564 alternative splicing events affecting 3599 genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). An alternative first exon was most common, accounting for the majority of alternative splicing events with several genes exhibiting multiple alternative first exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For other types of events, each most often affected one gene, with some of the genes exhibiting a combination of alternative splicing events. The extent of alternative splicing in each sample was quantified as a¬†percent spliced in (PSI) of every event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This quantification can be regarded as a quantitative trait; however, the distribution of PSI for every type of event suggests an excess of 0 or 1 values (never or always spliced in, respectively <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This observation is consistent with alternative splicing being often bimodal rather than a normally distributed continuous measure (e.g. present or absent splice site), however, it also shows that quantitative regulation plays a significant role in ratio of isoforms that arise from the¬†inclusion or exclusion of a splicing event.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15614.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Alternative splicing in the mouse hypothalamus.</title><p>Alternative splicing events were classified (see Materials and methods) into 7 types: alternative 3‚Äô splice (A3, blue), alternative 5‚Äô splice (A5, purple), alternative first exon (AF, orange), alternative last exon (AL, brown), mutually exclusive exons (MX, black), retained intron (RI, green), and skipped exon (SE, dark red).

However, surprisingly, peak SNPs in the chr15 hotspot (SNPs rs31703733 and rs31780670) are located within a H3K4me1 histone methylation mark associated with enhancers, and which was detected in all neuronal tissues probed by ENCODE in adult mice (cortex, cerebellum, olfactory bulb), but not in other metabolic tissues such as liver, heart, intestine or lung (UCSC genome browser). Based on this preliminary and indirect evidence one may hypothesize that rs31703733 and rs31780670 potentially affect the¬†enhancer activity and the expression of nearby genes.

We also used length and open reading frame criteria to examine the novel loci. Notably, the RNA length criteria of &gt;200¬†bp is a commonly accepted parameter, while the length of minimal potential open reading frame varies between 30‚Äì100 aa in different studies. Based on these criteria we can identify up to 129 potentially novel lincRNAs expressed in the mouse hypothalamus, with 49 of them being spliced.

For example, myeloid differentiation primary response 88 factor (Myd88), is a Toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor molecule. This protein mediates fatty acid induced inflammation and leads to leptin and insulin resistance in the central nervous system. Mice with CNS specific deletion of Myd88, are protected from high fat diet induced weight gain, and development of leptin resistance induced by acute central application of palmitate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kleinridders et al., 2009</xref>). Our data show that there is a strong eQTL (p value 1.9e‚Äì17, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>) modulating expression of Myd88. In addition, we detect genetic variations that affect expression of key molecules such as leptin receptor (LepR) and Pomc. Together, these data suggest that the genetic background of inbred mice is an important factor in functional studies, and that the results of molecular perturbations of hypothalamic metabolic pathways can be modulated by genetics.</p><p>In addition to exploring the links between genetic variation and expression traits, we also looked into the association of transcript levels with phenotypes. We confirmed known relationships ‚Äì for example the expression of orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) was associated with total body mass (pvalue¬†=¬†2.4e‚Äì6). Interestingly, one of the strongest correlations we observed were between fractalkine receptor Cx3cr1 and fat mass response (p¬†=¬†9.62E‚Äì10). Fractalkine (Cx3cl1) is a chemokine, that was recently implicated in diet induced obesity, insulin regulation and promotion of hypothalamic inflammatory response to fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shah et al., 2015</xref>). However, different models of Cx3cr1 knockout mice resulted in variable results on diet induced obesity. The correlation we found is consistent with previous reports that identify a central role for fractalkine receptor Cx3cr1 as a regulator of diet induced obesity and hypothlamic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee¬†et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morari et al., 2014</xref>).

We identify thousands of new isoforms, and &gt;400 new genes, and show independent support for these being translated into protein, which further validates our data. Notably, transcription of pseudogenes had been noticed previously, and likely plays a role in gene regulation. Recent shotgun proteomic studies of the human proteome strongly suggest that a sizable fraction of pseudogenes and lncRNAs is translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ji et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). The peptide data from our study supports low level translation of processed pseudogenes and is in line with these results.</p><p>The hypothalamus is a highly heterogeneous tissue with multiple nuclei and cell types acting in concert. A recent RNA-seq study of fed and food-deprived mice showed that cell type specific transcripts in hypothalamic Agrp and Pomc neurons exhibited specific co-expression networks associated with feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henry et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, due to the¬†practical constrains of the study, our data were collected on the entire hypothalamus, and as such would be less sensitive to cell type specific signals. Nevertheless, expression of cell-specific markers and functional molecules showed that our approach recapitulates known correlations between genes and metabolic phenotypes, and identifies new ones. In addition, our data capture the various non neuronal cell types, such as microglia or astrocytes, which are often overlooked in the mostly neuron focused studies of the hypothalamus. These cells are important mediators of hypothalamic inflammation and other processes induced by a high fat diet. Regulation of gene expression in this population impacts every aspect of metabolism. While cell type specific transcriptomics is valuable for understanding cellular processes in hypothalamic neurons, our data provide a robust framework recapitulating transcriptional processes affecting multiple cell populations. Our approach is thus complementary to the cell type-specific transcriptomic efforts.</p><p>In this study, we showed extensive genetic regulation of transcription and alternative splicing in the hypothalamus and identified two loci which influence transcription of hundreds of genes in <italic>trans</italic>. In addition, our data indicate that a considerable proportion of the new isoforms and transcripts are significantly correlated to physiological phenotypes. While human studies generally lack the power to address <italic>trans</italic> regulation on a genome-wide scale, the HMDP provides a powerful resource for such analysis. Indeed, we identified two very strong <italic>trans</italic> acting hotspots that seem to harbor major regulators of gene expression in hypothalamus. We suggest that the <italic>trans</italic> effects of genetic variation in these regions are likely mediated by <italic>local</italic> interactions, which is consistent with previously observed cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Small et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinig¬†et al., 2010</xref>). Enrichment analyses clearly suggest that each <italic>trans</italic> eQTLs hotspot regulates a set of functionally enriched genes (e.g. the hotspot on chromosome 15 is strongly associated with ion transport in synaptic areas) suggesting a new link between genetic variants in these loci and specific cellular function. We further showed that the genes associated with these hotspots correlate to physiological phenotypes, such as HDL and triglyceride levels providing insight into the mechanism behind correlation of these genotypes with complex traits. The connection between the associated genes and traits does not imply direct causality. For example, ion transport is regulated by circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ko et al.,¬†2009</xref>), which in turn is associated with many other aspects of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsuneki et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Notably, although several examples of <italic>trans</italic> eQTL hotspots were published and analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Small et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinig et al., 2010</xref>;¬†<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tian et al., 2016</xref>), authenticity of such hotspots remains somewhat controversial, and <italic>trans</italic> eQTL hotspots may arise due to uncontrolled batch effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breitling et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joo et al., 2014</xref>), which are difficult to distinguish from real interactions. To minimize technical batch effects arising from sequencing, we used a¬†round robin approach where each sample was sequenced as part of several pools (see details in Materials and methods). Batch effects may also arise from random environmental exposures, rather than technical sample preparation. In such case, it is unlikely that those effects would be tissue specific or affect only gene level analysis. We found no indication of these <italic>trans</italic> eQTL hotspots in the adipose or liver data from the same cohort of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parks et al., 2013</xref>), nor were the hotspots detected for isoQTL. Thus, while we cannot exclude the possibility that <italic>trans</italic> eQTL hotspots described in this study may had arisen from unaccounted environmental or technical effects, we believe that this is unlikely, but further molecular studies are required to validate our results.</p><p>RNA-Seq allowed us to quantify transcripts at different levels of analysis- from the¬†total expression of all isoforms in a locus, to transcript specific estimates and their combinations. Our analysis showed that regulation of the total number of transcripts from a gene is far more common than isoform specific regulation. Nevertheless, we were able to identify specific interactions at every level of detail we explored, namely eQTLs, isoQTLs, tssQTLs and cdsQTLs. In addition, we identified and quantified &gt;7000 alternative splicing events affecting &gt;3500 genes in the hypothalamus, and showed that these events are mostly affected by extensive <italic>local</italic> genetic regulation. In many cases of alternative splicing QTLs, the associated variant resulted in an excess of either 0 or 1 splice PSI values, suggesting that variants affecting splicing act as strong determinants rather than weak contributors to a complex trait.</p><p>RNA editing is a result of post transcriptional deamination processes whereby an adenosine is converted to inosine (A-to-I), or cytosine to uracil (C-to-U). Both types of RNA editing are mediated by specific enzymes members of the ADAR family facilitate the A-to-I editing which is most commonly observed in neuronal tissues, while Apobec1 mediates the C-to-U editing, and is primarily expressed in the intestine and liver. Editing is a tissue specific process which usually results in modification of only fraction of the transcripts, and therefore can be regarded as a quantitative trait. Previous studies showed that polymorphisms either in the editing enzymes or in the sequence proximal to editing site affect the extent of editing. Specifically, Gu et al recently reported a sequence variant in Apobec1 which affects in <italic>trans</italic> multiple C-to-U editing sites in the mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gu et al., 2015</xref>). As expected from previous studies, A-to-I was by far the most common RNA editing event in our study. Further, our data show that RNA editing occurs at low levels in thousands of sites, but is highly variable. Less than &lt;1% of the sites were consistently detected in the adult mouse brain across &gt;75% HMDP strains. Consistent with the lack of coding genetic variation in the ADAR enzymes in our mouse panel, and with their invariable expression levels, we did not observe any <italic>trans</italic> editing QTL that would affect editing levels of multiple sites. However, we found a few local associations that seem to affect editing of specific sites. For example a strong <italic>local</italic> editing QTL (p&lt;e‚Äì7) was observed for one of the editing sites in the <italic>Ociad1</italic> gene (also known as <italic>Asrij</italic>). This editing QTL is likely due to a sequence variant in or near the <italic>Ociad1</italic> gene. Notably, <italic>Ociad1</italic> is expressed in stem cells, where it regulates pleuropotency via the JAK/STAT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sinha et al., 2013</xref>). Editing of <italic>Ociad1</italic> or its expression in neuronal tissue was not reported before.</p><p>Another significant aspect of our data relates to long non-coding RNAs. LincRNAs have been shown to play an important role in various cellar functions. Recent genome annotations include thousands of known lincRNAs, yet most of them remain functionally uncharacterized, and only a¬†few studies have examined the¬†genetic control of their expression in detail. Moreover, lincRNAs are often expressed in a tissue specific manner, and therefore are not readily identifiable from general expression datasets. In this study, we detected expression of 381 known and novel lincRNA isoforms, and also identified 129 novel, potentially hypothalamus- specific lincRNAs. Our data indicate that lincRNAs are subject to similar variation in expression, and exhibit similar overall genetic control as the coding genes. Specific lincRNAs have been implicated in a¬†variety of phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guttman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huarte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>), and our data indicate strong correlations between some of the hypothalamic lincRNAs and metabolic phenotypes, such as body weight.</p><p>The hypothalamus is a very heterogeneous tissue, and one of the major drawbacks of our analysis is that we used whole hypothalamus, rather than dissecting specific nuclei. This limitation stems from practical considerations ‚Äì¬†meaningful expression QTL analysis requires sacrifice of hundreds of mice, while the¬†dissection of specific hypothalamic nuclei is delicate and time consuming and thus was not feasible within the constraints of this study. Still, this shortcoming is likely to limit our power to detect meaningful associations, rather than introducing spurious ones. Moreover, since our study mostly focuses on genetic regulation of transcription, which was shown to be largely shared among tissues and cell types, we believe that the data presented in this work are not substantially confounded by heterogeneity.</p><p>To summarize, our data fill a substantial gap and will be useful to the research community. The hypothalamus is composed of multiple nuclei, which are distinct in morphology and function, and many laboratories focus on disentangling the complex interactions that ultimately affect metabolism and behavior. However, genome wide transcriptome analysis of this tissue has not been published, and genetic regulation of transcription as well as tissue specific transcripts remains largely obscure. We believe that our study is complimentary to physiological studies and will facilitate research into the crosstalk between the brain and other metabolic tissues. All of the expression data described in this paper are publicly available from NCBI archives GEO (GSE79551) and SRA (project number PRJNA314533).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Samples, library preparation and sequencing</title><p>Altogether we sequenced 285 samples, from 99 strains of the HMDP.

All samples were barcoded, and sequenced with ~18 samples per lane, with HiSeq2000 using 50¬†bp paired-end sequencing protocol. A round robin design was implemented such that biological replicates were sequenced on different lanes, and each sample was part of more than one sequencing pool.

The average number of reads per sample was 26.3¬†M. All reads were passed to mapping as is, without trimming or filtering. Samples were mapped to the mm10 genome using STAR aligner version 2.3.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/releases/tag/STAR_2.3.1z9">https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/releases/tag/STAR_2.3.1z9</ext-link>).

Alignment files from all samples of the same strain were merged into one alignment file per strain using the 'merge' function of the samtools package. On average 94.1% of the reads mapped, and of the mapped reads 96.4% mapped uniquely. STAR also detected on average 2.8¬†M splices per sample, with 98% of them previously annotated.

We implemented 3 filtering steps:</p><p>First, we removed transcripts that are likely to be an¬†assembly or sequencing artifacts, based on following criteria:</p><p>Comparison to GENECODE M2 indicated that this is not a known transcript (class code '='), new isoform of a known gene (class code 'j') or novel intergenic transcript (class code 'u').</p><p>b.

While we consider that all these features may potentially represent true splicing and transcription events, only features that show sufficient variation and expressed at appreciable level are useful in eQTL analysis. Further, many of the potentially new features were expressed either at very low levels or in a small number of samples. Therefore, at the second filtering step we implemented detection and expression thresholds (FPKM&gt;0 in &gt;=100 samples, and FPKM&gt;1 in &gt;=50 samples) to focus on ~100,000 expressed features that are more likely to produce meaningful mapping results in the HMDP panel.</p><p>Third, expression values (FPKM) of transcription start sites, coding sequences and genes are a sum of expression values of transcripts associated with these features. Consequently, if a locus, transcription start site or coding sequence is associated with only one transcript, the expression information of that feature is identical and thus redundant to the respective transcript. Therefore, such features were removed from eQTL mapping.</p><p>Altogether, this filtering reduced the number of explored features to ~ 93,000.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Allele-specific expression and cis eQTL</title><p>All features that passed the described above filtering criteria, were analyzed for eQTLs using expression estimates in 282 individual mice representing 100 strains, 193,400 SNPs and the fastLMM algorithm using an appropriate kinship matrix that accounts for the¬†HMDP population structure. <italic>Cis</italic> acting eQTLs were identified by allele expression (ASE) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hasin-Brumshtein et al., 2014</xref>).

We then detected likely mismatch positions considering the read sequence quality score at that position and its position within in a read. We further required potential editing sites to be covered by &gt;=5 total and &gt;=3 edited reads and excluded positions that overlap SNPs or are located in homopolymers, simple repeats, and within 4nts of splice junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee¬†et¬†al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>LC-MS proteomics</title><p>Proteomic data were collected on 110 samples representing the 99 strains used in this study, plus 10 C57Bl/6 samples.

Upon denaturation for 1‚Äâhr at 37¬∞C the extracted protein concentrations were measured using coomassie assay and readjusted using aforementioned denaturation buffer to 1.5 mg/ml. Equal aliquots of 150 Œºg were taken further into cysteine alkylation and trypsin digestion steps. After purification of peptides by solid phase extraction using C18 columns the average recovered peptide amount was 68 Œºg. The resulting peptide solutions were normalized to 0.5 Œºg/ŒºL for LC-MS/MS analysis</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Instrumental analysis</title><p>Samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) that was interfaced with a 75 Œºm i.d.√ó65 cm long LC column packed with 3 Œºm Jupiter C18 particles (Phenomenex) and a 5 ŒºL injection loop. The mobile phase solvents consisted of (A) 0.2% acetic acid and 0.05% TFA in water and (B) 0.1% TFA in 90% acetonitrile.

The fasta file included sequences of known genes, newly discovered isoforms and novel genes. The MSGFplus MS/MS search settings were as follows: tryptic peptides only, 10 ppm parent ion mass tolerance, static cysteine carbamylation and maximum charge state 4+. The resulting mzIdentML files were analyzed using MSnID Bioconductor package [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSnID.html">http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSnID.html</ext-link>] to confidently isolate identifications of know genes, isoforms and novel genes. The prior probabilities that the know genes, isoforms and novel genes are real and exist in the protein form are substantially different. Therefore the corresponding identifications were considered separately employing a process effectively emulating the proposed earlier cascade search [26084232]. Briefly, in the first pass we considered peptide identifications matching only to the protein sequences of the known genes (highest prior probability). The filtering criteria on peptide-to-spectrum matching (Spectrum E-Value &lt;9.4e-11 and parent ion mass measurement tolerance &lt;2.4 ppm) were optimized to achieve maximum peptide identifications whilst not exceeding 1% FDR based on reverse sequence identifications. Next, the spectra that match confidently identified 9910 peptide sequences of the known genes were removed from further consideration. In the next round we applied filtering criteria (Spectrum E-Value &lt;2.5e‚Äì13 and parent ion mass measurement tolerance &lt;10 ppm) that allowed to confidently identify 236 unique peptide sequences matching to isoforms. After further removing peptides matching to isoforms and applying 1% FDR optimized criteria (Spectrum E-Value &lt;2.3e‚Äì9 and parent ion mass measurement tolerance &lt;0.2 ppm) we identified 20 peptide sequences matching novel genes.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>YH-B, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>AHK, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>FH, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>CP, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>BWP, Acquisition of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>VAP, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>PDP, Acquisition of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>AB, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>MP, Conception and design</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>XX, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>EE, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>RDS, Conception and design, Acquisition of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>AJL, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>DJS, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: The animal protocol for the study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at University of California, Los Angeles.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="SD1-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15614.016</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Annotations of novel genes and samples.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Annotation of novel genes and transcripts Basic annotation data of all transcripts classified as 'new locus' (class code¬†=¬†u).Data includes tracking ID of the transcript and gene, locus position, number of samples where transcript is detected (FPKM&gt;1e-6) and number of samples where transcript is expressed (FPKM &gt;1), mean expression across all samples and if gene arises from uniquely mapped reads.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mark McCarthy as the Senior Editor. One of the three reviewers has agreed to reveal her identity: Penelope Bonnen (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While all of the reviewers found your data to be of potential interest, they all raised substantive concerns regarding both study design and data presentation. The consensus was that addressing all of these issues would entail substantial work. As you may know, one of the goals of <italic>eLife</italic> is to avoid protracted cycles of &quot;long-loop&quot; revision, and this means that we try to avoid any recommendations for revision that are likely to take longer than a few weeks.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>1) Trans eQTL hotspots analysis is nicely done and the authors relate two well-supported and interesting examples of trans eQTLs. Two comments for this section. Firstly, the method used to identify regions of trans eQTLs was blind to LD; a simple distance (100 kb) based bin was used and the number of trans acting SNPs counted. The authors relate that a 'hotspot' of trans acting SNPs contained several SNPs in LD with each other. This approach is valid, but may skew results to identify regions with a larger number of trans acting SNPs because of the underlying LD structure. In this case LD helps to identify these regions. However, there may be regions with less LD but still strong trans acting SNPs; using the method these regions will be de-emphasized, not due to the strength of trans acting elements but rather due to LD architecture of the genome. The authors may wish to mention this. Second, poorly annotated regions of the genome are not devoid of functional elements and it may be a bit of an overstatement to say the eQTL SNPs in these regions are unlikely to be causative.</p><p>2) Which lincRNAs were included in the association testing between lincRNAs and HMDP phenotypes? Were both the 381 plus 129 novel tested? In particular it would be interesting to clarify if any of the 129 newly identified lincRNAs associate with HMDP phenotypes. This reviewer found this sentence a little confusing 'none of these lincRNA were previously reported in the hypothalmus'; does this mean they all belonged to the group of 129 novel lincRNAs? Were these 129 totally novel or simply not previously known to be expressed in the hypothalamus? Some clarification would be helpful and would emphasize the findings that are particular to this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic> </p><p>Please include the top 500 transcripts that associate with a phenotype in supplemental materials listed along with transcript ID, phenotype, and p-value. These are referred to in the first paragraph of the subsection ‚ÄúAssociation of hypothalamic expression and phenotypes‚Äù and are a valuable work product of this study. As such readers may benefit from this information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript focuses on a detailed analysis of hypothalamic transcriptomes from 99 mouse strains to among many things identify eQTL, spicing eQTL and novel non-coding genes and their relationship to metabolic and cardiovascular traits. Many of the aspects of the relevance or tissue-specific findings pertaining to hypothalamus were not well clarified leading to a concern with the overall study design. Many of the analyses suffer from potential interpretation or technical flaws limiting my enthusiasm.</p><p>A key feature of the manuscript is the identification of numerous novel isoforms and genes. It is an exceptional feature that the authors are able to confirm their data using peptide data. However, most of these are pseudogenes when manual characterized against NCBI and UCSC. Is this simply a deficiency in the GENCODE M2 annotation? Further, can the authors discount mismapped reads from highly homologous sequences to these pseudogenes. Key aspects of this pipeline are not well presented and I am very skeptical of the &quot;novelty&quot; of the set of genes they have found or even their relevance to the hypothalamus in specific let alone any hypothalamus specific function. Criteria for tissue-specificity should further be better described.</p><p>The distal eQTL information provides no extra information. Indeed, the authors themselves describe it as most likely a local signal.</p><p>The correlation of ASE and eQTL is a technical feature that has been reported in several other papers. It shouldn't be listed as a major feature of the manuscript and would be better as supplemental information.</p><p>The authors derive their own ASE approach using DEseq. This is not a conventional approach for this tool. Other published ASE-specific software exists. Can the authors explain why they did it this way?</p><p>How correlated are ASE sites within a gene? Does this support site aggregation for a gene-centric approach?</p><p>Trans-eQTLs can be spurious due to the chance correlation of a genetic marker with technical factors such as batch or biological factors such as sex or BMI. The authors do not provide enough detail/experimentation as to make these effects believable as true trans-eQTLs compared to spurious correlations.</p><p>Furthermore, for RNA-seq data many 1-1 trans-eQTLs can be the product of mismapping and are clearly identified when looking at the distribution of reads across a gene model in a tool like IGV.</p><p>The comment on rs31703733 is very speculative. The authors should prove that this is the case otherwise, I am not sure there is anything that can be definitely said about trans-eQTLs in this manuscript.</p><p>Some of the statements in the manuscript could benefit from more formally described multiple testing correction or an FDR. For instance &quot;35% of lincRNA.‚Ä¶ significantly (p&lt;1e-3) correlate to at least one phenotype in the HMDP&quot;. If I do some rudimentary correction assuming 150 traits, I am not sure this is a significant finding. This is an issue for the trait analysis of the novel transcripts too.</p><p>How believable are the non A-to-G modification? Is 30% an expected number?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Hasin-Brumshtein and coauthors provide a systems-level analysis of hypothalamic gene expression, its regulation by genetic elements, and its association with metabolic phenotypes. The hypothalamus is composed of diverse and distributed neuronal subpopulations that control multiple aspects of metabolic homeostasis. Here, the authors test the hypothesis that differences in hypothalamic gene expression in a hybrid mouse diversity panel (HMDP) may influence the sensitivity of particular strains to phenotypes associated with diet-induced obesity.

The consensus was that addressing all of these issues would entail substantial work. As you may know, one of the goals of eLife is to avoid protracted cycles of &quot;long-loop&quot; revision, and this means that we try to avoid any recommendations for revision that are likely to take longer than a few weeks.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Trans eQTL hotspots analysis is nicely done and the authors relate two well-supported and interesting examples of trans eQTLs. Two comments for this section. Firstly, the method used to identify regions of trans eQTLs was blind to LD; a simple distance (100 kb) based bin was used and the number of trans acting SNPs counted. The authors relate that a 'hotspot' of trans acting SNPs contained several SNPs in LD with each other. This approach is valid, but may skew results to identify regions with a larger number of trans acting SNPs because of the underlying LD structure. In this case LD helps to identify these regions. However, there may be regions with less LD but still strong trans acting SNPs; using the method these regions will be de-emphasized, not due to the strength of trans acting elements but rather due to LD architecture of the genome. The authors may wish to mention this. Second, poorly annotated regions of the genome are not devoid of functional elements and it may be a bit of an overstatement to say the eQTL SNPs in these regions are unlikely to be causative.</italic> </p><p>We are glad that reviewer found our trans eQTL analysis interesting. Regarding the LD comments, we agree that stronger and longer LD will increase the number of SNPs associated in trans, however it is not likely to increase the number of genes associated with each bin, since essentially linked SNPs will be capturing the same interactions. In our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) we counted the number of different genes associated with any SNP in the bin, and not (as reviewer seems to suggest) the number of trans acting SNPs, thus we believe LD does not significantly impact our identification of hotspots. We are sorry for this confusion, and rewrote the relevant sentences to better clarify our approach (subsection ‚ÄúGenetic regulation of gene expression‚Äù), and made it clearer in the Discussion as well.</p><p><italic>2) Which lincRNAs were included in the association testing between lincRNAs and HMDP phenotypes? Were both the 381 plus 129 novel tested? In particular it would be interesting to clarify if any of the 129 newly identified lincRNAs associate with HMDP phenotypes. This reviewer found this sentence a little confusing 'none of these lincRNA were previously reported in the hypothalmus'; does this mean they all belonged to the group of 129 novel lincRNAs? Were these 129 totally novel or simply not previously known to be expressed in the hypothalamus? Some clarification would be helpful and would emphasize the findings that are particular to this study.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments, and have rewritten the section to clarify these points (subsection ‚ÄúLong non-coding RNAs in the mouse hypothalamus‚Äù).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic> </p><p><italic>Please include the top 500 transcripts that associate with a phenotype in supplemental materials listed along with transcript ID, phenotype, and p-value. These are referred to in the first paragraph of the subsection ‚ÄúAssociation of hypothalamic expression and phenotypes‚Äù and are a valuable work product of this study. As such readers may benefit from this information.</italic> </p><p>We have added the requested file to the supplementary material (Supplementary file 5).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This manuscript focuses on a detailed analysis of hypothalamic transcriptomes from 99 mouse strains to among many things identify eQTL, spicing eQTL and novel non-coding genes and their relationship to metabolic and cardiovascular traits. Many of the aspects of the relevance or tissue-specific findings pertaining to hypothalamus were not well clarified leading to a concern with the overall study design. Many of the analyses suffer from potential interpretation or technical flaws limiting my enthusiasm.</italic> </p><p><italic>A key feature of the manuscript is the identification of numerous novel isoforms and genes. It is an exceptional feature that the authors are able to confirm their data using peptide data. However, most of these are pseudogenes when manual characterized against NCBI and UCSC. Is this simply a deficiency in the GENCODE M2 annotation? Further, can the authors discount mismapped reads from highly homologous sequences to these pseudogenes. Key aspects of this pipeline are not well presented and I am very skeptical of the &quot;novelty&quot; of the set of genes they have found or even their relevance to the hypothalamus in specific let alone any hypothalamus specific function. Criteria for tissue-specificity should further be better described.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In the manuscript we present several types of analysis suggesting that the genomic properties of the novel genes, as identified compared to GENCODE M2, are similar to the genomic properties of known non coding transcripts. Specifically, distributions of their potential reading frame length and their splicing pattern indicate that for the most part the novel transcripts would be expected to be non coding and therefore not expected in the peptide data. Thus we did not find it surprising that the very few peptides matching exclusively novel genes can be attributed to pseudogenes. In our opinion this does not imply that the majority of novel transcribed genes are pseudogenes rather that they are probably not translated. We have made this point more clearly in the revised manuscript (subsection ‚ÄúHypothalamic gene expression and proteomic data reveals multiple new isoforms and novel genes‚Äù, third paragraph).</p><p>Regarding the reviewers question whether this presents a deficiency in M2 annotation, we would like to add that unlike genome sequence versions, genome annotations tend to develop quite rapidly. For some time GENCODE has released a new set of annotations for the mouse genome every few months. It is impractical to reanalyze the entire dataset every time a new annotation is released. We therefore focused our analysis on M2, which was the annotation we used for our genome indexing and read mapping.</p><p>The reviewer raised a question as to whether the expression of novel genes can be attributed to multi-mapped reads. We addressed that question by re-estimating abundances in 3 C57BL/6 samples, using uniquely mapped reads only. Indeed, some of the novel genes (and known genes) show low uniqueness. However, the peptide data supports expression of both uniquely mapped genes and those that arise from multimapping. This observation indicates that a high percentage of multimapping does not necessarily equate to an artifact. We therefore added uniqueness of mapping as an annotation of novel genes and expanded the relevant text to include this analysis (subsection ‚ÄúHypothalamic gene expression and proteomic data reveals multiple new isoforms and novel genes‚Äù, last paragraph and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>We agree that tissue specificity of these transcripts cannot be defined based on our data alone, and intend to suggest it as one of the possible explanations. We thank the reviewer for raising this concern, and have rephrased that part of the manuscript to better reflect other potential explanations (Results).</p><p>We also thank the reviewer for pointing out that the pipeline is not described in sufficient detail. We have now added a more detailed description, supplementing the already described software versions and specific command lines in the Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>The distal eQTL information provides no extra information. Indeed, the authors themselves describe it as most likely a local signal.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that distal eQTLs are redundant to local. Distal eQTLs are only mentioned in our manuscript for the sake of completeness (how we selected the eQTLs for analysis). The distal loci were completely excluded from any QTL analysis. We now made this point clearer (Results).</p><p><italic>The correlation of ASE and eQTL is a technical feature that has been reported in several other papers. It shouldn't be listed as a major feature of the manuscript and would be better as supplemental information.</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors derive their own ASE approach using DEseq. This is not a conventional approach for this tool. Other published ASE-specific software exists. Can the authors explain why they did it this way?</italic> </p><p><italic>How correlated are ASE sites within a gene? Does this support site aggregation for a gene-centric approach?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that ASE is secondary to our results and have moved the ASE analysis to supplementary material. Concerning our choice of method for ASE analysis, we would like to point out that while we indeed created this approach to ASE, the method was not developed for this study and is not novel. In fact, we published this approach in BMC Genomics (Hasin-Brumshtein et al. 2014), with full details and extensive analysis of concordance of ASE within biologically relevant units (exons, transcripts, and genes). The paper also showed that aggregation of ASE signal over haplotype improves specificity of the results (as compared to single SNP). Therefore, since this approach was already developed in our laboratory, published in peer reviewed journal and readily accessible, we chose to use it for the ASE analysis in this paper as well.</p><p><italic>Trans-eQTLs can be spurious due to the chance correlation of a genetic marker with technical factors such as batch or biological factors such as sex or BMI. The authors do not provide enough detail/experimentation as to make these effects believable as true trans-eQTLs compared to spurious correlations.</italic> </p><p><italic>Furthermore, for RNA-seq data many 1-1 trans-eQTLs can be the product of mismapping and are clearly identified when looking at the distribution of reads across a gene model in a tool like IGV.</italic> </p><p><italic>The comment on rs31703733 is very speculative. The authors should prove that this is the case otherwise, I am not sure there is anything that can be definitely said about trans-eQTLs in this manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We concur that many of the 1-1 trans interactions may represent spurious results, even when stringent thresholds are used. However, trans eQTL hotspots are much less likely to represent a technical artifact, or a spurious association since that possibility would require the coincidence of multiple artifacts in non-random manner. Thus we only discuss in depth the two trans eQTL hotspots, and do not consider any 1-1 trans eQTLs.</p><p>Mapping artifacts are not generally random and might result in false positive signals. Indeed, as the reviewer suggested, it is possible to inspect any given gene for mapping artifacts in IGV or other visualization tools. However, we find it impractical to go manually through the 900 genes associated with one of the 2 hotspots in this way. Thus to address this issue, we assessed whether mapping artifacts or multi mappers significantly contribute to expression levels of the genes in trans eQTL hotspots. To this end we re-estimated the expression of all transcripts in 3 samples, using only high quality mapping scores (mapping quality =255, corresponding to the highest mapping score and unique mapping). Expression levels estimated by this procedure did not change much (correlation values were &gt;0.96 for all genes) showing that mapping artifacts are not likely to account for the variation in expression levels of the trans eQTL hotspots.</p><p>The reviewer raises an important concern about potential confounding factors such as sex, BMI and batch effects. First we would like to point out that all of the mice used in this study were males, of the same age and treated with exactly the same protocol. Thus we consider sex age and treatment not to be major confounders of trans-eQTL mapping. Batch effects can arise from two sources in our data, one is the sequencing process, and the other is mice housing conditions. To minimize the batch effects of sequencing we used a round robin design, where we distributed every sample over 3-4 lanes of sequencing, and biological replicates were largely distributed over different lanes, such that no individual strain data was the result of a single lane sequencing. While ideally we would like to pool all samples into one library and sequence that library as many times as need to achieve desired coverage, this was not technically possible because the number of available barcodes is smaller than the number of samples. The other source of batch effects may arise from mouse housing conditions, although great care was taken to match these as well as possible. Still, mice are housed in cages by strain, and work load in a large study like this is invariably distributed over a period of time, thus not all cages are treated on exactly the same days. These factors typically are considered minor in mouse eQTL studies compared to the effects of genetic variance on gene expression, and cannot be fully addressed in a practical manner for eQTL mapping.</p><p>Finally the reviewer points out that location of rs31703733 in an enhancer specific to neuronal cells is not strong evidence for its potentially causative role in changes in gene expression. We agree that this is a weak evidence, however we believe that combining several lines of evidence is an important aspect of using our data as resource. We therefore did not remove that point, but rewrote the Results and Discussion in a more reserved manner to convey the issues more clearly (subsection ‚ÄúTrans eQTL hotspots‚Äù, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>Some of the statements in the manuscript could benefit from more formally described multiple testing correction or an FDR. For instance &quot;35% of lincRNA.‚Ä¶ significantly (p&lt;1e-3) correlate to at least one phenotype in the HMDP&quot;. If I do some rudimentary correction assuming 150 traits, I am not sure this is a significant finding. This is an issue for the trait analysis of the novel transcripts too.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the need for clarification. Association analysis was performed using linear mixed models (Fast-LMM, Lippert et al., 2011), which corrects for the population structure in our data. Statistical thresholds used in this work were determined as 5% FDR by permutations and modeling in previous eQTL and association studies conducted within HMDP (Parks et al. 2015, Bennet et al. 2010). We now added this point explicitly to the Results section to better explain our choice. Importantly, since many of the metabolic phenotypes are not independent, and are significantly correlated, the rudimentary approach suggested by the reviewer would be overly stringent.</p><p><italic>How believable are the non A-to-G modification? Is 30% an expected number?</italic> </p><p>A-to-G modifications and C-to-T modifications (another canonical type of editing catalyzed by APOBEC), together make up ~78% of the detected RNA-DNA differences (RDD) when requiring a minimum of 5 total and 3 edited reads covering the editing position.</p><p>Since the paired-end RNA-seq reads are non-strand specific and we used known gene annotations to assign strand, it is likely that some reads originating from un-annotated genes were assigned to a known gene located on the opposite strand. In this case, A-to-G editing events would be identified as T-to-C mismatches, which make up ~8% of the RDD sites and represent the second largest type of nucleotide conversions. Similarly, G-to-A modifications (~6% of sites) could potentially reflect C-to-T editing due to reads assigned to the opposite strand. Together, the four types of modifications (A-to-G, C-to-T, T-to-C, G-to-A) constitute ~92% of all detected RDDs.</p><p>However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a few of the non-A-to-G/C-to-T mismatches are indeed SNPs that were not captured in the genotyping data. About 60% of the non-A-to-G and non-C-to-T RDDs were identified in only 1 mouse strain, while only 16% were identified in more than 5 strains. As a comparison, ~44% of A-to-G editing sites were identified in only 1 and ~26% in more than 5 mouse strains.</p><p>Importantly, since many of the non-canonical editing sites are identified in only one strain, the ratio of A-to-G editing sites per strain is much larger than the overall mean ratio. Per strain it ranges between 76-87% and is on average 81%.</p><p>Generally, the fraction of A-to-G editing sites in mouse is observed to be lower than in humans (mouse: 52-56% Lagarrigue et al., Genetics 2013; mouse: ~60% Gu et al., PLoS One 2012; mouse 96% vs. human 95-99% Porath et al., Nat Commun 2014; mouse 15% vs. human 25% Eisenberg et al., Trends Genet 2005), which may partly be explained by the lower density of Alu elements in the mouse genome (Neeman et al. RNA 2006).</p><p>Altogether, we think that the fractions of A-to-G editing sites among all RDDs in our study are as expected and in agreement with previous observations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this manuscript, Hasin-Brumshtein and coauthors provide a systems-level analysis of hypothalamic gene expression, its regulation by genetic elements, and its association with metabolic phenotypes. The hypothalamus is composed of diverse and distributed neuronal subpopulations that control multiple aspects of metabolic homeostasis. Here, the authors test the hypothesis that differences in hypothalamic gene expression in a hybrid mouse diversity panel (HMDP) may influence the sensitivity of particular strains to phenotypes associated with diet-induced obesity. The authors provide two specific examples from their data of transcripts (1 annotated and 1 lincRNA) whose expression correlates with a specific metabolic endpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>).

This reviewer raised several important issues which we would like to address:</p><p>1) We respectfully want clarify what seems to be a conceptual difference between our and reviewer‚Äôs view of this work. Particularly, the reviewer seems to assume that the main focus of our effort should be to identify novel transcripts the expression of which is related to the metabolic phenotypes characterized in the HMDP. However, in our view, the main goal of the manuscript is to provide one of a kind resource for researchers that focus on molecular studies of the hypothalamus, as well as system genetics of metabolism. Our studies provide comprehensive characterization of the hypothalamic transcriptome and examples of how this resource can facilitate testing of existing hypothesis, or generate new ones. The study is aimed at exploratory analysis of hypothalamic transcriptome in the mouse ‚Äì and we hope that it can provide the basis for forming the type of hypothesis the reviewer wishes us to test. We sincerely regret that it was not made clear enough in our manuscript, and have revised the introduction and discussion to reflect this point.</p><p>A major critique from reviewer 3 focuses on a lack of functional validation of our presented examples. We completely agree with the reviewer that an association of gene expression with a particular phenotype does not necessarily imply that those changes play any causative role in the development of the phenotype. Also as the reviewer points out, these expression changes could be, or are even likely to be, reactive. This is a general limitation of the many studies that associate gene expression with phenotypes, and is not unique to this work. Nevertheless, previous studies in humans and mice show that identifying expression changes which correlate with a phenotype can often lead to molecular insights and novel hypothesis that can then be tested in follow up experiments. The specific cases of gene-phenotype associations presented in our manuscript were intended as examples of the utility of our data, not as definitive evidence for novel genes regulating these two phenotypes. As such, we believe that the experimental confirmation of these associations is beyond the scope of this study and should be addressed separately. Importantly, since experimental validation is often time consuming and expensive, we suggest the use of multiple lines of evidence when choosing gene targets for experimental confirmation, rather than relying on the association of gene expression alone. To augment the usability of our results, we have added a section discussing the regulation and association of hypothalamic genes already experimentally implicated in metabolic phenotypes by previous studies in mice, or that are markers of particular processes. We identify the regulatory pathways of some of these genes, and show associations to traits that reflect known biology as well as potentially novel aspects.</p><p>2) The reviewer raises an important question of tissue heterogeneity in the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus contains many distinct nuclei, that are central to regulation of different phenotypes. Indeed, as stated in our Discussion, using the entire hypothalamus for gene expression analysis is one of the major limitations of our study and is dictated by the physical impracticality of dissecting specific nuclei or neurons in hundreds of mice. Yet, we recognize that this is an important limitation, and to better assess how heterogeneity is reflected in our data, we added a section discussing the expression of hypothalamic cell markers, and their relative abundance across strains. We show that well established markers of hypothalamic neurons (such as Agrp, Sf1, or Pomc genes), as well as glial markers are highly expressed in our data and the variation and genetic regulation of these genes is captured. We further show that despite using whole hypothalamus, we are able to recapitulate the expected relations between hypothalamic transcripts and metabolic traits.</p><p>3) Fourth, the reviewer raises a question about whether using only one mouse per strain in 2 of the 99 strains (AxB-12/PgnJ and I/LnJ), is likely to affect the accuracy of our results. We believe that having 2 strains with only one animal out of 99 is highly unlikely to bias our results. However, to address this concern, we used a subset of transcripts to remap eQTLs using only one expression value per strain. This downsampling did not significantly alter our eQTL results. The reviewer also suggests adding additional mice from specific phenotypically diverse inbred strains to enhance the power of the study. We appreciate this suggestion, however our analysis shows that inter-strain variability of gene expression is considerably larger than intra-strain variability. Therefore, increasing the number of individual mice per strain is not likely to increase the power of genetic mapping, as it would not increase the genetic diversity of our sample.</p><p>4) The reviewer asked for more details on mouse husbandry conditions, and the relation between our sample and mice used in the Parks et al., 2013 paper. We are grateful for this comment. The mice used in our study are a subset of mice used in Parks et al. study, although in our work we present analysis of a different tissue (hypothalamus). Therefore, the husbandry conditions, the diet and the obtained phenotypes are exactly as were described in Parks et al. 2013 study. To avoid confusion, we have repeated this point in the Materials and methods section, and also made it more clear in the Introduction.</p><p>[Editors‚Äô note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Hypothalamic transcriptomes of 99 mouse strains reveal trans eQTL hotspots, splicing QTLs and novel non-coding genes&quot; for further consideration at eLife.

The rationale that annotation changes too rapidly (&quot;month-to-month&quot;) is not supported by the Gencode release dates and since the novelty of these transcripts is a major feature, it should be put in line with the latest (2.5y old) annotation. One could simply overlap novel locations with bed files of latest annotations at a minimum.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that M2 is quite outdated, and as suggested compared the novelty of our data to the latest released annotation (GENECODE M10, released January 2016), and find that 50% of our novel genes are novel. Please find the relevant additions in the second paragraph of the subsection ‚ÄúHypothalamic gene expression and proteomic data reveals multiple new isoforms and novel genes‚Äù.</p><p><italic>2) Another issue that remains is the trans-eQTL results as any SNP correlated with a batch effect can appear as a trans-eQTL hotspot. The trans-eqtl on chr15 relevant to ion transport might be reflecting circadian rhythm. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2819050/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2819050/</ext-link> </italic></p><p><italic>The authors should explore this issue in more detail or properly caveat it too.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for these points and agree that we are not able to exclude completely the possibility of unknown batch effects, especially if those would arise from random environmental rather than technical aspects and thus not recorded. However, in our opinion, such factors are unlikely to cause batch effects in a tissue specific manner ‚Äì thus we revisited the liver and adipose eQTL mapping data, from Parks BW 2013, that used the same mice. We do not observe these trans eQTL hotspots in either adipose or liver data. Nonetheless, we now discuss the possibility of this caveat at length in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion section. We also completely agree that the trans effects acting on ion transport, do not necessarily directly cause the associated changes in metabolic profile. These associations are complex, and can be mediated by variety of physiological processes, and indeed circadian rhythm plays a major role in metabolic homeostasis. We thank the reviewer for this comment, and clarified this point in the Discussion (third paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
