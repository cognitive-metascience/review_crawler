Each time a cell divides several millions of histones, small basic proteins that conform nucleosomes, are synthesised and incorporated as the replication machinery copies the genome. Higher eukaryotes are unable to survive without histones and possess several alternative pathways to ensure enough histones during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cook et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Groth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marzluff et al., 2008</xref>). Cells can also modulate cell cycle progression when histones become limiting to ensure the faithful replication of chromatin and avoid genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Groth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Günesdogan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murillo-Pineda et al., 2014</xref>). Histone excess has also been linked to genome instability and to a wide variety of processes in the cell including DNA repair and life span, which probably explains why all eukaryotes have several redundant pathways that ensure the absence of free histones beyond replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Au et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castillo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gunjan and Verreault, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Singh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Takayama et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Accurate chromosome segregation is essential to prevent genome instability. Eukaryotic cells have different mechanisms or checkpoints able to specifically sense and respond to different types of errors. These checkpoints are able to modulate the length of the cell cycle and give the cells additional time to solve them ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hartwell and Weinert, 1989</xref>]. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> like most eukaryotic cells has two major checkpoints able to block cells prior to mitosis: the DNA damage response (DDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>) and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). Both of them are able to perform this block inhibiting the cleavage and degradation of the kleisin subunit of the cohesin complex Scc1<sup>RAD21</sup>. This inhibition takes place through a stabilisation of Pds1<sup>Securin</sup> either by phosphorylation (DDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sanchez et al., 1999</xref>) or by preventing its degradation through the APC (DDR and SAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agarwal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">London and Biggins, 2014</xref>). The SAC can additionally respond to lack of tension keeping Shugosin at the pericentromere, which prevents cohesin cleavage through the inhibition of Esp1<sup>Separase</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clift et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nerusheva et al., 2014</xref>). The DDR can also block mitosis through the phosphorylation and inhibition of the G2/M cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup> at Tyr<sub>19</sub> (15 in humans) that plays a key role during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal and Cohen-Fix, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rahal and Amon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Besides these well-characterised checkpoints, studies in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have revealed an additional checkpoint able to respond to actin cytoskeleton perturbations called the morphogenesis checkpoint, which delays cell-cycle progression when the actin cytoskeleton is perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lew, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McMillan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sakchaisri et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sia et al., 1998</xref>). This checkpoint is able to stabilise Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup>, a kinase able to promote a phosphorylation on Tyr<sub>19</sub> of Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup> (Tyr<sub>15</sub> in humans) that inhibits its activity and results in a delay on the metaphase to anaphase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lianga et al., 2013</xref>). Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup> is present in lower and higher eukaryotes during an unperturbed cell cycle. This kinase is expressed during replication and degraded before mitosis in a mechanism that involves the action of several kinases that promote Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup> hyperphosphorylation and trigger its ubiquitination and subsequent destruction by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Howell and Lew, 2012</xref>). Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup> can also be stabilised upon DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Palou et al., 2015</xref>) and in response to certain types of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chauhan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">George et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">King et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup> was quite recently shown to be able to physically interact with histone H2B and promote its phosphorylation. This phosphorylation is conserved from yeasts to humans and seems to play an important role in the repression of histone transcription at the end of S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mahajan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>One crucial question that remains unsolved is whether cells are able to respond or sense high levels of histones as they do when they become limiting in order to prevent their undesirable effects on genome stability. To address this question, we have constructed a set of tools to test and analyse the cellular consequences of abnormal accumulations of histones beyond DNA replication in the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> Our results show that cells that fail to degrade histones after DNA replication or wild-type cells constitutively exposed to high levels of histones H2A and H2B have defects in chromosome segregation and are able to suffer aberrant cell divisions that result, in some ocassions in viable cells that have experienced a whole-genome-duplication event (WGD). We observe that high levels of histones promote changes in chromatin structure, increase nucleosome occupancy at centromeric and pericentromeric chromatin and decrease the incorporation of the histone variant Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> to chromatin. This defect in Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> incorporation is accompanied by a reduction of condensin recruitment to pericentromeric chromatin, a phenotype that could explain why cells exposed to high levels of histones experience WGDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oliveira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Woodward et al., 2016</xref>). We also show that Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup> is stabilised in the presence of high levels of histones and promotes the phosphorylation of Cdc28<bold><sup>CDK1</sup></bold> through a mechanism that does not require the activation of the DNA damage response. Our results, link for the first time high levels of histones with a cell cycle mark able to delay the cell cycle transition from G2 to mitosis and highlight histone levels as a potential and yet unexplored source of genome instability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Persistent generation of histones promotes WGDs</title><p>To determine the effects of histone overexpression beyond replication, we first decided to use a centromeric vector that expresses histones H2A and H2B under the control of a promoter that is not repressed outside of S-phase (<italic>CEN-HTA1-HTB1∆NEG</italic> referred as CEN∆<italic>NEG)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Osley et al., 1986</xref>). Deletion of the <italic>NEG</italic> regulatory site (<italic>∆NEG</italic>) in the <italic>HTA1-HTB1</italic> cluster interferes with the normal repression of histones H2A and H2B by the HIR complex and leads to their persistent transcription beyond S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eriksson et al., 2012</xref>). This vector was introduced in wild-type cells and in cells that carried a mutation in <italic>RAD53</italic> (<italic>rad53K227A</italic>) or a deletion of <italic>TOM1</italic> (<italic>tom1∆</italic>), both of them required for the rapid degradation of histone excess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gunjan and Verreault, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Singh et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). When transformed in <italic>rad53K227A</italic> or <italic>tom1∆</italic> cells, this construct generated a large number of small colonies that experienced severe growth defects and a small population of large colonies able to grow almost like wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) (between 2–4 × 10<sup>−2</sup>, raw numbers are in the additional source data file for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). FACS analysis of these two populations revealed that large colonies had experienced a WGD and became diploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) [detailed information on methods, strain genotype and analyses can be found in the supplemental experimental procedures section]. This effect was not observed in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>) and was not specific for the overexpression of histones H2A and H2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Growth analysis of small (n) and big colonies (2 n) in the <italic>rad53K227A</italic> mutant confirmed that diploids are able to tolerate better high levels of histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). To rule out the possibility that WGDs occur independently of histone levels due to a selection of pre-existing <italic>rad53K227A</italic> diploids endowed with a growth advantage after transformation, we tested if increasing the number of copies of the <italic>HTA1-HTB1∆NEG</italic> construct would be sufficient to induce WGDs in a wild-type strain. Cells transformed with a high-copy vector that contains the <italic>HTA1-HTB1∆NEG</italic> construct (2µ∆NEG) vector gave rise to a significant number of cells (around 1 × 10<sup>−2</sup>, source data file for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) that have experienced a WGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This construct increases by 50% the amount of histone H2B mRNA but does not induce a detectable change in the amounts of total histone H2B protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>). Diploids were perfectly viable, did not show any major chromosome reorganisation when compared to a haploid or diploid strain obtained by cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) and were able to form triploids when crossed with a strain from the opposite mating type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Diploids still had a small growth advantage when compared to haploids in wild-type conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>). WGDs were never detected in wild-type cells transformed with an empty vector (more than 2.2 × 10<sup>2</sup> colonies analysed by FACS). These results support the fact that WGDs do not take place in the absence of histone deregulation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35337.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Persistent transcription of histones promotes WGDs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the three pathways that negatively regulate histone levels at a transcriptional (HIR complex), post-transcriptional (Lsm1-7 Pat1 complex), or post-translational (Rad53-Tom1-Ubc4/5 complex) level.

Time course experiments with these cells revealed that most of them usually turned into a diploid state in 48–96 hr after inoculation in liquid from a petri dish plate (colonies have already grown for 5 days in the plate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Cell cycle distribution of these haploids transformed with the 2µ∆NEG vector in a strain carrying several tags to follow kinetochores (Mtw1-mCHERRY), centrosomes (Spc42-CFP) and tubulin (TUB1-GFP)) revealed a large population of non-dividing cells as well as a significant decrease in the number of cells that have started to separate their chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Interestingly, in some of these cells we observed that the whole spindle apparatus was able to traverse to the daughter cell before segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). In order to try to catch the exact moment in which some haploids become diploid, we constructed a strain carrying a tagged nuclear membrane protein and followed cell division using live microscopy in cells transformed with the 2µ∆NEG vector or an empty vector. This analysis confirmed a large population of non-dividing cells in the strain transformed with the 2µ∆NEG vector, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morillo-Huesca et al., 2010</xref>), and a significant number of cells (18% vs 3% in the control strain) in which the nucleus remained undivided for several hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, first panel and source data file for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). This experiment also revealed two specific phenotypes for cells transformed with the 2µ∆NEG that were not observed in cells transformed with the empty vector. The first one was a small proportion of cells (8%) in which the nucleus migrated to the daughter cell before mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, second panel). The second phenotype involved a combination of the two phenomena previously described and led on some occasions (1%) to an aberrant mitosis in which both nuclei remain trapped in the daughter, generating a binucleated cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, third panel). To confirm that these phenotypes were specific for cells transformed with the 2µ∆NEG vector, we performed additional movies comparing cells transformed with this vector or an empty one. These movies confirmed that aberrant mitosis in which the daughter (never observed in the mother) keeps all the genetic material only take place in cells transformed with the 2µ∆NEG vector. In one of these events, we were able to follow a second cell division of one of these binucleated cells in which the two nuclear masses were split between the mother and the daughter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). We assume that these events may serve as a precursor for diploid cells that are probably being selected among haploids due to their growth advantage.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35337.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Deregulation of histone levels delays chromosome segregation and promotes aberrant cell divisions.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative FACS profiles of haploid wild type cells after transformation with the 2µ∆NEG vector grown during several days.

This construct constitutes a useful tool to test the effects of histones per se in genome stability in a mutant-free background. This tool, however, does not allow us to perform molecular studies in wild-type cells exposed to high levels of histones since most of the population becomes fully diploid before large volumes of culture are obtained. Synchronisation experiments in these cells were also problematic. Cells transformed with the 2µ∆NEG vector accumulate large amount of cells that do not exit G1 after an alpha factor release or have a very slow progression to S-phase, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morillo-Huesca et al., 2010</xref>). To overcome these problems and further prove our initial observations, we designed an alternative experimental setting that would theoretically be able to generate large amounts of histones in the cell. We therefore created a strain that combined a deletion of <italic>LSM1</italic>, involved in the posttranscriptional degradation of histone mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herrero and Moreno, 2011</xref>) with an Auxin-Inducible Degron of Rad53 (<italic>rad53-AID</italic>) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eriksson et al., 2012</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> for additional information about histone regulation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>). This strategy allowed us to conditionally block at the same time the two major pathways involved in histone degradation at the end of S-phase which is otherwise lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herrero and Moreno, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>rad53-AID</italic> degron was fully functional as indicated by the low level of Rad53 after one hour of treatment with 500 µM NAA (1-Naphthaleneacetic acid, NAA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). <italic>rad53-AID</italic> mutant cells were sensitive to histone overexpression and deletion of <italic>LSM1</italic> was lethal in these cells in the presence of Auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b and c</xref>). Indeed, 4 hr of Auxin treatment was sufficient to reduce 90% of cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>). This lethality was much higher than the one observed in cells transformed with the 2µ∆NEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e</xref>) indicating that this conditional system was much more toxic for the cell.</p><p>We next measured histone levels in <italic>rad53-AID LSM1</italic> or <italic>rad53-AID lsm1∆</italic> cells. To this purpose, we purified core histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jourquin and Géli, 2017</xref>) and measured their amounts relative to a non-specific band in a Comassie Blue-stained acrylamide gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Quantification of histone levels indicated that Rad53 depletion per se had little or no effect on histone accumulation but did increase histone levels in an <italic>lsm1∆</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Western blot analysis with these samples confirmed a significant increase of canonical histones compared to the levels of histone H2A.Z, a histone variant that is not regulated by Lsm1 as canonical histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 3f</xref>). To address if these changes in chromatin composition were able to affect chromatin structure, we performed a Microccocal Nuclease (MNase) digestion analysis of chromatin extracted from single and double mutants treated or not with NAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). r<italic>ad53-AID-lsm1∆-</italic>treated cells displayed a clear aberrant nucleosome pattern. While mono and di-nucleosomes were visible at concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 5 mU of Mnase in controls, chromatin from <italic>rad53-AID-lsm1</italic>-treated cells produced a high-molecular-weight smear that suggests that this chromatin is somehow less accesible to Mnase digestion. Overall, our results indicate that the <italic>rad53-AID lsm1∆</italic> system constitutes a good tool to generate conditional large accumulations of histones in the cell and that high levels of histones are able to promote changes in chromatin structure.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35337.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Rad53 depletion in <italic>lsm1∆</italic> cells allows large and conditional overproduction of histones beyond S-phase.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Purified core histones from <italic>rad53-AID</italic> and <italic>rad53-AID lsm1∆</italic> cells that were treated or not 2 hr with NAA and blocked with Nocodazole 2 additional hours.

These cells usually died after 6–8 hr of NAA treatment and were unable to enter or skip mitosis. FACS analysis suggested that most of them were able to complete replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). To confirm this observation, we next performed pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) allowing us to differentiate chromosomes in which DNA is fully replicated (chromosomes are able to enter the gel) from chromosomes in which some parts are not (DNA is unable to enter the gel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ide and Kobayashi, 2010</xref>). Cells treated for 4 hr with NAA exhibited a similar pattern to the one observed in cells treated with Nocodazole and clearly different from the one observed in cells treated with Hydroxyurea that leads to the accumulation of cells that have not fully replicated their DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>).

Treatment with Auxin specifically raised a population of cells that had doubled their DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>).

As expected, incorporation of Cse4 outside of the centromeres was low and differences in the Cse4 at these regions were not significant. Canonical histones in contrast did increase their occupancy along several regions and were highly enriched at centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, middle and right panels). To check if kinetochores were still able to attach to centromeres, we measured by ChIP the recruitment of Mtw1, an essential component of the MIND complex that binds centromeric DNA through the association with inner and outer kinetochore elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hornung et al., 2014</xref>) in asynchronous growing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) and in cells synchronised with Nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Mtw1 recruitment to centromeres IV and XII was similar and did not significantly increased in other regions of the genome. To confirm that kinetochores remained bound to the spindle, we studied the behaviour of chromosomes along the spindle axis in <italic>rad53-AID lsm1∆</italic> arrested cells using a strain with tags to follow kinetochores (Mtw1-mCHERRY) and the spindle axis (TUB1-GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, most of the arrested cells displayed one single mass of chromosomes in the daughter or the mother cell that always remained in line with the spindle axis. We concluded that histone overexpression is able to increase histone H3 and H4 occupancy at centromeres and several other regions but this incorporation does not seem to affect CENP-A recruitment, the attachment of kinetochores to chromosomes, or the attachment of both to the spindle.</p><p>We next analysed the recruitment of Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> to chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). We observed a clear decrease in the incorporation of Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> to pericentromeric chromatin in agreement with the global decrease of the H2AZ/H4 ratio shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>. This decrease was opposite to what was observed for histones H2B and H2A and indicated that Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> molecules were being replaced by the canonical histone H2A in the <italic>rad53-AID lsm1∆</italic> mutant treated with Auxin.</p><p>Interestingly, although wild-type cells transformed with the 2µ∆NEG vector do not seem to increase the protein levels of H2B (see above <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), the level of Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> was decreased in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b and c</xref>). To investigate if changes in Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> levels were directly related to WGDs, we decided to interfere with the incorporation of this histone variant in both, the 2µ∆NEG and the <italic>rad53-AID lsm1∆</italic> systems. Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> overexpression using a high copy vector largely increased the levels of Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> observed in cells transformed with the 2µ∆NEG vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) and was able to decrease the amount of WGDs observed in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Diploid cells were not affected by Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> overexpression discarding an indirect effect due to a counterselection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Consistent with the result of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, deletion of <italic>SWR1</italic>, which decreases Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> incorporation to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mizuguchi et al., 2004</xref>) had an opposite effect to the one conferred by Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> overexpression and increased the formation of WGDs in cells transformed with the 2µ∆NEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Overexpression of histone Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> in <italic>rad53-AID lsm1∆</italic> cells also increased the amounts of total histone Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 5b</xref>) but was unable to supress the defect in the incorporation of this histone variant to chromatin, the G2/M arrest or the lethality after NAA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c, d ane e</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our results with the 2µ∆NEG vector indicate that Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> relative levels are important in the generation of WGDs in cells exposed to a persistent transcription of histones H2A and H2B. In contrast, overexpression of this histone variant is unable to suppress the defects observed in <italic>rad53-AID-lsm1∆-</italic>treated cells and suggests that this double mutant might have additional effects on chromatin structure that interfere with Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> deposition, cell cycle, and cell viability.</p><p>Excessive incorporation of Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> to pericentromeric chromatin has been previously linked to WGDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>). While the opposite has been linked to chromosome segregation defects, it has never been associated to WGDs. In <italic>S. pombe</italic> Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> is required to stabilise the recruitment of condensin to pericentromeres, a complex able to embrace each of the daughter DNA strands and required to allow their proper segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cuylen and Haering, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). Depletion of the CAP-H kleisin subunit (Brn1) of Condensin II in drosophila S2 cells has been shown to lead to chromosome segregation defects and produce a small number of abortive mitosis in which all the genetic material is retained in one cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oliveira et al., 2005</xref>). Mutations in the condensin II subunit Caph2 in mice have also been recently involved in the generation of cells with an increased ploidy content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Woodward et al., 2016</xref>). Based on these published results, we tested if Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> defective recruitment observed in the <italic>rad53-AID lsm1∆</italic> double mutant would affect condensin recruitment to pericentromeric chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Recruitment of Brn1 to pericentromeric chromatin decreased in three out of the four pericentromeres examined in five independent experiments suggesting that Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> is important for condensin recruitment to pericentromeric regions in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> We further tested the effects of histone overexpression in a strain that carries a thermosensitive version of the condensin subunit SMC2 (<italic>smc2-8</italic>). The <italic>smc2-8</italic> mutant, was extremely sensitive to histone overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>) further linking histone levels to condensin function. Cell cycle kinetics to measure WGDs in these cells was not possible due to the extreme sensitivity of this mutant to histone overexpression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Accumulation of histones triggers a DNA damage-independent phosphorylation of Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup></title><p>One of the initial goals of this work was to evaluate if cells have mechanisms able to modulate cell cycle progression in the presence of abnormal levels of histones as they do when histones become limiting during replication. This question is particularly relevant since persistent activation of the DDR, the SAC and Swe1 overexpression have all been linked to WGDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davoli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sotillo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kawasaki et al., 2003</xref>). We therefore investigated if high levels of histones were able to promote the activation of the DDR, the SAC or affect Swe1 stability using our two systems (<italic>rad53-AID lsm1∆ and</italic> 2µ∆NEG) able to deregulate histone levels during the cell cycle.</p><p>Auxin treatment in <italic>rad53-AID lsm1∆</italic> cells did not promote Pds1<sup>Securin</sup> phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), a marker for DDR activation, or enhanced the formation of Mad2 foci at kinetochores, a marker used to detect SAC activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). To further confirm or discard the activation of the SAC, we decided to follow Pds1<sup>SECURIN</sup> degradation during a G2/M release in <italic>rad53-AID and rad53-AID lsm1∆</italic> cells treated or not with NAA before the release. This experiment revealed a slight stabilisation of Pds1<sup>SECURIN</sup> in <italic>rad53-AID-lsm1∆-</italic>treated cells, higher levels of Scc1<sup>Rad21</sup>, the main substrate of Pds1, and Clb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). Clb2 started to degrade but reaccumulated later suggesting that the activity of APC-Cdh1 is impaired in this mutant. We next looked at Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup> levels and observed that this kinase was stabilised in a hypophosphorylated form in <italic>rad53-lsm1∆-</italic>treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). This stabilisation led to a higher level of Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup> phosphorylation that depend on Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>) and was independent of the DDR, since MEC1 deletion did not abolish it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). <italic>SWE1</italic> deletion was able to suppress Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup> phosphorylation but unable to suppress Pds1 stabilisation suggesting that the mechanism by which Pds1 is stabilised does not depend on Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>). The results obtained with the <italic>rad53-AID lsm1∆</italic> system suggest that histone accumulation can stabilise Pds1 and delay cohesion degradation, and that it promotes a Swe1-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup>. The absence of Pds1<sup>SECURIN</sup> phosphorylation added to the fact that its stabilisation does not depend on Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup> phosphorylation favor the idea that Pds1 stabilisation could be due to an activation of the SAC.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35337.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Histone accumulation triggers a Swe1-dependent Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup> phosphorylation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Pds1 phosphorylation (Pds1-HA) in <italic>rad53-AID</italic> and <italic>rad53-AID lsm1∆</italic> cells either after 4 hr treatment with NAA or bleomycin (Ble, 15 µg/ml).

Collectively, our results indicate that these events are linked to a defect in the incorporation of the histone variant Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup>. We propose a competition model in which the canonical histone H2A competes with the histone variant H2A.Z. In this model, increasing the levels of canonical histone H2A will decrease the ratio H2A.Z/H2A in nucleosomes thereby decreasing the interaction of H2A.Z with the readers of this histone variant. Histone overexpression has been previously shown to saturate certain histone-modifying enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Singh et al., 2010</xref>) and could also in theory, saturate chromatin remodelers able to bind and exchange H2A by H2A.Z. However, this explanation is not sufficient to explain how the overexpression of histones H2A and H2B trigger WGDs since H3 and H4 overexpression also triggers WGDs in a <italic>rad53K227A</italic> mutant. Two reports have shown that the incorporation of Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ranjan et al., 2013</xref>) and condensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Toselli-Mollereau et al., 2016</xref>) requires nucleosome-free regions to be incorporated efficiently to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ranjan et al., 2013</xref>). Our results show that the regions in which Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> incorporation is decreased in <italic>rad53-AID-lsm1∆-</italic>treated cells exhibit higher nucleosome occupancy and are less accessible to Micrococcal Nuclease digestion. Accumulation of histones beyond replication might have a general effect on chromatin structure and reduce the amount of nucleosome-free regions. This general effect on chromatin structure may explain why the overexpression of Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> is able to decrease the amounts of WGDs in cells overexpressing histones H2A and H2B but does not improve the incorporation of <italic>Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup></italic> in <italic>rad53-AID-lsm1∆-</italic>treated cells. We infer from our results that histone expression may be restricted to S-phase to avoid an excessive incorporation of histones to chromatin and maintain nucleosome-free regions that would in particular promote the specific incorporation of Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyarchuk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nekrasov et al., 2012</xref>). Efficient incorporation of Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> would regulate condensin recruitment throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Condensin depletion has been previously linked to chromosome segregation defects and WGDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oliveira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Woodward et al., 2016</xref>) and could explain why high levels of histones promote WGDs.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35337.029</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Proposed model to explain how histone-stress impacts mitosis.</title><p>Histone dimers are depicted as small rectangles (H3-H4 in white, H2A-H2B in grey and H2A.Z-H2B in blue). During an unperturbed cell cycle (<bold>a</bold>, upper scheme), canonical histones and Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup> increase during replication. Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup> will phosphorylate Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup> and maintain it inactive. During G2, histone synthesis will be repressed and all histones (mRNAs and proteins) that are not incorporated to chromatin as well as Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup> will be degraded. During mitosis, Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> will stabilise condensin recruitment at pericentromeric regions allowing the proper function of this complex in chromosome segregation. When histone degradation is compromised (<bold>b</bold>, lower scheme), cells reach G2 with high levels of histones (histone-stress). This accumulation of histones will promote Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup> phosphorylation and inactivation. This inhibition will delay the entry into mitosis and presumably give time to the cell to lower histone levels. Since this phosphorylation depends on Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup>, we propose that histone-stress promotes Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup> phosphorylation through a stabilisation of Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup>. Cells unable to efficiently lower histone levels after replication will increase the amount of canonical nucleosomes incorporated at centromeres and pericentromeres. We propose that this increase in nucleosome density will decrease the efficient exchange of histone H2A by histone Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup>, and reduce Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> incorporation. This defect in incorporation would consequently lead to a less stable association of condensin to pericentromeres and trigger chromosome segregation defects.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35337-fig9-v1"/></fig><p>We have also addressed in this study if high levels of histones modulate cell cycle progression to avoid their potential toxicity. Our results confirm that histone overexpression does not trigger the canonical DNA damage response. The Pds1 stabilisation observed in <italic>rad53-AID lsm1∆</italic> treated cells added to the fact that <italic>MAD2</italic> deletion enhances WGDs indicate that the SAC could be activated in cells that overexpress histones. This activation, however, does not seem to be the cause behind WGDs but rather a mechanism that helps to prevent them. One of the most interesting results of our checkpoint analysis is that cells that accumulate large amount of histones exhibit a DNA damage-independent phosphorylation of Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup> that likely results from the stabilisation of Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup>. As mentioned, this activation would not be the cause of WGDs but rather would help to prevent them. Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup> was previously reported to interact with histone H2B in yeast and humans, phosphorylate H2B at Tyr<sub>37</sub> (Tyr<sub>40</sub> in yeast), and promote the efficient repression of histones transcription at the end of S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mahajan et al., 2012</xref>). The fact that this kinase is stabilised in the presence of high levels of histones unveils an unsuspected and general role of Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup> in histone metabolism. Noteworthy, low levels of histone supply during S-phase have been shown to delay mitosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos through the increase of CDK1 phosphorylation levels mediated by the transcriptional downregulation of the Cdc25 phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Günesdogan et al., 2014</xref>). Our results added to this study suggest that the regulation of Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup> could be a mechanism by which cells can respond to both high and low levels of histones.</p><p>WGDs are quite frequently observed in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zack et al., 2013</xref>) and play an important role in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davoli and de Lange, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dewhurst et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Janssen and Medema, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Santaguida and Amon, 2015</xref>). Given the different ways in which higher and lower eukaryotes regulate histone levels, one reasonable question that arises from our study is if our results can be extrapolated to higher eukaryotes. Overexpression of histone H2A has been linked to the transformation of normal liver to preneoplastic and neoplastic stages of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khare et al., 2011</xref>) where WGDs and aneuploidy are both frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davoli and de Lange, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duncan et al., 2010</xref>). Two different lines of investigation, one in drosophila and one in bronchial cells, have shown that a partial depletion of the histone mRNA-binding factor SLBP leads to the accumulation of abnormal levels of polyadenylated histones mRNA beyond replication. These polyadenilated mRNAs can be translated and escape the normal cell cycle control of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brocato et al., 2015</xref>). In the first study, this depletion correlated to the generation of a tetraploid population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Salzler et al., 2009</xref>). The second study demonstrated that arsenic, a common carcinogenic agent able to promote aneuploidy and WGDs, partially depletes SLBP, which in turn increases the tumorigenic potential of transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brocato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">States, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, arsenic-induced cellular transformation induces a more compact chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Riedmann et al., 2015</xref>). Our work, combined with these reports, supports the idea that histone deregulation might constitute an important and yet unexplored potential source of genome instability in cells. It would therefore be interesting to revise upwards the amplification of the small arm of chromosome 6, which contains 55 out of the 65 genes that encode canonical histones. This amplification takes place in a wide variety of tumors and correlates with cancer aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Santos et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains, plasmids, growth conditions and cell-cycle synchronisation</title><p>All strains used in this study derive from the S288C background.

The strain carrying the <italic>rad53-AID</italic> allele also bears the integrative vector pNHK36, which contains the OsTYR1 protein under the control of the <italic>GAL1</italic>-inducible promoter. Both vectors were obtained from Addgene. All <italic>rad53-AID</italic> strains were constructed in an <italic>sml1∆</italic> background to compensate the essential function of Rad53 in promoting dNTP production. The functionality of tagged proteins was systematically checked.</p><p>Exponentially growing <italic>rad53K227A</italic> (or <italic>tom1∆)</italic> cells were transformed with a centromeric vector carrying the <italic>HTA1-HTB1∆NEG</italic> construct while wild-type cells were transformed with a 2-µ vector carrying the same cassette. After transformation, strains were plated on SC-Uracil selective media at 30°C. The frequency of WGDs in these strains was calculated based on the percentage of cells able to form a colony after 3 days of growth compared to the total amount of colonies visible after 5 days of growth. This method to estimate WGDs is based on the growth advantage that WGDs confer upon histone overexpression. Ploidy analysis of individual transformants by FACS indicates that roughly than 90% of cells able to grow at day 3 have experienced a WGD (8 or 9 out of 10, two independent repeats for each strain). As control, similar experiments were performed with strains transformed with an empty vector to show that generation of WGDs in linked to the presence of the <italic>∆NEG</italic> construct. Time courses to determine the timing of WGDs were performed always from single small colonies that were grown and maintained in exponential growth conditions in liquid SC-uracil. As control, single colonies obtained from the corresponding strain transformed with an empty vector were analysed in parallel. Samples were taken every 24 hr to estimate the proportion of haploids and diploids by FACS.</p><p>For plate growth assays, yeast cultures were diluted to an O.D.<sub>600nm</sub> of 0.5 and serial 1:10 dilutions were spotted on the indicated plates. Doubling times were calculated from 12 hr time-courses in which cells were maintained in exponential growth conditions. Doubling times correspond to the growth rate of cells that still remain haploid during the time course (checked by FACS).</p><p>For experiments involving the rad53-AID construct, glucose was replaced with galactose to allow the expression of the OsTyr1 protein, required for AID-mediated degradation. These experiments were always carried out in yeast-peptone rich media (YP) except those performed for microscopy that were carried in SC media. Rad53 depletion was induced adding 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (SIGMA N0640, referred as NAA or Auxin in the text). NAA was normally added to a final concentration of 500 µM (rich media) or 200 µM (SC) unless indicated. This difference in NAA concentration used between rich and minimal media is due to the fact that high concentrations of NAA in minimal media have deleterious effects on yeast growth.</p><p>Cell-cycle synchronisations in G1 were performed adding alpha factor to a final concentration of 0.01 µg/ml. All strains were <italic>bar1∆</italic> to ensure a complete arrest that was checked by FACS and microscopy (90% or more of G1-arrested cells). Cell-cycle synchronizsations in G2/M were performed adding 10 µg/ml of Nocodazole. Cells were maintained in the presence of alpha-factor or Nocodazole for a duration corresponding of at least one whole cell cycle (estimated from duplication time). Cell-cycle arrest was confirmed by FACS and DAPI staining after fixation in 70% ethanol. After rehydratation in 1X PBS, samples for FACS were incubated for 3 hr with RNaseA (0.5 mg/ml) at 37°C. Cells were then resuspended in 0.5 µg/ml SYTOX green in PBS and incubated for at least 20 min at room temperature. After a 1X PBS wash, cells were briefly sonicated to remove cell clumps and DNA content was determined with a Becton Dickinson FACS-Calibur. For DAPI analysis, fixed cells were incubated with 0.2 µg/ml of DAPI for 30 min before washing twice with 1x PBS.

However, they felt that there were too many shortcomings in the data and unexplored mechanistic issues that the current manuscript is not sufficient for publication. They also felt that these issues could not be addressed in a timely manner and did not recommend revision of the manuscript for <italic>eLife</italic>. We hope that the detailed reviews below will be useful for moving the study forward.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Miles et al. present multiple lines of evidence that histone overexpression causes mitotic defects in yeast cells. The DNA damage and spindle assembly checkpoints are not activated by such a stress, whereas Tyr<sub>15</sub> of Cdk1 is phosphorylated, suggesting a novel Cdk1-dependent, but DDR- and SAC-independent regulatory function of mitosis. Whole genome duplication is an important phenomenon associated with development of many species and of human cancers. This work is thus of strong interest to many. However, this manuscript suffers from a slew of deficiencies, ranging from writing to experimental design to result interpretation. It'll take a very significant effort to resolve these issues satisfactorily.</p><p>1) One of the most interesting and valuable observations from this work is probably the visualization of how diploids might be generated in the wake of histone overdose. That is, the movement of both sets of duplicated genome to the daughter cell without cytokinesis. However, the authors fall short on testing the functionality of other key mitotic machinery such as spindle, spindle pole bodies, separation of centromeres, etc. of these cells. Moreover, there is no telling whether these cells can proceed successfully to the next round of mitosis, resulting in the formation of a homogenous diploid population.</p><p>2) It is good that the authors use different approaches to induce histone stress, however, the basis of which remains unclear. The authors cite a previous finding that Swe1 contacts H2B, but do not elaborate. They also suggest that reduced H2A.Z recruitment to chromatin might be responsible. However, there is no report of a similar mitotic defect in known htz1 alleles. It is also unclear how skewing histone expression would lead to WGD. For example, what is the minimal degree of overexpression needed? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows that GAL-controlled expression of all four core histones in the same <italic>rad53K227A</italic> background results in the retention of 1n population, suggesting that concerted expression of histones, not merely the number of histone molecules, is critical for mitotic integrity. Furthermore, the authors favor the idea of downregulation of H2A.Z loading to pericentromeres being the underpinning of the observed mitotic defects. If so, will co-expressing H2A.Z with H2A and H2B alleviate at least some of the stress? How is it that H3/H4 overexpression also confers the growth phenotype as does H2A/H2B ectopic expression?</p><p>3) The ChIP-qPCR data are weak. What is the resolution of the qPCR?

Genomic instability at the chromosome level results in aneuploidy, which can cause birth defects and cancer. As cancer cells typically gain copies of chromosomes, one popular theory is that aneuploidy follows whole-genome duplication and polyploidy. Polyploidy puts more burden on the mitotic chromosome segregation machinery, increases errors in that process, and allows cells to better tolerate the resulting aneuploidy. Thus, it is important for us to understand the potential causes and mechanisms of polyploidy. Using the budding yeast as a model organism, Miles et al. showed in the current study that histone overexpression (coupled with or without mutations in other histone-surveillance genes) causes polyploidy. They further probed the underlying mechanisms and made two interesting findings. First, histone overexpression promotes Wee1-dependent negative phosphorylation on Cdk1 and delays mitotic entry. This mechanism is not, however, required for polyploidization, but may impede it. Second, histone overexpression limits the deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z and its downstream effector condensin on chromosomes, particularly near centromeres. They believe that this mechanism underlies polyploidization caused by histone overexpression.</p><p>Overall, this study advances our understanding of ploidy regulation. The findings are novel and significant. The results are for the most part convincing and logically presented. Publication is recommended, provided that the authors address the following major points.</p><p>1) While it is clear that H2A.Z and condensin deposition is defective under conditions of histone overexpression, the evidence linking this effect to polyploidization needs to be further strengthened. The only strong evidence presented is that deletion of the H2A.Z depositor Swr1 exacerbates the effect of histone overexpression. A genetic suppression experiment will be much more convincing. The authors should test whether H2A.Z overexpression or forced targeting of condensin to peri-centromeres reduces polyploidy caused by histone overexpression.</p><p>2) Much of the results on DNA damage checkpoint, spindle assembly checkpoint, and Shugoshin are negative results. These sections should be shortened. This will leave more space for the authors to address point 1 above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This study builds on the notion that histone protein levels are tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms and that misregulation or histone overexpression causes toxicity, cell cycle arrest, sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, and mitotic chromosome loss.</p><p>One key observation in this study is that conditions that cause increased histone protein expression lead to whole genome duplication events in yeast, i.e. cells fail to divide the nuclear material between mother and daughter cell in a timely manner; these cells stop proliferating, or the resulting diploid cells as a result of endoreduplication have a growth advantage and rapidly take over the population. This is also apparent on plates where diploids form larger colonies. Upon presumed severe increased histone levels (by disrupting the histone RNA and protein degradation pathways, which is lethal) cells arrest in G2/M and fail to exit from a G2/M arrest. In this first part, the authors investigated whether there is a sensing mechanism, or a checkpoint, for high histone levels. The failure to exit from G2/M was accompanied by a delay in cohesin degradation and increased Cdc28 phosphorylation by Swe1. The authors propose that this event delays the entry into mitosis. However, deletion of Swe1 abolishes Cdc28 phosphorylation but does not suppress the G2/M arrest. Swe1 loss does enhance WGD events.</p><p>In the second part, investigating the cause of the WGD events, the authors show that presumed very high histone levels do not affect CENP-A recruitment to centromeres, but do impair H2A.Z and condensin recruitment to pericentric heterochromatin. A condensin mutation enhances the toxicity of histone overexpression and loss of the H2A.Z assembly factor Swr1 enhances the selection for diploid cells upon transformation with a histone H2A/B overexpression vector, together suggesting that loss of these two chromatin components can further exacerbate the effects of increased histone dosage. This leads the authors to suggest that the decrease in H2A.Z and condensin is at least one of the causes that trigger WGDs when excess free histones accumulate. However, another interpretation of these results (in essence negative genetic interactions) is that histone excess and loss of H2A.Z/condensin act by independent mechanisms because a loss of H2A.Z alone was not sufficient to cause WGD events. It is likely that increased histone dosage affects WGD also by other mechanisms.</p><p>This study presents a series of interesting observations that warrant further investigation. However, the claims made by the authors are not always justified and supported by data. Importantly, whether there is a CDC28/Swe1-mediated sensing mechanism has not been fully addressed. In addition, for many of the experiments, replicates are missing and the study would benefit from a more quantitative appreciation of the altered histone levels. Finally, the story is composed of two pieces that are currently not well connected.</p><p>- The claims made by the authors are not always justified and supported by data, e.g. &quot;we have uncovered a new type of stress (histone-stress) able to trigger a stabilization of Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup> that promotes Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup> phosphorylation and delays the entry into mitosis&quot;. Similar conclusions are drawn elsewhere (e.g. Discussion, third paragraph and Abstract). That histone overexpression causes stress was already known. That it stabilizes Swe1 is not shown in this manuscript. Furthermore, that Cdc28 phosphorylation delays entry into mitosis is not so clear because deletion of Swe1, the responsible kinase, does not affect the delay.</p><p>- For many key experiments replicates or quantification of replicate experiments are missing. For most of the western blots, FACS analyses, microscopy, and MNase sensitivity assays in the manuscript no replicates or quantification of replicates are provided. The authors should provide additional data on these experiments to demonstrate reproducibility, following the guidelines of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>- The authors use various conditions to increase histone expression outside S-phase. One approach is overexpressing the histone genes from strong promoters. This is in principle straightforward. The other main approach is combining a <italic>Rad53</italic> degron with an <italic>lsm1</italic> mutation, which causes cell death. There are several issues with the approaches.</p><p>1) In the latter case (<italic>lsm1</italic>+<italic>rad53</italic>-aid) it cannot be excluded that the phenotypes seen are at least in part caused by other functions of the inactivated proteins. Although this is partially addressed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the Cdc28 phenotype has only been observed in <italic>rad53</italic> mutant backgrounds.</p><p>2) The authors use various conditions to induce histone overexpression but show in very few cases to what extent histone proteins are overexpressed. This is an important issue because the various methods and combinations of alleles and/or plasmids have different phenotypic consequences (e.g. 2-micron-δ NEG vs. <italic>lsm1</italic>+<italic>rad53</italic>-aid). The authors should examine histone protein levels for the different conditions used, for example not only <italic>lsm1</italic> with or without <italic>rad53</italic>-aid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), but also for the conditions used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>. For example, based on the phenotypes, one might assume that the δ NEG or GAL-H2A-H2B plasmids cause lower histone protein expression than the combined <italic>rad53</italic>+<italic>lsm1</italic> mutation. However, this is not demonstrated by histone blots.</p><p>3) The assay first shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> involves transformation with a 2-micron-HTA-HTB1-δ-NEG plasmid. The authors monitor diploidization of the pool of cells over time starting at the time of transformation. This is a somewhat unconventional assay that would benefit from more explanation of the approach and experimental details. For example, at what time point was the vector control analyzed? It would be appropriate to take a vector control along for every time point and also take a t=0 point. In this assay several factors can influence the outcome or dynamics: First, after transformation only a small proportion of the cells will contain a plasmid and survive the selection, most cells will die. Therefore, the kinetics might depend on the transformation efficiency. Second, cells that become diploid will have a growth advantage and take over the population. How fast they do so will depend on the rate of diploidization as well as the growth rate. These different parameters should be explained more clearly and taken into account experimentally. Another point here concerns panel 2D: what is the time point after transformation, how did the authors assess whether the cells examined actually contained a histone plasmid, and what are the numbers for a wild-type cell or vector control?</p><p>Other Points:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. How long were the cells grown in galactose to induce histone expression?</p><p>The authors state that '<italic>Rad53</italic> depletion was lethal in the absence of <italic>Lsm1</italic> and largely increased the amount of histones in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).' However, the increase in H2B seems modest.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, the colony formation data should be represented as absolute numbers instead of relative</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, the blots are confusing. In the top panel it is hard to judge the absence of the band in the last lane, in the bottom panel it is not clear why the intensity of the two bands changes?</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, the cell cycle progression is hard to judge from the images shown; the phenotype of the <italic>rad53</italic> mutant seems independent of the histone plasmid (and this may also be the case for cdc28 phosphorylation). Furthermore, in the third paragraph of the subsection “Histone accumulation triggers a Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup> phosphorylation that delays the entry into mitosis” the authors conclude that the phosphorylation in the upper right panel was slightly increased. However, this cannot be concluded from the blots shown because the comparison is made between two separate blots.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> it is not clear how many biological replicates were performed.</p><p>The authors suggest that '<italic>rad53 AID lsm1</italic>Δ treated cells were more resistant to MNase digestion' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, and subsection “High levels of histones decrease Htz1<sup>H2A.Z</sup> and condensin incorporation to pericentromeric chromatin”, second paragraph). This is not immediately obvious from the figure. The authors should provide additional analyses or discussion to support this conclusion.</p><p>Regarding the mechanism of WGD by increased histone dosage, a role for H2A.Z in condensin stability has previously been shown in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. Given the differences in pericentric chromatin between the models yeasts, it would be useful to establish whether there is also a connection in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>[Editors' notes: What follows is the decision after the authors appealed the previous decision.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;A histone-sensing checkpoint prevents undesired endomitosis promoted by histone overexpression&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

This experiment is feasible and within our capabilities but probably complex to analyze. Regarding the second question, we can try longer films and check if are able to catch a second division in cells that have experienced a WGD event. However, the facts that the observation of a WGD event is something that takes place at a low frequency added to the long time required for the cell to resume mitosis in the presence of histone overexpression may make this task rather difficult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is good that the authors use different approaches to induce histone stress, however, the basis of which remains unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>During this study we have tried several strategies to try to increase the amount of histones in the cell. There are two main reasons that lead us to finally decide to carry out our experiments with the HTA1-HTB1ΔNEG system. The first one is that this system allows us to overexpress histones when histones are not normally required (beyond replication) but should not interfere with the normal supply of histones required for DNA replication. The second one is that this construct was the only one among those tested (including all the plasmids in which histones are overexpressed using galactose inducible promoters) in which most of the phenotypes observed in the <italic>rad53</italic> and <italic>tom1</italic> mutants were reproduced in wild type cells. Moreover, cells -in which histone overexpression is driven by the GAL promoter- are quite difficult to release from G1 arrest. The reason to use a conditional strain (<italic>rad53-AID lsm1Δ)</italic> able to cut off all histone degradation is explained in the text (Results section). We are aware of the fact that <italic>lsm1</italic> and <italic>rad53</italic> play key roles in other processes in the cell but to our knowledge there is no direct evidence of a common function of these two proteins other than the regulation of histone levels during the cell cycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors cite a previous finding that Swe1 contacts H2B, but do not elaborate.</p></disp-quote><p>We do.

Genes and Dev. 2006; Krogan et al. PNAs 2004) and polyploidy with H2A.Z overexpression (Chambers et al. Genes and Dev 2012). We agree that there is no direct link between the absence of H2A.Z and the generation of polyploid cells but our results do indicate that this phenomenon takes place at a low frequency and could have therefore passed unnoticed. For instance, polyploidy induced by telomere dysfunction was described just a few years ago (Davoli and de Lange, Cell 2010) despite numerous studies in the field of telomere.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also unclear how skewing histone expression would lead to WGD.

All comparisons mentioned in the text as significant normally include a paired t-test that is something not always present in many recently published papers. Regarding the resolution, we include an image at the end of this paragraph in which we can observe chromatin fragmentation from the first biological replicate. The DNA smear in this biological replicate is similar for all of them and seems to be more enriched in a region slightly smaller than 200 bp (last band of the ladder). We also include a first test that was performed with the <italic>rad53-AID CSE4-MYC</italic> (CENP-A) strain to determine the efficiency of the H2A.Z antibody and the MYC antibody (CENP-A). In this test, we can see that CENP-A is specifically enriched at both centromeres (CEN4 and CEN12) and that this enrichment is significantly decreased when the PCR set of primers is displaced less than 200 bp to the left or the right side of centromeres (CEN4 or 12 left and right). This test also shows that H2A.Z is highly enriched at intergenic regions and pericentromeric chromatin, two regions in which H2A.Z is normally present. Each primer used for the qPCR reactions includes a number with its exact position on the chromosome (start or end of the amplicon depending if it’s the forward or reverse primer).

Polyploidy puts more burden on the mitotic chromosome segregation machinery, increases errors in that process, and allows cells to better tolerate the resulting aneuploidy. Thus, it is important for us to understand the potential causes and mechanisms of polyploidy. Using the budding yeast as a model organism, Miles et al. showed in the current study that histone overexpression (coupled with or without mutations in other histone-surveillance genes) causes polyploidy. They further probed the underlying mechanisms and made two interesting findings. First, histone overexpression promotes Wee1-dependent negative phosphorylation on Cdk1 and delays mitotic entry. This mechanism is not, however, required for polyploidization, but may impede it. Second, histone overexpression limits the deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z and its downstream effector condensin on chromosomes, particularly near centromeres. They believe that this mechanism underlies polyploidization caused by histone overexpression.</p><p>Overall, this study advances our understanding of ploidy regulation. The findings are novel and significant. The results are for the most part convincing and logically presented. Publication is recommended, provided that the authors address the following major points.</p><p>1) While it is clear that H2A.Z and condensin deposition is defective under conditions of histone overexpression, the evidence linking this effect to polyploidization needs to be further strengthened. The only strong evidence presented is that deletion of the H2A.Z depositor Swr1 exacerbates the effect of histone overexpression. A genetic suppression experiment will be much more convincing. The authors should test whether H2A.Z overexpression or forced targeting of condensin to peri-centromeres reduces polyploidy caused by histone overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>We are more than willing to test if H2A.Z overexpression is able to suppress WGDs in wild type cells transformed with the 2μΔNEG vector. The second experiment may be more complex to achieve. Indeed artificial targeting of condensin to pericentromeres may be detrimental for the cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Much of the results on DNA damage checkpoint, spindle assembly checkpoint, and Shugoshin are negative results. These sections should be shortened. This will leave more space for the authors to address point 1 above.</p></disp-quote><p>We can easily re-adapt the paper once all the experiments are finished in order to clarify the message.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This study builds on the notion that histone protein levels are tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms and that misregulation or histone overexpression causes toxicity, cell cycle arrest, sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, and mitotic chromosome loss.</p><p>One key observation in this study is that conditions that cause increased histone protein expression lead to whole genome duplication events in yeast, i.e. cells fail to divide the nuclear material between mother and daughter cell in a timely manner; these cells stop proliferating, or the resulting diploid cells as a result of endoreduplication have a growth advantage and rapidly take over the population. This is also apparent on plates where diploids form larger colonies. Upon presumed severe increased histone levels (by disrupting the histone RNA and protein degradation pathways, which is lethal) cells arrest in G2/M and fail to exit from a G2/M arrest. In this first part, the authors investigated whether there is a sensing mechanism, or a checkpoint, for high histone levels. The failure to exit from G2/M was accompanied by a delay in cohesin degradation and increased Cdc28 phosphorylation by Swe1. The authors propose that this event delays the entry into mitosis. However, deletion of Swe1 abolishes Cdc28 phosphorylation but does not suppress the G2/M arrest. Swe1 loss does enhance WGD events.</p><p>In the second part, investigating the cause of the WGD events, the authors show that presumed very high histone levels do not affect CENP-A recruitment to centromeres, but do impair H2A.Z and condensin recruitment to pericentric heterochromatin. A condensin mutation enhances the toxicity of histone overexpression and loss of the H2A.Z assembly factor Swr1 enhances the selection for diploid cells upon transformation with a histone H2A/B overexpression vector, together suggesting that loss of these two chromatin components can further exacerbate the effects of increased histone dosage. This leads the authors to suggest that the decrease in H2A.Z and condensin is at least one of the causes that trigger WGDs when excess free histones accumulate. However, another interpretation of these results (in essence negative genetic interactions) is that histone excess and loss of H2A.Z/condensin act by independent mechanisms because a loss of H2A.Z alone was not sufficient to cause WGD events. It is likely that increased histone dosage affects WGD also by other mechanisms.</p><p>This study presents a series of interesting observations that warrant further investigation. However, the claims made by the authors are not always justified and supported by data. Importantly, whether there is a CDC28/Swe1-mediated sensing mechanism has not been fully addressed. In addition, for many of the experiments, replicates are missing and the study would benefit from a more quantitative appreciation of the altered histone levels. Finally, the story is composed of two pieces that are currently not well connected.</p><p>- The claims made by the authors are not always justified and supported by data, e.g. &quot;we have uncovered a new type of stress (histone-stress) able to trigger a stabilization of Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup> that promotes Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup> phosphorylation and delays the entry into mitosis&quot;. Similar conclusions are drawn elsewhere (e.g. Discussion, third paragraph and Abstract). That histone overexpression causes stress was already known. That it stabilizes Swe1 is not shown in this manuscript. Furthermore, that Cdc28 phosphorylation delays entry into mitosis is not so clear because deletion of Swe1, the responsible kinase, does not affect the delay.</p></disp-quote><p>Of course, we are aware that we are not the first ones reporting that large accumulation of histones causes stress in cells or the first ones that demonstrate that Swe1 is a stress responsive kinase able. What we want to point out with this sentence is that we have uncovered a type of stress able to trigger a Cdc28<sup>CDK1</sup> phosphorylation that depends on the stress-responsive kinase Swe1<sup>WEE1</sup>. We agree that Swe1 stability is not directly addressed in the paper. However, we do show that Cdc28 phosphorylation in <italic>rad53-AID lsm1Δ</italic> treated cells depends on the presence of this kinase and does not take place when Swe1 is lacking. We have recently found a specific antibody for Swe1 that we could order and use it to address this issue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A and 5D</xref>. The conclusion of the delay is based on the results obtained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and not in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (this result is discussed in the second paragraph of the Discussion section). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> we do observe that <italic>rad53</italic> cells increase the levels of phosphorylated Cdc28 and the time required to reach the next G1 (compare the FACS profile at 105 and 120 minutes) specifically when these cells are exposed to high levels of histones H2A and H2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- For many key experiments replicates or quantification of replicate experiments are missing. For most of the western blots, FACS analyses, microscopy, and MNase sensitivity assays in the manuscript no replicates or quantification of replicates are provided. The authors should provide additional data on these experiments to demonstrate reproducibility, following the guidelines of eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to apologize for this issue. The new revised version will include an additional source data file that contains all the raw and processed data and a pdf file with original images for all the replicates performed in all key experiments. We are also happy to share raw data from live microscopy videos if there is a server in which we can upload them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors use various conditions to increase histone expression outside S-phase. One approach is overexpressing the histone genes from strong promoters. This is in principle straightforward. The other main approach is combining a Rad53 degron with an lsm1 mutation, which causes cell death. There are several issues with the approaches.</p><p>1) In the latter case (lsm1+rad53-aid) it cannot be excluded that the phenotypes seen are at least in part caused by other functions of the inactivated proteins. Although this is partially addressed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the Cdc28 phenotype has only been observed in rad53 mutant backgrounds.</p></disp-quote><p>Please check the answer to reviewer 1 (Point 2 major issues).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors use various conditions to induce histone overexpression but show in very few cases to what extent histone proteins are overexpressed. This is an important issue because the various methods and combinations of alleles and/or plasmids have different phenotypic consequences (e.g. 2-micron-δ NEG vs. lsm1+rad53-aid). The authors should examine histone protein levels for the different conditions used, for example not only lsm1 with or without rad53-aid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), but also for the conditions used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>. For example, based on the phenotypes, one might assume that the δ NEG or GAL-H2A-H2B plasmids cause lower histone protein expression than the combined rad53+lsm1 mutation. However, this is not demonstrated by histone blots.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now examined histone levels in the 2μΔNEG vector by RT-PCR and western blot. We will include this data in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The assay first shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> involves transformation with a 2-micron-HTA-HTB1-δ-NEG plasmid. The authors monitor diploidization of the pool of cells over time starting at the time of transformation. This is a somewhat unconventional assay that would benefit from more explanation of the approach and experimental details. For example, at what time point was the vector control analyzed? It would be appropriate to take a vector control along for every time point and also take a t=0 point. In this assay several factors can influence the outcome or dynamics: First, after transformation only a small proportion of the cells will contain a plasmid and survive the selection, most cells will die. Therefore, the kinetics might depend on the transformation efficiency. Second, cells that become diploid will have a growth advantage and take over the population. How fast they do so will depend on the rate of diploidization as well as the growth rate. These different parameters should be explained more clearly and taken into account experimentally. Another point here concerns panel 2D: what is the time point after transformation, how did the authors assess whether the cells examined actually contained a histone plasmid, and what are the numbers for a wild-type cell or vector control?</p></disp-quote><p>All experiments involving the <italic>ΔNEG</italic> cassette started from exponentially growing cells transformed with a centromeric (<italic>rad53K227A</italic> and <italic>tom1Δ)</italic> or a 2-μ vector (wild type) carrying the <italic>HTA1-HTB1ΔNEG</italic> construct. After transformation, strains were plated on SC-Uracil selective media at 30ºC. Time courses to determine the timing of WGDs were performed always from single small colonies coming usually from a 5-days growth plate. These cultures were grown and maintained in exponential growth conditions in liquid SC-uracil minimal media and were only considered for further analysis when they had a full haploid DNA content the first day (day 2 or 1) of the kinetic. Number of days in these experiments reflects the number of days that cells were grown in liquid media culture and not the number of days after transformation. Each experiment performed carried at least one colony of the strain tested transformed with an empty vector. This control cell was treated essentially as cells transformed with the histone-overexpressing vector. Samples were taken daily to estimate the proportion of haploids and diploids by FACS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other Points:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.

The discoveries of the potential involvement of H2A.Z and condensin are very promising.</p><p>However, there are insufficiencies need to be addressed.</p><p>a) One of the fundamental issues that I have for this manuscript is the use of &quot;endomitosis&quot; for the observed phenotype. There are well-documented and -defined examples, normal or pathological, for endomitosis and endoreplication. The authors' initial observation might be better described as an escape from failed segregation, so that a small number of daughter cells inherit the full set of duplicated genomes, at the cost of losing the mother cell. Oddly, the &quot;diploidization&quot; stops at a 2n DNA content, and does not progress into 4n, 8n, or even higher ploidy that is the case for typical endocycles.</p></disp-quote><p>The term endomitosis was used to describe the phenomenon observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> in which the nucleus divides inside the daughter cell without cytokinesis. To avoid confusion, we have replaced the term “aberrant endomitosis” by “aberrant cell division”. We have detected 4n cells in rare occasions while we were analyzing the DNA content of rad53K227A and tom1∆ cells transformed with the CEN∆NEG vector.</p><p>We have never observed them in wild type cells transformed with the 2µ∆NEG vector. We think that this issue could be related to the fact that a 2N DNA content in wild type cells is sufficient to buffer the toxic effect generated by high levels of histones in haploid cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Another concern is that overexpressing histones H2A and H2B is sufficient to trigger the 2n phenotype in a wildtype background. The use of the rad53-AID lsm1 null strain does not add significant values to the study but might further complicate the matter (e.g., rad53 loss-of-function alleles can cause problems in cell cycle progression). Therefore, mechanistic in sights from the use of these strains may not be directly applicable to WGD caused by histone overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>Rad53 and Lsm1 have no other function in common than the regulation of histone levels to our knowledge. However, it is certainly important to consider the possibility that some of the phenotypes observed in the double mutant may be indirect and not related to histone metabolism. To prove if the defect in H2A.Z incorporation observed in the double mutant was relevant for WGDs we have measured H2A.Z levels, and checked the effects of H2A.Z overexpression and SWR1 deletion in cells transformed with the 2µ∆NEG (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). All the results are consistent with the hypothesis that H2A/H2A.Z balance is affected by histone overexpression and critical in the generation of WGDs.</p><p>To prove that Cdc28 phosphorylation is also directly related to histone levels, we have followed Cdc28 phosphorylation during a whole cell cycle in cells that were overexpressing histones H2A and H2B in a wild type and in rad53K227A cells in which histones are not efficiently degraded after histone overexpression (Gunjan et al., Cell 2003). Our results in the rad53K227A indicate that Cdc28 phosphorylation is maintained for a longer time in cells in which histones are being overexpressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Technical issues need to be addressed as well. Firstly, the characterization of histone dosages and chromatin distribution is less than ideal. The authors cherry-picked the methods and histones for analysis. Why not just purify all core histones and resolve them by SDS-PAGE for CBR staining?</p></disp-quote><p>As asked by reviewer 1, we have purified histones (Jourquin and Géli, 2017; Histones Methods and Protocols) in rad53-AID and rad53-AID lsm1∆ mutants treated or not with Auxin and replaced the results from the previous version (Western Blot and Chromatin Fractionation). Histones were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with CBR. Histone amounts were normalized to a non-specific band present in the purification. We observe a relative increase of histones compared to a non-specific band in the rad53-AID lsm1∆ double mutant treated with Auxin either compared to the non treated sample or to the rad53-AID single mutant treated or not (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) The authors argued that H2A.Z is the key player for WGDs, and yet the characterization of H2A, the counterpart of H2A.Z, is lacking (except <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Did they see the expected inverse correlation between H2A and H2A.Z?</p></disp-quote><p>As asked by reviewer 1, in the revised version of the manuscript we have performed ChIPqPCR with an H2A antibody (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We observe that the level of H2A increases at those regions exhibiting a decrease of H2A.Z (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Secondly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> shows that the centromeric Cse4 level does not change, yet histone H3 detection at centromeres shoots up by a factor of about 10, and H4 level is up at the similar level at centromeres. What is the explanation? Why does H3 not evict Cse4?</p></disp-quote><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has just one centromeric nucleosome able to incorporate either one (Dalal et al., Plos Biology 2007) or two Cse4 molecule/s (Mizuguchi et al., Cell 2007; Wisniewski et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2014). Our Cse4 ChIP indicates that the amount of Cse4 at centromeres does not change when histones are overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and therefore disfavors a model in which H3 competes with Cse4 incorporation. The fact that Mtw1, a subunit of the MIND complex required to build a functional kinetochore, is recruited with a similar efficiency and always remains in line with tubulin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C and D</xref>), further suggests the formation of a functional kinetochore that is able to attach chromosomes to microtubules. We agree however with reviewer one that the large increase in H3 and H4 at centromeres and other regions of the genome is intriguing. We discussed thoroughly this point and propose two different explanations.</p><p>The first one is that histone overexpression favors the incorporation of additional nucleosomes at both sides of the centromeric nucleosome. The chromatin that surrounds the centromere is far from perfectly positioned (Cole et al., PNAS 2011) and may allow the incorporation of additional nucleosomes that will increase the signal at centromeres. This hypothesis is simple but has to face the fact that there is a space constraint. Indeed, only a limited amount of nucleosomes can be incorporated in 200600 bp fragments, the average size of DNA fragments that we obtain after sonication in our ChIP experiments. Therefore, the large increase in histone ChIP levels that we observe would be difficult to explain with the addition of 1 or 2 nucleosomes.</p><p>The second explanation that could explain this increase would be a change in chromatin compaction. Nucleosomes can physically interact with neighbor nucleosomes and promote chromatin condensation (Wilkins et al., Science 2014). Changes in chromatin condensation allow the interaction of nucleosomes with other nucleosomes that are not necessarily assembled at the same region. These nucleosomes should, in principle, retain these interactions after formaldehyde crosslinking, and should be able to increase the ChIP signal even if these nucleosomes are not directly interacting with centromeric chromatin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) Thirdly, overexpressing H2A.Z reduces the percentage of 2n* cells. Is this genuine suppression or that cells suffer from lower viability, hence the percentage of viable 2n* colonies decreases? Are the overall chromatin structure and condensin localization improved?</p></disp-quote><p>As demanded by reviewer 1, in the revised version we show the growth of haploids and 2n* cells transformed with the vector allowing the overexpression of histone H2A.Z or an empty control vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We observe no obvious differences in growth between n and 2n* cells overexpressing H2A.Z or carrying the empty vector control. In cells transformed with the 2µ∆NEG vector, H2A.Z overexpression enhances the growth of both haploids and 2n* cells. We do not observe a counter-selection of diploids.</p><p>We have also performed ChIP experiments to see if H2A.Z overexpression is able to suppress the defect in the incorporation of H2A.Z observed in rad53-AID lsm1∆ treated cells. We observe that H2A.Z overexpression is not sufficient to restore the levels of H2A.Z at pericentromeric chromatin in this double mutant. The rad53-AID lsm1∆ double mutant must have other defects that are able to maintain lower levels of H2A.Z incorporation to chromatin. We propose a possible explanation in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) Lastly, with all the supplemental figures, why did authors choose to not show the mating characterization results of the 2n* cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not include it because we considered it something anecdotic and not really important for the overall message of the paper.

I have attached my original review along with comments on the newly added data.</p><p>Genome stability is critical for normal physiology of an organism. Genomic instability at the chromosome level results in aneuploidy, which can cause birth defects and cancer. As cancer cells typically gain copies of chromosomes, one popular theory is that aneuploidy follows whole-genome duplication and polyploidy. Polyploidy puts more burden on the mitotic chromosome segregation machinery, increases errors in that process, and allows cells to better tolerate the resulting aneuploidy. Thus, it is important for us to understand the potential causes and mechanisms of polyploidy. Using the budding yeast as a model organism, Miles et al. showed in the current study that histone overexpression (coupled with or without mutations in other histone-surveillance genes) causes polyploidy. They further probed the underlying mechanisms and made two interesting findings. First, histone overexpression promotes Wee1-dependent negative phosphorylation on Cdk1 and delays mitotic entry. This mechanism is not, however, required for polyploidization, but may impede it. Second, histone overexpression limits the deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z and its downstream effector condensin on chromosomes, particularly near centromeres. They believe that this mechanism underlies polyploidization caused by histone overexpression.</p><p>Overall, this study advances our understanding of ploidy regulation. The findings are novel and significant. The results are for the most part convincing and logically presented. During the review of the initial draft of this paper, I raised the point that the connection between polyploidization and H2A.Z/condensin was weak, and asked for genetic suppression data. The authors have now provided convincing evidence to show that H2A.Z overexpression reduces the extent of polyploidization caused by canonical histone overexpression. This new piece of evidence strengthens their argument for a link between H2A.Z and polyploidization. In a second development, I recently heard at a meeting that condensin II mutations cause tissue-specific polyploidization in the mouse. The finding was actually published near the end of 2016 (Woodward et al. (2016) Genes Dev, 30:2173-2186), but apparently escaped my notice (and was not referenced in this paper). In the Woodward et al. study, Andrew Wood and coworkers showed that mutation of condensin II caused lymphoma and polyploidizition of tumorinitiating cells in the mouse. These findings, along with results in the fly (which the authors discuss), I am now convinced that there is an evolutionarily conserved connection between condensin defects and polyploidization. For these reasons, I recommend the publication of this excellent study.</p></disp-quote><p>We really appreciate the comments from reviewer 2.

First, increased histone dosage in budding yeast leads to genome segregation errors and whole-genome duplication.

The sensing mechanism seems to be independent of known checkpoint mechanisms. Finally, increased histone dosage leads to reduced H2A.Z levels in the cell and reduced condensin loading in pericentric regions; these events may contribute to the genome instability caused by histone stress.

Similarly, why are H4 levels lower in rad53-Aid treated vs untreated?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that they represent loading differences rather than real differences in the levels of H2A.Z. In the new version of the manuscript, western blots are performed with histonepurified extracts.

Here it would be appropriate to show that at t=0, the cells indeed started off as haploids. The vector control does not provide this information. And what is time point used for the vector control, why is only one time point shown for the vector alone? What was the time point used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>?</p><p>In this study, FACS profiles are always made from exponentially growing cells in liquid cultures and not from cells directly collected from petri dishes. This decision was based on the fact that plated cells after 4 or 5 days tend to accumulate in G1/G0. As a result, diploid populations are difficult to differentiate from haploid cells at a G2/M stage. Obtaining a sample in exponential growth conditions usually takes two days in cells transformed with the 2µ∆NEG vector due to their slow growth. Day 2 therefore constitutes the first time-point for which we can harvest enough cells to perform a FACS experiment. At day 2, a large proportion of wild type cells transformed with the 2µ∆NEG vector remain haploid. However, in some cases, some of the transformed colonies have already started to change to a mixed population of haploids and diploids.</p></disp-quote><p>The vector control is used to prove that the strain is completely haploid before transformation with the 2µ∆NEG vector and also to prove that this strain does not go to a 2n state in the absence of the 2µ∆NEG vector. We have always included at least one in each kinetic and taken samples the first and the last day. The one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> corresponds to the one taken the last day. We have never observed a diploidisation in any genetic context in the absence of histone overexpression. That is why we only represent one sample and not two. We believe that is important to point out that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells are very stable unicellular organisms that do not usually experience changes in their ploidy content after subcultivation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, the authors show doubling time data for haploids transformed with the multi-copy deltaNEG plasmid. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>, the authors show that these cells rapidly diploidize. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>There is a certain variation in the time taken by each transformant to become fully diploid, something that can be appreciated in the kinetics shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8A</xref>. Duplication times of transformants were estimated from a twelve-hour time course performed during day 2. FACS samples were taken at the beginning and at the end of the time course to check the ploidy. Samples that were already diploid or had started to diploidize during the kinetic were not considered for the estimation of the duplication time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For many figures, the authors show the average of two experiments and a standard deviation. Although two replicates may sometimes suffice, including more replicates gives more confidence in the results. For small sample size, showing the two data points or the spread is more informative than standard deviation.</p></disp-quote><p>In this new version we have corrected the representation of our results according to the suggestion of reviewer 3. We have also extended the number of repeats of two of our key experiments, the condensin ChIP experiment, that now shows the average of five biological replicates and the suppression of WGDs by H2A.Z overexpression, that is done with 4 independent biological replicates.

It thus remains possible that Mad2 is activated through the canonical kinetochore pathway. The authors should include positive controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C</xref>, such as cells treated with nocodazole.
