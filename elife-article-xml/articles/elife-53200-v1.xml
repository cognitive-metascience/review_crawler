The first discovered environmental sensing by phages, lysis inhibition, has only been characterized and studied in the limited context of T-even coliphages. Here, we discover lysis inhibition in the etiological agent of the diarrheal disease cholera, <italic>Vibrio cholerae,</italic> infected by ICP1, a phage ubiquitous in clinical samples. This work identifies the ICP1-encoded holin, <italic>teaA,</italic> and antiholin, <italic>arrA,</italic> that mediate lysis inhibition. Further, we show that an MGE, the defensive phage satellite PLE, collapses lysis inhibition. Through <underline>l</underline>ysis <underline>i</underline>nhibition <underline>d</underline>isruption a conserved PLE protein, LidI, is sufficient to limit the phage produced from infection, bottlenecking ICP1. These studies link a novel incarnation of the classic lysis inhibition phenomenon with conserved defensive function of a phage satellite in a disease context, highlighting the importance of lysis timing during infection and parasitization.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacteriophages, or phages for short, are viruses that infect bacteria, take over the molecular machinery inside the bacterial cells and use it to make more copies of themselves.

Early geneticists observed an interesting phenotype in <underline>r</underline>apid lysing T-even mutants, called <italic>r</italic> mutants, which produce plaques with clear edges while plaques of wild type (WT; all acronyms are expanded in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) T-even phages have fuzzy edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hershey, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paddison et al., 1998</xref>). Edge fuzziness is the consequence of inhibited cell lysis triggered by the adsorption of additional phage after initial infection. This ‘superinfection’ also stabilizes infected cells as measured by optical density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doermann, 1948</xref>). The phenomenon, termed lysis inhibition (LIN), is significant for two reasons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>): it allows for prolonged production of progeny phage resulting in larger phage bursts, and it protects progeny phage from adsorbing to infected cells, which are not productive hosts for secondarily adsorbed phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abedon, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abedon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doermann, 1948</xref>). Consequently, LIN is considered an important adaptation in environments where host bacteria are scarce but free virions are plentiful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abedon, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abedon, 2019</xref>). Despite being discovered over half a century ago, LIN has only been well characterized in T-even coliphages where it is mediated by holins and antiholins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen and Young, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paddison et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ramanculov and Young, 2001</xref>). Holins are the first step in canonical holin-endolysin-spanin lysis systems in Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cahill and Young, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Young, 2014</xref>). Holins accumulate in the inner membrane until they trigger, making holes that enable endolysin digestion of the peptidoglycan after which spanins fuse the inner and outer membranes to complete cell lysis. During lysis inhibition, antiholins inhibit holin triggering thereby stopping the progression towards lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen and Young, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paddison et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ramanculov and Young, 2001</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterizing lysis inhibition.</title><p>Schematic of T4 infection of <italic>E. coli</italic>.

V. cholerae</italic> poses a substantial global health burden as the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ali et al., 2015</xref>). In both aquatic reservoirs and stool samples from cholera patients, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> co-occurs with predatory phages. Several studies have implicated <italic>V. cholerae</italic> phages in playing a role in modulating cholera outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">D'Herelle and Malone, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Faruque et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Faruque et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jensen et al., 2006</xref>) leading to proposals of phage cocktails as prophylactics to curb cholera transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yen et al., 2017</xref>). The predominant phage in cholera patient samples is ICP1, a lytic myovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seed et al., 2011</xref>) that is locked in a dynamic arms race with no clear winner as both <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and ICP1 continue to be isolated from patients in the cholera endemic region of Bangladesh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Angermeyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKitterick et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKitterick et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seed et al., 2011</xref>). Added into the evolutionary fray is a parasitic phage satellite called PLE (<underline>p</underline>hage-inducible chromosomal island-<underline>l</underline>ike <underline>e</underline>lement) found integrated in the chromosome of clinical <italic>V. cholerae</italic> isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McKitterick et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seed et al., 2013</xref>). Previous analysis of isolates dating back to 1949 revealed a succession of five distinct PLEs (PLE 1 through PLE 5 of which PLE 1 is the most recently circulating PLE) in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> which possess shared genomic architecture. Each PLE provides <italic>V. cholerae</italic> with a clear fitness benefit in the defense against ICP1 as PLE abolishes phage production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>). Upon infection, PLE excises from the bacterial chromosome, harnessing an ICP1-encoded protein as the trigger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McKitterick and Seed, 2018</xref>), replicates using both PLE and ICP1-encoded products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKitterick et al., 2019a</xref>), and accelerates cell lysis after forming particles hypothesized to be made by hijacking ICP1 structural components to transduce the PLE genome to naïve recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>). As no infectious ICP1 are produced, PLE defends populations of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> from ICP1 attack, functioning as an abortive infection system. In the face of this anti-phage element, ICP1 acquired a Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system to target PLE in a sequence-specific manner, restoring ICP1 progeny phage production and overcoming PLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McKitterick et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seed et al., 2013</xref>). While the full extent of ICP1, PLE, and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> interactions are unknown and continuing to evolve, efforts to understand how PLEs restrict ICP1 have yet to identify any single PLE open reading frame necessary for inhibition (via testing of PLE-encoded <italic>repA,</italic> which is necessary for PLE replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barth et al., 2020</xref>] and <italic>int,</italic> which is required for PLE excision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McKitterick and Seed, 2018</xref>]). From the only characterized processes, namely excision and replication, it is clear that PLE requires phage-encoded products, consequently depending on ICP1 for horizontal transmission; however, uncharacteristic of other phage satellites like the well characterized <italic><underline>S</underline>taphylococcus <underline>a</underline>ureus</italic> <underline>p</underline>athogenicity <underline>i</underline>slands (SaPIs) which decrease but do not eliminate the production of progeny virions, PLE completely abolishes ICP1 production – a balancing act that likely requires the exploitation of select products at exact times during the 20 minutes before PLE-mediated accelerated cell lysis.</p><p>The accelerated cell lysis program in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> harboring PLE led us to investigate the prolonged infection of ICP1 in strains without PLE where we discovered that ICP1 exhibits lysis inhibition. In this work we report the first mechanistic characterization of archetypal LIN outside of <italic>E. coli</italic> and we reveal ICP1 LIN mechanisms in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> by identifying previously uncharacterized ICP1 genes with holin and antiholin activity, termed <italic>teaA</italic> and <italic>arrA</italic> respectively. Subsequently, we discovered a single PLE-encoded gene we call <italic>lidI</italic> for <underline>l</underline>ysis <underline>i</underline>nhibition <underline>d</underline>isruption that is sufficient to collapse ICP1-mediated lysis inhibition. All PLEs encode LidI, highlighting a conserved strategy PLEs may use to antagonize an aspect of the phage lifecycle not previously known to be targeted by parasitic satellites. While we cannot be sure of LidI function in the context of the PLE, it alone is sufficient to decrease the yield of ICP1 from infected <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and impose an evolutionary bottleneck on phage populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ICP1 exhibits lysis inhibition</title><p>After infection at low multiplicity of infection (MOI; MOI = 0.1), ICP1 completes virion production within 20–25 minutes in PLE (-) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>).

Such lysis kinetics are consistent with canonical LIN by T-even coliphages wherein a portion of infected cells release progeny phages triggering LIN in the remaining population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doermann, 1948</xref>).

Given that TeaA is conserved in ICP1 isolates, and lysis timing, which is fine-tuned by antiholins, is critical, we expected antiholins would also be conserved. Antiholins are often found near holin genes, in many cases utilizing an alternative start site within the holin sequence or occupying an overlapping open reading frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bläsi and Young, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Graschopf and Bläsi, 1999</xref>).

This suggests that there are potential homologous LIN systems - complete with both holin and antiholin - present in phages other than ICP1. In contrast, the presence of ArrA homologs without TeaA homologs raises the question: what are antiholins doing on their own? Perhaps they have evolved functionality with holins divergent enough to no longer be considered homologous to TeaA under our search parameters, or they have been coopted for divergent functions much like holins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mehner-Breitfeld et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saier and Reddy, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PLE accelerates ICP1-mediated lysis</title><p>Thus far, characterization of all ICP1 LIN was done in the absence of PLE, a parasitic phage satellite of ICP1. Although the mechanisms that PLE deploys to inhibit and hijack ICP1 are not completely understood, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> lysis kinetics during high multiplicity infections vary depending on the presence of PLE. Consistent with previous experiments at high MOI (MOI = 5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>), ICP1 infection of PLE (-) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> gradually lyses cultures reaching the lowest optical density ~90 minutes after infection.

This accelerated timescale could result from any combination of processes such as PLE deploying its own lysis machinery, PLE modulating the expression or stability of ICP1’s lysis machinery, or PLE inhibiting or collapsing LIN.</p><p>To investigate the underpinnings of accelerated lysis in the presence of PLE, we scrutinized the PLE for potential lysis machinery. Initial analysis revealed no transmembrane domains in any of the ~25 predicted open reading frames in each of PLEs 1, 2, and 3. However, the earliest known PLEs, (PLEs 4 and 5) contain two ORFs with predicted transmembrane domains: ORF2 and ORF26. ORF2<sup>PLE 4/5</sup> does not have homologs in PLEs 1 or 2, suggesting it is not a conserved player mediating accelerated lysis. Consequently, we focused on ORF26<sup>PLE 4/5</sup>. Although no homologs were immediately obvious, the synteny between PLEs suggested the presence of previously unannotated open reading frames in PLEs 1, 2, and 3 (namely ORF20.1<sup>PLE 1</sup>, ORF24.1<sup>PLE 2</sup> and ORF24.1<sup>PLE 3</sup>), which are homologous to ORF26<sup>PLE 4/5</sup> and contain transmembrane domains. We subsequently named these genes <italic>lidI</italic> and the homologs cluster into two groups: <italic>lidI<sup>PLE 1</sup></italic> and <italic>lidI<sup>PLE 2</sup></italic> encode for a 66 amino acid long protein, while <italic>lidI<sup>PLE 3</sup></italic>, <italic>lidI<sup>PLE 4</sup></italic> and <italic>lidI<sup>PLE 5</sup></italic> encode larger proteins at 121 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These data suggest that LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> does not act as a canonical holin when expressed alone and that its ability to mediate cell lysis is dependent on the presence of ICP1.</p><p>Having demonstrated that LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> recapitulates PLE-mediated accelerated lysis, we wanted to determine if it was also necessary for this phenotype. Interestingly, however, when we deleted <italic>lidI<sup>PLE 1</sup></italic> from PLE 1 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> the lysis kinetics were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To be sure the accelerated lysis is not the consequence of PLE inhibiting the production of phage that are necessary to superinfect cells, exogenous phage was added to PLE 1 and PLE 1 <italic>ΔlidI</italic> strains both of which still demonstrated accelerated lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). As these findings were at odds with the conservation of <italic>lidI</italic> homologs in all the known PLEs, we tested a representative of the other cluster of homologs, LidI<sup>PLE 4</sup>, for conserved function. Indeed, LidI<sup>PLE 4</sup> is sufficient to cause accelerated lysis in the absence of PLE, however again we found that it is not necessary – PLE 4 <italic>ΔlidI V. cholerae</italic> strains still exhibit accelerated lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). To further investigate the role of individual genes in lysis timing, PLE 1 mutants containing a single knockout of each individual open reading frame were exposed to phage and each demonstrated accelerated lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). To identify other PLE-encoded factors sufficient to recapitulate PLE-mediated accelerated lysis, we expressed each PLE 1 ORF individually and challenged those strains with phage. This screen did not identify any other single genes sufficient to accelerate lysis, however, it is important to note that cryptic genes could be responsible, other accelerated lysis systems could require multiple ORFs to function, or the timing and expression level of genes expressed outside the context of PLE could obscure gene function. Collectively, these results suggest that PLE mediated accelerated cell lysis is the consequence of the activity of two or more functionally redundant gene products, of which LidI is the only product sufficient to phenocopy the PLE-encoded phenotype. Although redundancy is perhaps not expected for mobile genetic elements (MGEs) with restricted genome size, we have additionally observed that no single PLE open reading frame is necessary for inhibition of ICP1 plaque formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>), suggesting that multiple strategies act synergistically to eliminate phage production in addition to accelerating lysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> can function through lysis inhibition disruption</title><p>As LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> is sufficient to accelerate lysis but does not phenocopy what we expect of a holin, we wanted to determine the mechanism of LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup>-mediated accelerated lysis in the absence of PLE. Since ICP1 exhibits LIN during high MOI infections, we hypothesized that LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> causes accelerated lysis by disrupting LIN. LIN occurs when phages outnumber hosts, so changing the multiplicity of infection changes the onset of LIN: at low multiplicities of infection, a small fraction of cells produce a burst of phage which are adsorbed by neighbors and this process can repeat a number of times until the majority of cells are infected and LIN is triggered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The differential onset of LIN means that accelerated lysis mediated by LidI<sup>PLE 1 </sup>would also be expected to change in accordance with MOI if it functions by disrupting LIN.

Hence, we hypothesize that PLE-mediated accelerated lysis decreases the ability of ICP1 to evolve in the face of PLE. However, because our data support a model in which accelerated lysis is redundantly encoded, it is not currently possible to test the impact of delayed lysis on ICP1 evolution in the context of the PLE. We can, however, interrogate how the <italic>lidI</italic>-mediated collapse of LIN and concomitant decrease in phage production in PLE (-) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> constrains ICP1 evolution. To test if LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup>-mediated accelerated lysis is enough to impact diversity through the acquisition of random mutations in the progeny phage population, we exposed PLE (-) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> with and without <italic>lidI<sup>PLE 1</sup></italic> to ICP1 (MOI = 0.1), collected the population of progeny phage, and looked for plaque formation on PLE (-) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> encoding a Type I-E CRISPR-Cas system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Box et al., 2016</xref>); an expanded schematic of this experiment is available in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>. These host strains of CRISPR-Cas (+) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> were engineered to harbor various anti-ICP1 spacers that allowed for varying rates of ICP1 escape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). For each spacer, fewer phage progeny from <italic>lidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> V. cholerae</italic> were able to overcome targeting than progeny from infections of strains without <italic>lidI<sup>PLE 1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This defect is due to the LidI-mediated decrease in the population of phages as the frequency of phage escaping stays the same (e.g. ~2 out of every thousand phages can overcome spacer C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Consequently, because less phage are produced from <italic>lidI<sup>PLE 1</sup></italic>-expressing <italic>V. cholerae,</italic> an order of magnitude fewer phages can overcome the spacer in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>While exposure to <italic>V. cholerae</italic>’s CRISPR-Cas system was meant to probe evolution at the level of individual random mutations and proclivity to overcome targeting, phages also readily use homologous recombination to evolve during co-infection. To test the impact of LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> on this aspect of evolvability, we took advantage of the Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system found in ICP1 by engineering two ICP1 variants with nonfunctional CRISPR-Cas systems: one devoid of spacers against PLE with an inactive Cas1 preventing spacer acquisition (CRISPR*-Cas ICP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McKitterick et al., 2019b</xref>) and the other lacking Cas2-3 (CRISPR-Cas* ICP1). We then used these phages to coinfect <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains (MOI = 0.01) with and without LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup>. After lysis, progeny phage were tested for their ability to plaque on PLE 1 <italic>V. cholerae,</italic> which is only possible if homologous recombination between the two variants restored a functional CRISPR-Cas system able to target PLE 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>); an expanded schematic of this experiment is available in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>. Predictably, the presence of LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> decreased the number of progeny phages per infection that recombined to reconstitute the CRISPR-Cas system and overcome PLE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Although LidI expression does not directly impact ICP1 evolvability within infected cells, these data demonstrate that LidI imposes a bottleneck on ICP1’s population size resulting in fewer diverse phages and limiting ICP1’s potential to escape anti-phage activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we observe a previously unknown lysis inhibition (LIN) state in the globally relevant pathogen, <italic>V. cholerae,</italic> in response to ICP1, the predominant phage isolated from clinical samples, and identify the relevant ICP1-encoded lysis machinery: the holin, TeaA, and the antiholin, ArrA. Consistent with T-even induced LIN, ICP1 LIN results in fuzzy-edged plaques and delayed lysis sensitive to cellular proton motive force. This work subsequently reveals that the disruption of LIN is part of PLE’s anti-phage repertoire. A single open reading frame, <italic>lidI</italic>, which is conserved through all five PLEs spanning the last 70 years, is sufficient to disrupt LIN and limit progeny phage populations when expressed outside its native context in PLE (-) <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. These two opposing forces, ICP1 LIN and accelerated lysis by PLE through LIN disruption (which our data shows LidI is capable of doing in isolation and yet other undiscovered PLE-encoded mechanisms redundantly accomplish), act in the midst of the ongoing evolutionary arms race between <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and its parasites.</p><p>In phage-host interactions, research continues to unveil evolutionary strategies used to sense populations in the environment. Phage-encoded anti-CRISPRs (the counter adaption to combat CRISPR-Cas systems) can function in a phage-concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borges et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Landsberger et al., 2018</xref>), small arbitrium peptides can influence lysogeny decisions based on other infections throughout the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Erez et al., 2017</xref>), and phages can ‘listen in’ on host quorum sensing as a measure of host availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Silpe and Bassler, 2019</xref>). All of these environmental signals parallel LIN, one of the first discovered forms of communication during phage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doermann, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abedon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hershey, 1946</xref>). The anti-CRISPR system uses multiple subsequent phage infections, each benefiting from anti-CRISPRs expended during previous infections, to overcome host defenses similar to the subsequent superinfections that trigger LIN to make the most of the infected host. Arbitrium peptide signals formed upon infection give phages a proxy for when the majority of neighboring cells are infected, protecting potential progeny phage from adsorbing to previously infected cells by employing lysogeny – this shielding of progeny phages from infected cells is also accomplished during LIN. Phages eaves dropping on the host quorum sensing system provides a measure of available hosts – a lack of which is communicated by secondarily adsorbed virions during LIN. Consequently, our discovery of ICP1’s LIN in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> reinforces lysis inhibition as a relevant form of environmental sensing and highlights the importance of phages tuning their infection parameters depending on host availability in the environment. Following ingestion, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> colonizes and blooms in the small intestine before being shed in stool, further contaminating aquatic reservoirs and promoting subsequent ingestion and infection cycles. If large numbers of ICP1 are co-ingested with small numbers of <italic>V. cholerae,</italic> it would be theoretically beneficial for ICP1 to demonstrate LIN in infected cells, bide time inside the cell while making more virions, and lyse in the small intestine after uninfected <italic>V. cholerae</italic> have had time to replicate, providing ample hosts for subsequent rounds of phage predation. This is consistent with outbreak models in which phage become more abundant in the environment towards the end of an epidemic and there is phage amplification within cholera patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Faruque et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Faruque et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jensen et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, if <italic>V. cholerae</italic> bloomed in the gut followed by a subsequent expansion of the phage population to the extent that phages now outnumber hosts, it would be beneficial for ICP1 progeny phage to stay inside a cell, protected from adsorbing to cells that are already making progeny phage, and instead wait for release into the aquatic environment or ingestion by an uninfected patient via person-to-person transmission where ICP1 progeny may have better chances of finding an uninfected bacterial host to carry out its parasitic lifecycle. Interestingly, this begins to touch on variability of the phage life cycle in different aquatic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silva-Valenzuela and Camilli, 2019</xref>), and the potential benefit for a phage population if a lysis inhibited cell is ingested along with <italic>V. cholerae</italic> from a patient – after which <italic>V. cholerae</italic> has been shown to be hyperinfectious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Merrell et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>It is important to consider that within this tripartite system there are two parasites at odds with one another and both encode mechanisms to alter lysis timing. While the benefits of LIN to ICP1 have been explored in the parallel T-even phage/<italic>E. coli</italic> systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abedon, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abedon, 2019</xref>) and discussed above, the impact of a MGE, specifically a parasitic phage satellite like PLE, on lysis inhibition could not have been predicted. One could argue that LIN might provide PLE with more resources for horizontal transmission, or counter that LIN provides time enough for ICP1 to evade PLE-encoded anti-phage mechanisms. Here, we show that the PLE accelerates lysis with LidI as a conserved part of its program – presumably collapsing LIN as a hinderance to ICP1. Known examples showcase the deleterious effects of accelerated lysis on phage fitness, with holin mutations like the λ phage S-holin mutants which accelerate lysis by 20–25 minutes and lower progeny phage yield by orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson-Boaz et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang, 2006</xref>). Similarly, a part of an abortive infection system in <italic>Lactococcus lactis,</italic> the AbiZ protein, causes cells infected by φ31 to lyse 15 minutes early, decreasing phage titers 100-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Durmaz and Klaenhammer, 2007</xref>). Indeed, we find even without other PLE-encoded products, accelerated cell lysis by LidI is sufficient to decrease phage population size and this bottlenecks the phage population, likely reducing ICP1’s ability to overcome PLE. The absolute abolishment of progeny phage accomplished by PLE’s complete anti-phage repertoire (of which LidI is only a part) is particularly interesting considering functionally similar SaPIs, which lay dormant in the chromosome much like PLE, until phage infection when SaPIs are induced to parasitize phage components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Novick et al., 2010</xref>). One of many ways that PLEs and SaPIs differ is that SaPIs allow for some propagation of their helper phage, whereas PLE completely ablates ICP1 production of progeny phage. It is easy to think of SaPIs as selfish elements: they integrate and take advantage of vertical transmission. Once the cells are challenged by a helper phage, they excise, inhibit phage for their own ends, and escape the cell while allowing some progeny phage to escape with them all the while promoting diversity and horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frígols et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Novick et al., 2010</xref>). This lifecycle ensures horizontal transmission of the SaPI as well as continued activation of SaPIs down the line by available helper phages. In contrast, PLE completely blocks ICP1 production by acting as an abortive infection mechanism. Our evidence that PLE functions through collapsing lysis inhibition supports this angle as lysis inhibition could theoretically, as previously mentioned, allow for more time to produce PLE particles, enabling horizontal transmission of PLE to larger numbers of naïve cells. Surprisingly, this is so important that the means to disrupt LIN and execute lysis for PLE’s own selfish benefit are apparently redundantly encoded within the PLE – LidI can collapse LIN in the absence of PLE, though <italic>ΔlidI</italic> PLE still shows accelerated lysis. There is also limited evidence that PLE uses the hijacked ICP1 machinery to transduce in nature – in the laboratory, conditions allow four of the five PLEs to integrate in many sites across the superintegron; however, natural isolates only ever have one of those four PLEs integrated in one specific site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>). This pattern is indicative of vertical transmission and infrequent horizontal transduction in the strains sampled from epidemics, which makes it easier to reconcile PLE’s abortive infection activity. With these evolutionary hypotheses in mind, ICP1 acquiring the CRISPR-Cas system changed the game: some single spacers encoded in ICP1 targeting PLE allow ICP1 to form progeny while simultaneously allowing for transduction of PLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McKitterick et al., 2019b</xref>). If all spacers were singular and created equal, selection could drive PLE to act more like a typical satellite phage, embracing horizontal transfer and allowing ICP1 to slide by producing limited progeny phage. We know, however, that this is not the case; CRISPR systems function by dynamically acquiring spacers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>) and multiple spacers can abolish PLE’s ability to transduce while also killing the cell harboring PLE, destroying any chance at horizontal or vertical transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McKitterick et al., 2019b</xref>). Considering this complication, it is no surprise PLE would employ products like LidI to collapse LIN, perhaps to limit the ability of ICP1 to pick up new spacers against PLE.</p><p>The dynamic arms race between ICP1, PLE, and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is ongoing as is research on other coevolving parasite/host systems. Focusing future work on LIN and MGEs is particularly promising given that this work represents a novel incarnation of LIN outside of the T-even coliphages, and we found homologs of LIN machinery outside of the limited contexts that LIN has been previously alluded to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gromkova, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Latino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schito, 1974</xref>). This prevalence suggests that LIN exists outside of characterized systems though the impacts of LIN and its disruption are unknown and largely unexplored. In contrast, the importance of MGEs is widely accepted and anti-phage mechanisms are increasingly found on MGEs, making questions about the interplay between MGEs and the complicating factors outlined here particularly attractive. One recently discovered example of how prevalent these confounding factors are is that of the cyclic-oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signaling system, which is found on MGEs in bacteria including <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, and that, in <italic>E. coli</italic>, serves as an abortive infection system upon phage infection and can cause lysis on an accelerated timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2019</xref>). As a final note on these intriguing areas of future inquiry, there is increased interest in utilizing phages to combat bacterial infections as a part of phage therapy - the successful application of such approaches will likely depend on understanding all the interactions between phages and bacteria including responses that depend on the environment like lysis inhibition and interplay mediated by MGEs like PLE.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

plates and growth in Miller LB (Fisher Bioreagents) with aeration. Media was supplemented with chloramphenicol (2.5 μg/mL for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol for <italic>E. coli</italic>), kanamycin (75 μg/mL), ampicillin (100 μg/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL) when appropriate. Cell densities were measured at OD<sub>600</sub> in tubes (Biochrom Ultrospec 10; 10 mm pathlength referred to as OD<sub>600-tube</sub>) and in 96-well plates (all reported OD<sub>600</sub> measurements in figures have a pathlength equivalent to 150 μL in Costar Clear 96-well plates (Corning)). To induce chromosomal constructs in both liquid and top agar, plasmid constructs in top agar, and the plasmid P<sub>tac</sub>-<italic>arrA</italic> construct for complementation, 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and 1.5 mM theophylline were added to cultures while the remaining plasmid constructs were induced with 125 μM IPTG and 187.5 μM theophylline in liquid cultures. Plasmid constructs were used for all experiments other than phage infection yield experiments which utilized chromosomal constructs to decrease leaky expression in uninduced strains.</p><p>Bacteriophages were propagated on PLE (-) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> hosts and prepped via polyethylene glycerol precipitation or concentration and media exchange on Amicon Ultra – 15 (Millipore) centrifugal filters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonilla et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clokie and Kropinski, 2009</xref>). Stocks were stored in sodium chloride-tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffer (STE), and quantified via the soft agar overlay method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clokie and Kropinski, 2009</xref>). Briefly, titering was completed by growing <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to mid-log, infecting with cultures with diluted phage, and allowing adsorption to occur for 7 to 10 minutes before plating on 0.5% LB top agar. Subsequently, multiplicity of infection (MOI) was determined by calculating the number of plaque forming units and varying that with the number of colony forming units of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> at a given optical density. This does not take into account virions that adsorb but do not successfully form plaques. Consequently, all reported MOIs do not address multiplicity of adsorption which could vary and impact initial changes in optical densities during experiments. Mechanical lysis of cultures infected with phage was accomplished by mixing chloroform into cultures then letting cultures stand at room temperature for ten minutes before spinning at 5000 x <italic>g</italic> for 15 minutes at 4°C and removing the supernatant for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cloning and strain generation</title><p>Chromosomal integrations in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> were accomplished through natural transformation of linear DNA created via splicing by overlap extension PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dalia et al., 2014</xref>). In the case of deletions, antibiotic resistance cassettes were integrated into the locus of the deleted gene and subsequently flipped out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baba et al., 2006</xref>). Plasmids were constructed with Gibson Assembly and Golden Gate reactions. Phage mutants were selected as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Box et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, complementary spacer oligos were annealed and inserted into a plasmid-borne CRISPR array. This plasmid was mated into a strain of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> engineered to include an inducible Type 1-E CRISPR-Cas system (CRISPR-Cas (+) <italic>V.</italic> cholerae). This system in the host strain was induced for 20 minutes before ICP1 infection for plaque assays on 0.5% LB top agar containing antibiotics to maintain the CRISPR array plasmid. Plaques were picked into STE (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl 1 mM EDTA), purified on the same host twice, and genomic DNA was prepped for PCRs with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Phages were subjected to PCR of the targeted gene and subsequent Sanger sequencing. Clean knockouts were accomplished by adding a repair template of homologous sequence containing the desired deletion and flanking DNA to the plasmid containing the CRISPR array as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Box et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Lysis kinetics</title><p><italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains were grown in 2 mL cultures to an OD<sub>600-tube</sub>=0.3 and 150 μL of cultures were added to 96-well plates. This transition often results in a slight decrease in optical density at the beginning of experiments where OD<sub>600</sub> is tracked. The underlying cause for this decrease is unknown, but is consistent between controls and experimental conditions. Inducers and phage were pre-aliquoted in plates unless otherwise specified. OD<sub>600</sub> within the plate was read for each sample on the SpectraMax i3x (Molecular Devices) plate reader every two minutes with one minute of shaking between each read while the machine incubated cultures at 37°C. Assays were interrupted for the addition of phage, inducers, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP; 2 μL of 8.4 mM DNP dissolved in 80% ethanol for a final concentration of 110 μM DNP), or ethanol (2 μL of 80% ethanol) during which samples were removed from the plate reader briefly before measurement was resumed. This enabled superinfection of cultures (initial cultures were infected with ICP1 MOI = 1, returned to the plate reader for four minutes, and subsequently superinfected with ICP1 MOSI = 5), addition of DNP in ethanol or ethanol alone to ICP1 MOI = 5 infected cultures 25 minutes post-infection, and DNP addition to induced cultures after 20 minuntes of growth with the inducers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Determination of phage yield from high MOI infection</title><p>For each strain, three 2 mL cultures of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> were grown. The first was grown to an OD<sub>600-tube</sub>=0.15, inducer was added, and the culture was returned to the incubator; this culture served as the pre-induced culture. All cultures were grown for an additional 20 minutes to OD<sub>600-tube</sub>=0.3 at which point ICP1 MOI = 5 was added. Inducer was added to one tube at this time; this culture served as the culture induced at time zero. Tubes were returned to the incubator for 5 minutes for phage adsorption. Cultures were spun at 5000 x <italic>g</italic> for 3 minutes to pellet cells. Unadsorbed phage was aspirated off and cells were washed once with 1 mL of prewarmed LB with or without inducer. Cells were spun again and resuspended in media with and without inducer at which point OD<sub>600-tube</sub> was determined. Cultures (150 μL) were moved to 96-well plates with one well designated to the pre-induced culture, one well devoted to the culture induced at time zero, and three wells filled with uninduced culture. The plate was returned to the 37°C incubator to shake at 230 RPM. Inducer was added to two wells of the uninduced cultures 20 and 40 minutes post-infection respectively, leaving one uninduced control. The experiment was ended with mechanical lysis of cultures and subsequent quantification of phage titers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Determination of proton motive force</title><p><italic>V. cholerae</italic> containing the specified plasmids were grown to OD<sub>600-tube</sub>=0.2. Inducers (125 μM IPTG and 187.5 μM theophylline) were added and cells were grown at 37°C with aeration for 30 minutes before 0.5 mL were pelleted at 5000 x <italic>g</italic> for 3 minutes and resuspended in 0.1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.2; Gibco Life Technologies) containing 20 μM 3,3’-diethloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC<sub>2</sub>(3); Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescence measurements were completed in black 96-well half-volume plates (Corning) in the SpectraMax i3x (Molecular Devices) with 480(508) and 488(650) excitation(emission) wavelength settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Plaque analysis</title><p><italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains were grown to mid-log before plaquing assays. For EOP experiments, plasmid constructs were induced for 20 minutes prior to infecting and plating with antibiotic and inducer in the 0.5% LB top agar. For plaque edge analysis, plasmids were maintained with antibiotics but not induced prior to plating on 0.5% top agar containing antibiotics and inducer. Plates solidified at room temperature prior to incubation at 37°C. For spot plates, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> was mixed with 0.5% top agar prior to infection, vortexed, and poured onto an LB agar plate to solidify before 3 μL spots of phage dilutions were overlaid on the agar. Plates were allowed to dry prior to incubation at 37°C. To visualize plaques, plates were scanned on the EPSON Perfection V800 Dual Lens scanner.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blots</title><p>Plasmid empty vector (EV) and FLAG-LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> were grown to OD<sub>600-tube</sub>=0.2 then induced with 1 mM IPTG and 1.5 mM for 40 minutes before 0.5 mL samples were taken. To observe expression during infection, strains were grown to OD<sub>600-tube</sub>=0.3, infected with ICP1 MOI = 2 with 4 mL samples taken at the labeled timepoints. Samples were prepared and visualized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McKitterick and Seed, 2018</xref>). Briefly, samples were mixed with one volume of cold methanol, pelleted at 15,000 x <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 15 minutes, washed with 1 mL cold PBS, and pelleted. Pellets were resuspended in PBS with XT sample buffer and reducing agent (Bio-Rad), vortexed, and boiled for 10 minutes before being run on 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS gels (Bio-Rad Criterion XT). Gels were transferred via the Trans-Blot Turbo (Bio-Rad) and visualized with rabbit-α-FLAG (1:3,000) primary and goat-α-rabbit-HRP conjugated secondary antibodies on the ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>CRISPR-Cas targeting of phage populations</title><p><italic>V. cholerae</italic> harboring an empty vector control or LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> plasmid were grown to OD<sub>600-tube</sub>=0.15 before being induced and returned to the incubator to grow with aeration until OD<sub>600-tube</sub>=0.3. At this point 150 μL of culture were added to 96-well plates and infected with ICP1 MOI = 0.1. After lysis 90 minutes post-infection, any remaining cells were mechanically lysed and the resulting phage population was plaqued on CRISPR-Cas (+) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Box et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, Cas (+) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> harboring CRISPR array plasmids were induced 20 minutes before phage populations were titered on each specified <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strain.

Lysis inhibition, first discovered about 70 years ago, serves to increase phage burst size and protect phage progeny from adsorbing to cells that are already infected. Prior to this work, lysis inhibition had only been well-characterized in <italic>E. coli</italic> T-even phages, although it was also reported in coliphage N4. In these T4 phages it is mediated by antiholins that inhibit the activity of phage holin proteins and slow progression towards cell lysis in the presence of high phage concentrations.</p><p>This work provides the first study of lysis inhibition outside of <italic>E. coli</italic>. Phage ICP1, a lytic phage that infects <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, is the predominant phage in cholera patient samples. The parasitic phage satellite PLE is integrated into the clinical <italic>V. cholerae</italic> isolates and it abolishes ICP1 phage production. When ICP1 infects, PLE is excised from the chromosome, replicates, and accelerates cell lysis; this results in release of PLE, and no infectious ICP1. One open question was how PLEs restrict ICP1, as no single PLE gene had been shown to be necessary for inhibition. Hays and Seed show that ICP1 inhibits lysis inhibition – they discover previously uncharacterized ICP1 genes with holin and antiholin activity (<italic>teaA</italic> and <italic>arrA</italic>), and they characterize a single PLE-encoded gene, lidI, which collapses ICP-mediated lysis inhibition. LidI is the first PLE-encoded ORF shown to negatively impact ICP1 phage yield. They show that all PLEs encode LidI, thereby revealing a conserved strategy to antagonize the phage lifecycle and inhibit progeny production.</p><p>There are a number of technical questions that need to be clarified, after which the reviewers feel confident that the authors have shown that a genuine LIN state is induced in ICP1 infections and aborted by PLE.</p><p>Major concerns</p><p>1) The bioinformatic analyses could be improved with a more systematic investigation of the TeaA and ArrA homologues. For example, the BLASTp hits for TeaA and ArrA are noted to be present &quot;throughout marine phage and bacterial genomes&quot;. However, the figures appear to show that they are only found in Vibrio spp. The statement made in the paper makes it sound as though they are not restricted to Vibrio, and it should be made clear with respect to where these homologues are found. Also, an indication of how many homologues were found for each of the proteins and a table listing the hits (if this is a manageable number) with the associated ArrA homologues would be useful. It seems that not all <italic>teaA</italic> genes are associated with <italic>arrA</italic> genes. In cases where no ArrA homologue is identified, is there some other transmembrane-containing protein encoded next to <italic>teaA</italic> where <italic>arrA</italic> is expected to be?</p><p>– &quot;the presence of ArrA homologues without TeaA homologues&quot; – where is this data presented?</p><p>2) There are some confusing issues that should be resolved in the CRISPR-targeting experiments presented in the last section of the Results. In the absence of a spacer, there is approximately 10-fold difference in pfu/mL produced by LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> – and + samples. This is approximately the same difference that is noted between the LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> – and + samples in each of the three CRISPR targeting samples (Figure 6D). It's not clear to me how the conclusion that fewer phage progeny from LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> <italic>V. cholerae</italic> were able to overcome targeting than progeny from strains without LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> (subsection “LidI lowers phage yield”). It seems that the difference between phages produced in +/- LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> strains remains constant in the absence of CRISPR targeting or in the presence of the three spacers. Why is the targeting so poor for the spacers, particularly in the case of spacer A, which shows less than 10-fold decrease in phage plaquing? How were the three spacers chosen? Do the authors always find such poor targeting with CRISPR spacers and ICP1? I also had difficulty following the line of reasoning presented at the very end of the Results, centered on the reconstitution of the CRISPR system and the impact on evolution in infected cells.</p><p>3) There is some concern about the importance of both Figures 5 and 6. The authors have no real evidence that LidI is the LIN collapsing protein. It is an integral membrane protein with 2 TMDs and its overexpression will likely cause depolarization of the membrane and that would collapse LIN, just like DNP. Unfortunately, the lidI knockout has no phenotype. Regarding Figure 5, if one starts with low MOI, it takes longer to see LIN just because most cells are not infected.

Figure 3E shows the presence of ArrA homologs without TeaA homologs (squares without yellow dot). We have expanded the bioinformatics analyses on these homologs in the revised manuscript (available in Supplementary files 2 and 3). These newly added supplementary files include the GenBank Description and number of predicted transmembrane domains for each homolog as well as for the adjacent genes as per reviewer request.</p><p>We note that the homologs for TeaA are found throughout marine phage and bacterial genomes as shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. This figure shows that TeaA homologs are found in phages that infect Vibrionaceae (indicated by filled colored boxes) as well as in a number of bacteria (Pseudoalteromonas being the most common; signified by black box outlines) and multi-species metagenomic samples (signified in grey box outlines). We have clarified the statement to specify this is true for TeaA (and not for TeaA <italic>and</italic> ArrA as originally written). ArrA homologs are indeed limited to phages, specifically phages that infect the Vibrionaceae family (limited to members of the Vibrio and Entrovibrio genera) as we note in the text:</p><p>“ArrA yielded fewer homologs than TeaA (Supplementary file 3), however, using less stringent search parameters, we found that some organisms containing TeaA homologs also contain ArrA homologs though these were limited to vibriophages (Figure 3E and Supplementary file 2 and 3)”.</p><p>We do not expect all TeaA homologs to be associated with ArrA homologs because holins are fully functional without antiholins present. We think what is more interesting is that we find antiholins (i.e. ArrA homologs) in organisms without a holin (TeaA) homolog because antiholins function to regulate holins. As such, we displayed this information as yellow circles on both trees and clarified this in the text:</p><p>“This suggests that there are potential homologous lysis inhibition systems – complete with both holin and antiholin – present in phages other than ICP1. In contrast, the presence of ArrA homologs without TeaA homologs raises the question: what are antiholins doing on their own? Perhaps they have evolved functionality with holins divergent enough to no longer be considered homologous to TeaA under our search parameters, or they have been coopted for divergent functions much like holins (Mehner-Breitfeld et al., 2018; Saier and Reddy, 2015).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are some confusing issues that should be resolved in the CRISPR-targeting experiments presented in the last section of the Results. In the absence of a spacer, there is approximately 10-fold difference in pfu/mL produced by LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> – and + samples. This is approximately the same difference that is noted between the LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> – and + samples in each of the three CRISPR targeting samples (Figure 6D). It's not clear to me how the conclusion that fewer phage progeny from LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup><italic>V. cholerae</italic> were able to overcome targeting than progeny from strains without LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> (subsection “LidI lowers phage yield”).</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewers are correct that LidI decreases the PFU/mL produced and this finding is the major result of figure panels 6A and B and Figure 6—figure supplement 1D. These panels demonstrate that LidI expression decreases the yield of phage from infected cultures. This is confirmed again in the samples with and without spacers targeting the phage in Figure 6D.</p><p>This effect is further quantified in Figure 6—figure supplement 4A where the efficiency of plaquing of LidI + strains in respect to LidI – strains is ~0.1 for all spacers and the control meaning that, though the absolute number of phages has been impacted, the frequency of escapes has not.</p><p>While the proportion of progeny phage that can overcome the spacer remains the same (Figure 6—figure supplement 4A), the total number of phage that can overcome a spacer from a LidI + infection is less than the total number of phage that can overcome a spacer from a LidI– infection (Figure 6D). For example, an average of ~6.13x10<sup>7</sup> more phages per mL can plaque on spacer A from a LidI– infection in comparison to a LidI+ infection.</p><p>We have worked to make this clear in the text:</p><p>“For each spacer, fewer phage progeny from lidI<sup>PLE 1</sup><italic>V. cholerae</italic> were able to overcome targeting than progeny from infections of strains without lidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> (Figure 6D). This defect is due to the LidI-mediated decrease in the population of phages as the frequency of phage escaping stays the same (e.g. ~2 out of every thousand phages can overcome spacer C, Figure 6D). Consequently, because less phage are produced from lidI<sup>PLE 1</sup>-expressing <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, an order of magnitude fewer phages can overcome the spacer in the population (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems that the difference between phages produced in +/- LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> strains remains constant in the absence of CRISPR targeting or in the presence of the three spacers.</p></disp-quote><p>This is exactly the case and is shown conclusively Figure 6—figure supplement 4A. Our interpretation of these data is in agreement with these comments and we have expanded the text as stated above that indeed the frequency of escapes remains the same +/-LidI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why is the targeting so poor for the spacers, particularly in the case of spacer A, which shows less than 10-fold decrease in phage plaquing? How were the three spacers chosen? Do the authors always find such poor targeting with CRISPR spacers and ICP1?</p></disp-quote><p>Spacer A shows ~10-fold drop in phage while spacers B and C show ~1000-fold drop. These decreases are within the range of previously published values and are linked to the frequency of escapes (Box et al., 2016). The additive effect that LidI has on the total number of phage that can overcome targeting is consistent across spacers. We chose these spacers from the lab’s collection and could add more if reviewers think it would be helpful hoewever we do not expect the results to change – spacers will work to varying degrees while LidI expression will decrease the population of phages that overcome the spacer by ~10-fold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also had difficulty following the line of reasoning presented at the very end of the Results, centered on the reconstitution of the CRISPR system and the impact on evolution in infected cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided additional supplementary schematics to clarify the experimental set up and better contextualize these experiments for the reviewers. For Figures 6C and D and further explained in Figure 6—figure supplement 2, the CRISPR system discussed is encoded by <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> and targets the phage (“we exposed PLE (-) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> with and without lidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> to ICP1 (MOI=0.1), collected the population of progeny phage, and looked for plaque formation on PLE (- <italic>V. cholerae</italic> encoding a Type I-E CRISPR-Cas system (Box et al., 2016); an expanded schematic of this experiment is available in Figure 6—figure supplement 2.”).</p><p>In contrast, for Figures 6E and F inactive CRISPR systems are encoded by two phage strains and target the PLE within the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> chromosome (“To test the impact of LidI<sup>PLE</sup> 1 on this aspect of evolvability, we took advantage of the Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system found in ICP1 by engineering two ICP1 variants with nonfunctional CRISPR-Cas systems: one devoid of spacers against PLE with an inactive Cas1 preventing spacer acquisition (CRISPR*-Cas ICP1) (McKitterick et al., 2019) and the other lacking Cas2-3 (CRISPR-Cas* ICP1).”). These phage with inactivate CRISPR systems can only plaque on PLE+ strains if homologous recombination occurred reconstituting an active CRISPR system in the phage (“progeny phage were tested for their ability to plaque on PLE 1 <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, which is only possible if homologous recombination between the two variants restored a functional CRISPR-Cas system able to target PLE 1”).</p><p>These assays probe the evolution of the phage by measuring how many successful recombinants are formed in the presence and absence of LidI as shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 3. The key finding is that by limiting the population size as a whole, the number of phage that can evolve to overcome some selection pressure (either by mutations to escape CRISPR targeting or homologous recombination to restore a functional CRISPR-Cas system) is also limited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is some concern about the importance of both Figures 5 and 6. The authors have no real evidence that LidI is the LIN collapsing protein. It is an integral membrane protein with 2 TMDs and its overexpression will likely cause depolarization of the membrane and that would collapse LIN, just like DNP. Unfortunately, the lidI knockout has no phenotype. Regarding Figure 5, if one starts with low MOI, it takes longer to see LIN just because most cells are not infected. Recommend deleting these figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 6 shows the decreased yield that results from LidI expression and the consequent collapse of lysis inhibition. This is an important finding in line with literature about T4 lysis inhibition and we observe the decreased phage production consistently across all tested conditions:</p><p>yield after phage infection in with LidI from both PLE 1 and PLE 4 induced at various times in respect to infection at high MOI (MOI=5) in Figure 6A and B</p><p>phage capable of overcoming <italic>V. cholerae</italic> encoded-CRISPR targeting after low MOI infection conditions (MOI=0.1) in Figure 6D</p><p>phage capable of recombining to reconstitute a functional phage encoded-CRISPR-system after low MOI infection conditions (MOI=0.01)) in Figure 6F</p><p>and we have now included three very low MOI infections of LidI expressing strains in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 (MOI=0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001) at the reviewer’s request</p><p>This finding was identified by the reviewers as important in the summary statement where, “LidI is the first PLE-encoded ORF shown to negatively impact ICP1 phage yield” and in the minor concern number 5 where a reviewer stated, “the authors designed a nice experiment to measure phage yield presented in Figure 6A where a specific high MOI was used. The two log decrease in yield is impressive under these conditions.” We believe this series of experiments marks the finding as consistent, reproducible, and significant, as such we do not agree to the recommendation to delete these figures.</p><p>In Figure 5, we do not claim that LidI is the protein that collapses lysis inhibition but instead that it is a protein sufficient to collapse lysis inhibition, which the data shows conclusively in Figures 4A, 5A, and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-C. We further show that the PLE 4 LidI homolog is also sufficient to disrupt lysis inhibition in Figure 4E. We are careful to state that lysis inhibition collapse still happens in the absence of LidI (Figure 4A and E; subsection “PLE accelerates ICP1-mediated lysis”).</p><p>At this time, we can propose many molecular mechanisms for LidI activity: it likely could depolarize the membrane directly upon expression, which we show occurs after phage infection (Figure 4C) as the reviewer suggests, alternatively it could stabilize holin pore formation, destabilize the antiholin, inhibit holin-antiholin binding, or work through some other unforeseen mechanism. At this time we cannot distinguish between these hypotheses beyond stating that LidI expression alone does not depolarize membrane in the absence of phage infection (Figure 4C; subsection “PLE accelerates ICP1-mediated lysis”) yet still is sufficient to collapse lysis inhibition under the same induction conditions (Figure 4A and E).</p><p>Additionally, the reviewers communicated the following via email: The authors still leave the impression that LidI is the protein that collapses LIN. &quot;LidI is the first PLE-encoded ORF shown to negatively impact ICP1 phage yield&quot;. This sounds like LidI actually does this but there is no evidence to this effect. Indeed, by earlier standards of phage genetics, we would conclude that it does not have this function, since there is no phenotype. The language still needs to be softened to avoid this false impression.</p><p>As stated above, we are careful not to say that LidI is the protein that collapses lysis inhibition in the context of PLE in the revised manuscript, but that it is sufficient to collapse lysis inhibition outside of the context of PLE. We conclusively show that LidI is the first PLE-encoded ORF demonstrated to negatively impact ICP1 phage yield (by orders of magnitude) in Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1D. It is true that LidI could function differently in the context PLE, however, even if the function of LidI is a “fluke” in that LidI normally completes a different function in the cell, this “fluke” conveniently phenocopies the accelerated lysis we see in PLE+ cells. Although redundancy is perhaps not expected for mobile genetic elements with restricted genome size (like PLE), the most parsimonious explanation is that accelerated lysis is mediated by product(s) with redundant function, LidI being one of them (now stated in subsection “PLE accelerates ICP1-mediated lysis”). The earlier standards noted by the reviewer apparently do not allow for redundancy, nonetheless our investigation of this system is consistent with such redundancy and we believe this is even more of an interesting biological system because of it. The data demonstrating this redundancy has been added and can be found in Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</p><p>We have clarified language throughout the manuscript to impress upon the reader that the LidI characterization we have done is outside the context of PLE.</p><p>“Through lysis inhibition disruption a conserved PLE protein, LidI, can limit the phage produced from an infection, bottlenecking ICP1.”</p><p>“Subsequently, we discovered a single PLE-encoded gene we call lidI for lysis inhibition disruption that is sufficient to collapse ICP1- mediated lysis inhibition.”</p><p>“After confirming lidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> expression during ICP1 infection, we next sought to characterize LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> function in PLE (-) <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. During infection with ICP1, LidI<sup>PLE1</sup> was sufficient to recapitulate the PLE-mediated accelerated lysis phenotype.”</p><p>“Having demonstrated that LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> recapitulates PLE-mediated accelerated lysis, we wanted to determine if it was also necessary for this phenotype. Interestingly, however, when we deleted lidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> from PLE 1 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> the lysis kinetics were unchanged (Figure 4A).”</p><p>“LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> can function through lysis inhibition disruption.”</p><p>“As LidI<sup>PLE1</sup> is sufficient to accelerate lysis but does not phenocopy what we expect of a holin, we wanted to determine the mechanism of LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup>-mediated accelerated lysis in the absence of PLE.”</p><p>“Congruent with LidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> disrupting lysis inhibition, lidI<sup>PLE 1</sup> expression in PLE (-) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> does not change the efficiency of plaquing (EOP) by ICP1, an experiment that probes the number of successful initial infections at a low multiplicity of infection (Figure 5B). Consistent with this, the phenotypic change in plaque morphology expected of disrupted lysis inhibition is the loss of fuzzy plaque edges, which we see in PLE (-) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> expressing lidI<sup>PLE 1</sup><italic>in trans</italic> (Figure 5C). It is important to note that these data showing that LidI disrupts lysis inhibition when expressed alone do not reveal the molecular mechanism underlying this activity or ensure that the gene serves the same function in the context of PLE, even though it successfully phenocopies PLE-induced accelerated lysis.”</p><p>“These data reveal LidI as the first PLE-encoded ORF that can singlehandedly negatively impact ICP1 phage yield.”</p><p>“Hence, we hypothesize that PLE-mediated accelerated lysis decreases the ability of ICP1 to evolve in the face of PLE. However, because our data support a model in which accelerated lysis is redundantly encoded, it is not currently possible to test the impact of delayed lysis on ICP1 evolution in the context of the PLE. We can, however, interrogate how the lidI-mediated collapse of lysis inhibition and concomitant decrease in phage production in PLE (-) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> constrains ICP1 evolution.”</p><p>“A single open reading frame, lidI, which is conserved through all five PLEs spanning the last 70 years, is sufficient to disrupt lysis inhibition and limit progeny phage populations when expressed outside its native context in PLE (-) <italic>V. cholerae</italic>.”</p><p>“These two opposing forces, ICP1 lysis inhibition and accelerated lysis by PLE through lysis inhibition disruption (which our data shows LidI is capable of doing in isolation and yet other undiscovered PLE-encoded mechanisms redundantly accomplish), act in the midst of the ongoing evolutionary arms race between <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and its parasites.”</p><p>Surprisingly, this is so important that the means to disrupt lysis inhibition and execute lysis for PLE’s own selfish benefit are apparently redundantly encoded within the PLE – LidI can collapse lysis inhibition in the absence of PLE, though DlidI PLE still shows accelerated lysis.</p><p>We also further state that PLE may encode redundant ways to accelerate lysis subsection “PLE accelerates ICP1-mediated lysis”: “This accelerated timescale could result from any combination of processes such as PLE deploying its own lysis machinery, PLE modulating the expression or stability of ICP1’s lysis machinery, or PLE inhibiting or collapsing lysis inhibition.” and show that inhibition of plaque formation and accelerated lysis phenotypes are robust to knocking out each individual ORF in Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</p><p>In respect to the importance of Figure 5, Figure 4 shows the reader that LidI is a conserved protein sufficient to cause accelerated cell lysis, that LidI is expressed during infection, and is not functioning as a holin in the absence of phage infection. The question that logically follows is how can LidI achieve acceleration of lysis? We do not specify molecular mechanism for the reasons explained above and instead check the obvious characteristics of lysis inhibition probing MOI (during low MOI infections the LIN state will be achieved later in time as described by the reviewer and in the final paragraph of subsection “PLE accelerates ICP1-mediated lysis”), checking the plaque edge phenotype, and efficiency of plaquing. The resulting data are consistent with disruption of lysis inhibition so much so that the reviewer raising this concern has already hypothesized the mechanism by which lysis inhibition is collapsed: depolarization of the membrane.</p></body></sub-article></article>
