lining the interior of blood vessels. Expansion of vascular networks arises through sprouting angiogenesis, a process involving extensive cell rearrangements and collective cell migration. Yet, the mechanisms controlling angiogenic collective behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we show this collective cell behavior is regulated by non-canonical Wnt signaling. We identify that Wnt5a specifically activates Cdc42 at cell junctions downstream of ROR2 to reinforce coupling between adherens junctions and the actin cytoskeleton. We show that Wnt5a signaling stabilizes vinculin binding to alpha-catenin, and abrogation of vinculin in vivo and in vitro leads to uncoordinated polarity and deficient sprouting angiogenesis in <italic>Mus musculus</italic>. Our findings highlight how non-canonical Wnt signaling coordinates collective cell behavior during vascular morphogenesis by fine-tuning junctional mechanocoupling between endothelial cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45853.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a new blood vessel is created, a leader cell branches out from the lining of an existing vessel before being joined by other cells moving together in the same direction. A protein called Wnt5a regulates this process by helping the cells to orient themselves and finely coordinating their migration, but the exact details of this mechanism are still unclear.</p><p>One way that cells can communicate is by touching and physically exerting forces on each other. This is made possible by structures called cellular junctions, which are present at the interface between cells. These can transmit forces within a tissue because they are connected with elements that form the cells’ internal skeletons. A protein known as vinculin is involved in these connections.</p><p>To find out what role Wnt5a plays in cell migration, Carvalho et al. prevented blood vessel cells from creating the protein. The results showed that Wnt5a helps cells to move together by stabilizing vinculin at cell junctions. This strengthens the physical communication between cells and allows them to efficiently coordinate their movements. Indeed, in the mouse retina, deleting vinculin from cells that make blood cells impaired the formation of new blood vessels.</p><p>Problems in the way that blood vessels grow are very common in the human population. In addition, Wnt5a is linked to cancer progression, which also relies on coordinated movement of cells. A better grasp of the role of this protein could therefore be relevant to understand how blood vessels are formed, but also how certain cancers invade surrounding tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>collective cell migration</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>adherens junctions</kwd><kwd>vinculin</kwd><kwd>non-canonical Wnt signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>679368</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franco</surname><given-names>Claudio A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IF/00412/2012/CP0163/CT0007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franco</surname><given-names>Claudio A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001674</institution-id><institution>Fondation Leducq</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17CVD03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franco</surname><given-names>Claudio A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010684</institution-id><institution>H2020 Spreading Excellence and Widening Participation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>692322</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franco</surname><given-names>Claudio A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of axial polarity distributions shows that Wnt5a regulates collective cell migration in vivo by stabilizing vinculin at adherens junctions and fine-tuning mechanocoupling between neighbouring cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Morphogenesis is driven by coordinated and dynamic cell movements, which are regulated by a combination of chemical and physical cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaalouk and Lammerding, 2009</xref>). Morphogenic cues are sensed and read at the single cell-level, yet biomechanical information is relayed to and integrated by neighboring cells leading to tissue-level collective cell behaviors. These emergent collective behaviors arise by mechanically coupling cadherin-based adhesion and actomyosin-based contraction, allowing propagation of cell-cell interactions across large cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedl and Mayor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lecuit and Yap, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yap et al., 2018</xref>). One of such morphogenic processes is the formation of blood vessels. Vascular morphogenesis occurs mainly through sprouting angiogenesis, a process where endothelial tip cells lead the vascular sprout, migrate and invade into avascular tissues in response to pro-angiogenic molecules. Endothelial stalk cells follow tip cells contributing to sprout elongation and branch formation through proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Potente and Mäkinen, 2017</xref>). Although sprouting angiogenesis is considered a collective cell migration process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vitorino and Meyer, 2008</xref>), little is known about the mechanisms regulating this collective behavior. Recently, endothelial cell front-rear polarity has emerged as a crucial regulator of collective behavior in sprouting angiogenesis. In fact, endothelial cell (EC)-specific deletion of NCK1/2 and Cdc42 impairs cell polarity, which correlates with decreased sprouting efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubrac et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laviña et al., 2018</xref>). However, the mechanisms controlling and coordinating polarity patterns of endothelial cells during sprouting angiogenesis remain elusive.</p><p>Recent reports showed that non-canonical Wnt signaling, a known regulator of cell migration and cell polarity in key morphogenic events such as gastrulation, neural tube closure, fur orientation, and ureteric bud formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang and Mlodzik, 2015</xref>), also controls sprouting angiogenesis and vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Korn et al., 2014</xref>). Non-canonical Wnt signaling was shown to control vascular remodeling by blocking excessive vessel regression in a flow-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Korn et al., 2014</xref>). In this context, non-canonical Wnt signaling modulates the threshold for flow-dependent EC polarization, inducing premature vessel regression, and leading to a decrease in vessel density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franco et al., 2016</xref>). In parallel, abrogation of endothelial non-canonical Wnt ligands also leads to reduce sprouting efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Korn et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, it remains unresolved how mechanistically non-canonical Wnt signaling regulates sprouting angiogenesis.</p><p>Here, we have established a simple assay to measure endothelial collective cell behavior in vivo and in vitro using axial polarity histograms. Using this assay, we uncovered a novel Wnt5a pathway that stabilizes the binding of vinculin to ɑ-catenin at adherens junctions, and consequently the efficient coupling between adherens junctions and the actin cytoskeleton in endothelial cells. We showed that vinculin loss-of-function impairs collective polarity in vivo and in vitro, leading to deficient sprouting angiogenesis. Overall, we propose that non-canonical Wnt signaling coordinates collective cell behavior during vascular morphogenesis by fine-tuning junctional mechanocoupling between endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Non-canonical Wnt signaling is required for the coordination of collective cell polarity</title><p>Non-canonical Wnt signaling deficiency leads to impaired sprouting angiogenesis, a process that requires extensive cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Korn et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate the role of non-canonical Wnt ligands in endothelial cell migration, we used a well-characterized model of collective cell migration, the scratch-wound assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tambe et al., 2011</xref>). Wnt5a is the major non-canonical Wnt ligand operating in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Korn et al., 2014</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In the scratch-wound assay, siRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of Wnt5a, hereafter siWNT5a, significantly impaired wound closure and straightness of cell migration without affecting cell velocity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Accordingly, single cell tracking highlighted coordinated collective behavior in control siRNA (siControl) cells, whereas siWNT5a cells showed uncoordinated migration paths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Taking advantage of this feature, we generated a simplified method, compared to PIV analysis, to quantify the degree of coordination between cells by measuring the front-rear cell polarity (nucleus-to-Golgi apparatus axis) at the population level. The angular histogram of axial polarities relative to the wound-edge displays the distribution of cell polarities in the monolayer relative to the wound-edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As a measure of collective polarization, we defined a polarity index (PI, see Materials and methods), which ranges from 1 (strongly polarized) to 0 (random distribution) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The PI represents the length of the mean resultant vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berens, 2009</xref>). Using this approach, we measured PIs in consecutive 50 µm-wide areas from the leading edge towards the monolayer (details in Materials and methods). As expected, siCTNNA1 led to a generalized poor collective coordination of polarities demonstrated by low PIs throughout the monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). According to the PI equation, perfect randomization should give a PI = 0. However, ɑ-catenin KD cells shows PI &gt;0, which highlights a polarity bias caused by geometrical constraints that are generated by the free space-cell monolayer interface. Therefore, we used the polarity patterns of siCTNNA1 cells to define the threshold of PI that defines uncoordinated behavior. We established this PI threshold by determining the mean ± SD of the results obtained from the siCTNNA1 experiments across the monolayer. For the calculation of the mean value, we excluded the first row of cells, as these were strongly affected by wound-monolayer asymmetry, leading to a stronger polarity towards the wound. Taking these rules, we defined the PI threshold for uncoordinated migration at PI = 0.14 (corresponding to the upper limit of the mean ± SD, PI = 0.1 ± 0.04, in ɑ-catenin KD experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). SiControl cells showed coordination of cell polarities up to ~300 µm from the leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Remarkably, siWNT5a cells showed uncoordinated polarity starting at ~150 µm from the leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>In the wound assay, coordinated migration emerges because leader cells, localized at the edge of the monolayer, are polarized due to the presence of a free edge, and instruct follower cells’ directionality of migration through force transmission at adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedl and Mayor, 2017</xref>). To understand the extent to which the polarization patterns of leaders and followers were affected in their polarization patterns, we measured the PI for leaders (1<sup>st</sup> row of cells) and followers (2-5<sup>th</sup> row of cells) separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Cdc42 is a well-known regulator of cell polarity, playing important roles in yeast budding, epithelial polarity, migratory polarity and fate specification during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heasman and Ridley, 2008</xref>). In this context, Cdc42 frequently interacts with the PAR complex (PAR6–PAR3–aPKC) to mediate both front-rear polarity and apical-basal polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). In endothelial cells, Cdc42 was previously implicated in filopodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fantin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wakayama et al., 2015</xref>), adherence, junction stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broman et al., 2006</xref>), cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vitorino and Meyer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wakayama et al., 2015</xref>), and more recently on collective polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laviña et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, Cdc42 seems to be dispensable for apical-basal but essential for front-rear polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laviña et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, non-canonical Wnt pathway was shown to cooperate with Cdc42/PAR complex to regulate front-rear polarity in migrating fibroblasts at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schlessinger et al., 2007</xref>), evoking two parallel mechanisms regulating polarity of leader cells. This fits with our own results, as leader cells were mildly affected by Wnt5a KD. In endothelial cells, we show that Wnt5a regulates Cdc42 activity at cell-cell boundaries but not at the leading edge of leader cells. This signaling spatial regulation could explain why leader cells are less affected by deficient Wnt5a signaling. Indeed, Cdc42 inhibition or LOF in vitro or in vivo gives to a stronger polarity phenotype than non-canonical Wnt signaling LOF experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laviña et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that Cdc42 is regulated by multiple inputs to control cell polarity, and that Wnt5a signaling fine-tunes Cdc42 activity at cell-cell junctions.</p><p>Our data further shows that the role of non-canonical Wnt signaling on mechanocoupling relies on vinculin stabilization at adherens junctions. The biological function of vinculin at adherens junctions has been a theme of controversy. Despite being present at high-tension junctions in several model organisms, vinculin is dispensable for zebrafish and fruitfly normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alatortsev et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2017</xref>). However, its absence during mouse embryonic development results in lethal cardiovascular and neuronal defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 1998</xref>). To explain these differences, it has been proposed that mechanical and molecular properties of proteins from the adherens junctions might have diverged during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2017</xref>). For instance, zebrafish ɑ-catenin is monomeric and can form a complex with β-catenin and F-actin simultaneously, whilst the murine orthologue forms dimers and cannot bind simultaneously to F-actin and β-catenin in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, vinculin is required to promote efficient coupling between ɑ-catenin and F-actin in mouse. However, the factors that would regulate these interactions are so far elusive. Our results are compatible with the idea that a Wnt5a-ROR2-Cdc42 signaling axis could have evolved in mammals to enhance cadherin mechanoproperties through vinculin. Moreover, the ability to rescue the collective cell polarity defects on Wnt5a-deficient cells by re-expression of Vinc-T12 or ɑCat-Vinc fusion protein further suggests that Wnt5a modulates mechanocoupling efficiency by regulating vinculin’s actin-binding properties. How Wnt5a affects the dynamics or affinity of vinculin to actin filaments shall be investigated in future work.</p><p>In addition, our results strongly suggest that Wnt5a acts as a permissive rather than an instructive cue regarding cell polarity. The ability to rescue the collective polarity phenotype of siWNT5a cells by re-expression of either Vinc-T12 or ɑCat-Vinc fusion protein implies that the polarity cue organizing collective cell polarity does not depend on Wnt5a. In this context, Wnt5a seems to be mainly necessary to potentiate mechanocoupling between cells via vinculin activation, a condition sufficient to propagate the external polarity cue in the system. This is also concordant with our previous observations that overexpression of Wnt5a in endothelial cells in vivo led to normal vascular sprouting and remodeling phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franco et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, a similar debate regarding a permissive or instructive role involves non-canonical Wnt signaling in planar cell polarity (PCP) establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Humphries and Mlodzik, 2018</xref>), where conflicting evidences exists in favor of each role. Our results suggest that non-canonical Wnt signaling plays a role in force transmission within cell populations. As mechanical cues were shown to play a contributing role in PCP establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Humphries and Mlodzik, 2018</xref>), a mechanobiology perspective into the function of non-canonical Wnt signaling in PCP could in part conciliate the possibility that non-canonical Wnt signaling can be seen as instructive or permissive, depending on the experimental setting.</p><p>Non-canonical Wnt signaling was previously implicated in the regulation of vessel regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Korn et al., 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>Vinculin</italic> EC-KO shows a very similar phenotype, with an increase in vessel regression, and a decrease in vessel density and radial expansion. It was suggested that non-canonical Wnt signaling regulates vessel regression by controlling a mechanosensitive threshold, based on wall shear stress, that induces endothelial cell polarization and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franco et al., 2016</xref>). The mechanisms controlling this threshold are still unclear. Given the well-known mechanoresponsive properties of vinculin, it is tempting to speculate that vinculin could also play a relevant role in establishing this threshold. Further work is necessary to clarify this question. Nevertheless, it is relevant to note that Wnt5a and vinculin regulates a different mechanosensitive pathway in flow-independent conditions. This also raises the question of how shear stress and junctional mechanotransduction pathways are regulated and coordinated by non-canonical Wnt signaling in space and time within the vascular network.</p><p>Taken together, our results show that Wnt5a signaling fine-tunes junctional mechanocoupling between endothelial cells to promote collective cell behavior during vascular

Blocking/permeabilisation was performed using Claudio’s Blocking Buffer (CBB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franco et al., 2013</xref>), consisting of 1% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 3% BSA (Nzytech), 0.5% triton X100 (Sigma), 0.01% Na deoxycholate (Sigma), 0,02% Na Azide (Sigma) in PBS pH = 7.4 for 2 hr in a rocking platform. Primary antibodies (Anti-CD102 and Anti-Erg) were incubated at the desired concentration (see Key Resources Table) in 1:1 CBB:PBS at 4°C overnight in a rocking platform and afterwards washed 3 × 60 min in PBS-T. Then, retinas were incubated in 1:1 CBB:PBS solution containing the secondary fluorophore conjugated antibodies at 4°C overnight in the dark. Next, and due to the fact that we are using same species primary antibodies, retinas were incubated with AffiniPureF(ab’)<sub>2</sub> fragments Donkey anti-rabbit IgG (see Key Resources Table) for 2 hr at RT, followed by 3 washes of 30 min in PBS-T. Retinas were fixed with 4%PFA in PBS at RT and blocked using CBB and primary antibody (Anti-GOLPH4) was incubated (see Key Resources Table) in 1:1 CBB:PBS at 4°C overnight in a rocking platform. Secondary antibody was done as previously described. Retinas were mounted on slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs, H-1000, Burlingame, California, USA). For polarity quantification, a tile-scan spanning the sprouting front was acquired on a Zeiss Cell Observer Spinning Disk microscope, equipped with the Zen software with a Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.4 Oil DIC M27 objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Culture of HUVECs</title><p>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were routinely cultured following the manufacturer’s guidelines, in filter-cap T75 flasks Nunclon ∆ surface treatment (VWR international, LLC) and cultured at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to ensure a stable environment for optimal cell growth. HUVECs (C2519A, Lonza) were cultured with complete medium EGM-2 Bulletkit (CC-3162, Lonza) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (#15140122, Gibco). When passaging cells for experiments, cells were washed twice in sterile PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.47 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH7.4). Then, cells were incubated for 3–5 min in trypsin/EDTA (#15400054, Gibco) or in TrypLE Express (#12605–028, Gibco) at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. When 95% of the cells detached, complete medium was added to each flask to inhibit the activity of the trypsin/EDTA or TrypLE Express and the cell suspension was transferred to a falcon tube. To maximize the amount of cells collected, all flasks were washed again with complete medium, which was added to the cell suspension gathered previously. HUVECs were then centrifuged at 115 g for 5 min at room temperature. The pellet was re-suspended in fresh complete medium. The cell concentration present in the suspension was determined using a Neubauer Chamber Cell Counting (Hirschmann EM Techcolor).

The Golgi-nucleus assignment was done automatically minimizing the distance between all the possible couples. The polarity of each cell was defined as the angle between the vector and the scratch line. An angular histogram showing the angle distribution was then generated. Circular statistic was performed using the Circular Statistic Toolbox.</p><p>To test for circular uniformity, we applied the polarity index (PI), calculated as the length of mean resultant vector for a given angular distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">cos</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">sin</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:msqrt></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>PI corresponds to length of the mean resultant vector, previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berens (2009)</xref>. The PI varies between 0 and 1. The closer to one the more the data are concentrated around the mean direction, while values close to 0 corresponds to random distribution. PI indicates the collective orientation strength of the cell monolayer. Box plots were generated by using every single PI calculated for images of each biological replica, which show the biological variability of the system. This data is used to calculate the significance of differences between experimental conditions.</p><p>To obtain a global description of a given experimental condition, we pooled together all the different biological replicates in one single file and calculate a global PI and mean angle (angular histograms and values below in the main text). This representation provides information on the general distribution of polarities in all experiments, and provides a mean angle of polarity, which is important to understand directionality.</p><p>To calculate the PI as a function of distance, each image was divided starting from the wound edge in slices 50 μm apart. The cell polarity within each slice was extracted and represented as angular histogram and the corresponding PI was calculated. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,a</xref> global polarity index was calculated merging together the results from different images from the same experimental conditions. N = 9 for siControl, N = 10 for siWNT5a and N = 4 for siCtnna1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7 and Matlab (Mathworks). Statistical details of experiments are reported in the figures and figure legends. Sample size is reported in the figure legends and no statistical test was used to determine sample size. The biological replicate is defined as the number of cells, images, animals, as stated in the figure legends. No inclusion/exclusion or randomization criteria were used and all analyzed samples are included. Comparisons between two experimental groups were analyzed with unpaired parametric t test, while multiple comparisons between more than two experimental groups were assessed with one-way ANOVA. We considered a result significant when p&lt;0.05. Box plots for polarity indexes represent min to max, central line represents mean.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank M Schwartz (Yale University, New Haven) for plasmids; RS Ross (University of California, San Diego) for providing the Vinculin floxed mouse; M Takeichi (RIKEN, Kobe) for a18 antibody; AC Vion and H Gerhardt (Max-Delbruck Center, Berlin) for providing the basis of our Matlab script for automated polarity analysis; and M Nakayama (MPI Bad Nauheim), J Barata, D Henrique, and E Gomes (iMM, Lisbon) for discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The comments are relatively favorable and constructive. However, the authors are required to address the following.</p><p>1) Please carefully address the major comments 1 and 2 of reviewer 1 with additional experiments and/or alternative analyses. In particular, it seems necessary to validate the usefulness of polarity index (PI) <italic>in vivo</italic> in retinal angiogenesis, regarding whether or not the geometric effects of vascular pattern could be neglected. In addition, please clarify whether formula in Figure 1D (subsection “Non-canonical Wnt signaling is required for the coordination of collective cell polarity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>”, second paragraph) was developed by the authors or was modified from a previous study.</p><p>2) Please address the other points of reviewer 1 and 3 point-by-point in a data-driven manner or with further analyses.</p><p>I believe the authors are capable of addressing most of the comments, but please provide the reasons for not implementing the suggested changes where necessary.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this report, the authors propose a biomechanical mechanism regulated by non-canonical Wnt signaling in angiogenic collective movements of ECs. They first tried to develop a simple assay system, which enables evaluation of endothelial collective movement in <italic>in vitro</italic> wound healing and <italic>in vivo</italic> murine retinal angiogenesis. Using the key assay system, they identified that non-canonical Wnt signaling coordinates collective cell polarity by regulating mechanical tension via vinculin stability control at EC adherent junctions. They further showed that the junctional mechanocoupling is fine-tuned by non-canonical Wnt signaling through the ROR2-Cdc42 signaling axis. The findings are interesting and could provide novel and important mechanistic information in the field of angiogenic morphogenesis, and on the whole the experimental designs seem well organized. However, the following issues need to be addressed.</p><p>1) To more simply quantify the extent of coordination between cells at population levels compared to PIV analysis-based method, the authors generated a method using a polarity index (PI), which is developed from axial polarity index. The reviewer agrees that the index reflects well the extent of EC coordination in scratch wound assay <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, the index does not seem to reflect the coordination status correctly and sufficiently if they adopted the same algorithm for analysis in retinal angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> because of the following reason. In case of scratch wound assay, EC theoretically can move toward all directions without specific spatial limitations, although the moving direction tended to be biased toward wound area. In the case of retinal angiogenesis, moving direction is spatially limited or biased by the vascular structure and network pattern, in which ECs move. In other words, vascular geometry pattern can potently affect the PI. For example, increasing the number of vascular branches in parallel with spouting front edge in the analyzed area, PI is predicted to become smaller. Actually, PI value in murine retinal angiogenesis was smaller than in those in <italic>in vitro</italic> scratch wound assay as seen in Figure 1N. Because, in the logical flow of this manuscript, PI serves as a key assay parameter even <italic>in vivo</italic>, they need to more carefully evaluate the validity of PI also <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this sense, they may wish to consider that leading front edge is set in each branch to calculate PI instead of sprouting front edge as shown in Figure 1L.</p><p>2) In some cell biology experiments, explanation of experimental protocols and data presentation seem insufficient in the text including sections of Materials and methods, Results and figure legends, which sometimes caused the reviewer difficulties in understanding the data completely. Specifically, for rescue or overexpression experiments using Lenti virus vector in scratch wound assay (Figure 1H and J, Figure 7 and Figure 8), did the authors use only transduced cells after cell sorting or not? If not, what percentage of cells used were transduced in each experiment? Transduction efficiency can potentially affect the experimental result. If they assayed in mosaic condition mixed with no transduced cells, they may wish to compare the effect between transduced and non-transduced cells in same dish. Also, biochemical data showing the levels of exogenous proteins expressed using overexpression vector were omitted in all rescue experiments.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) The reviewer could not understand how &quot;the correlation length&quot; was calculated even though the reviewer referred to Ng et al., 2012 and Petitjean et al., 2010. More detailed information needs to be described anywhere in the text.</p><p>2) Do the authors have any explanations as to why the coordination of leader cells is significantly affected by Wnt5A KD?</p><p>3) Biochemical data and the quantification shown in Figure 4A and B are confusing to the reviewer. β-catenin levels seem higher in control group than in Wit5A KD group in the representative data of western blotting in Figure 4A, while the mean level is rather lower in the control in the quantification data of Figure 4B although there is no statistical significance. Which is correct? Also, vinculin levels are significantly higher in Wint5a KD group in Figure 4B, but they describe that there were not any differences there in the text (subsection “Non-canonical Wnt signaling regulates vinculin stability at adherens junctions to reinforce junctional mechanocoupling”).</p><p>4) Is the overall wound closure impaired in vinculin KD ECs concomitant with the decrease of PI?</p><p>5) The authors should change the description of Figure 8D to Figure 8E (subsection “Constitutively active vinculin is sufficient to rescue collective behavior defects in Wnt5a-deficient endothelial cells”).</p><p>6) Figure 9H needs to be quantified similarly.</p><p>7) There are no headings in each figure legend throughout the manuscript.</p><p>8) The authors need to state how they considered statistical significance in the text.</p><p>9) The authors need to change the description to the correct one in the figure legend for Figure 1C.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, Carvalho et al. investigate mechanisms regulating collective cell migration of endothelial cells during angiogenic sprouting. The authors report that the non-canonical Wnt ligand Wnt5a plays a crucial role in regulating the collective cell behavior of endothelial cells. Using various <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches, they find that Wnt5a, through its receptor ROR2, activates Cdc42 to support the coupling between adherens junctions and the actin cytoskeleton. This mechanism involves the stabilization of the vinculin-α-catenin interaction, which is important for force transmission between individual endothelial cells.</p><p>The mechanisms that control collective endothelial migration are poorly understood. Here Carvalho and colleagues use elegant methods to demonstrate that non-canonical Wnt signaling plays a vital role in regulating the collective behavior of endothelial cells during angiogenic sprouting.</p><p>Overall, the analyses are thorough and of good quality, and the results nicely presented. The findings are relevant to the field, and there will also be an interest in the described methods to study the collective behavior of endothelial cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Carvalho et al. report that non-canonical Wnt5a signaling reinforces coupling between VE-cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton in response to mechanical stimuli. They investigated this function in the context of the collective endothelial cell migration such as occurs during angiogenesis. The authors show that Wnt5a is cell autonomously required for endothelial cells to coordinate their collective migration both in an <italic>in vitro</italic> scratch wound assay and during angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Cells lacking Wnt5a did not form high-tension adherens junctions. VE-cadherin was under less tension based on a FRET tension-sensor, and endothelial cells formed weaker cell-cell interactions based on atomic force microscopy measurements. This compromised the ability of cells to coordinate their polarity and migration. Mechanistically, the authors report that the non-canonical receptor ROR2 is necessary for transducing the Wnt5a signal via CDC42 activation. The authors exclude other non-canonical receptors and other signaling pathways downstream of ROR2. CDC42 promotes co-localisation of vinculin with VE-cadherin, connecting it to the actin cytoskeleton.</p><p>The same group have previously reported that non-canonical Wnt signaling regulates the sensitivity of ECs to blood flow by regulating polarity. In this report, they show that non-canonical Wnt regulates EC polarity in response to junctional pulling, providing new insight into how non-canonical Wnt can regulate mechanosensing by endothelial cells during angiogenesis.</p><p>Overall the manuscript is well written, the data are comprehensive and generally support the conclusions. There are a few points that would strengthen it further.</p><p>1) The claim for reduced association between actin stress fibers and VE-cadherin is not clear from the data shown (Figure 2B and Figure 9H). Some form of quantification is required to support this.</p><p>2) Vinculin is shown to co-localize with VE-cadherin at junctions by immunofluorescence imaging (Figure 4C) yet by PLA, sites of co-localisation appears to be scattered across the cell at random and not enriched at junctions. What are the implications of this distribution pattern for how vinculin and VE-cadherin regulate junction tension?</p><p>3) Was the co-immunoprecipitation in Figure 4G performed on cells that had been wounded? If not, what is the source of tension that promoted VE-cad and vinculin co-association and would this be stronger in wounded monolayers?</p><p>4) Retina vessels in vinculin ECKO mice (Figure 6C and D) show some phenotypic overlap with Wnt5a/Wnt11 mutants. This includes reduced vessel density which in Wnt5a/Wnt11 mice is due to increased vessel regression. Do the Vincluin ECKO mice have increased vessel regression? The authors should quantify this and discuss the results in the context of the junction mechanocoupling mechanism they describe.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45853.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) To more simply quantify the extent of coordination between cells at population levels compared to PIV analysis-based method, the authors generated a method using a polarity index (PI), which is developed from axial polarity index.

In this sense, they may wish to consider that leading front edge is set in each branch to calculate PI instead of sprouting front edge as shown in Figure 1L.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this very relevant and insightful comment. Indeed, as the reviewer points out, PIs for analyses <italic>in vivo</italic> are generally smaller than PI values from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. These differences can be derived from the complexity of the <italic>in vivo</italic> microenvironment when compare to the relatively simple organisation of the <italic>in vitro</italic> wounded monolayers. Thus, we agree with the reviewer that geometry of vessel segments are imposing constraints into the freedom of endothelial cells to migrate/polarise in any direction. Therefore, those constraints can restrict the amplitude of PI.</p><p>We performed analysis of branch orientation in three different experimental conditions from an ongoing work: intraocular injections of PBS, VEGF and sFLT1. Retinas were treated for 36h. Three retinas per condition were analysed. Although the phenotype is different between the three conditions, the branch directionality is preserved in the sprouting front (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on distribution of the angles formed by the branches with the sprouting front edge showed confirmed that the underlying distribution was the same in the three different conditions.</p><p>Inversely, PI values were significantly different between the three conditions. In the case of sFlt1, the cells preferentially oriented toward the optic nerve, thus we attributed to these retinas a negative value of the PI, as cells are not orientated by VEGF gradients but rather by blood flow.</p><p>Based on these results, we believe it is not necessary to re-calculate the PI relative to the edge of each branch, which will not only be computationally expensive, but will also pose a limitation as around 50% of the cells are estimated to be located at branching points, and thus we would have to exclude them from the analysis.</p><p>Importantly, we showed that this pattern of polarity was very sensitive to manipulation in VEGF concentrations in the system. These observations strengthen the validity of the method and strongly supports its usefulness to measure endothelial collective behaviour <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45853.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Data supporting response to reviewers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of polarity index and branch orientation in intraocular injections of PBS, VEGF, sFLT1 retinas. Left: examples of the sprouting front vascular network of designated treatments. Right: Box plots for Polarity Indexes, Branch Angle, and distribution of Mean Branch Angle and Mean Polarity Index for each retina. The analysis of branch direction was performed using Fiji. Briefly, the sprouting front of each retina was skeletonize and short branches were pruned. Subsequently, we used the directionality plugin to infer branch directionality. PI analysis and statistical analysis was performed in Matlab. n = 3 independent retinas. (<bold>B</bold>) Left: Example of area of analysis in a P6 mouse retina. Rectangles represent bins of 100µm wide used to calculate Polarity Index of endothelial cells towards the sprouting front (green &gt; 0-100µm; blue &gt; 300-400µm; yellow &gt; 900-1000µm). Right: Distribution of Polarity Indexes along the Sprouting Front to Optic Nerve axis of the mouse retina, for retinas injected either with PBS (blue line), VEGFA (green line), sFLT1 (VEGFA inhibitor, red line), treated for 36h. Standard deviation is shown as lighter color. Note that close to the Sprouting Front, endothelial cells show a positive Polarity Index, meaning pointing towards the Sprouting Front, but closer to the Optic Nerve, endothelial cells show a negative value of Polarity Index, representing a polarity away from the Sprouting Front (towards the Optic Nerve). VEGFA treatment delays the transition from positive to negative values. sFLT1 reverts polarity of endothelial cells even at the Sprouting front, and in this condition, endothelial cells mainly polarize towards the Optic Nerve. This analysis was possible because of an adaptation of the Polarity Index formula, imposing a positive value to the Polarity Index if mean value of the resultant vector is between 0-179 degrees, and a negative value if mean value of the resultant vector is between 180-359 degrees.

Specifically, for rescue or overexpression experiments using Lenti virus vector in scratch wound assay (Figure 1H and J, Figure 7 and Figure 8), did the authors use only transduced cells after cell sorting or not? If not, what percentage of cells used were transduced in each experiment? Transduction efficiency can potentially affect the experimental result. If they assayed in mosaic condition mixed with no transduced cells, they may wish to compare the effect between transduced and non-transduced cells in same dish.</p></disp-quote><p>We realised from this comment that our experimental design was not sufficiently clear in the Materials and methods section. We have updated the description with the hope that it will be clearer for readers.</p><p>In summary, we did not positively select for transduced cells during the direction of the experiment. Our analysis was performed using mixed populations. We have optimised viral protocols to achieve high transduction. In general, we have transduction efficiencies ranging from 35-75%. An extra step of enrichment was performed during imaging. Only regions with high-density of transduced cells was selected for analysis. We have nevertheless re-analysed the transduced vs. non-transduced cells. In this analysis, we obtained very similar values for PI for both transduced and non-transduced cells. We provide results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>. We interpret this as a collective behaviour effect and likely means that tissue-level stresses are increased overall in the monolayer in rescue conditions, which are sufficient to sensitise and coordinate non-transduced Wnt5a KD cells. Yet, as this is very speculative we opted to not include this analysis in the manuscript, but to explain in more detail the way the experiment was performed in Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, biochemical data showing the levels of exogenous proteins expressed using overexpression vector were omitted in all rescue experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer suggestion, we have now included WB data showing the efficiency and specificity in experiments in Figure 7—figure supplement 2 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) The reviewer could not understand how &quot;the correlation length&quot; was calculated even though the reviewer referred to Ng et al., 2012 and Petitjean et al., 2010. More detailed information needs to be described anywhere in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We added this information in Materials and methods, on a sub-section “Particle image velocimetry (PIV) analysis”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Do the authors have any explanations as to why the coordination of leader cells is significantly affected by Wnt5A KD?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. It is not an easy question to answer, as collective motility is influenced by several interdependent parameters. To clarify this question, we would like to refer the reviewer to Vitorino et al., 2008. In this elegant paper, the authors described in detail that endothelial collective cell migration depends on 3 semi-independent parameters, namely cell motility, directed behaviour, and coordination.</p><p>Endothelial cells are epithelial in nature, and have strong adhesive proprieties. For this reason, endothelial cells rarely detach from each other. Thus, leader cells remain attached to follower cells, and leaders are also influenced by the behaviour of followers. Moreover, we need to emphasise that, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, endothelial leader cell is not a definitive position, but rather a dynamic state, in which leader cells can be replaced by follower cells, and vice-versa.</p><p>Based on Vitorino et al., along with many other reports in the field, we can postulate that the main reason for the impaired polarity of siWNT5a leader cells compared to siControl cells is due to a decrease in coordination of cell movements between leader and follower cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Biochemical data and the quantification shown in Figure 4A and B are confusing to the reviewer. β-catenin levels seem higher in control group than in Wit5A KD group in the representative data of western blotting in Figure 4A, while the mean level rather lower in the control in the quantification data of Figure 4B although there is no statistical significance. Which is correct? Also, vinculin levels are significantly higher in Wint5a KD group in Figure 4B, but they describe that there were not any differences there in the text (subsection “Non-canonical Wnt signaling regulates vinculin stability at adherens junctions to reinforce junctional mechanocoupling”).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thorough checking of the data. This pointed to a specific issue in the figure that is now corrected. The mistake was an interchange of labels of the bar plots from older version of the manuscript. Specifically, the former order from left to right was VE-cadherin, vinculin, a-catenin, b-catenin. Whilst the correct order was VE-cadherin, α-catenin, β-catenin, vinculin, which we have now corrected. We apologise for the oversight, and thank again the reviewer for this important correction.</p><p>Yet, this does not fully address the concerns raised by the reviewer.</p><p>a) Question1: β-catenin levels in blot and graph seem not to correspond. The WB blot image that we showed comes from one experiment of the 4 replicas. We showed the WB for all adherens junction proteins coming from the same protein extract, which might not reflect all the replicas. The experiment was repeated 4 times (during revision, we have performed one additional experiment to re-confirm everything). The result remains constant, with no statistical differences in β-catenin levels between siControl and siWnt5a cells. To clarify, we have now replaced the original WB data with blots from another biological replicate.</p><p>b) Question2: Regarding vinculin levels, they are not significantly upregulated. As mentioned before, the mistake came from an interchange of labels of the bar plots from older version of the manuscript. We have now corrected and added extra-quantifications. The data shows that there are no significant changes in vinculin protein levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Is the overall wound closure impaired in vinculin KD ECs concomitant with the decrease of PI?</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified wound closure in vinculin KD cells, which shows a significant impairment. We have added the quantification data to Figure 6C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should change the description of Figure 8D to Figure 8E (subsection “Constitutively active vinculin is sufficient to rescue collective behavior defects in Wnt5a-deficient endothelial cells”).</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected the mistake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 9H needs to be quantified similarly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified and present the results in Figure 9I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There are no headings in each figure legend throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the headings to figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors need to state how they considered statistical significance in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We are unsure about the exact meaning of the request. Nevertheless, believe that this might be related to define which condition is considered as statistically significant. We have added a sentence in the Materials and methods section stating that we consider significant a p value below 0.05.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors need to change the description to the correct one in the figure legend for Figure 1C.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Overall the manuscript is well written, the data are comprehensive and generally support the conclusions. There are a few points that would strengthen it further.</p><p>1) The claim for reduced association between actin stress fibers and VE-cadherin is not clear from the data shown (Figure 2B and Figure 9H). Some form of quantification is required to support this.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified the number of actin stress fibers associated to adherens junctions in siControl, siWnt5a and siCdc42, which shows a significant decrease (Figure 2D, and Figure 9J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Vinculin is shown to co-localize with VE-cadherin at junctions by immunofluorescence imaging (Figure 4C) yet by PLA, sites of co-localisation appears to be scattered across the cell at random and not enriched at junctions. What are the implications of this distribution pattern for how vinculin and VE-cadherin regulate junction tension?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our PLA experiments shows signals that are not only localized at junctions. However, this signal seems to be specific as no signal can be detected in control experiments (incubation with only one of the primary or no antibody). This is indeed a puzzling result. We can speculate about its meaning, yet we cannot provide a conclusive proof. These extra-junctional PLA signals can be derived from either pools of cadherin-catenin-vinculin complexes being recycled from junctions, establishment of ectopic cadherin-catenin-vinculin complexes at the cell membrane but not at junctions, or as suggested previously early cadherin-catenin complex assembly in the Golgi.</p><p>http://jcb.rupress.org/content/144/4/687</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2742162/</p><p>Nevertheless, as we were not completely sure about the source of those extra-junctional complexes, we only quantified junctional puncta, as described in the Materials and methods.
