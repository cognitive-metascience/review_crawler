Here we show that CD40, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, is a major regulator of dendrite growth and elaboration in the developing brain. The dendrites of hippocampal excitatory neurons were markedly stunted in <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, whereas those of striatal inhibitory neurons were much more exuberant. These striking and opposite phenotypic changes were also observed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons cultured from <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and were rescued by soluble CD40. The changes in excitatory and inhibitory neurons cultured from <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were mimicked in neurons of <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice by treatment with soluble CD40L and were dependent on PKC-b and PKC-g, respectively. These results suggest that CD40-activated CD40L reverse signalling has striking and opposite effects on the growth and elaboration of dendrites among major classes of brain neurons by PKC-dependent mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>103852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Alun M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: Mouse breeding and housing was approved by the Cardiff University Ethical Review Board and was performed within the remit of Home Office Licence PPL303081.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><supplementary-material><ext-link xlink:href="elife-30442-supp-v1.zip">Download zip</ext-link><p>Any figures and tables for this article are included in the PDF.
