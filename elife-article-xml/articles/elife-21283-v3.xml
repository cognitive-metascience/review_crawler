Experimentation in 3-D presents challenges, especially with virulent pathogens. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) kills more humans than any other infection and is characterised by a spatially organised immune response and extracellular matrix remodelling. We developed a 3-D system incorporating virulent mycobacteria, primary human blood mononuclear cells and collagen–alginate matrix to dissect the host-pathogen interaction. Infection in 3-D led to greater cellular survival and permitted longitudinal analysis over 21 days. Key features of human tuberculosis develop, and extracellular matrix integrity favours the host over the pathogen. We optimised multiparameter readouts to study emerging therapeutic interventions: cytokine supplementation, host-directed therapy and immunoaugmentation. Each intervention modulates the host-pathogen interaction, but has both beneficial and harmful effects. This methodology has wide applicability to investigate infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases and develop novel drug regimes and vaccination approaches.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21283.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21283.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic></kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>bioengineering</kwd><kwd>modelling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N006631/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elkington</surname><given-names>Paul T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R33AI102239</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jayasinghe</surname><given-names>Suwan N</given-names></name><name><surname>Elkington</surname><given-names>Paul T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000849</institution-id><institution>National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NC/L001039/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tezera</surname><given-names>Liku B</given-names></name><name><surname>Elkington</surname><given-names>Paul T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The bridging of bioengineering and cell culture techniques provides a transformative platform to investigate human biology within a 3-dimensional extracellular matrix over prolonged periods with multiplex readouts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An emerging paradigm in biology is that events in traditional 2-dimensional cell culture often differ from those in 3-dimensional (3-D) culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pampaloni et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the extracellular matrix regulates cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamada and Cukierman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwartz and Chen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parker et al., 2014</xref>) and infection biology differs between 2-D and 3-D systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrila et al., 2010</xref>). Human disease occurs in 3-D and in the context of extracellular matrix. Consequently, conclusions drawn from 2-dimensional cell culture systems may not fully reflect events in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamada and Cukierman, 2007</xref>). This presents a challenge to progress from standard culture systems, where cells are grown in 2-D on plastic, to more advanced systems that more faithfully replicate events in man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamada and Cukierman, 2007</xref>). These technical difficulties are particularly marked in studying infectious diseases, where experiments must have additional levels of containment to prevent the release of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrila et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) is a pathogen of global significance that continues to kill 1.5 million people per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O'Garra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Horsburgh et al., 2015</xref>). Unfortunately, despite major investment in research, recent clinical trials and vaccine studies to reduce the global burden of tuberculosis (TB) have been unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tameris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ndiaye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Warner and Mizrahi, 2014</xref>), indicating that the model systems that informed these studies require further refinement. In TB, the host-pathogen interaction is highly complex, with the immune response concurrently necessary for containment of infection but paradoxically also driving immunopathology that leads to lung destruction and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Russell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elkington and Friedland, 2015</xref>). The mouse is the principal model system to study TB, but inflammatory conditions in the mouse differ from man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seok et al., 2013</xref>), and lung pathology is different in murine Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Young, 2009</xref>). Mtb is an obligate human pathogen and has a very prolonged interaction with host cells, surviving within professional phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Russell, 2011</xref>). Therefore, long term human culture experiments are required to investigate pathogenesis. A specific advantage of 3-D cell culture incorporating extracellular matrix is that cellular survival is greatly prolonged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchheit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mueller-Klieser, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, inflammatory signalling in TB granulomas is spatially organised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marakalala et al., 2016</xref>), with specific microenvironments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mattila et al., 2013</xref>), and the extracellular matrix regulates cell survival in TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Shammari et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that an optimal system to study human disease will need to be 3-D with extracellular matrix.</p><p>We hypothesised that to fully understand the host-pathogen interaction in TB, a 3-D cell culture system that incorporates primary human cells, extracellular matrix, fully virulent Mtb, and multiparameter longitudinal readouts is required. Whilst human cellular models of human granuloma formation have been developed, none have all these characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Puissegur et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kapoor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parasa et al., 2014</xref>). We addressed the technical challenges of performing these experiments at biosafety containment level three by adopting a bioengineering approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Workman et al., 2014</xref>). We developed a model system that permits interrogation of the host-pathogen interaction in 3-D in the context of extracellular matrix. We demonstrate that cardinal features of human disease develop and that the host immune response is significantly different when cells are adherent to collagen, favouring the host relative to the pathogen. We investigate emerging therapeutic approaches in the system, and demonstrate that each intervention has both beneficial and likely harmful effects. The model permits the concurrent analysis of multiple outcomes and therefore can be used to develop optimal approaches to address the TB pandemic, and can be applied to diverse infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Key features of human tuberculosis develop in the bio-electrospray model</title><p>To address the challenges of studying infection of primary human cells with a virulent pathogen within a 3-D extracellular matrix, we optimised the bio-electrospray parameters for stable microsphere generation. PBMCs were isolated from healthy donors, counted and then infected with Mtb that had been cultured in Middlebrook 7H9 broth at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. After overnight infection, cells were detached, resuspended, and pelleted by centrifugation, and then re-suspended in alginate or alginate-collagen matrix before bioelectrospraying into microspheres using a Nisco Cell Encapsulator (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>).

Quantitation demonstrated significantly more aggregates in infected microspheres than unifected microspheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). One day after infection, a quarter of monocytes had phagocytosed Mtb, analyzed by flow cytometric analysis of cells infected with GFP-expressing Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). After 14 days of incubation, large cellular aggregates are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Survival of Mtb-infected cells in 3-D collagen-alginate microspheres was much greater than in 2-D culture, as analyzed by LDH release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and cellular cytotoxicity assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). An advantage of the model is that cells can be released from the microsphere by decapsulation by divalent cation chelation with EDTA and sodium citrate in HBSS for 10 min, which causes dissolution of the spheres and releases cells for downstream assays. Decapsulation did not significantly affect cell viability, with over 90% cell viability after decapsulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Monocytes mature into macrophages in infected microspheres, with greater expression of CD68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Within the aggregates, multinucleate giant cells typical of human TB develop, stained for CD68 by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). These multinucleate giant cells are similar to those that occur in human patients with pulmonary TB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). T cell differentiation occurs within microspheres, with a progressive increase in the proportion of CD4+ T cells, while the percentage of CD8+ T cells declines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).

Therefore, extended studies of human cells adherent to extracellular matrix in 3-D are likely to be essential to fully understand the host-pathogen interaction. We developed a model of human TB utilising bio-electrospray technology that replicates key features of clinical disease and optimised a multiplex readout to investigate both host and pathogen responses. We demonstrated that the extracellular matrix regulates the host immune response, consistent with reports of the ECM regulating inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sorokin, 2010</xref>), and found that collagen favours host control of Mtb. We then used the model to investigate novel therapeutic approaches. The system permitted prolonged culture of primary human cells, and we found that significant differences between experimental conditions often only emerged after more than 7 days, which would not have been observed in 2D culture systems where 3–4 days is the standard experimental duration. Our findings are consistent with other infections, where the cellular adaptions to their context determines outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Snijder et al., 2009</xref>).

The mouse model of TB has many advantages and key findings in the mouse have been replicated in man, such as critical roles for CD4+ T cells, TNF-α and IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flynn and Chan, 2001</xref>), but pathology in the mouse differs from human TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Young, 2009</xref>) and humanised mice are required to generate caseating lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calderon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heuts et al., 2013</xref>). Other advanced human cellular models of TB have been developed. For example, Altare’s group has studied a prolonged model of PBMC culture with Mtb and demonstrated cell aggregate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Puissegur et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lay et al., 2007</xref>), but this model lacks extracellular matrix. A collagen matrix-containing model has been developed by Kapoor, showing aggregation and TB dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kapoor et al., 2013</xref>), but lacks the high throughput potential of the bioelectrospray system and rapid cellular recovery for multiparameter readouts. Generation of a complete human granuloma structure will require stromal cells such as fibroblasts, which are present in the periphery of TB granulomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O'Kane et al., 2010</xref>). A key next step will be to compare patients with latent TB with active TB, and those with and without HIV-co-infection, to determine whether the model can differentiate protective immunity to Mtb directly ex vivo.</p><p>Many of our findings are consistent with conclusions drawn from these systems. For example, a significant role for IFN-β in the host immune response to TB is emerging from genomic studies, though it remains controversial as to whether this is protective or harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cliff et al., 2015</xref>). Our data suggest a predominantly protective effect, and emerging data support this conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moreira-Teixeira et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, we confirmed that augmentation of PGE<sub>2</sub> improves host control of mycobacterial proliferation, consistent with findings in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayer-Barber et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, T cells responsive to specific Mtb antigens proliferated in infected microspheres and secreted cytokines known to be important in the host immune response to Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O'Garra et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, while some results were as expected, several findings in the 3-D system may not be predicted from current disease paradigms. For example, IFN-γ in high concentrations increases the growth of TB, whereas murine experiments predict improved control. Consistent with our findings, several previous studies have shown that IFN-γ increases Mtb growth in primary human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vogt and Nathan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Douvas et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rook et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crowle and Elkins, 1990</xref>). The evidence for a beneficial role of IFN-γ in humans is principally supported by individuals where there is a complete absence of signalling through the IL-12/IFN pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karp et al., 2015</xref>), and this protective effect has clearly been shown in the mouse through both knock-out and vaccination studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flynn and Chan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aagaard et al., 2011</xref>). However, cohort studies have shown that a high PPD response, or high IFN-γ response to ESAT-6 or CFP-10, associates with the subsequent development of TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Comstock et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Higuchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">del Corral et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that an excessive IFN-γ response may be deleterious. We attempted to determine if there was a tipping point of IFN-γ concentration by adding IFN-γ neutralising antibodies to the microsphere matrix, and although we were able to demonstrate increased growth with IFN-γ neutralisation, we found a similar effect with isotype control antibodies, so it was impossible to determine if this was a specific effect. Our longitudinal observations of Mtb growth in a non-destructive manner using luminescent mycobacteria support the emerging concept that a balanced immune response is essential, and either a deficit or excess of a specific mediator may favour the pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O'Garra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gideon et al., 2015</xref>). Combining the model with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will permit further interrogation of each cytokine component of the immune response.</p><p>PGE<sub>2</sub> augmentation has been proposed as a novel host-directed therapy to improve outcome in TB, and we demonstrate reduced Mtb growth. However, the multiparamter analysis in our human system showed that PGE<sub>2</sub> increases secretion of IL-8, which is likely to drive migration of neutrophils, and PGE<sub>2</sub> also reduced host cell viability. Neutrophil recruitment has been described to have a deleterious effect on host control of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kimmey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nouailles et al., 2014</xref>) and therefore there is potential that this may favour Mtb, driving increased pathology, lung destruction and transmission. The peak PGE<sub>2</sub> concentration that we studied is similar to that reported in human tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reikerås et al., 2009</xref>). We also found that immunoaugmentation with ESAT-6 or CFP-10 responsive T cell lines led to increased growth of Mtb. Pathogenic mycobacteria express the RD1 locus but the precise mechanism linking RD1 to pathology is not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Majlessi et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings are consistent with the recent observations that T cell epitopes are hyperconserved in pathogenic mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Comas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coscolla et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lindestam Arlehamn et al., 2015</xref>), indicating an evolutionary advantage to the pathogen of specifically stimulating components of the host immune response to facilitate transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orme et al., 2015</xref>). However, an alternative explanation is that the in vitro expansion conditions generated a T cell phenotype that was permissive to Mtb growth, skewing an initially protective phenotype to a deleterious one, and so further confirmation across different T cell lines is required. Augmented iNKT cells did not increase Mtb growth after ex vivo expansion. The key conclusion of these experiments is that the immunoaugmentation model has potential to dissect protective versus pathological host immune responses.</p><p>The recent negative outcomes from both vaccine trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tameris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ndiaye et al., 2015</xref>) and treatment-shortening regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Warner and Mizrahi, 2014</xref>) illustrate that observations in current model systems may not reliably translate to human disease and highlight the need for more nuanced approaches that reflect human TB infection. Our data suggest that simply driving an increased immune response to Mtb will not improve control of mycobacterial growth. Augmenting PGE<sub>2</sub> release by modulating the leukotriene pathway may reduce mycobacterial proliferation but may come at a cost of increased pathology. Vaccination using ESAT-6 as an antigen, which has entered human trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luabeya et al., 2015</xref>), may actually favour Mtb growth under certain circumstances, demonstrating the fine balance between the host immune response and control of pathogen growth. Critically, our data from the bioengineered model are consistent with clinical phenomena observed in human TB. For example, an excessive immune response in patients is associated with greater pulmonary pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaufmann and Dorhoi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Comstock et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Philips and Ernst, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nunes-Alves et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, our immunoaugmentation studies concur with the expression of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 by pathogenic mycobacteria, implying a critical role in causing disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brites and Gagneux, 2015</xref>). The model can be used to investigate approaches currently in development, such as vaccines based on targeting CD1-restricted T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Van Rhijn et al., 2015</xref>) and emerging host-directed therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zumla et al., 2015</xref>), to determine whether they confer greater protection without likely harmful effects.</p><p>The bio-electrospray cell culture model has broad potential, addressing the technical complexity of performing 3-D primary cell culture within diverse extracellular matrices. The system can readily be applied to study diverse infectious and inflammatory diseases, or cancer immunotherapy, and can be developed for high-throughput applications by combining the microsphere system with microfluidics. Integration with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will permit genetic manipulation of both host and pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty et al., 2014</xref>). The multiparameter readouts define the translational potential of novel interventions over time with longitudinal data acquisition, identifying both beneficial and deleterious effects. Therefore, this system developed to dissect the host-pathogen interaction in human TB can be applied to identify novel therapeutic approaches to multiple human diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>For analysis of blood from healthy donors and healthy TB exposed individuals, this work was approved by the National Research Ethics Service committee South Central - Southampton A, study title ‘An investigation into the immune response to tuberculosis infection and development of novel diagnostic markers’, reference 13/SC/0043.

Tuberculosis-host interactions in a 3D environment. There is a particular need in TB research to establish new model systems. A simple 3D bead-based system that more closely mimics the 3D environment of the human host may accelerate our understanding of TB biology and the development of improved interventions. The reviewers believe that the 3-D biospray model for human tuberculosis described here may be an important tool for the field, but that the strength of the model must be further illustrated with a few additional experiments. We invite a revised manuscript that describes these experiments and addresses the concerns listed below:</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for their comments and for seeing the potential of the model for the field. We have done as many experiments as technically possible within the 2 month requested period for resubmission. However, due to the prolonged time course of the experiments, which each often last for 21 days, it has not been possible to do all experiments suggested, and we have amended the text where appropriate to respond to the specific comments and highlight future direction for the model.</p><p> <italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Although mouse models can be wrong, the importance of T cells specific for Mtb antigens, including ESAT-6 or CFP-10, has been clearly demonstrated. Models where ESAT-6 or CFP-10 T cells provide protection alone have been published. Therefore, the exacerbation of growth when specific T cells were added to the microsphere must be further investigated and validated. First, a titration of T cells should be performed – is there a tipping point for numbers of T cells, and how was the number of T cells determined? In addition, what is the phenotype of those T cells in terms of cytokine production (a feature of how they were generated)? Since this result is not intuitive, it must be further investigated.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the points the reviewers make. We have performed detailed characterisation of the cytokine response of the ESAT-6 and CFP-10 augmented T cells and present these data as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and 1C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref> – E. There is significantly increased secretion of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IL-1β, MCP-1 and IFN-γ secretion in augmented microspheres. We have amended the Discussion (fourth paragraph) to include the evidence that ESAT-6 can be protective, and also cite human data where an increased IFN-γ response correlates with the subsequent development of TB. These contrasting observations demonstrate that the host immune response to TB is highly nuanced and a greater response does not consistently correlate with greater protection.</p><p>In terms of T cell titration, although we completely agree that they are very valuable suggestions, the experiments suggested are simply not possible in the time frame available, as expansion of the T cells would take 20 days, the microsphere incubation would be 20 days, and then colony counts 21 days, so just one experiment would take 2 months. We accept that the ex vivo proliferation may have created an adverse T cell phenotype, and so have amended the text discussing whether the expansion protocol has led to a non-controlling phenotype (Discussion, fifth paragraph). We have also included future potential experiments to investigate this possibility.</p><p>Critically, the fundamental conclusion that the model can be used to distinguish protective versus pathological T cell responses is demonstrated by our data and supports the use of the model to investigate the host-pathogen interaction.</p><p><italic>2) It would also be very helpful for a comparison of microspheres using PBMC from Mtb+ (active or latent TB) humans to microspheres with PBMC from uninfected individuals. This is a much more realistic and interesting comparison.</italic> </p><p>We completely agree that this is a valuable line of investigation and indeed is a programme of work we would like to undertake. However, allowing for inter-donor variability that is inevitable in a primary human system, we anticipate needing to study at least 6 uninfected and 6 latently infected individuals, again at least 4 months’ work. Therefore, it is simply impossible in the time frame available. We now discuss these experiments in the second paragraph of the Discussion and hope to be able to undertake this work in the coming year.</p><p><italic>3) To validate the IFN-γ results, the authors could consider antibodies against IFN-γ to determine if the added IFN-γ pushes the system over the top. Can the authors measure IFN-γ in their system – this would be important here and in the T cell experiments.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have measured IFN-γ in the system and also analysed gene expression by RT-qPCR. Mtb infection upregulates gene expression and secretion. We now include these data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4I</xref>. In the cytokine augmentation experiment, we show that Mtb infection upregulates IFN-γ secretion, and this is further increased by IFN-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). In the PGE<sub>2</sub> experiment, we show that PGE<sub>2</sub> suppresses IFN-γ secretion, and include this as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>. In the immunoaugmentation experiments, there was a significant increase in IFN-γ secretion and this is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>.</p><p>In terms of adding antibodies, we have performed this experiment as requested, and again shown in 3 further donors that IFN-γ increases TB growth, so we have now demonstrated this result in a total of 8 donors studied. We found that anti-IFN-γ antibodies also increased TB growth, consistent with the tipping point hypothesis proposed by the reviewers. However, we also found a similar effect with the isotype control antibody, so impossible to know if this is a specific effect. We now discuss these results in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion, and make it clear that further work, such as by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, is required to resolve this this.</p><p><italic>4) In the Abstract, please list the cell types used in the study.</italic> </p><p>The cell types are now stated.</p><p><italic>5) The proliferation data in the T cell study shows only modest proliferation. This should be quantified over several different microspheres and provided in graphical form, in addition to the histograms provided.</italic> </p><p>Thank you, we have performed quantitation as suggested from 3 separate donors and provide this as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. Statistical analysis shows a significant increase in proliferation after T cell augmentation at day 7.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> does not look like a human granuloma. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, it is simply an aggregate of cells, not an organized granuloma. This statement should be clarified and the absence of true structure should be noted. If they have evidence of true granuloma structure, they should provide it. Otherwise, this is very misleading.</italic> </p><p>We accept the point made and that this is a cell aggregation and further work is required to prove it is an organised granuloma. We have changed the wording throughout the manuscript from granuloma to aggregate. We now discuss the future potential development of the model in the second paragraph of the Discussion to generate a fully multicellular system.</p><p><italic>7) The PGE<sub>2</sub> experiments are very interesting and provocative. How does the 20μg/ml concentration use relate to</italic> in vivo <italic>concentrations in murine models?</italic> </p><p>We are glad the reviewers find the experiments interesting, and highlight the potentially double-edged nature of TB immunotherapy. The concentration we used was chosen on the basis of those reported in human inflamed lung, which is 20μg/ml, and we now cite this reference in the manuscript. We have been unable to find reports of local concentrations of PGE<sub>2</sub> in the mouse model, and justify the concentration studied on the basis of human data.</p><p><italic>8) The methodology is difficult to understand or is not fully described.</italic> </p><p>We apologise for this and accept that our familiarity with the system may have led us to describe it poorly. We have amended throughout to give greater detail, addressed the points below.</p><p><italic>Novel methods such as the spray technology have a very brief discussion in the main text and should be given more space given that this is a tools article. It was difficult, for example, to understand what cells were used and that they were preinfected. Information on how the cells were infected was not included, for example, nor was how the bacteria were cultured.</italic> </p><p>We have expanded this section in the Results section giving an overview of the process and we have provided additional details in the Methods. Most importantly, we have initiated the submission of a Bio-protocol giving step by step guides of the entire process, and we will complete the submission immediately if this article is accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> to make it freely available to researchers worldwide.</p><p><italic>Other aspects of the methods that are emphasized as part of the general utility of the model are not well described. Only by reading the Methods do I see that cytokines are measured using xMAP technology. It is not clear without reading Andreu et al., 2010 how the luminescence assay is longitudinal.</italic> </p><p>We have clarified these two points in the Results in the last paragraph of the subsection “Key features of human tuberculosis develop in the bio-electrospray model” and re-read the manuscript to try to ensure that all methods are described as clearly as possible.</p><p><italic>How is decapsulation performed? Given how important decapsulation is to the functionality of this model for studying the host-pathogen interaction, it is important to demonstrate how efficient and damaging the decapsulation process is.</italic> </p><p>We give further details on decapsulation in the second paragraph of the subsection “Key features of human tuberculosis develop in the bio-electrospray model”. We thank the reviewers for this comment and now include data from 3 experiments studying cell toxicity of decapsulation and include this as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>. Cells have over 92% viability after the entire matrix incorporation / encapsulation / decapsulation process compared to autologous cells stored at 4<sup>o</sup>C during this process. Therefore, we feel that the process is minimally damaging.</p><p><italic>How were the CFU experiments performed? After how many days were the cells plated?</italic> </p><p>We apologise for omitting these data. CFUs were performed by decapsulating cells, lysing with 1% saponin and the plating on Middlebrook 7H11 agar. Plates were read at 3 weeks. We stipulate the time point taken more clearly in the Results and Methods sections.</p><p><italic>It is hard to understand how comparable the 2D and 3D cytotoxicity measurements are (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-F</xref>) without information about how many cells were used in the measurements.</italic> </p><p>We now provide greater details about the cell numbers used and how the measurements were performed in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend and in the Methods subsection “DQ Collagen Degradation Assay”.</p><p><italic>9) The emphasis in the writing is on characterizing bacterial burden and host cell behaviors, but falls short of comprehensively placing these findings in context of experiments performed in animal models and in 2D.</italic> </p><p>We accept this criticism and now include an entirely new paragraph in the Discussion trying to place the model more comprehensively in findings from animal and 2D systems.</p></body></sub-article></article>
