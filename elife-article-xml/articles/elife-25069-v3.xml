isolates stimulus-locked inter-regional correlation patterns, we compared the cortical topology of the neural circuit for face processing in participants with an impairment in face recognition, congenital prosopagnosia (CP), and matched controls. Whereas the anterior temporal lobe served as the major network hub for face processing in controls, this was not the case for the CPs. Instead, this group evinced hyper-connectivity in posterior regions of the visual cortex, mostly associated with the lateral occipital and the inferior temporal cortices. Moreover, the extent of this hyper-connectivity was correlated with the face recognition deficit. These results offer new insights into the perturbed cortical topology in CP, which may serve as the underlying neural basis of the behavioral deficits typical of this disorder. The approach adopted here has the potential to uncover altered topologies in other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25069.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25069.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25069.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human babies prefer to look at faces and pictures of faces over any other object or pattern. A recent study found that even fetuses in the womb will turn their heads towards dots of light shone through the mother’s skin if the dots broadly resemble a face. Brain imaging studies show that face recognition depends on the coordinated activity of multiple brain regions. A core set of areas towards the back of the brain processes the visual features of faces, while regions elsewhere process more variable features such as emotional expressions.</p><p>Around 2% of people are born with difficulties in recognizing faces, a condition known as congenital prosopagnosia. These individuals have no obvious anatomical abnormalities in the brain, and brain scans reveal normal activity in core regions of the face processing network. So why do these people have difficulty with face recognition?</p><p>One possibility is that the condition reflects differences in the number of connections (or “connectivity”) between brain regions within the face processing network. To test this idea, Rosenthal et al. compared connectivity in individuals with congenital prosopagnosia with that in healthy volunteers. In the healthy volunteers, an area of the network called the anterior temporal cortex was highly connected to many other face processing regions: that is, it acted as a face processing hub. In individuals with congenital prosopagnosia, this hub-like connectivity was missing. Instead, a number of core regions involved in processing the basic visual features of faces, were more highly connected to one another. The greater this “hyperconnectivity”, the better the individual’s face processing abilities.</p><p>The findings of Rosenthal et al. pave the way for developing imaging-based tools to diagnose congenital prosopagnosia. The same approach could then be used to investigate the basis of other neurodevelopmental disorders that are thought to involve abnormal communication within brain networks, such as developmental dyslexia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25069.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25069.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>ventral cortex</kwd><kwd>functional connectivity</kwd><kwd>network analysis</kwd><kwd>face processing</kwd><kwd>prosopagnosia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>296/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Avidan</surname><given-names>Galia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BCS-1354350</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Behrmann</surname><given-names>Marlene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#SBE-0542013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Behrmann</surname><given-names>Marlene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An innovative inter-subject stimulus-locked brain activation approach uncovers marked topological differences in a brain network of higher-order visual regions in individuals with a congenital impairment in face recognition compared with controls.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding the neural basis of developmental disorders such as congenital prosopagnosia (CP) remains a challenge from both a basic science and a translational perspective as there are no obvious identifiable deficits on conventional anatomical MR brain scans. Furthermore, many studies show that CP individuals evince normal fMRI activation in the 'core' face-related posterior patches of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hasson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avidan et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avidan and Behrmann, 2009</xref>) (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">von Kriegstein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dinkelacker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Furl et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, more sensitive methods that have been used to map structural changes in CP relative to controls, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have revealed a reduction in long-range white matter tracts connecting the ‘core’ face-related posterior patches and the anterior temporal lobe face patch (ATL) in CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>; for related papers, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grossi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Scherf et al., 2014</xref>). Other studies have also reported local structural and functional atypicalities in the vicinity of face-selective regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Song et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lohse et al., 2016</xref>). Using standard functional connectivity (FC) analysis, which measures the temporal correlations across different brain areas within an individual, we have previously documented abnormal deviations from the control pattern in the connectivity patterns between the 'core' and 'extended' nodes of the face system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avidan and Behrmann, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The pattern of FC within each individual, as utilized in previous studies, is a combination of stimulus-induced correlations, intrinsic neural fluctuations, and correlations induced by non-neuronal artifacts (such as head motion, respiration). Separating these factors is challenging within the framework of standard FC, given the strength of the intrinsic neural fluctuations. Hence, group differences in FC may not be sufficiently robust to be detected following whole brain statistical correction, and, therefore, are less suitable for mapping large-scale changes in network topology.</p><p>In contrast with these previous studies that have examined the neural profile of CP based on a subset of brain regions and their connectivity, here, we adopt an innovative, large-scale network approach. The primary goal of this approach is to elucidate the functional brain topology in individuals with CP (and matched controls) as a means of examining alterations in neural circuitry. Because there is consensus that multiple regions (face ‘patches’) are implicated in normal face recognition in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haxby et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pyles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weiner and Grill-Spector, 2013</xref>) and in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moeller et al., 2017</xref>), elucidating alterations in the topology of this distributed cortical circuit is of great interest.</p><p>To that end, in the present study, we have used a novel method, termed ‘inter-subject functional correlation’ (ISFC), which is designed to isolate stimulus-locked functional responses, by correlating the response profile across the brains of multiple participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Simony et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, intrinsic neural dynamics during rest and during task conditions that are not related to the pattern of activation evoked by stimulation, as well as non-neuronal artifacts (e.g., respiratory rate, motion), can only influence the pattern of correlations within each individual brain, but cannot induce correlations between subjects. In contrast, neural processes that are locked to the structure of the stimulus can be correlated across brains. Thus, the ISFC method allows us to track stimulus-locked brain responses within the high-level visual network in control subjects and to contrast these correlation patterns with the patterns uncovered in CP individuals. Such an approach enables us to explore possible alterations in connectivity across large swaths of the cortex in an assumption-free manner rather than focusing on a predetermined subset of regions and connections.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>During an fMRI scan, 10 CP and 10 control subjects viewed separate blocks of images of emotional faces (angry, fearful), neutral faces, famous faces, unfamiliar faces and buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Avidan et al., 2014</xref>). To define an initial set of unbiased nodes (functional regions or clusters comprising the network) with which to explore topology and connectivity, face-selective (right FFA) and non-face selective (right LOC) seed regions were defined based on BOLD data from a separate group of 16 control subjects (see Materials and methods). Using these two seed regions, and their mean activation profile across subjects, two correlation maps were derived and a binary mask was constructed for each. These masks were then separately sub-divided into small, spatially constrained clusters with each cluster serving as a node for the network analyses. This procedure resulted in large swaths of cortex sub-divided into nodes, each of which preserved the original ‘functional tagging’ from the seed correlation analysis (i.e., face-selective nodes, orange color, object-selective nodes, green color, or nodes that are not exclusive to either faces or objects, blue color; see Materials and methods for details on node definition, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25069.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Networks obtained using the ISFC approach. </title><p>The top schematic denotes the inter-subject functional correlation approach, which calculates the inter-regional correlations in the brains of different individuals.

(2016)</xref> demonstrated that the ISFC method substantially increases the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in detecting shared stimulus-locked network correlation patterns by filtering out idiosyncratic intrinsic neural dynamics and non-neuronal artifacts (e.g., respiratory rate; motion) that can influence FC patterns within a brain but that are uncorrelated across the brains of different participants. Capitalizing on the high SNR of the ISFC procedure permits the construction of a fine-grained functional brain network even with a relatively small sample size as is the case in the present study and potentially in other situations of relatively rare disorders (see Materials and methods).</p><p>We calculated the ISFC within the CP and the control groups using the BOLD signal elicited in response to faces and buildings (see below). For comparison, we also ran the same analysis using a standard FC procedure. In the FC analysis, the response profile in each node was correlated with the response profile of all other nodes within an individual. The analysis was repeated for each individual in each group and statistical significance for each edge was determined using a t-test followed by FDR correction. We return to these results below. ISFC is similar in logic to FC, with one critical difference: instead of correlating the response profile within the brain of each individual, we calculated the correlation patterns across brains. For each experimental group (controls and CPs), the correlation between the response profile of each subject and the mean of the remaining 9 subjects was calculated (see ISFC procedure in Materials and methods). The average non-thresholded networks for each group are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref> for visualization purposes.</p><p>As is evident, the raw mean networks over the ISFC of each group are visually similar. To evaluate whether there are any statistical differences in the network structure across the two groups, the networks were directly compared using a permutation test (see Materials and methods for details). This analysis resulted in a difference network in which the edges indicate the significant difference between the two groups (either controls&gt;CPs or CPs&gt;controls). Non-significant edges were eliminated (see details of statistical analysis in Materials and methods ISFC Formulation section). For the following analysis, we applied a stringent statistical criteria. This approach is followed by a second, more descriptive network analysis which captures the overall difference in the pattern of ISFC across the two groups (see Network analysis section).</p><p>The controls&gt;CPs difference network revealed that control participants, but not CP, exhibited an overall, non-selective increase in ISFC patterns from nodes in the vicinity of the ATL (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and Network analysis section). In contrast, the opposite analysis of CPs&gt;controls revealed a significant edge between nodes in the vicinity of the LOC (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Correlations of the significant edges with behavior</title><p>To examine whether the neuronal ISFC of these significant edges is related to behavioral performance, the mean raw ISFC value for each group was correlated with the famous faces questionnaire and CFMT scores of each participant (see Materials and methods for details). We hypothesized that higher ISFC values in the network edges located in posterior visual areas (e.g. LOC) should suffice for face representations that are largely driven by the immediate visual input and do not necessarily enable recognition (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gainotti, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2008</xref> and the Discussion section).</p><p>We focused the analysis on the single, significant posterior edge that was obtained from the contrast of the CPs&gt;controls and examined the raw ISFC value of this edge within the CP and control groups. Moreover, based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Furl et al., 2011</xref>), we set to examine whether the two behavioral measures are redundant and consequently, whether there is a latent behavioral measure which can account for both. In accordance with this study, we found a significant correlation between the CFMT and famous faces behavioral measures <italic>r</italic>(18)=0.71, p=0.0003. Accordingly, the 2 measures were factorized using PCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Furl et al., 2011</xref>), and the first principal component which accounted for 85.9% of the variance served as our new face recognition behavioral score. The correlation between the face behavioral score was <italic>r</italic>(18) = 0.9, p&lt;0.0001 and <italic>r</italic>(18) = 0.94, p&lt;0.0001 for CFMT and famous faces questionnaire respectively. Subsequently, a multivariate regression was conducted to examine if ISFC and group predicted the face recognition behavioral score. This was done for the significant ISFC edges obtained from both the CP &gt;Controls and the Controls &gt; CP contrasts. As for the CP &gt;controls contrast, overall a significant effect was found for both the group and the ISFC edge and the independent variables indeed explained a significant amount of the variance of the face recognition behavioral score (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.83, <italic>R<sup>2</sup><sub>Adjusted</sub></italic> = 0.81, <italic>F</italic>(2,17) = 42.67, p&lt;0.0001). Moreover, the group significantly predicted face recognition behavioral score (β = −6.08, p&lt;0.0001<italic>, t</italic> = −6.83, stde = 0.87), as did the ISFC value (β = 4.89, p=0.017, <italic>t</italic> = 2.63, stde = 1.85). The intercept term was not statistically significant (<bold>α</bold> = 0.93, p=0.089, <italic>t</italic> = 1.8, stde = 0.52). Hence, ISFC score was positively associated with behavioral face performance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). When conducting the same procedure but examining the edges obtained from the controls&gt;CPs contrast, the ISFC edge and the independent variables also explained a significant amount of the variance of the face recognition behavioral score (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.77, <italic>R<sup>2</sup><sub>Adjusted</sub></italic> = 0.74, <italic>F</italic>(2,17) = 29.19, p&lt;0.0001).

To further understand and quantify the networks obtained from comparing CPs and controls, we used a complementary approach in which the non-thresholded positive t-values matrix connectivity patterns were compared to various topological and topographical attributes, while using correspondingly appropriate weighted graph measures for each contrast (CP&gt;control and control&gt;CP). These group differences were further quantified for each contrast using a measure of 'node strength', which quantifies the sum of positive edge weights connected to a node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rubinov and Sporns, 2010</xref>). First, we assessed the selectivity of the differences in the ATL connectivity. The ISFC of the edges connecting the ATL to both face and non-face selective nodes located throughout the visual cortex was higher in controls&gt;CPs compared to the opposite contrast (see specific pattern of ATL ISFC in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,f</xref>). The strength scores of all nodes in the network were ranked in a descending order, and, of interest, the three nodes located in the ATL were ranked as the top 3 for the control subjects (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3a</xref>). Note that the ATL served as a hub connecting both face and non-face selective nodes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The node rankings confirm the centrality of the ATL in the face network of controls in contrast with that of CP, whose top 3 rankings include the right inferior temporal gyrus and the left lateral occipital cortex.</p><p>The network obtained from the CPs&gt;controls comparison revealed that, at a low-edge threshold, significant edges were located throughout the visual cortex, but, as the threshold was increased, edges from anterior regions were eliminated and the remaining significant edges were located only in posterior parts of the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). To further quantify this effect, the Y coordinates of the 3D MNI space were ranked in an ascending order and binned into 10–21 equally sized bins measuring distance parallel to the posterior-anterior commissure axis (the maximal number of bins was chosen with a constraint that each bin contained at least one node). The significance level of the posterior to anterior pattern was then quantified using the Spearman correlation between the Y coordinate bins and the nodes' strength for CPs&gt;controls and controls&gt;CPs contrasts separately. The results indicate that the higher Y coordinates (more anterior regions along the anterior posterior axis) were associated with higher positive strength values for the controls&gt;CPs contrast across all bin divisions (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.52 to 0.8, p=0.004 to 0.053). Note that division into 14 bins resulted in the lowest correlation (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.52), which was only marginally significant (p=0.053). Contrarily, the CPs&gt;controls contrast revealed an opposite result such that more posterior regions had higher node strengths across all bin divisions (r<sub>s</sub> = −0.67 to −0.83, p=0.0003 to 0.01). These correlations validate the result of greater posterior ISFC in CPs versus controls.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25069.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ISFC correlation between strength and node location along posterior-anterior axis.</title><p>Linear regression fit with a 95% confidence interval band between the strength measure of the nodes and the Y coordinate ascending rank order of each node binned into 21 equally sized bins for (<bold>a</bold>) controls &gt; CPs (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.58, p=0.005) and (<bold>b</bold>) CPs &gt; controls (rs = −0.70, p=0.0003).

Specifically, higher ISFC patterns in the control group, compared to the CP group, were associated with face selective nodes. For this comparison, eight out of the top ten nodes (80%) were face-related (ranked in descending order by degree score) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3a</xref>), compared to an overall face node base rate of 35% (number of face nodes divided by overall number of nodes). The difference between the face-selective node rate in the controls &gt; CPs contrast and the overall face nodes base rate was statistically significant, χ²(1, n = 20) =5.05, p=0.02. Moreover, 9 out of these 10 nodes, consisted of voxels originating from the same seed (FFA or LOC). In the remaining node, voxels consisted of 90% of one tag (either FFA or LOC) and 10% of the other tag. Thus, the face network of the controls was associated with a higher number of face-tagged nodes compared with the face network of the CPs. When comparing the opposite contrast (CPs&gt;controls), no statistically significant difference was found in the face-selectivity of the nodes χ²(1, n = 20) =1.25, p=n .s. In support of these findings, 7 out of the 10 nodes included a substantial majority of LOC tagged voxels (&gt;75%). As for the remaining 3, they were more heterogeneous and contained a mixture of voxels with all 3 possible taggings. In fact, four of the top ten nodes, of which only one was face specific, belonged to the lateral occipital cortex (one in the left hemisphere and three in the right) and six nodes belonged to the adjacent right inferior temporal cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Functional correlation analysis</title><p>We next compared the results obtained using ISFC to the results obtained using standard functional connectivity (FC) analysis.

On the one hand, CP individuals provide a unique opportunity to examine the underlying network function of normal face processing while avoiding some of the pitfalls that arise when studying patients with frank lesions (and altered vasculature) to cortex and, on the other hand, characterizing the deficits in these individuals relative to controls elucidates the atypical profile of this neurodevelopmental disorder. Also, because face recognition appears to be accomplished via the coordinated activity of multiple nodes of a distributed neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haxby et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fairhall and Ishai, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davies-Thompson and Andrews, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gschwind et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Joseph et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pyles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhen et al., 2013</xref>), such a study provides the opportunity to determine whether a disrupted function of one or more of the nodes within this network leads to an altered organization of the network and, if so, to document the nature and topology of this altered organization.</p><p>By isolating stimulus-locked neural responses using a novel ISFC analysis, the present study revealed alterations in the topological structure of the visual network in CP vs control subjects.</p><p>We exploited an ISFC approach, which filters out intrinsic neural dynamics and non-neuronal artifacts that can influence FC patterns within a brain but are uncorrelated across brains of different participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hasson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Simony et al., 2016</xref>). We aimed to characterize and contrast the normally functioning face network in healthy individuals with the face network of individuals with CP who are markedly impaired at face processing. The ISFC analysis revealed a unique pattern of anterior to posterior differences in the significance of nodes in the network of CPs vs. controls. Specifically, we documented hyperconnectivity in posterior visual areas in CPs vs. controls, and hypoconnectivity between the occipital areas and anterior temporal and frontal areas. Such alterations in the topology of the correlation patterns were correlated with behavioral scores of participants in standard measures of face processing. A previous study has shown that the ISFC better captured momentary network configurations and better predicted behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Simony et al., 2016</xref>). Consistently with this study, in the context of the present study, only the ISFC, but not FC was shown to be related to the behavioral measure of face processing, and hence was able to elucidate an additional important aspect of the data. In addition, a complementary analysis revealed face-specific dominance, reflected as higher degree nodes that are face selective (defined by a localizer), in the control group compared to the CP group. In fact, in the comparison of CPs&gt;controls, six of the top ten nodes belonged to the right inferior temporal gyrus and three nodes belonged to the lateral occipital cortex (LOC), of which only a single node was face specific.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The anterior temporal cortex</title><p>Perhaps the most striking difference in the topology of the face network in the controls versus CPs concerns the differences in the connectivity to the anterior temporal lobe (ATL). The ATL is implicated in the integration of person-specific information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kriegeskorte et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simmons et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nestor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2016</xref>) and familiar people recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gainotti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gainotti, 2007</xref>). Specifically, damage to the left ATL is more associated with impaired representation of semantic information, while damage to the right ATL impedes the visual recognition of familiar faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gainotti, 2007</xref>). Based on both functional activation data, functional connectivity data (during task and at rest) and structural volumetric and connectivity findings, we have argued previously that an abnormality in the anterior temporal lobe and its connectivity may play a critical role in the neural basis of CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behrmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avidan and Behrmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Avidan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>). The abnormality of the ATL is evident in the current findings as well, and the analysis, conducted in an assumption-free fashion revealed that the ATL was the most important hub that distinguished the network topology of the CPs and controls. Together, these findings point to abnormal structure, function and connectivity of this region in CP individuals (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Song et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lohse et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Altered organization of the face network in CPs</title><p>Our findings indicate that the impaired ISFC of the ATL may result in hyper-ISFC of the more posterior nodes, as in the right inferior temporal gyrus and the LOC, in CP compared to controls. These alterations in topology offer a possible account for the face recognition deficits exhibited by CP individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avidan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tanzer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). For example, the posterior hyper-connectivity in CP, in tandem with the residual, weak, connectivity with anterior regions may allow for some structural encoding of face stimuli derived from the immediate visual input (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Behrmann et al., 2005</xref>) for relevant behavioral findings). Although insufficient for facial recognition and individuation of identity, this rudimentary processing may partially compensate for the failure to utilize the ATL and its connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, in the current study, CP subjects exhibited greater LOC-related ISFC compared to normal subjects. Consistent with this finding, it has been demonstrated that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who have selective deficits in face recognition show greater activation of the LOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schultz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hubl et al., 2003</xref>).

Specifically, it is possible that the network edges located in posterior visual areas (e.g. LOC) allow for the computation of face representations that are largely driven by the immediate visual input. This information may be relied on disproportionately by the CP individuals and perhaps serves as partial compensation for the failure to represent person-selective information which, in the normal brain is supported by the anterior temporal cortex and its connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gainotti, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2008</xref>).

This approach was applied in the present study as well. However, despite its popularity, a major limitation of this measure, which captures within-subject synchronous activity, often referred to as functional connectivity, is that spontaneous intrinsic neuronal activity cannot be reliably separated from the evoked activity associated with the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greicius et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fox and Raichle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Simony et al., 2016</xref>).

Briefly, for each pair of preselected regions of interest (ROIs) or nodes, correlation coefficients are computed between each participant and the mean signal of the remaining group without this particular participant (leave-one-out), and then correlations are averaged across all pairwise iterations. As the correlations are calculated between different participants, any intrinsic activity and artifacts, which are not correlated between participants, are cancelled out and, consequently, only the task-induced activity of interest serves as the basis of the correlations, resulting in an improved SNR.</p><p>The present study is conducted on individuals with CP, a relatively uncommon disorder and, hence, sample size is inherently limited, especially when contrasting the group size against the large number of nodes and edges (i.e., the number of variables outweighs the number of samples). This situation is typical in investigations of special populations and so we used a version of the inter-subject functional correlation (ISFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hasson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Simony et al., 2016</xref>) to increase the SNR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>ISFC formulation</title><p>ISFC, is composed of the following steps: First, each experimental group (e.g. controls and CPs) which is composed of 10 subjects is divided into a group of 9 subjects and one remaining subject, and the raw signal for each node is averaged across all participants in the 9 subjects group. Second, for each experimental group, correlation coefficients are calculated between each pair of independent nodes, such that each pair of nodes is composed of one node from the individual subject and one node from the mean of the remaining nine subjects. The correlation coefficients are transformed by Fisher z-transformation. This process is repeated for all subjects in each experimental group such that, in each iteration, one of the subjects is left out.

To assess whether the differences are specific to face-selective nodes, the ratio of face-selective nodes and non-face selective nodes connected to the ATL nodes was quantified using within-module weighted degree and participation coefficient. Within-module weighted degree measures the ISFC level of a node within its module. In this analysis, a module is defined as one of the three types of functional tags (faces, non-faces and overlap). Note that this definition is different from the graph theoretical modularity measure as used in the first section of the results.

To gain a finer resolution of the network while maintaining the functional origin of each node, a seed-based correlation mask was constructed based on all voxels activated by seeds in the FFA and LOC located in the right hemisphere. These high-order visual regions were selected as seeds due to their well-documented roles in face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yovel and Kanwisher, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mazard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pinsk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">James et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rosenthal et al., 2016</xref>) and non-face processing respectively. Specifically, our underlying theoretical hypothesis was that CP would exhibit a more ‘object like’ processing style compared to controls while utilizing the right LOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsuyoshi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rosenthal et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A SPM8 random-effects group analysis was conducted, such that in a first-level analysis, contrasts between stimulus categories were calculated and these were then used in a second-level analysis with subject as a random factor. The analysis included high-pass filtering with a cutoff of 1/128 Hz and a first-order autocorrelation correction. Right FFA and right LOC seeds were initially marked based on the contrasts of faces&gt;(houses and objects) and (houses and objects) &gt;faces using xjview, an SPM add-on tool for defining ROIs, after FDR &lt; 0.05 correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cui et al., 2011</xref>). The selected voxels (see below for selection procedure) were later sub-divided into small, spatially constrained clusters. This procedure preserved the original functional specificity of each voxel with ‘functional tagging’ marking the functional preference of each node.</p><p>Using a custom Python script, voxels obtained from the functional localizer scans were limited to a gray matter mask based on the intersection of all the individual gray matter masks in MNI space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2014</xref>). Then, the time course was z-scored and a mean time course for all localizer runs averaged across all subjects was created. Using the mean time course, two separate seed-based correlation maps based on the right FFA and LOC initial seeds were defined and binarized using a 0.5 r value threshold. Our main motivation for choosing the 0.5 threshold was that it covered large portions of the cortex. A union between the two maps was created and a clustering analysis was performed using the scikit-learn (v0.18.1) Ward Agglomeration algorithm while utilizing a spatial neighborhood matrix to constrain clusters to form contiguous parcels on the nodes' mean time courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>) resulting in nodes which are either FFA-tagged, LOC-tagged, and nodes which are not exclusively tagged (i.e. voxels which were correlated to both the FFA and LOC seeds at r &gt; 0.5). For each node, we counted the number of voxels associated with each functional tagging and the node's selectivity was determined by the mode. The upper bound of spatially constrained sub-regions was set to 500 and was determined by practical reasons with a compromise between the need for a finely grained resolution of nodes, on the one hand, and the requirement to avoid regions that are too small and might result in poor signal to noise ratio, on the other. Hence, nodes with fewer than 10 voxels were eliminated from the analysis, resulting in 415 nodes for the obtained networks. The total number of voxels which were removed due to this threshold of a minimum cluster size was 313 voxels out of 13407 (eliminated nodes had 3.86 voxels on average with a 2.42 standard deviation, while remaining nodes had 31.55 ± 18.4 voxels on average). Of note is that one possible outcome of this unsupervised clustering analysis is that more than a single node can reside within the ‘classical’ functional definition (contrast based definitions) of a node such as for example, within the LOC or the FFA. This is evident in the Results section when the characteristics of the nodes are specifically described. Visualization of networks was done with custom Python script utilizing Nilearn library v0.2.5.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2014</xref>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001362">SCR_001362</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Definition of edges</title><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>Standard functional connectivity (FC)</title><p>For each subject and localizer run, the time course of each of the nodes was extracted after standardization (zero mean and unit variance) and high-pass filtered using a cutoff of 1/128 Hz.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David Van Essen as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper presents a new network analysis method, to characterize and compare the large scale network topology of brain networks in congenital prosopagnosia (CP) compared to typical controls. By using a new approach (inter-subject functional correlation approach, ISFC), which captures the correlations between nodes of different subjects, the study reports both local and macro scale differences between CP and controls. Locally, there were differences across groups in the anterior temporal (ATL), which served a hub for the control participants, but not CPs. Macroscopically, CPs evinced hyper-connectivity in posterior visual regions compared to controls, especially in the right hemisphere. Moreover, this hyper-connectivity was higher in the right hemisphere, known for its dominance in face processing, compared to the left hemisphere. These results advance understanding of network differences between CPs and controls.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the topic is of great interest, the rationale of the study is straightforward, and the experiments were well designed. They concluded that the study offers new insights into the perturbed cortical topology in CPs.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raised several major concerns that require your attention before the paper can be considered for publication.</p><p>Conceptual</p><p>The reviewers raised concerns about overlap with your prior 2014 Cerebral Cortex paper. Please clarify the conceptual advancement made by this study with respect to your prior work.</p><p>Another concern raised was that the comparison between normal controls and subgroups of CPs (mild and severe group) is non-independent from the comparison between normal controls and the entire group of CPs. Moreover, the results comparing the entire group of CPs and the different severity levels seems to be at odd with each other. The reviewer commented: &quot;The authors report that compared with controls, CPs showed decreased ISFC in the FFA tagged nodes, as well as increased ISFC in the LOC tagged nodes. However, in the comparison between severe CPs and mild CPs, they report compared with mild CPs, severe CPs showed decreased ISFC in the LOC tagged nodes, as well as increased ISFC in the FFA tagged nodes.

For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. uses an edge threshold of 0.3 without motivating why such a threshold is used, while the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> reads on the second line &quot;at minimum threshold&quot;, but it's unclear what the minimum is here.</p><p>2) Definition of nodes:</p><p>Why was a 0.5 threshold used? A better motivation should be provided.</p><p>Permutation testing: The permutation test that was used to evaluate the statistical differences of the network structure across the two groups was not properly implemented.</p><p>In permutation testing, given a statistic t computed on the difference between two groups, one would randomly assign the group labels, and compute the statistic again, repeat this process multiple times to estimate a null distribution, and compute the empirical p-value of the original statistic. If we apply the same concept to the method developed by the authors, one should first estimate the statistic, that is a correlation matrix for each group. This would be done by performing the split-half procedure for all the possible combinations (10C5 or 252 splits), and averaging across all splits, similar to what Simony et al. did with the leave-one-subject-out scheme. Given these two correlation matrices (one for each group), one would take their difference and obtain the final statistic of interest. Then, to compute the null distribution, one would randomly assign subjects to the groups (while maintaining the same numbers of subjects in each group), and then perform the same procedure to estimate the final statistic. By repeating this process at least 10,000 times (modern computing power can easily allow such number of iterations) one would effectively create a null distribution, that is the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis of no difference between the two groups. FWER correction could be performed in the same way as in Simony et al., 2016, by taking the max of the statistic at each iteration.</p><p>Estimation of the null distribution for statistical testing. In the original paper by Simony et al., ISFC was computed in a leave-one-subject-out scheme: time series from one subject were correlated with the average time-series of the other subjects. This process was repeated for all the possible combinations, and an average correlation matrix was computed, imposing symmetry by averaging the correlation matrix with its transpose. Statistical significance was computed through permutation testing, by randomizing the phase of the time series and computing an empirical, FWER corrected p-value. In contrast, Rosenthal et al., 2016 adopt what is known as a split-half scheme: for each group the correlation matrix is computed by correlating the average time series of five subjects with the average time series of the other five subjects. Statistical testing, however, is then mixed with the estimation of the actual correlation matrix from the data, by repeating this process 1,000 times and counting how many times the correlation in one group is greater than the correlation in the other group, to seemingly estimate an empirical p-value. The concern is that this approach might conflate the estimation of the correlation matrix with permutation testing, and might not compute a null distribution.</p><p>Comparison between functional connectivity (FC) analysis and ISFC: Comparing ISFC with FC to show the effectiveness of the novel method is very important, However, this comparison should be done while keeping all the statistical analyses comparable, similar to the approach of Simony et al., 2016.</p><p>In the present manuscript, the different methods used different statistical tests: t-test to compute significance in FC and a permutation testing in ISFC to evaluate differences between CPs and controls. It is unclear whether the usage of different statistical tests could lead to the differences across the two methods. A permutation testing approach in the analysis of FC could resolve this issue.</p><p>Additionally, for ISFC the time series of two runs were averaged and then the correlation matrix computed, whereas for FC correlation matrices were computed within each run, and then averaged. Consistency should be maintained (either averaging time series or computing correlation matrix individually for each run).</p><p>Brain-behavioral correlations: It would be interesting to link the topological changes to the severity of CP by conducting a correlation analysis between behavioral performance with topological measures, in which each point in the correlation is an individual subject. This approach could evaluate if the topological changes could predict behavioral performance in individual CPs. A similar analysis could also be conducted in normal groups.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Altered topology of neural circuits in congenital prosopagnosia&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by David Van Essen (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues listed by reviewers 2 and 3 that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. It is important to address these concerns incisively in the revised manuscript and in a point-by-point response in your cover letter.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have addressed my previous suggestions.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I'm glad to see my comments have been appropriately addressed, and the quality of the paper has been significantly improved. Importantly, the new correlation analysis between the ISFC edges and behavioral performance really provide us new insights on the neural mechanism of the CP. But on second thought I still have several concerns that the authors may want to address.</p><p>1) I do agree that ISFC is a powerful approach to detect the stimulus-locked inter-regional correlation patterns. But as the visual experiment in the current study is a blocked design rather than the continuous natural (or real life) stimulus design as that in Simony et al., 2016, I'm wondering if the ISFC were mainly driven by the 'box car' effect rather than stimulus-locked response. If so, maybe the authors need to remove the data from the rest periods before running ISFC.</p><p>2) The data from an independent localizer was used to define the nodes. It elegantly avoids the double dipping. But I'm still wondering if there are some biases because only the data from the controls were taken into account in defining the nodes. Will this choice bias some results (e.g., the face-specific dominance in controls' nodes)?</p><p>3) In the definition of edges using the standard FC, why the author normalized all correlation coefficients for each subject to remove the subject level global effects? Aren't the global effects our interests in comparing controls and CPs? And, why the authors didn't use the same strategy to normalize all correlation coefficients in the definition of edges using the ISFC?</p><p>4) As I pointed out in the last round of review that the top schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is somewhat misleading. The dash lines which connect the corresponding nodes in a pair of brains may mislead the readers into thinking that ISFC only calculates the functional correlation between corresponding nods across brain as inter-subject correlation (ISC) does. Nor do I catch what the top schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> exactly does express.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors addressed most of the comments in the first round of the review, however I believe that the manuscript can be improved further in clarity and in methodological rigor.</p><p>Definition of node strength. The authors abandoned the use of node degree in favor of weighted node degree, or node strength, by creating an undirected weighted graph, where the weights are t-values of correlations between pairs of ROIs. However, they used both negative and positive t-values at the same time to compute the strength of each node. As reported in the Appendix of the paper the authors cite (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010), the assumption of this metric is that all the weights are positive and normalized between 0 and 1. In this manuscript, weights are not all positive, and not normalized (although I believe this is less problematic). I'm not sure that it makes sense to consider both negative and positive weights at the same time. Imagine a node with only two incident edges, one with positive weight (say +10), and one with negative weight (-10). The strength of this node will be 0, but this doesn't correctly represent that the node is strongly correlated with another node only in the Control &gt; CP contrast, and strongly correlated with a different node only in CP &gt; Control. It is my understanding that in networks with negative weights one should analyze both sets of weights (positive and negative) separately.</p><p>Correlation between ISFC and behavior. I find that this analysis has several issues that need to be addressed. First, the authors used a one-tailed t-test, but this is generally considered too liberal without a clear a priori hypothesis on the directionality of the effect. It is even more problematic considering that with a two-tailed t-test, none of the results would be significant. In addition, even with a one-tailed t-test, the correlation between CFMT and ISFC values is not significant (even though the authors claim that it is: p = 0.053). Second, I find even more problematic the fact that the authors computed two different correlations and regressions, one for each group; looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> it is evident that if the two groups were considered together, the regression line would be flat or perhaps negative. This should be addressed by running a single multiple regression with a regressor variable indicating the group. Also, using z-scores as the x-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is confusing: there's no need to z-score the values prior to correlating them, and showing the actual questionnaire score will allow the reader to understand better how the participants score in those questionnaires. Lastly, what do the authors mean with &quot;raw ISFC value&quot;? Given the node by node ISFC matrix, does it refer to the average across one row of this matrix (perhaps taking only the upper triangular matrix if the ISFC matrix is symmetric)? And is the diagonal considered or removed prior to averaging, if the average is being computed?</p><p>Comparison between FC and ISFC. The authors improved the permutation testing approach for the ISFC, however they used an FDR corrected t-test with FC. The authors should consider implementing the permutation approach used in Simony et al., 2016, to make the two methods really comparable (i.e., differing only in the way correlations are computed), or justify why they chose these different statistical tests. In addition, ISFC correlations are still computed by averaging the time-series in the two runs first, whereas in FC first correlation matrices are computed, and then averaged. This should be made consistent in both analyses to make the comparison clearer.</p><p>In addition, it seems now that results from FC and ISFC converge. Then, why is ISFC needed at all? The authors should expand their discussion on this point. Also, correlations between edges and behavioral results should be performed also using FC-if not in the main text, they should be inserted in the supplementary materials to let readers understand the benefits/drawbacks of either methods when investigating similar questions.</p><p>Comparison between node strength and node location. Please provide more information on the stability of this result using different number of bins/bin sizes. How many bins had only one node? Also, for each bin, was the node strength computed as the sum of all the nodes belonging to that bin, or the average/median? The values in the y-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> seem too high to be averages, and this analysis suffers from the problem described above of putting together negative and positive weights: a better approach would be to divide negative and positive edges, and perform the same analysis.</p><p>Please provide units for both axes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>The legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> refers to controls as &quot;matched&quot;, but throughout the paper &quot;controls&quot; is used.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25069.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Conceptual</italic> </p><p><italic>The reviewers raised concerns about overlap with your prior 2014 Cerebral Cortex paper. Please clarify the conceptual advancement made by this study with respect to your prior work.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this important comment. Following the review process we feel that the distinction between the 2014 Cerebral Cortex had become clearer. Specifically, in contrast with the 2014 paper, in the current study, we utilized ISFC to investigate a large swath of visually related cortex in a relatively unbounded fashion. This led to the discovery of posterior hyper-connectivity in CP compared to control subjects. Furthermore, following the reviewers’ suggestions, we correlated the ISFC values with the measured behavioral measures and, we were pleased to discover that this analysis revealed a positive correlation with the two main behavioral markers of prosopagnosia. The anterior temporal hypo-connectivity together with the posterior hyperconnectivity and its correlation with behavior may explain individual differences between CP individuals.</p><p><italic>Another concern raised was that the comparison between normal controls and subgroups of CPs (mild and severe group) is non-independent from the comparison between normal controls and the entire group of CPs. Moreover, the results comparing the entire group of CPs and the different severity levels seems to be at odd with each other. The reviewer commented: &quot;The authors report that compared with controls, CPs showed decreased ISFC in the FFA tagged nodes, as well as increased ISFC in the LOC tagged nodes. However, in the comparison between severe CPs and mild CPs, they report compared with mild CPs, severe CPs showed decreased ISFC in the LOC tagged nodes, as well as increased ISFC in the FFA tagged nodes. The explanations in the discussion pertaining to the inconsistency between these findings is speculative.&quot;</italic> </p><p>The comparison of CP sub-groups employed in the previous version of the manuscript was used as a proxy for tapping into individual differences in CP. Following the reviewers’ helpful comments, we used a more powerful measure to compare directly the ISFC values with the individual behavioral measures. As noted above, we were able to discover a significant correlation between ISFC and behavioral performance. Hence, we think that the original division of CP to sub-groups had become redundant as well as too cumbersome, compared to the new analysis, and we have removed it from the current, new version.</p><p><italic>Data analysis</italic> </p><p><italic>Thresholding procedure: The reviewers raised concerns regarding the threshold used, and asked why only positive correlations were considered:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Throughout the paper different thresholds are mentioned, but no clear description or quantification of how these thresholds were computed is provided.

Note that this criterion practically dictates that in any comparison (Controls&gt;CPs and vice versa) there would be no edges which exhibits the opposite pattern of ISFC. Next, in our second analysis, we did not use any thresholding and examined the ISFC pattern by employing weighted graph measures, thereby, avoiding arbitrary thresholding decisions.

Specifically, to be able to correlate behavioral in the individual level, each subject must have an idiosyncratic neuronal measure. Hence, we modified the split-half ISFC analysis used in the original manuscript, to the correlation of one subject with the mean of the remaining subjects (as detailed in Simony et al., 2016). This procedure uncovered a significant correlation between the ISFC obtained from the CPs &gt; controls contrast and the behavioral performance on the diagnostic face task.

If so, maybe the authors need to remove the data from the rest periods before running ISFC.</italic> </p><p>We thank you for this important comment. The reviewer is correct that the current study utilizes a block design and that it is different from the &quot;real life&quot; experiment performed in Simony et al., 2016. We certainly agree with the reviewer that examining the potential contribution of rest periods to the ISFC response is of interest. However, after careful consideration of this issue and the potential implications of the design employed in the present study, we came to the conclusion that it is unlikely that an on/off signal could account for the present findings. Moreover, we are of the view that the current design is not suitable for such an analyses. Below, we lay out our response to this comment and to the potential effects of a block-design on our findings:</p><p>· It is important to note that the block design paradigm is identical in the two experimental groups (CP, controls) and critically, the differences obtained between the groups were selective and were observed only in high level visual regions. It is unlikely that these selective differences would be driven by an on/off effect. If that were the case, we might expect to find group differences in early visual cortex, which would be mostly affected by an ‘on/off’ visual stimulations, rather than in the ATL and the LOC. Additionally, these particular results confirmed our hypothesis that the ATL would exhibit reduced ISFC in CP compared with controls which was based on previous structural and functional studies (Avidan et al., 2014; Odegard et al., 2009; Steinbrink et al., 2008; Thomas et al., 2009). Finally, the ISFC in the vicinity of the LOC was correlated with behavior. For these reasons, it is unlikely that the differences are an artifact or a product of an on/off blocked stimulation. Rather, the more likely interpretation is that the findings stem from a real difference in the stimulus-driven signal between the experimental groups.</p><p>· Note that Simony et al., 2016 replicated their continuous ISFC analysis with a control block experimental design to test whether ISFC can be implemented in non-continuous paradigms (Supplementary figure 5 in their paper). Although their block design analysis included concatenated stimulus blocks, the signals also suffered from possible on-off transitions, as the boundaries between the stimulus and resting blocks were not removed. That they were able to replicate the key result with the blocked paradigm confirms that the ISFC is capable of capturing the stimulus driven signal and not the transitions between the blocks.</p><p>· In relation to the previous point, we agree that even when dismissing these observations, whether the differences between the experimental groups are driven by the blocked stimuli (or in other words, the presentation of sets of stimuli) or by the individual trials is certainly of interest, but it does not contradict our main claim that the obtained ISFC is selective in a group dependent fashion. We certainly plan to specifically address this issue in our future studies.</p><p>· It is also important to note that when we first considered the analytical procedures for this study, we actually considered the approach suggested by the reviewer and concluded that although deconstruction of the ISFC may be of interest, the current experimental design does not permit this kind of analysis. The &quot;resting&quot; blocks in the current experiment are only 6 seconds long (3 TRs). The HRF response is sluggish and variable across regions and individuals. This signal mainly consists of two parts – a positive signal change that peaks at approximately 4 to 6 seconds post stimulus onset and a post stimulus undershoot that peaks 6 to 10 seconds after the stimulus ends, but can last up to 30 seconds or more (Buxton, Uludağ, Dubowitz and Liu, 2004; Cohen, 1997; Frahm, Krüger, Merboldt and Kleinschmidt, 1996; Krüger, Kleinschmidt and Frahm, 1996; Mayer et al., 2014). Hence, the &quot;resting&quot; blocks in the current paradigm are not clean from the stimulus driven signal, and it is not obvious which time points from the &quot;resting&quot; blocks should be removed (and in fact the stimulus blocks may be &quot;contaminated&quot; by the &quot;rest&quot; signal and vice-versa).</p><p>Given these considerations, we think that the analysis suggested by the reviewer is not suitable for the specific design we employed and would potentially induce confounds. Nevertheless, we do agree that a paradigm involving continuous stimulus presentation may help to deconstruct the ISFC into inter-trial vs block related signal, as we have previously reported in a different context (Rosenthal, Sporns and Avidan, 2016). If the reviewer feels strongly about this point, we can certainly re-do the analysis with the &quot;resting blocks&quot; removed.</p><p><italic>2) The data from an independent localizer was used to define the nodes. It elegantly avoids the double dipping. But I'm still wondering if there are some biases because only the data from the controls were taken into account in defining the nodes. Will this choice bias some results (e.g., the face-specific dominance in controls' nodes)?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is correct that the definition of the nodes is independent from the current experiment and that the nodes are extracted from control participants. Nevertheless, in previous studies, we showed that the location, BOLD activation and overall spread of activation of the face patches in core face regions of the face network in CP, is not different from controls (Avidan et al., 2013; Avidan et al., 2005; Avidan and Behrmann, 2009; DeGutis, Bentin, Robertson and D’Esposito, 2007; Hasson et al., 2003). Hence, a difference in the definition of the ROIs is unlikely to drive the effects, and there is a benefit of using an independent node definition to avoid double dipping. Additionally, since this definition was done based on control data, we were able to use a larger group of participants to increase the reliability of the node definition. It was not feasible to recruit a comparable independent group of CPs on which only to define ROIs.</p><p><italic>3) In the definition of edges using the standard FC, why the author normalized all correlation coefficients for each subject to remove the subject level global effects? Aren't the global effects our interests in comparing controls and CPs? And, why the authors didn't use the same strategy to normalize all correlation coefficients in the definition of edges using the ISFC?</italic> </p><p>The focus of the current study was the application of the ISFC approach. In this approach, only signal that is synchronized across subjects is kept and this analysis revealed selective group dependent effects and did not reveal global effects (see SNR section). These findings thus imply that such global effects in the data are idiosyncratic and are not part of the critical, paradigm related signal. In contrast, subject level FC global effects may be induced by noise and intrinsic connectivity, which might mask the results and prevent a direct comparison with the ISFC. We therefore normalized the matrices to obtain the relative differences between the regions per subject and subsequently obtained the selective differences between the groups. This procedure actually allowed for a more direct comparison between the FC and ISFC analyses.</p><p><italic>4) As I pointed out in the last round of review that the top schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is somewhat misleading.

This should be addressed by running a single multiple regression with a regressor variable indicating the group.</italic> </p><p>Following the reviewer's comment and suggestions, we re-examined our data and models and this led to several modifications of the analysis. First, based on previous studies showing correlation between CFMT and the famous faces questionnaire (Furl, Garrido, Dolan, Driver and Duchaine, 2011) and some recent data from our own lab (Mardo, Hadad and Avidan, 2017 under review), we started off by examining whether the two behavioral measures are redundant and subsequently, whether there is a latent behavioral measure which can account for both. In accordance with these studies, we found a significant correlation between the CFMT and famous faces behavioral measures <italic>r</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>)=0.71, <italic>p</italic>=0.0003. Accordingly, the 2 measures were factorized using PCA (Furl et al., 2011), and the first principal component which accounted for 85.9% of the variance served as our new face recognition behavioral score. The correlation between the face recognition behavioral score was <italic>r</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) = 0.9, <italic>p&lt;0.0001</italic> and <italic>r</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) = 0.94, <italic>p&lt;0.0001</italic> for CFMT and famous faces questionnaire respectively.</p><p>Following the reviewer's suggestion a multivariate regression was conducted to examine if ISFC and group predicted the face recognition behavioral score. This was done for the significant ISFC edges obtained from both the CP&gt;Controls and the Controls&gt;CP contrasts. As for the CP&gt;controls contrast, overall a significant effect was found for both the group and the ISFC edge and the independent variables indeed explained a significant amount of the face recognition behavioral score <italic>(R<sup>2</sup> =0.83, R<sup>2</sup><sub>Adjusted</sub> =.81, F(2,17) = 42.67, p &lt; 0.0001).</italic> Moreover, the group significantly predicted face recognition behavioral score (β = -6.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), as did the ISFC value (β = 4.89, <italic>p</italic> =0.017). Hence, ISFC score was positively associated with behavioral face performance. When we conducted the same procedure but examining the edges obtained from the controls&gt;CPs contrast, the ISFC edge and the independent variables also explained a significant amount of the variance of the face recognition behavioral score <italic>(R<sup>2</sup> =0.77, R<sup>2</sup><sub>Adjusted</sub> = 0.74, F(2,17) = 29.19, p &lt; 0.0001).</italic> Nevertheless, only the group effect coefficient was significant (β = -5.23, p = 0.005), while the ISFC coefficient was not (β = -5.12, p = 0.44). Thus, indicating the lack of linear relation between the behavioral measure and ISFC in this contrast.</p><p>This analysis was added in subsection “Correlations of the significant edges with behavior” and we thank the reviewer for this comment. This has strengthened our conclusions.</p><p><italic>Also, using z-scores as the x-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is confusing: there's no need to z-score the values prior to correlating them, and showing the actual questionnaire score will allow the reader to understand better how the participants score in those questionnaires.</italic> </p><p>As we chose to use an aggregated measure for behavioral face recognition performance, this comment is no longer relevant. Accordingly, we have removed the correlation figure from the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Lastly, what do the authors mean with &quot;raw ISFC value&quot;? Given the node by node ISFC matrix, does it refer to the average across one row of this matrix (perhaps taking only the upper triangular matrix if the ISFC matrix is symmetric)? And is the diagonal considered or removed prior to averaging, if the average is being computed?</italic> </p><p>The raw ISFC is the value of the significant edges in the CP&gt;control or control&gt;CP contrasts which is indeed the average of the lower and upper triangle edges of the ISFC matrix. This is not the average of a row, but a single edge and hence, the diagonal is of no relevance.</p><p><italic>Comparison between FC and ISFC. The authors improved the permutation testing approach for the ISFC, however they used an FDR corrected t-test with FC. The authors should consider implementing the permutation approach used in Simony et al., 2016, to make the two methods really comparable (i.e., differing only in the way correlations are computed), or justify why they chose these different statistical tests.</italic> </p><p>In the current study, we had a specific hypothesis regarding the anterior temporal cortex hypo-connectivity and did not want to rely on a family-wise correction. The FDR procedure allowed us to test the edge-wise statistically significant difference between the groups.</p><p><italic>In addition, ISFC correlations are still computed by averaging the time-series in the two runs first, whereas in FC first correlation matrices are computed, and then averaged. This should be made consistent in both analyses to make the comparison clearer.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The time series in the two runs were first averaged and only then the FC correlation matrices were computed. This modification was made in the previous revision but was not properly described in the Materials and methods section. We now corrected this.</p><p><italic>In addition, it seems now that results from FC and ISFC converge. Then, why is ISFC needed at all? The authors should expand their discussion on this point. Also, correlations between edges and behavioral results should be performed also using FC-if not in the main text, they should be inserted in the supplementary materials to let readers understand the benefits/drawbacks of either methods when investigating similar questions.</italic> </p><p>We repeated the multiple regression analysis as described above. Specifically, we used the edges obtained from the FC as opposed to the ISFC and group independent variables to predict the face recognition behavioral score. This was done for the significant FC edges obtained from both the CP&gt;Controls and the Controls&gt;CP contrasts. The regression model with FC and the group independent variables explained a significant amount of the variance of the face recognition behavioral score for both CPs&gt;controls <italic>(R<sup>2</sup> =0.78, R<sup>2</sup><sub>Adjusted</sub> = 0.75, F(2,17) = 30.17, p &lt; 0.0001)</italic> and controls&gt;CPs <italic>(R<sup>2</sup> =0.78, R<sup>2</sup><sub>Adjusted</sub> = 0.75, F(2,17) =30.78, p &lt; 0.0001)</italic>. Nevertheless, for both the CPs&gt;Controls and Controls&gt;CPs only the group effect coefficient was significant (β = -4.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and (β = -5.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) respectively, while the FC coefficient was not (β =0.95, <italic>p</italic> = 0.31) and (β =1.34, <italic>p</italic> = 0.25) respectively. Thus, no direct link was found between the face recognition behavioral score and FC connectivity. A previous study has shown that the ISFC better captures momentary network configurations and better predicted behavioral performance (Simony et al., 2016).</p><p>Consistently with this study, in the context of the present study, only the ISFC, but not FC was shown to be related to the behavioral measure of face processing, and hence was able to elucidate an additional important aspect of the data</p><p>The analysis was added in subsection “Correlations of the significant edges with behavior”.</p><p><italic>Please provide units for both axes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</italic> </p><p><italic>The legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> refers to controls as &quot;matched&quot;, but throughout the paper &quot;controls&quot; is used.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for the comments, the figure was corrected accordingly.</p><p>References:</p><p>Barrat, A., Barthélemy, M., Pastor-Satorras, R., &amp; Vespignani, A.
