In eukaryotes the responsibility for chromosome segregation lies with a well-understood macromolecular machine, the mitotic spindle. In contrast, the mechanisms underlying bacterial chromosome segregation are much less understood mechanistically, but are just as critical for cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badrinarayanan et al., 2015</xref>). The starting point for bidirectional chromosomal replication, the origin (<italic>ori</italic>), has a crucial role in chromosome organisation and segregation. Not only is it duplicated and segregated first but its dynamic genomic position defines the position of other chromosomal regions with respect to the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duigou and Boccard, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Junier et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In new-born <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells growing under relatively slow growing conditions in which initiation of replication and its completion occur within a single cell generation, the ‘home’ position of the origin (henceforth and in the model, <italic>ori</italic>) is at mid-cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nielsen et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). After replication, and consequent 10–15 min of ‘cohesion’, arising at least in part from interlinking of the two daughter chromosomes (precatenation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicolas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nielsen et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nolivos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), duplicated origins migrate rapidly to opposite quarter positions, which become the new home positions for the remainder of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cass et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwada et al., 2013</xref>). Other genomic loci migrate sequentially with similar dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cass et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms that underlie <italic>ori</italic> positioning and direct newly replicated sisters to opposite cell halves remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badrinarayanan et al., 2015</xref>). This is particularly the case in <italic>E. coli</italic> and its relatives, which do not carry ParABS systems that facilitate the segregation of low copy plasmids and some other bacterial chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Livny et al., 2007</xref>). However, MukBEF, a functional homolog of ubiquitous Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nolivos and Sherratt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rybenkov et al., 2014</xref>), plays a role in <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome organisation-segregation. One of its functions is to recruit the type II topoisomerase Topo IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicolas et al., 2014</xref>), which is required for the timely removal of catenanes from newly replicated sister chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Under slow growth conditions, MukBEF forms a small number of dynamic clusters (visualised as fluorescent foci) located at the middle or quarter positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">den Blaauwen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ohsumi et al., 2001</xref>), in close association with <italic>ori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Danilova et al., 2007</xref>), and the splitting and movement of these foci occurs concurrently with the segregation of <italic>ori</italic>s to the quarter positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Danilova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicolas et al., 2014</xref>). Foci consist of on average 16 dimeric slowly-diffusing MukBEF complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012b</xref>). The colocalisation with <italic>ori</italic> is not required for either MukBEF foci formation or positioning: depletion of Topo IV results in cells with multiple catenated <italic>ori</italic>s forming a single focus at mid-cell but with multiple MukBEF clusters positioned throughout the nucleoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicolas et al., 2014</xref>). Thus MukBEF clusters are not necessarily assembled at or bound to <italic>ori</italic>, consistent with the lack of any sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nolivos et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, restoration of Topo IV activity leads to the decatenated <italic>ori</italic>s moving to the MukBEF clusters suggesting that MukBEF recruits or positions <italic>ori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicolas et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, depletion of functional MukBEF results in <italic>ori</italic> mis-positioning that is subsequently restored upon repletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012a</xref>).</p><p>If MukBEF clusters position <italic>ori</italic>s, what positions MukBEF clusters? Given that molecules in the clusters turnover continuously with a timescale of about one minute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012b</xref>) and that MukBEF binds DNA non-specifically, how does it even form clusters? We have proposed that a self-positioning stochastic Turing pattern can explain the positioning of MukBEF clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray and Sourjik, 2017</xref>) (see the methods section for a review). A Turing pattern is a spatial pattern in the concentration of a reactant in a reaction-diffusion system that arises spontaneously due to a diffusion-driven instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koch and Meinhardt, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Turing, 1952</xref>). Put simply, diffusion, rather than having a homogenising effect can actually, in combination with chemical reactions, create a spatially varying concentration profile. Such patterns are examples of self-organisation, a more general term that describes any dissipative non-equilibrium energy-dependent order that arises as a result of collective non-linear interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halley and Winkler, 2008</xref>). We used the Turing mechanism to explain the positioning of MukBEF foci and showed that a flux-balance mechanism and stochasticity work together to ensure that a specific Turing pattern is selected: short cells consistently have a single centre-positioned peak in the MukBEF concentration, while longer cells have quarter positioned peaks.</p><p>With this model in hand, we now investigate how MukBEF clusters could position chromosomal origins. In particular, we address whether the self-organising MukBEF gradient proposed in our model has the correct properties to act as an attracting gradient for <italic>ori</italic>. Additionally, it is critical that each newly replicated sister <italic>ori</italic> is recruited to a <italic>different</italic> MukBEF focus, a non-trivial requirement. We find that a self-organising MukBEF gradient can indeed accurately reproduce the observed <italic>ori</italic> dynamics, apparent diffusion constant and drift rate. A proposed preferential loading of MukBEF within <italic>ori</italic> introduces a non-trivial interaction between MukBEF foci and <italic>ori</italic>s that leads to accurate and stable partitioning as an emergent property of the system. Importantly, the model does not contain any actual directed force. MukBEF requires energy in the form of ATP to establish a self-organised gradient but it is not pulled to the middle or quarter positions by any active force. Similarly, the attraction of <italic>ori</italic> up the MukBEF gradient may be due to energetic considerations and the elastic nature of the chromosome (a DNA-relay) resulting on the macro scale in an effective (rectification) force and directed motion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Resul<bold>t</bold>s</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>o<italic>ri</italic> is attracted towards MukBEF foci</title><p>As discussed above, perturbative experiments support the hypothesis that MukBEF clusters position <italic>ori</italic>s in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicolas et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is unclear if this hypothesis is supported by the observed colocalisation of MukBEF clusters with <italic>ori</italic>s in unperturbed cells. It is possible that MukBEF clusters and <italic>ori</italic> could be positioned independently of one another as a result of the global organisation of the chromosome with the result that they show colocalisation but without their positions being correlated. To examine this possibility, we revisited the colocalisation of MukBEF clusters and <italic>ori</italic>s. We used only cells with a single <italic>ori</italic> focus, because, unlike cells with two <italic>ori</italic>s, they can be grouped together without scaling by simply aligning them according to their mid-cell positions and are more amenable to statistical analysis. To enrich for such cells, we treated a strain carrying fluorescently labelled MukB and <italic>ori</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) with DL serine hydroxamate (SHX). This structural analogue of serine triggers the stringent response thereby inhibiting DNA replication initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferullo et al., 2009</xref>). We then measured the position of fluorescent foci along the long axis of the cell as has been done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicolas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nolivos et al., 2016</xref>) and found very similar distributions for <italic>ori</italic> and MukB as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46564.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fluorescence microscopy indicates that <italic>ori</italic> and MukBEF are not positioned independently of one another.</title><p>A strain with FROS (LacI-mCherry) labelled <italic>ori</italic> and MukB-mYPet was treated with DL serine hydroxamate to obtain cells with a single non-replicating chromosome and imaged at 1 min intervals. (<bold>a</bold>) Overlay of phase contrast and fluorescence images showing three representative cells.

This latter distribution is obtained by randomly selecting pairs of positions from the two measured position distributions and calculating the distance between them. When we did this, we found that MukBEF foci and <italic>ori</italic> are much more colocalised than would be expected if they were positioned independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This was confirmed by the relatively strong positive correlation (r = 0.8) between MukBEF and <italic>ori</italic> positions (using a robust correlation based on the median absolute deviation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shevlyakov, 1997</xref>]). Importantly, the result was not due to treatment with SHX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p><p>If <italic>ori</italic> is indeed positioned by MukBEF, then we should be able to detect this in wild-type cells. In particular, we can measure the step-wise velocity of <italic>ori</italic> as a function of its position along the long axis of the cell. This ‘restoring’ velocity characterises the restoring force pulling <italic>ori</italic> back towards mid-cell. We can similarly determine the restoring velocity of <italic>ori</italic> towards MukBEF foci by measuring the step-wise velocity of <italic>ori</italic> as a function of position relative to the MukBEF focus. Comparing these two profiles, we found that <italic>ori</italic> experiences a greater restoring velocity towards the MukBEF focus than towards mid-cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This indicates that <italic>ori</italic> is not attracted to mid-cell per se, rather it is more likely attracted to the MukBEF focus, which happens to be positioned at mid-cell. Hence, together with previous results, these data strongly indicate that MukBEF positions <italic>ori</italic> in <italic>E. coli.</italic></p><p>We next asked whether the relationship is bi-directional i.e. is MukBEF positioning affected by <italic>ori</italic> positioning? When we examined the restoring velocity of MukBEF foci, we found that they displayed similar biases towards <italic>ori</italic> and mid-cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), suggesting that MukBEF foci are equally attracted to mid-cell and <italic>ori</italic> and that therefore the attraction between MukBEF and <italic>ori</italic> may be indeed be bi-directional. We will return to this result later.</p><p>The above results also confirm that <italic>ori</italic> has a special relationship with MukBEF compared to other genetic loci. This is supported by the observation that co-localisation with MukBEF is strongest for <italic>ori</italic> and becomes progressively weaker for <italic>ori</italic>-distant loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Danilova et al., 2007</xref>). What is the nature of this relationship? This has been an open question for many years, despite the application of tools such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nolivos et al., 2016</xref>) and single-molecule microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zawadzki et al., 2015</xref>). In the following, we take an abductive reasoning approach common in theoretical physics. We make a starting assumption or ansatz for the nature of the MukBEF-<italic>ori</italic> relationship in order to build a computational model of the system and take confirmation of model predictions as evidence in support of this ansatz. In particular, we propose that MukBEF is preferentially loaded onto the chromosome within the <italic>ori</italic> region. This is the case for SMC, a distant relative of MukBEF (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gruber, 2018</xref> for a review). In <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and other bacteria SMC is loaded onto the chromosome at <italic>parS</italic> sites by the protein ParB. While no analogue of ParB/<italic>parS</italic> has yet been discovered in <italic>E. coli</italic>, in the following we will focus on exploring the effect of preferential loading and examining whether it gives results that are consistent with experimental observations. We discuss other plausible scenarios in the discussion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Model of <italic>ori</italic> positioning by self-organised MukBEF reproduces mid-cell positioning</title><p>As a first step in building a model of <italic>ori</italic> positioning, we incorporated the <italic>ori</italic> into our previous stochastic model of MukBEF self-organisation and positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray and Sourjik, 2017</xref>), reviewed in the methods section and illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>. Briefly, MukBEF exists in three states corresponding to different conformations and associations with DNA, a well-mixed cytosolic fraction and two DNA-associated states. The differing diffusion constants and nonlinear interaction between the two latter states leads to the spontaneous formation of dynamic MukBEF foci (to be understood as regions of high density) via the Turing mechanism. The positions of these foci are determined by the balancing of fluxes originating from the well-mixed cytosolic state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The flux of molecules (number per second) reaching the MukBEF focus is proportional to the length of the nucleoid on each side since the flux of molecules arriving from the cytosol is proportional to these lengths. Thus, if the MukBEF focus is off-centre (in the case of a single focus), it experiences a differential in the incoming fluxes from either side, resulting in movement toward the equilibrium position (the centre). This flux-balance mechanism was first described in the context of plasmid positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ietswaart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murray and Howard, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sugawara and Kaneko, 2011</xref>) but is valid quite generally. Note that in this model, the chromosome is not modelled explicitly. While one could theoretically use a combined particle and polymer based approach, such simulations are not yet feasible. Rather, the action of condensins is typically implemented in polymer simulations implicitly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fudenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miermans and Broedersz, 2018</xref>). However, we are explicitly interested in the fact that MukBEF forms discrete positioned foci. We therefore take a protein-centric approach and model the chromosome implicitly but MukBEF explicitly.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46564.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>ori</italic> positioning by a self-organised protein gradient reproduces experimental results.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic showing the reactions of the previous MukBEF model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray and Sourjik, 2017</xref>) (see methods). Species <italic>w</italic> diffuses in the cytosol (red).

That is, the probability is higher that <italic>ori</italic> will move up the MukBEF gradient than down it. We perform the simulations in one dimension, representing the long axis of the cell, the dimension along which positioning and segregation occur. This is justified as both <italic>ori</italic> and MukB are confined within the transverse direction to the centre region of the cell: 95% of foci are within the centre 40% (300 nm) of the cell width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d–g</xref>). MukBEF is also a very large molecule complex, with the arc length from its hinge domain to either of its two head domains being about 70 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matoba et al., 2005</xref>). This suggests it can be treated as operating on a coarser level than individual strands of DNA. However the primary reason is due to an inherent limitation of the Reaction Diffusion Master Equation method for non-linear reactions. Every voxel (compartment) must be well-mixed and this condition is violated by non-linear reactions at small voxel volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isaacson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Isaacson and Peskin, 2006</xref>). While this can be overcome for bimolecular reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erban and Chapman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hellander and Petzold, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Isaacson, 2013</xref>), there is currently no such remedy for tri-molecular reactions, as present in our (and most) Turing models. As a quantification of the resulting artefacts, we measured the mean total number of species <italic>v</italic> as a function of compartment size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). While the mean number is stable in one dimension, it decreases rapidly in two and three dimensions as the compartment size is decreased. One might hope for a range of compartment sizes, small enough to realise the geometry but large enough to avoid small compartment-size effects. However, no such range exists. We will therefore confine our stochastic simulations to one dimension. However, as we shall show, this limitation does not prevent us from explaining the observed experimental behaviour and making falsifiable predictions.</p><p>We take initially the case of short cells (2.5 µm) with a single <italic>ori</italic>. For the moment, we do not implement the effect of preferential loading at <italic>ori</italic> on MukBEF dynamics. We found, as expected, that <italic>ori</italic> tracks the self-organised MukBEF focus, resulting in mid-cell positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). To more carefully examine the directed movement of <italic>ori</italic>, we measured the <italic>ori</italic> velocity as a function of position as we did previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Given the self-organising and fluctuating nature of the MukBEF gradient in our model (which is representative of the in vivo behaviour), it was not obvious that the model would reproduce the observed relationship. However, we indeed found a similarly linear velocity profile. Furthermore, quantitative comparison of our simulations with the experimental data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwada et al. (2013)</xref> was carried out by fitting the data in the mid-cell region to a theoretical model of diffusion in a harmonic potential, thereby obtaining an apparent diffusion constant and drift rate. We found that by adjusting only two parameters, the <italic>ori</italic> diffusion constant and drift parameter, we were able to obtain good agreement with the values obtained from the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3b</xref>). However, the resultant position distribution did exhibit somewhat fatter tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>).</p><p>This fitting of the experimental data also allows us to estimate the spring-like force on the <italic>ori</italic>. At a distance <italic>x</italic> from mid-cell, the force is given by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>f</italic> is obtained from the slope and variance of the velocity profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3b</xref>). At 0.2 µm from mid-cell this gives a restoring force of 0.02 pN, similar to the value measured in an in vitro reconstitution of a plasmid partitioning ParABS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vecchiarelli et al., 2014</xref>). Note that the data in Kuwada et al. are from growing cells and we use them rather than our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for consistency with later simulations that incorporate growth.</p><p>In the previous simulations <italic>ori</italic> moves up the MukBEF gradient but has no effect on the MukBEF gradient itself as we have not yet implemented that MukBEF is preferentially loaded onto the DNA within the <italic>ori</italic> region. In previous work, we showed that preferential loading at a fixed spatial location perturbs the positioning of the self-organised MukBEF foci due to the modified flux differential across foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray and Sourjik, 2017</xref>). In the case of a single MukBEF focus, the equilibrium position is no longer at mid-cell but somewhere between mid-cell and the location of preferential loading, depending on the strength of the loading. Thus the presence of a preferential loading site in the <italic>ori</italic> should lead to an effective mutual attraction between <italic>ori</italic> and MukBEF foci i.e. <italic>ori</italic> is attracted up the MukBEF gradient, while at the same time the’ home’ position of the MukBEF focus is shifted towards <italic>ori</italic>. We expected this to increase the association between the two and reinforce mid-cell positioning.</p><p>We added preferential loading into the simulations by increasing the loading rate of MukBEF in the compartment containing the <italic>ori</italic> relative to the other compartments while keeping the overall loading rate unchanged. This was observed to have a suppressive effect on noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a</xref>). At intermediate levels of preferential loading, the positions of both MukBEF and <italic>ori</italic> deviate less from mid-cell. Looking at individual simulations we could see that <italic>ori</italic> rarely escapes the MukBEF focus, rather the focus tracks <italic>ori</italic> and brings it back to the middle position. As a result <italic>ori</italic> only rarely undergoes diffusive excursions away from MukBEF and its home position as were observed without preferential loading. The reduction in the variance of the position distributions was reversed at higher loading ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a</xref>). We also found that preferential loading resulted in stronger colocalisation of <italic>ori</italic> with the MukBEF focus and this led to excellent agreement with previous measurements of their separation distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4b</xref>). Note that this experimental data was not used to constrain the model and this agreement thus constitutes confirmation of a model prediction and support for preferential loading.</p><p>We next examined if the simulations could reproduce the observed experimental velocity profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>). We found that <italic>ori</italic> shows a stronger restoring velocity towards MukBEF than mid-cell and this was independent of the level of preferential loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5d–f</xref>). The restoring velocity to mid-cell is non-zero due to the fact that MukBEF fluctuates around mid-cell. These results were to be expected as the biased motion of <italic>ori</italic> up the MukBEF gradient is explicitly included in the simulations. What was less clear was how the MukBEF focus would behave. We found that without preferential loading MukBEF displays a stronger restoring velocity towards mid-cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5g</xref>) consistent with its positioning by the flux-balance mechanism. At high loading however, it shows a stronger bias towards <italic>ori</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5i</xref>) consistent with the previous observation that the attraction to <italic>ori</italic> dominates, while at intermediate levels (6x) we found a very similar restoring velocity to both <italic>ori</italic> and mid-cell as was observed in the corresponding experimental profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). This is also the same level of preferential loading that leads to the most robust positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a</xref>). Thus, an intermediate level of preferential loading appears to be most consistent with experimental observations.</p><p>Given that preferential loading was found to have an effect on the apparent diffusion constant and drift rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4c</xref>), we needed to refit the model to the experimental <italic>ori</italic> velocity data. To do so we chose a particular value for preferential loading ratio, the one that minimised the variance, 6x (this choice will be justified in the section). We were able to find new values for the diffusion and drift parameters that lead to excellent agreement with the experimental values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Furthermore, the resulting distribution of the <italic>ori</italic> positions showed better agreement with the experimental distribution, with the fat tails observed in the absence of preferential loading no longer present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Preferential loading leads to stable and accurate partitioning</title><p>While promising, the above results are not sufficient to suggest that MukBEF can explain the in vivo behaviour of <italic>ori</italic>. The challenge arises after <italic>ori</italic> has been replicated. A true partitioning mechanism must ensure that each replicated <italic>ori</italic> is maintained at a <italic>different</italic> quarter position. A simple gradient based mechanism cannot, a priori, satisfy this requirement as both <italic>ori</italic>s could just as easily move towards the same quarter position. Furthermore, the experimental data suggests that once <italic>ori</italic>s separate they do not subsequently interchange their positions (cross paths). This ordering is essential during multi-fork replication, where the multiple <italic>ori</italic>s of each segregated chromosome must be positioned to the appropriate cell half to avoid guillotining the chromosome upon cell division.To examine if the model is capable of accurate and ordered partitioning, we performed simulations with two <italic>ori</italic>s in longer cells of 5 µm, in which MukBEF self-organises into, on average, two foci, one at each quarter position. With or without preferential loading, the average profile of <italic>ori</italic> positions displayed two peaks centred on the quarter positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, blue line). However, we found that without preferential loading approximately half of the individual simulations have both <italic>ori</italic>s near the same quarter position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), clearly indicating that partitioning was not accurate. This was the case even though the simulations were initialised with <italic>ori</italic>s at opposite quarter positions. Evidently, a model of <italic>ori</italic> simply moving up the MukBEF gradient is not sufficient to explain partitioning as the noise inherent to the system means that it can switch stochastically between partitioned and un-partitioned states.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46564.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Preferential loading of MukBEF at <italic>ori</italic> leads to correct and stable partitioning.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Example simulated kymograph showing two <italic>ori</italic> (white lines) diffusing around the same MukBEF peak (colour scale). This occurs approximately 50% of the time.

A preferential loading ratio greater than six (i.e. six times more loading than elsewhere) was sufficient to ensure that one and only one <italic>ori</italic> was positioned to each quarter position and they do not interchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). These simulations had <italic>ori</italic>s initialized at opposite quarter positions (so as to investigate the intrinsic stability of that configuration). However, the bias of the system towards the desirable quarter-positioned configuration was present when both <italic>ori</italic>s were initialized at mid-cell or at random positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>). While configurations with both <italic>ori</italic>s associated to the same MukBEF peak occurred more frequently under these conditions, in the presence of sufficient preferential loading the system eventually and irreversibly transitions to the quarter positioned configuration.</p><p>As previously observed in simulations of short cells, we found that preferential loading results in stronger colocalisation of <italic>ori</italic>s with MukBEF foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>) and has a suppressive effect on noise at intermediate ratios with MukBEF foci and <italic>ori</italic> deviating less from the quarter positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). However, partitioning accuracy remained robust even at high preferential loading ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Looking at individual simulations, we observed that the nature of the variance was different. While the number of foci is maintained accurately at two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>) and the foci are tightly associated to each <italic>ori</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>) they are together more mobile than at intermediate ratios. Effectively, the MukBEF clusters begin to follow <italic>ori</italic>, rather than the other way around.</p><p>These results demonstrate that preferential loading of MukBEF changes the stability of the different steady states of the system. In its absence, the desirable (<italic>ori</italic> associated to opposite quarter-positioned MukBEF peaks) and undesirable (both <italic>ori</italic>s associated to the same MukBEF peak) configurations have equal likelihood, as measured by partitioning accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>), and the system can stochastically jump from one state to the other. As preferential loading is increased, the desirable configuration becomes more stable until the system is found almost exclusively in that state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Accurate partitioning during growth</title><p>The previous simulations were of non-growing cells and of long duration. While, they were useful to examine the intrinsic stability of the different states in order to understand why <italic>ori</italic>s <italic>remain</italic> partitioned, they do not demonstrate that our model can explain how <italic>ori</italic>s <italic>become</italic> partitioned within the timescale and setting of a growing cell. We therefore incorporated exponential growth and <italic>ori</italic> replication into our simulations. The former was implemented by randomly adding a new spatial compartment after every time interval corresponding to growth by one compartment length (0.1 µm). The <italic>ori</italic> was duplicated at a randomly chosen time-point obtained from an experimentally derived distribution (the mean time of duplication was 40 min into the cell cycle). After duplication, the compartment that previously contained a single <italic>ori,</italic> then contains two <italic>ori</italic>s, which are free to move independently of each other (but dependent on the local MukBEF concentration).</p><p>We first examined growth in the absence of preferential loading. Similarly to what we observed previously in the simulations of non-growing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), we found that duplicated <italic>ori</italic>s often remained associated to the same MukBEF focus, resulting in a partitioning accuracy (defined as before as the fraction of simulations with <italic>ori</italic>s in opposite cell halves) of only 25% by the end of the cell cycle (120 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). When we introduced preferential loading at <italic>ori</italic>, we found firstly that it delayed the splitting of MukBEF foci, similar to a spatially fixed loading site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray and Sourjik, 2017</xref>). The feedback from <italic>ori</italic> to MukBEF, nonetheless resulted in somewhat improved (39%) partitioning. The effect was similar to what we observed in the simulations of non-growing cells. Preferential loading promotes partitioning (and colocalisation) but sufficient time is required for the system to stochastically jump out of the undesirable configuration. But once it does the quarter positioned configuration is stable and does not revert back. The long runtime of the previous simulations meant the system had sufficient time to transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>) but this is not the case here.</p><p>Clearly, this level of partitioning accuracy is not representative of the biological situation, where ~ 95% of cells have partitioned <italic>ori</italic> already 20 min after initial separation, with <italic>ori</italic>s being separated at that point by an average distance of 33% of the cell length. We wondered whether the poor partitioning observed in the simulations could be overcome by the introduction of polymeric effects. Entropic repulsion is believed to play a role in chromosome segregation and organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jun and Mulder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jun and Wright, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Minina and Arnold, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Youngren et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, newly replicated <italic>ori</italic>s would experience the entropic repulsion of two closed loops. This is consistent with experimental observations, in which duplicated <italic>ori</italic>s (and indeed all loci) experience an initially large segregation velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cass et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lampo et al., 2015</xref>). Numerical studies have demonstrated that the effective potential associated with such a repulsion has the approximate form of a (half) Gaussian in the centre-of-mass separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bohn and Heermann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohn and Heermann, 2010a</xref>). We therefore incorporated entropic repulsion into the simulations by adding a repulsive force between <italic>ori</italic>s specified by such a potential. Important to note is that this force is short-range and therefore, with a small enough value for the range, it does not affect the desirable quarter-positioned configuration but rather acts to destabilise the undesirable configuration having both <italic>ori</italic>s associated to the same MukBEF focus.</p><p>This introduced two unknown parameters, the depth of the potential and its range. We performed a sweep over these parameters and measured the partitioning accuracy 20 min after <italic>ori</italic> duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that entropic repulsion on its own (i.e. no preferential loading) was not able to reproduce the observed behaviour. Increasing the range of the repulsion to 400 nm, which is likely unphysical, did lead to accurate partitioning but at the cost of <italic>ori</italic>s that were too far separated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), especially immediately after duplication. Furthermore, as we observed previously, without preferential loading the <italic>ori</italic> can escape from the MukBEF peaks resulting in weaker colocalisation, as well as there being significant noise in the both the number and position of MukBEF peaks. Repulsion does not change these effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). As already noted, preferential loading on its own was also insufficient for accurate partitioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, combining preferential loading with short-range entropic repulsion of <italic>ori</italic>, gave the properties of both and allowed the model output to move much closer to the measured partitioning accuracy and relative separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and resulted in kymographs with the experimentally observed behaviours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–d</xref>). The short-range entropic repulsion destabilises the undesirable configuration so that system switches, in a timely manner, to the quarter positioned configuration. As we saw for non-growing cells, preferential loading stabilises this configuration, keeping <italic>ori</italic> in close association with their corresponding quarter-positioned MukBEF peak, thereby preventing both diffusive excursions and any attempts to return to the undesirable configuration.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46564.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Repulsion between newly replicated <italic>ori</italic> results in realistic simulations of growing cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) and (<bold>b</bold>) Two example kymographs from individual simulations during exponential growth (doubling time of 120 min) in the presence of a repulsive force between <italic>ori. </italic>Shown is the number of MukBEF molecules (colour scale) overlayed with the <italic>ori</italic> position (while lines).

How could such an attraction arise? It has previously been argued in the DNA relay and Brownian ratchet models of partition complex positioning by the ParABS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Surovtsev et al., 2016</xref>) that the elastic nature of the chromosome itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wiggins et al., 2010</xref>) can be harnessed to power directed motion of partitioning complexes. The elastic fluctuations of the chromosome allow partitioning complexes to detect local differences in ParA-ATP, a protein that tethers them non-specifically to the nucleoid. The result is that complexes move in the direction of greatest ParA-ATP concentration. However, this idea has never been tested polymerically. This is critical for migrating <italic>ori</italic>, since, unlike plasmids, the <italic>ori</italic> would experience an entropic counter force due to the polymeric nature of the chromosome. Nevertheless, we wondered whether a similar mechanism might underlie the biased movement of <italic>ori</italic> towards MukBEF foci.</p><p>In particular, we wondered whether directed movement of <italic>ori</italic> can arise due to the DNA bridging activity of MukBEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Petrushenko et al., 2010</xref>). It has recently been demonstrated in vivo that MukBEF promotes long-range DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>). Given the association between MukBEF and <italic>ori</italic>, it is plausible that MukBEF preferentially forms DNA contacts involving the <italic>ori</italic> region. As such contacts would reduce the mobility of the DNA polymer, we would expect that <italic>ori</italic> would colocalise with MukBEF foci. To study this possibility, we turned to polymer simulations. We modelled the chromosome as a self-avoiding ring polymer confined in a rectangular cuboid and used the dynamic loop model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohn and Heermann, 2010b</xref>) to mimic the formation of DNA loops (bridges) between <italic>ori</italic> (a specific monomer of polymer chain) and distant DNA sites (other monomers) (see methods for details). As it is not computationally feasible to explicitly include the reaction-diffusion dynamics of MukBEF into the polymer simulations, we instead incorporated MukBEF implicitly via a spatially dependent looping probability along the long axis of the cuboid (nucleoid) representing the MukBEF concentration profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). We found that this resulted in the <italic>ori</italic> being positioned to the middle of the nucleoid, where the looping probability was greatest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, blue line). This was in contrast to the uniform position distribution observed when a uniform looping probability was applied (red line).

When we examined the velocity of the <italic>ori</italic> as a function of the long-axis position, we found that the <italic>ori</italic> indeed experiences a restoring velocity towards mid-cell i.e. directed movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). We envisage this working as follows. On a short timescale, the <italic>ori</italic> fluctuates about its current ‘home’ position. This allows it to locally sample the spatially-varying looping probability. It is then most likely to form a loop with another monomer in the direction in which the looping probability is greatest i.e. the direction of greatest MukBEF. The polymer subsequently relaxes, the <italic>ori</italic> is released to a new ‘home’ position and the cycle repeats. In this way, elastic fluctuations of the polymer power the movement of <italic>ori</italic> up the gradient in the looping probability. Thus, directed movement of <italic>ori</italic> up the MukBEF gradient can plausibly arise due to a MukBEF-mediated, spatially-varying looping probability.</p><p>Finally, we examined how spatially-dependent looping affects chromosome segregation and the quarter positioning of duplicated <italic>ori</italic>s. We simulated two chromosomes, initially overlapping with their <italic>ori</italic>s at mid-cell, in the presence of a bi-modal looping probability distribution (with a peak at each quarter position). In the absence of looping, entropic repulsion ensures that the <italic>ori</italic>s, along with the chromosomes themselves, are segregated (through not positioned) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jun and Wright, 2010</xref>). However, we expected that looping of <italic>ori</italic>s at the quarter positions would accelerate this separation. Indeed, we found this to be the case. Looping had a positive effect on <italic>ori</italic> segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>): the greater the looping, the faster <italic>ori</italic> were segregated. Furthermore, the <italic>ori</italic> are not just segregated but are positioned by the spatially varying looping probability to opposite quarter positions along the long axis of the cell in the same way as for the single chromosome case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Similarly, we found that the <italic>ori</italic>s experience an effective restoring force around their respective quarter positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The strength of this attraction (the slope of curve) increased with the frequency of looping. Note that unlike our stochastic simulations, we do not need to add repulsion between duplicated <italic>ori</italic>s <italic>–</italic> entropic repulsion is a natural consequence of the polymer dynamics. Overall, these results indicate that a spatially-varying probability for <italic>ori</italic> to forms loops with other DNA (nominally due to the localised action of MukBEF) leads, in the manner of a DNA relay, to directed movement of <italic>ori</italic>s to the locations where the probability is greatest, i.e. to the locations of MukBEF foci and, furthermore, that this can accelerate <italic>ori</italic> segregation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we have presented a quantitative explanation for positioning of the chromosomal origin of replication in <italic>E. coli</italic>. By analysing the positioning and dynamics of <italic>ori</italic> and MukBEF foci in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we first showed that <italic>ori</italic> are attracted towards MukBEF foci, as has been previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicolas et al., 2014</xref>). We have recently argued that the positioning of MukBEF foci can be explained by a stochastic Turing and flux-balance mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray and Sourjik, 2017</xref>). Here, we incorporated <italic>ori</italic> and its interaction with MukBEF into this model and showed how self-organised MukBEF can position origins to their observed mid-cell and quarter-cell positions.</p><p>To formulate the model, we needed to specify a particular ansatz for the nature of MukBEF-<italic>ori</italic> relationship. Motivated by SMC in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gruber, 2018</xref>) and our previous computational results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray and Sourjik, 2017</xref>), we assumed that MukBEF is preferentially loaded onto the DNA at sites within the <italic>ori</italic>. We found that the resultant feedback from <italic>ori</italic> to MukBEF led to robust <italic>ori</italic> partitioning. Preferential loading stabilises the desirable quarter-positioned configuration, preventing stochastic switching to the undesirable configuration having both <italic>ori</italic>s associated to the same MukBEF focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). We describe in more detail how this occurs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. In essence, preferential loading leads to a non-trivial mutual attraction between MukBEF and <italic>ori</italic> that results in robust association, positioning and partitioning of <italic>ori</italic>s as an emergent property. We determined the <italic>ori</italic> drift and diffusion rates by fitting to the experimental <italic>ori</italic> velocity profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). This also lead to excellent agreement with other experimental measurements that were not used in the fitting, namely the distributions of <italic>ori</italic> positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) and the MukBEF-<italic>ori</italic> separation distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4b</xref>), thereby providing further quantitative support for the model. Additionally, we found evidence of the mutual attraction between MukBEF foci and <italic>ori.</italic> MukBEF foci were found to be attracted to <italic>ori</italic> to a similar degree as their attraction to mid-cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), consistent with what we observed in our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46564.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Preferential loading and entropic repulsion together lead to the observed <italic>ori</italic> dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic illustrating the effect of preferential loading of MukBEF at <italic>ori</italic> in the simulations of non-growing cells.

With spatially homogeneous loading of the well-mixed state onto the nucleoid, the fluxes balance, in the case of a single focus, at the mid-cell position (i). An object (the <italic>ori</italic>) that is attracted up the resulting gradient will also be positioned at mid-cell. However, if loading is not homogeneous, then the position at which the fluxes balance changes (ii). If higher loading occurs at the <italic>ori</italic>, then the mutual attraction between the self-organised MukBEF focus and the <italic>ori</italic> results in the suppression of fluctuations, strong colocalisation and positioning at mid-cell (iii). The system is analogous to a compound spring with the fixed end at mid-cell (but with a non-trivial relationship between the spring constants and preferential loading ratio). At high levels of preferential loading, colocalised MukBEF-<italic>ori</italic> becomes less sensitive to the (decreased) incoming flux from other regions, and is therefore less attracted towards mid-cell, resulting in more diffusive behaviour and a broader position distribution. (<bold>b</bold>) Suppose both <italic>ori</italic> have been pulled towards the same MukBEF focus. Due to the flux imbalance, the MukBEF focus without an <italic>ori</italic> will be effectively pulled towards the other one (i) until the fluxes balance (ii). The stochastic nature of <italic>ori</italic> and MukBEF movement means that at some point one <italic>ori</italic> leaves the influence of its MukBEF focus and becomes associated to the other focus (iii). This is aided by the fact that the two MukBEF foci repulse each other so that the first MukBEF focus is prevented from following the <italic>ori</italic>. After the <italic>ori</italic> associates to the other MukBEF focus, the balance of fluxes is again disturbed and MukBEF-<italic>ori</italic> move as single units towards opposite quarter positions (iv). Due the strong association and reduced spatial fluctuations caused by preferential loading, this is the stable configuration and the system does not revert back to (i).

This required adding entropic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jun and Wright, 2010</xref>) to the model. Preferential loading and short-range entropic repulsion are individually not sufficient for both timely and accurate segregation and positioning. However, combined, they give very good agreement with the observed dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The repulsion between newly duplicated <italic>ori</italic>s is needed to push the system out of the undesirable configuration immediately after <italic>ori</italic> duplication but is not required for the existence, stability or high colocalisation of the desirable quarter-positioned state (as was seen in simulations of long cells without repulsion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). These properties are the result of preferential loading and the mutual interaction between <italic>ori</italic>s and self-organising MukBEF foci.</p><p>Supported by our experimental results, the model assumes that <italic>ori</italic> moves up the MukBEF gradient. What is the physics underlying this biased movement? Since MukBEF can bridge distant regions of the chromosome, it is conceivable that the MukBEF-<italic>ori</italic> relationship, however it is mediated, leads to a higher probability for MukBEF to form bridges between <italic>ori</italic> and other regions of DNA than for other genetic loci. Using polymer simulations, we showed that, combined with the elastic fluctuations of DNA, this can result in directed movement of <italic>ori</italic> up the self-organised MukBEF gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), similar to the DNA relay model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Surovtsev et al., 2016</xref>) proposed for ParABS-based positioning. However, the situation here is different in that the protein gradient is not generated entirely by the <italic>ori</italic> itself (partition complex in the case of ParABS). In this sense, it is similar to the proposed bulk segregation of chromosomes by membrane-based protein gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di Ventura et al., 2013</xref>). The proposed mechanism leads to directed movement of <italic>ori</italic>s to the positions of greatest looping (bridging) probability - the middle or quarter-cell positions according to the distribution of MukBEF, as well as accelerated entropic segregation of duplicated <italic>ori</italic>.</p><p>It is interesting to compare our results to a previous study of how macro-domain formation and positioning affect chromosome organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Junier et al., 2014</xref>). It was found that a macrodomain formed by spatially <italic>independent</italic> condensation of the <italic>ori</italic> region led to it being pushed to the poles of the cell. The authors therefore needed to additionally impose the mid-cell localisation of the <italic>ori</italic> macrodomain. In our case, the mid-cell location is marked by MukBEF and the increased looping that it induces suffices to keep the <italic>ori</italic> region at that location. Since MukBEF foci are self-positioned (as explained by our stochastic model), no external determinants of location are imposed.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Predictions</title><p>Our model assumes that MukBEF is loaded onto the chromosome at positions within the <italic>ori</italic> region. However, there are other plausible hypotheses for the MukBEF-<italic>ori</italic> relationship. In general, we expect that any relationship that induces a mutual attraction between MukBEF foci and <italic>ori</italic> would result in similar dynamics. Indeed, initial simulations have indicated one possibility is that the <italic>ori</italic> region acts as a ‘stop’ site for translocating MukBEF complexes. Therefore, the fundamental prediction of our model is not necessarily that MukBEF is loaded at sites within the <italic>ori</italic> region, as for SMC, but rather that whatever the nature of the MukBEF-<italic>ori</italic> relationship, it is such that it leads to an effective mutual attraction between <italic>ori</italic> and MukBEF foci.</p><p>In any case, the specificity of <italic>ori</italic> must be specified, directly or indirectly, by some sequence (or sequences) within the <italic>ori</italic> region. We know that the actual site of replication initiation, <italic>oriC</italic>, is not responsible because moving it to another location on the chromosome does not affect <italic>ori</italic> positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). If this unknown ‘centromeric’ sequence were inserted into a plasmid lacking a partitioning system, then we would predict that the resulting plasmids would colocalise with MukBEF foci just like the <italic>ori</italic>, and thereby be maintained in the absence of their own partitioning system. However, the challenge lies in identifying the centromeric site as it may be some distance (tens of kb) from <italic>oriC</italic> as is the case for the <italic>parS</italic> sites in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</p><p>The focus of this work was on <italic>ori</italic> positioning in slow-growing cells. However, an important question and one about which has received comparably little attention, is how <italic>ori</italic> are positioned during faster growth in which cells have multiple replication forks. Youngren et al. have examined the positioning of several genetic loci for the case of four replication forks, i.e. two to four <italic>ori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Youngren et al., 2014</xref>). They found that cells are born with two quarter positioned <italic>ori</italic>, that after replication, move to the quarter positions of each cell half. While polymeric effects and bulk chromosome segregation likely play an important role in this behaviour, we nonetheless wondered whether our simplified model could recapitulate these results. Taking into account the higher copy number of MukBEF in faster growing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2014</xref>), we found very consistent <italic>ori</italic> dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). At birth, the two <italic>ori</italic> are quarter positioned, while after replication they migrate to the quarter positions of each cell half. Similar to the slow growth case, we observed that <italic>ori</italic> and MukBEF remain in tight association and MukBEF splitting is coincident with <italic>ori</italic> separation, so that there are approximately as many MukBEF foci as <italic>ori</italic>. This behaviour requires the aforementioned higher copy number. Without it, the number of MukBEF is not substantially different from the slow-growing case and hence correct positioning was not observed. These predictions could be tested in the future by examining MukBEF in these cells as well as the effect of modulating MukBEF expression on the number of foci and on <italic>ori</italic> positioning.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46564.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The model qualitatively reproduces the observed <italic>ori</italic> dynamics during multi-fork replication.</title><p>An example kymograph showing multi-fork replication.

Nevertheless the depth of the comparison is beyond what has been achieved previously for origin positioning in other bacterial systems. Hence, we suggest that this approach warrants further consideration and that protein self-organisation may have an unappreciated role in chromosome organisation.</p><p>More generally, the idea of dynamically controlling the positioning and splitting of a Turing pattern is interesting from a mathematical point of view and may be applicable to other unrelated systems. Indeed, a major aspect of the ‘robustness problem’ of Turing patterning is the sensitivity of splitting to model parameters, domain size and stochastic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maini et al., 2012</xref>). The non-trivial coupling to <italic>ori</italic> in our model, as well as the self-positioning nature of the pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray and Sourjik, 2017</xref>), goes some way towards mitigating this sensitivity.</p><p>As noted earlier, the cubic reaction present in our model leads to a compartment-size effect in dimensions higher than one. One way to overcome this limitation would be to use particle-based simulation methods, which have recently been extended to higher order reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flegg, 2016</xref>). However, this would likely involve a substantial increase in computation time, which would make it more challenging to perform multiple runs and parameter sweeps like we have done here. It may rather be possible to reformulate the model in terms of only bimolecular reactions. This would not only be more chemically realistic only but would also allow for higher-dimension lattice based simulations.</p><p>For future work, combining particle and polymer simulations, at least to whatever extent is feasible, may provide a deeper understanding of the system. In particular, MukBEF has a major role in chromosome organisation and facilitates long-range DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>). Like other SMC complexes, MukBEF may act by extruding loops of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>), and/or be involved in stabilising them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, MatP, which binds to <italic>matS</italic> sites in the replication terminus region, interacts with MukBEF, displacing it from that region of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nolivos et al., 2016</xref>) and thereby restricting long-range DNA interactions between the terminus region and other regions of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>). Both effects may help position this region at mid-cell, while simultaneously encouraging the co-localisation of <italic>ori</italic> with MukBEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nolivos et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the role of MatP may need to be incorporated into future models. Lastly, with sufficient computing power, a fitting over more model parameters should be possible and may allow the quantitative evaluation of different hypotheses for the MukBEF-<italic>ori</italic> interaction. Overall, we envisage that the study of protein self-organisation in the context of chromosome dynamics has a promising future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Review of the model</title><p>We briefly summarise the underlying model for MukBEF self-organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray and Sourjik, 2017</xref>). The general model scheme consists of three ‘species’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Species <italic>u</italic> and <italic>v</italic> exist on the surface (the nucleoid), while species <italic>w</italic> exists in the bulk (the cytosol). Species <italic>v</italic> diffuses slower than <italic>u</italic>. In the context of MukBEF, <italic>v</italic> is the basic functional complex, the ATP-bound dimer of dimer, in a state in which it has entrapped multiple strands of DNA and is therefore relatively immobile. Species <italic>u</italic> represents the dimer of dimers in state in which it is non-specifically associated to DNA but without being immobilised e.g. it has not entrapped any DNA strands. These two species interconvert with the latter becoming the former at a basal rate α and cooperatively at a rate β, while the former becomes the latter at a rate γ. The cytosolic state <italic>w</italic> is the ATP-unbound dimer state which converts to and from the DNA associated states with linear rates ϵ and δ respectively. The differential equations describing the model are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>. Parameter values are specified below.</p><p>This system exhibits Turing pattern formation i.e. the differing diffusion rates and the reactions of the system are such that a diffusion-driven instability can occur that leads to the spontaneous formation of spatially varying concentration profiles. The two states <italic>u</italic> and <italic>v</italic> generate the Turing pattern while the cytosolic state <italic>w</italic> is responsible for positioning the pattern. The latter is required to be well-mixed and it is so because it interconverts with the Turing species <italic>u</italic> and <italic>v</italic> on a sufficiently slow timescale. Note that more generally this state is not required to be cytosolic, only well-mixed. The kymographs and distributions shown in this work are of <italic>v</italic> (which we simply refer to as MukBEF).

We use the difference in the slowly-diffusing species only as MukBEF clusters have been shown in vivo to consist only of this state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012b</xref>). This form for the jump rates respects detailed balance since the exchange between two neighbouring compartments balances i.e. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. The derivation of these rates relies on the assumptions that, within individual compartments, the probability density for <italic>ori</italic> is at steady state and that the MukBEF gradient is approximately linear. Both of these requirements can be satisfied for sufficiently small compartment widths. However, it is not feasible to decrease the compartment width much below 0.1 µm due to the increased computationally cost. Yet, the often sharp MukBEF profile (at a fixed moment in time) suggested that shorter compartment widths might be required. We therefore introduced sub-compartments within every compartment but only for <italic>ori</italic> positions. This approach has previously been applied to stochastic Turing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao and Erban, 2014</xref>) but here we apply it to a ‘non-Turing’ species (<italic>ori</italic>). Each compartment was divided into an odd number of sub-compartments and the MukBEF concentration was linearly interpolated across sub-compartments. The jump rates between sub-compartments were then defined as above. Performing simulations for different numbers of sub-compartments, we found that the apparent diffusion constant and drift rate (see below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) stabilised with greater than approximately 5 sub-compartments. The apparent diffusion was approximately 40% higher without sub-compartments. Since higher numbers of sub-compartments carried very little computational cost, we chose an arbitrary but relatively high value of 21 sub-compartments for the simulations presented in this work in order to be confident that there are no sub-compartment-size dependent effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Duplication of <italic>ori</italic></title><p>The timing of <italic>ori</italic> replication was chosen randomly in each simulation by picking a duplication length from a normal distribution with mean 3 m and coefficient of variation 0.16 (based on the distribution of <italic>ori</italic>-foci splitting length of the data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwada et al., 2013</xref>). As we use a fixed growth range (2.5-5 µm) and doubling time (120 min), we truncate the distribution to this range. This duplication length is then converted to a duplication time via the exponential relationship between cell length and time. The simulation is paused when it reaches this time, the <italic>ori</italic> is duplicated (remaining within the same sub-compartment) and the simulation continued. Note that we do not mimic cohesion of newly replicated stands so that what we refer to in the simulation as <italic>ori</italic> duplication actually more closely corresponds to initial <italic>ori</italic> separation in vivo, which occurs 10-15 minutes after replication initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>o<italic>ri</italic> repulsion</title><p>As discussed in the text, newly duplicated <italic>ori</italic> are likely to experience, for entropic reasons, a repulsive force between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jun and Mulder, 2006</xref>).

Within this framework, the DNA is described as a self-avoiding ring polymer that is confined in an elongated cuboid with an aspect ratio of 4:1 comparable to that of the <italic>E. coli</italic> nucleoid. Using a ring polymer composed of 464 monomers, we chose a lattice of size 22 × 22 × 88 that leads to a system density (monomer-to-volume ratio) of around 10%. Dynamic looping interactions were enabled between one specific monomer (<italic>ori</italic>) and distant monomers. For simplicity, we did not include loop formation between any two arbitrary sites but we do not expect this to change the nature of our results other than giving a homogeneous background of looping events. The looping probability is set to be dependent on the spatial position of <italic>ori</italic> along the long axis of the nucleoid and is drawn from a Gaussian distribution centred around mid-cell with a standard deviation of 8.8 lattice units. A lifetime of 10000 Monte-Carlo steps (MCS) was assigned to each loop. 50 independent Monte-Carlo trajectories were used to sample the dynamics of the system. In each simulation, 10000 polymer conformations were recorded, one every 50000 MCS. The initial position of <italic>ori</italic> was varied in each simulation in order to uniformly cover the long axis of the cuboid.</p><p>In the simulations of the two chromosomes, each chromosome was modelled as a ring polymer composed of 232 monomers in a cuboid of the same size. Hence, the system density of 10% stayed the same compared to the single-chromosome simulations. The spatially-varying probability for looping between both either of the two <italic>ori</italic>s and a distant monomers of any of the two polymers were drawn from the superposition of two Gaussian distributions centred around the two quarter positions of the cuboid with a standard deviation of 8.8 lattice units. 500 independent Monte-Carlo trajectories were used to sample the dynamics of the two polymer system. The simulations were initialized with two overlapping polymers with the two <italic>ori</italic>s at the centre of the cuboid.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Experiments</title><p>Strain SN192 (AB1157 <italic>lacO240-hyg</italic> at <italic>ori1, tetO240-gen</italic> at <italic>ter3, Plac-lacI-mCherry-frt</italic> at <italic>leuB, Plac-tetR-mCerulean-frt</italic> at <italic>galK, mukB-mYPet-frt</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nolivos et al., 2016</xref>) was grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glycerol and required amino acids (threonine, leucine, proline, histidine and arginine—0.1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>) at 30°C. Cells were grown O/N, diluted 1000-fold and grown to an A<sub>600</sub> of 0.05–0.2. Unlike longer cells with two (quarter positioned) <italic>ori</italic> foci, cells with a single (mid-cell localised) <italic>ori</italic> focus, can be analysed together in absolute, rather than scaled, coordinates by simply measuring foci positions relative to mid-cell (as we did in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> for the dataset of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwada et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore, unless otherwise indicated, treated cells with DL serine hydroxamate (SHX) (Sigma-Aldrich, S4503) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. During the treatment, cells do not initiate a new round of replication, but complete any ongoing rounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferullo et al., 2009</xref>). To allow sufficient time for replication to complete to termination, cultures were grown for 3 hr in the presence of SHX (generation time ~170 min). Finally, cells were spotted onto an M9-glycerol 1% agarose pad with the growth medium on a slide for imaging.</p><p>Time-lapse movies were acquired on a Nikon Ti-E inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a perfect focus system, a 100 × NA 1.4 oil immersion objective, an sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu Flash 4), a motorised stage, and a 30°C temperature chamber (Okolabs). Fluorescence images were automatically collected at 1 min intervals for 56 min using NIS-Elements software (Nikon) and an LED excitation source (Lumencor SpectraX). Exposure times were 150 ms for mCherry, and 100 ms for mYPet using 50% LED intensity. Phase contrast images were also collected at 1 min intervals for cell segmentation.</p><p>Alignment of frames, cell segmentation and linking of cells in consecutive frames were performed using SuperSegger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stylianidou et al., 2016</xref>). To ensure that we considered only cells with a single <italic>ori</italic>, we subsequently filtered the dataset as follows. For any cells that had two <italic>ori</italic> foci on any frame, we kept only the frames before two foci were first detected. This reduced the dataset of SHX treated from 1431 to 952 cells. We then used only frames with exactly one <italic>ori</italic> focus and one MukB focus. This resulted in 31820 data points (cell-frame combinations). Similar results were obtained if we further restricted the data set to cells of similar length. The same data was used to generate the step-wise velocity profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>) but as two consecutive frames are required this reduced the data set to 26226 data points.</p><p>Analysis, fitting and plotting were performed in MATLAB (Mathworks Inc).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Remy Colin for discussions and Victor Sourjik for discussion, support and comments on the manuscript.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Self-organised segregation of bacterial chromosomal origins&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the manuscript &quot;Self-organised segregation of bacterial chromosomal origins&quot;, the authors investigate the segregation of the chromosomal origins in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteria. They build on previously published work (Murray and Sourjik, 2017) about the dynamic and self-organized clustering of MukBEF proteins on the chromosome. To study the dynamics of the chromosomal origins they incorporate interactions between MukBEF and the origins into the model, as suggested by experimental findings. Their main result is that preferential loading of MukBEF at the origins and entropic repulsion of the origins can explain the experimentally observed ori dynamics. The presented work is an important contribution to quantitative cell biology because it gives new mechanistic insights into origin positioning in <italic>E. coli</italic> by integration of computational methods with experimental data.</p><p>The reviewers were supportive of the approach and the results, but have raised a number of issues that need to be addressed in a revised manuscript in order for the paper to be acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In particular, additional modeling work is requested, along with detailed, falsifiable predictions, and a discussion of the limitations of the current model.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Limitations of 1D modeling.</p><p>The authors' modeling is limited to 1D. While I appreciate the technical challenges, 3D modeling is a conceptual necessity. The population average aspect ratio of <italic>E. coli</italic> is typically length/width = 4, and treating an <italic>E. coli</italic> cell as a 1D space is really misleading for chromosome organization and segregation. Such an 1D approach was acceptable for Min oscillations some 20 years ago when physicists modeled them as a 1D reaction-diffusion problem; not only such approaches were new then, but also the nature of dynamics of Min allowed dimensional reduction as the Min proteins bind and unbind to the inner cell-wall membrane, which was key to Min oscillations. However, that is not the case for MukBEF. See also below the points on the polymeric nature of the chromosome.</p><p>2) 3D effects and robustness.</p><p><italic>E. coli</italic> cells with mild inhibition of mreB expression become almost completely round, but they still grow at the same growth rate as wildtype showing multifork replication (e.g., PMID: 28416114). We are unsure how ori positioning (if at all) by MukBEF pattern formation is important for chromosome segregation in round cells. Please explain and make predictions.</p><p>3) Polymeric nature of the chromosome.</p><p>Another aspect of the chromosome the authors almost completely neglect is the polymeric nature of the problem. Ori, after all, is an extremely small fraction of the chromosome. How does the ori positioning explain the principal organization of the rest of the chromosome? The authors did add limited 3D polymeric simulations, but they are far from being sufficient to justify the main claim of the paper.</p><p>4) Ori dynamics during (non-overlapping) replication.</p><p>In the last part of the manuscript, the authors do consider the polymeric nature of the chromosome and model the gradient of MukBEF implicitly by dynamic looping model with only one ori. They show that the ori can have a directed motion towards the cell center where the looping probability is more, but it is not clear how the oris reach the quarter positions during replication using the dynamic looping model. How does the dynamic looping model explain the position of MukBEF at quarter positions?</p><p>5) Ori dynamics during multifork replication.</p><p>We cannot assess the robustness of preferential loading of MukBEF on ori segregation and positioning during multifork replications (when 2 or 3 replication cycles overlap with up to 8 oris). This must be one of the most straightforward predictions the authors should be able to make based on their model, and they should extend their work to multifork replication cases. To be clear, we are not asking for more experiments, just falsifiable predictions using their model for future experimental tests.</p><p>6) Predictions.</p><p>In our view, modeling would be far more informative when it makes falsifiable predictions, rather than when the ad-hoc assumptions can produce results that look like published data. We ask the authors make two predictions, and include them in their revised manuscript.</p><p>Prediction 1: what will happen to low-copy number plasmids without partitioning system, when they instead integrated the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome ori? We presume the authors would predict these plasmids would completely localize with MukBEF clusters given that entropic repulsion would be negligible. If validated, this prediction would significantly support both the authors MukBEF model as well as the role of entropic repulsion.</p><p>Prediction 2: what would happen to the ectopic ori in the chromosome, depending on its locus position in the chromosome? And what would happen to the ectopic ori during multifork replication? Such strains were constructed previously and tested in limited growth conditions (PMID:21670292), and it would be worthwhile to extend the authors work by making explicit predictions assuming various different locations of the ectopic ori under different growth conditions.</p><p>See also other suggested predictions above.</p><p>7) The model is based on the known flux-balance mechanism and extended to explain the movement of the chromosomal origins. With each experimental observation (separation of two oris, ori dynamics during growth) they add a new aspect to the model (preferential loading, repulsive interaction of oris), which then leads to good agreement of the simulation results with the data. This raises two important questions: a) Are there new insights the model provides beyond the data? b) Are the model assumptions justified? In particular, is a preferential loading ratio of six, which shows the smallest variance of the peaks, realistic? The authors refer to a measured preferential loading for SMC in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. What is the preferential loading ratio here? Is it possible to get a measurement for MukBEF in <italic>E. coli</italic>? Furthermore, is the chosen repulsive interaction strength / range realistic? It might be that, although repulsion contributes to the dynamics of the origins in the in vivo system, it is not the main factor because it might not be strong enough. The values for the repulsive strength and range are obtained by fitting (Figure 4——figure supplement 2). Isn't it trivial that with this fitted choice of parameters the experimental observations are reproduced?</p><p>8) In the model, diffusion of the origins is biased by a gradient of MukBEF. This is an important assumption of the model, which raises several questions: What is the physics behind this assumption, i.e. where does the net force come from? What determines the strength of the bias? Can the strength be measured? Another assumption of the model is that only the concentration of the slow species (in blue in Figure 2A) is considered for the bias of the origins. Why are not both, the slow and the fast moving, nucleoid-bound species (in green in Figure 2A) considered for the bias? Couldn't the success of the model in explaining the data hinge to a large degree on all these assumptions?</p><p>9) The authors justify their assumption of a one-dimensional model with the fact that most of the foci are within 40% of cell width and &quot;There are also technical reason inherent to the method that make nonlinear models in higher dimensions (and the corresponding lower voxel volumes) problematic.&quot; However, 40% of cell width is not a very confined region. Furthermore, could the authors state more clearly, which technical reasons they refer to? If it is the lower bound on the mesh size, there are generalized RDMEs that overcome this limit (Hellander and Petzold, 2016).</p><p>10) Most of the parameters for the MukBEF dynamics are chosen as previously described (Murray and Sourjik, 2017). This reference should be cited when the parameters are discussed (subsection “Parameters”). The only parameter that is chosen differently is the concentration of MukBEF, which is set to a larger value than the one used before. Why is this choice justified? Couldn't the concentration be measured experimentally? Since the strength of stochastic effects depends on the number of particles, it is crucial to choose realistic concentrations / number of particles as well as realistic rates in the model.</p><p>11) The authors did a number of experiments with <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, in which they imaged the ori location(s) and/or Muk-foci. Together with what is already known in the literature, these experiments constitute the empirical basis for the analysis of the authors. However, instead of presenting this empirical basis in a coherent fashion in the beginning of the Results section, the authors chose to present the results piecemeal. In particular, the results that we found most striking, the &quot;restoring velocities&quot; of Figure 5B and D, are shown very late in the paper and presented only as a confirmation of their hypothesis of preferential Muk-loading onto the ori locus. In our view, this data should be the motivation for the hypothesis – prior to seeing this data we kept wondering what the basis for the hypothesis was.</p><p>Then, after finally seeing the &quot;restoring velocities&quot; of Figure 5B and D, we thought that the most logical next step would be to repeat this analysis on different variants of the MukBEF-system, in order to test whether the higher restoring velocity towards MukB than to midcell is lost when the system is modified in one or the other way.</p><p>Instead, the authors continued by presenting computer simulations of chromosome dynamics within a dynamic loop model. The presentation was so brief and the analysis of the simulations so minimal that the conclusions from this part of the work remained obscure to us. We think these simulations were meant to explore whether the directed motion of ori (within their model) is due to a real mechanical force on ori (and, if so, where this force comes from), or whether it results from a ratchet-like mechanism. However, what is the conclusion on this question and how do the authors arrive at the conclusion? We think this part of the work should either be eliminated or should be elaborated on and presented much more clearly.</p><p>12) The logic underlying the simulations of the stochastic model of Figure 2C was much clearer. However, given that this model relies heavily on the prior work of Murray and Sourjik, 2017, it would be good to spell out more clearly what has already been established in that paper and what is added here. Furthermore, the way in which the comparison of these simulations with the experimental data is done is sometimes confusing, in the sense that we did not get a clear sense about &quot;what is put in and what they got out&quot;. For instance, it says &quot;… Note this was based on a direct comparison and not a fit to the experimental distribution.&quot;, while earlier, it says &quot;… We found that by adjusting the diffusion and drift input parameters, we were able to obtain excellent agreement with the experimental results (Figure 2F).&quot; (the latter indicates fitting)</p><p>In conclusion, we recommend that the authors rewrite their manuscript to present the data and the logic in a more coherent and stringent way. For instance, we think it is in the best interest of the authors to clearly point out what results of this paper remain true in case future studies should show that there is no preferential loading of Muk onto ori. Our impression is that the data of Figure 5B and D is an important part of what would survive in that case. It would be helpful, if the authors clearly spell out what can be concluded from this data independent of a specific modeling scenario. It would be even better to also add data that tests the restoring velocities of variants of the Muk system.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46564.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Limitations of 1D modeling.</p><p>The authors' modeling is limited to 1D.

However, that is not the case for MukBEF. See also below the points on the polymeric nature of the chromosome.</p></disp-quote><p>Also in response to point #9 below. There are important differences between our study and those of the Min system. The Min system is typically, modelled using a quadratic interaction (bimolecular reaction), whereas our model, as is typical for (static) Turing patterns, has a cubic interaction. As this reviewer has noted there is a fundamental limit on the mesh size (voxel volume) when using non-linear reactions in lattice based Gillespie/Monte Carlo simulations. Several groups have proposed ways of overcoming this problem. However, all such ‘fixes’ are for bi-molecular reactions, including the recent work of Hellander and Petzold. To our knowledge there is currently no way to overcome the problem for tri-molecular reactions. We have now explained this problem in more detail in the text and Materials and methods section and include a quantification of the mesh-size effect (Figure 2—figure supplement 5).</p><p>Note that we have previously performed deterministic 3D simulations of the core MukBEF model (Murray and Sourjik, 2017). However, as there are only a few hundred MukB molecules in the cell, and only 1 or 2 ori, the model must be simulated stochastically.</p><p>The presence of trimolecular reaction term in models of Turing patterning has always been problematic due to their somewhat unrealistic nature. Attempts have been made to introduce an intermediate species that is in equilibrium with one of the other states and thereby replace one trimolecular reaction with two bimolecular reactions. This can work for some models e.g. the Brusselator (Smith and Dachau 2018, doi.org//10.1098/rsif.2017.0805) but not all depending on the precise form of the reactions (our attempts with the approach have given unsatisfactory results). Furthermore any additional species should be biological justifiable. We therefore think that the solution will come from future experimental results or re-interpretation of existing data, something on which we are actively working.</p><p>Another important point to make concerns the comparison to experimental data. To our knowledge, the comparisons of the Min system to experiment have always been qualitative in nature. We on the other hand make quantitative comparisons between simulated and measured ori dynamics. Furthermore, since we only have 1 ori in a short cell, we must necessarily perform many simulations for long times to obtain sufficient statistics (in Figure 2, we perform 100 simulations of 600 min simulation time each). The average distribution of MukBEF we can determine more easily – the ori is the limiting factor statistics-wise. We also perform parameter sweeps, with each parameter set requiring the aforementioned number of simulations. Running in parallel on 20 cores it takes a few days to complete a sweep of only 64 parameter choices. Performing such sweeps for a 3D model could easily multiply this by a factor of several hundred or more (with small mesh-sizes diffusion events become much more frequent and dominate the simulation time) and so even without the issue of mesh-size effects, performing all the analyses and parameter sweeps that we have done in 3D is not a straightforward request.</p><p>Furthermore, we would like to point out that many groups have worked on the Min system over many years with many developments on both the experimental and modelling sides. This is our first paper on the ori-MukBEF model and we can therefore hardly be expected to have studied the system to the same degree. We would also like to point out that the Min system is still commonly modelled deterministically (e.g. Halatek and Frey 2018, Nature Physics; Denk et al. 2018, PNAS; Wu et al. 2016, Mol.Sys.Bio.).</p><p>Lastly, concerning the reviewer’s comment that MukBEF foci and ori being within the centre 40% (300 nm) of the short axis of the cell does not count as being confined, we now comment on the size of MukBEF (140 nm arc length, 70 nm from the hinge to each head domain). It is also worth noting that we are interested and measure ori and MukBEF foci positioning only along the long axis of the cell and that segregation, by definition, occurs along this axis. Our reaction diffusion simulations are also not single-occupancy: MukBEF molecules and ori can move ‘through’ each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) 3D effects and robustness.</p><p>E. coli cells with mild inhibition of mreB expression become almost completely round, but they still grow at the same growth rate as wildtype showing multifork replication (e.g., PMID: 28416114). We are unsure how ori positioning (if at all) by MukBEF pattern formation is important for chromosome segregation in round cells. Please explain and make predictions.</p></disp-quote><p>The cells in the given reference, while certainly shorter and wider than WT are nonetheless far from round, with an aspect ratio not much lower than WT. Indeed, depletion of MreB or inhibition of MreB structures (using for example the antibiotic A22), results in completely round cells that then lyse (PMID: 15612918). However, the lethality can be suppressed in these cells by overexpressing the cell division genes ftsZAQ. To our knowledge, chromosome organisation in these cells has not been studied in detail. We do not know if these cells grow at the same rate as wildtype nor if ori and MukBEF foci (which presumably still form) are specifically positioned within the cell. There is also evidence that MreB interacts with the topoisomerase TopoIV, thereby linking it to chromosome organisation and segregation (PMID: 19187760). Thus, geometry is likely not the only determining factor for the positioning of ori in these cells. Given that and the fact that we do not explicitly model the chromosome, we would argue that the topic is not in the scope of the paper, which is focused on slowing-growing wild-type cells.</p><p>However, ignoring other such effects, we can speculate about what would happen in the context of our model. We have previously showed that geometry sensing by the flux-balance mechanism works in 3 dimensions (within a rectangular cuboid) using the deterministic version of our model (Murray and Sourjik, 2017) and it has recently also been shown to work in 3 dimensions in the context of a stochastic model of PomXYZ positioning in M. xanthus (Biorxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/496364). We therefore expect that the flux-balance mechanism could find the centre of round cells, and the approximate quarter positions of oblong dividing cells. MukBEF foci would form at these positions and recruit and partition ori to the same locations. This is our speculative prediction. As our stochastic simulations are not reliable in 3D, we cannot verify that this would be the result of our model. Therefore, we have not added this to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Polymeric nature of the chromosome.</p><p>Another aspect of the chromosome the authors almost completely neglect is the polymeric nature of the problem.</p></disp-quote><p>Our model is a simplified one, out of necessity. It is simply not feasible to perform coupled polymer and reaction-diffusion simulations. We are forced to do one or the other implicitly. More importantly, not enough is known about how MukBEF interacts with DNA and other MuBEF molecules. Many of the investigations of the role played by nucleoid associated proteins such as SMC/MukBEF in organising the chromosome have been chromosome-centric in nature e.g. chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and related techniques. By that, we mean that they generally address the organisation of the chromosome with request to itself, not with respect to the cell. Furthermore, the fact that SMC and MukBEF form positioned foci in both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is not reflected in the Hi-C maps (PMID: 24158908, 29358050). In particular, though both condensins colocalise with ori, there is little evidence of an enrichment of induced contacts in this region. This disparity between the Hi-C maps and fluorescence microscopy results has yet to be explained.</p><p>Polymer modelling approaches have been used to try to understand how bacterial SMC is organising the chromosome and to explain the observed Hi-C maps (e.g. PMID 30333247). However, SMC is modelled implicitly as sliding links between nodes of the polymer (similar to studies of eukaryotic SMC e.g. PMID: 27192037). Thus, the fact that SMC form foci is not taken account of. The first mechanistic model (as in chemical kinetics) for how SMC interacts with the DNA and changes between its states (thereby translocating along the DNA and extruding loops) has very recently been published last month (PMID: 31175837) but we still do not know how the details of how it moves and self-interacts on the large spatial scale of the nucleoid.</p><p>Rather than taking a chromosome-centric approach, we take a protein-centric (and cell-centric) approach in which we are interested in the positioning of MukBEF on the bulk nucleoid. However, the price of modelling the spatial protein dynamics is that we must treat the DNA polymer implicitly. In previous work, we showed how MukBEF could self-organise on the nucleoid and be positioned by a flux-balance mechanism. In this manuscript, we provide evidence that MukBEF foci position <italic>ori</italic> and show how this can be explained by an interaction between ori and self-positioning MukBEF foci. We make contact with the chromosome-centric approach in the final section by performing polymer simulations to test the hypothesis that a spatially-dependent probability for ori to form contacts (loops) with other loci can lead to directed motion of ori, in a diffusion-ratchet/DNA relay -type mechanism.</p><p>In the future, we would like to shorten the gap between the two approaches. One possibility is to perform hybrid coupled simulations i.e. polymer simulations with the protein modelled implicitly coupled to reaction-diffusion simulations with the polymer modelled implicitly, using the output of one as the input to the other and vice versa in an iterative manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ori, after all, is an extremely small fraction of the chromosome. How does the ori positioning explain the principal organization of the rest of the chromosome?</p></disp-quote><p>This is out of the scope of our paper. In our MukBEF-ori model, we study only the positioning and partitioning of ori and the chromosome is treated implicitly.</p><p>However, this question has already been investigated. There is experimental evidence that the position of the ori defines the other macrodomains and affects their position inside the cell, see PMID 28486476 and the paper cited by a reviewer in Prediction 2 below. These results are supported by polymer simulations that studied the effect of forced localisation of ori and other loci/macrodomains on overall chromosome organisation (Junier et al., 2014).</p><p>However, to address this reviewer’s concern, we have now added histograms of the positions of L, R and ter (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We found the same organisation as in Junier et al. The mid-cell positioning of ori results in a L-ori/ter-R organisation of the polymer. Note that the polar ter localisation in Figure 3 of the aforementioned paper must be due to the histogram being from only a single simulation. By symmetry, the ter distribution in these simulations must be centred around mid-cell.</p><p>Our simulations do not take into account the formation of other macrodomains or the forced localisation of ter. These effects were considered by Junier et al., and we refer the reviewer to their paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors did add limited 3D polymeric simulations, but they are far from being sufficient to justify the main claim of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The main claim of the paper stands without the polymer simulations (in point 10, one reviewer even raises the possibility of removing them altogether). However, as evidenced by point 7, it is a natural question to ask about the mechanism underlying the biased diffusion of ori towards MukBEF foci, something which is indicated by our experimental data and which our model assumes. The goal of the polymer simulations was to propose an explanation. Even if this reviewer thinks the proposed mechanism is not plausible, the experimental data (here and previous) nonetheless indicate that ori are attracted to MukBEF foci.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Ori dynamics during (non-overlapping) replication.</p><p>In the last part of the manuscript, the authors do consider the polymeric nature of the chromosome and model the gradient of MukBEF implicitly by dynamic looping model with only one ori. They show that the ori can have a directed motion towards the cell center where the looping probability is more, but it is not clear how the oris reach the quarter positions during replication using the dynamic looping model. How does the dynamic looping model explain the position of MukBEF at quarter positions?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added substantial new polymer simulations to demonstrate ori segregation and quarter positioning. Even without looping, the ori naturally move away from one another due to entropic repulsion. However, we found that MukBEF induced looping at the quarter positions accelerates separation. The duplicated ori are then positioned at opposite quarter positions in the same way as the single ori case. See the revised text for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Ori dynamics during multifork replication.</p><p>We cannot assess the robustness of preferential loading of MukBEF on ori segregation and positioning during multifork replications (when 2 or 3 replication cycles overlap with up to 8 oris). This must be one of the most straightforward predictions the authors should be able to make based on their model, and they should extend their work to multifork replication cases. To be clear, we are not asking for more experiments, just falsifiable predictions using their model for future experimental tests.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now examined the case of multifork replication. As it is more speculative than the slow-growing case (where we have data to constrain the model) and is somewhat out of scope of the manuscript, which is explicitly concerned with ori positioning in slow-growing cells, we have added this to the Discussion section. In short, we found very similar behaviour to the observed ori dynamics. We can use this to make predictions about the number and position of MukBEF foci in these cells. A proper investigation of multifork replication, to the same extent as we have done for non-overlapping replication, would be substantially more work and we leave it for a future manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Predictions.</p><p>In our view, modeling would be far more informative when it makes falsifiable predictions, rather than when the ad-hoc assumptions can produce results that look like published data.</p></disp-quote><p>We address this comment regarding ah-hoc assumptions in the next point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We ask the authors make two predictions, and include them in their revised manuscript.</p><p>Prediction 1: what will happen to low-copy number plasmids without partitioning system, when they instead integrated the E. coli chromosome ori? We presume the authors would predict these plasmids would completely localize with MukBEF clusters given that entropic repulsion would be negligible. If validated, this prediction would significantly support both the authors MukBEF model as well as the role of entropic repulsion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is something we have been thinking about. We would indeed predict that they would co-localise with MukBEF foci. However, the essential point is that it is not the origin of replication site oriC itself that is important but rather one of the hypothetical loading sites, which could be some distance from oriC. For example, in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, the closest parS site (outside of the ParB gene) is ~48 kb from oriC (parB is ~10kb from oriC). This is also consistent with the paper cited below in which the ori1 locus within the ori macro-domain remains positioned at mid-cell even if oriC itself is moved. Thus the challenge would be to find this site(s). It is worth noting that inserting the matS site into a plasmid leads to plasmid localisation at the septum (where the matS binding protein MatP is anchored) (PMID:22580828). So a single short sequence can indeed determine plasmid positioning much like a native partitioning system.</p><p>We have now added this prediction to the Discussion section in a separate subsection (along with the case of multi-fork replication).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Prediction 2: what would happen to the ectopic ori in the chromosome, depending on its locus position in the chromosome? And what would happen to the ectopic ori during multifork replication? Such strains were constructed previously and tested in limited growth conditions (PMID:21670292), and it would be worthwhile to extend the authors work by making explicit predictions assuming various different locations of the ectopic ori under different growth conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>This is unfortunately outside of the limits of our model. We do not model (apart from in the last section) the chromosome explicitly and therefore we cannot say anything about ectopic ori. Our manuscript is also concerned with non-overlapping, not multifork replication. In fact, even just simulating the polymer aspects of the question, and ignoring MukBEF, would be a massive undertaking. Indeed, we are not aware of any polymeric studies that have examined multifork replication and know only of a single paper in which active non-overlapping replication is simulated (PMID:16885211).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>See also other suggested predictions above.</p><p>7) The model is based on the known flux-balance mechanism and extended to explain the movement of the chromosomal origins. With each experimental observation (separation of two oris, ori dynamics during growth) they add a new aspect to the model (preferential loading, repulsive interaction of oris), which then leads to good agreement of the simulation results with the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, it was clear to us at the initial conception of this work that ori simply moving up the MukBEF gradient would not lead to ori partitioning. Preferential loading was then a natural effect to investigate given the role it plays for SMC, a functional homolog of MukBEF (which we now make clearer, see below). We presented the case without preferential loading first for expositional purposes as we thought that immediately jumping into a stochastic Turing model with a bidirectional interaction with a diffusing particle would be too confusing for the general reader. The presentation has now been reordered so that preferential loading is introduced earlier. With regard entropic repulsion between ori, this effect is well established and it is unsurprising that it may be included in a model of ori segregation. No other aspects or model extensions were investigated and since the two mentioned inclusions are well justified, we do not consider it a disadvantage of our model or approach that we needed to include them. We also prefer to take a minimal modelling approach in which we only add components as required to explain the data, rather than including them without justification at the beginning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This raises two important questions: a) Are there new insights the model provides beyond the data?</p></disp-quote><p>The model gives the first explanation of ori positioning in <italic>E. coli,</italic> a long-standing question in the most studied bacterial species, and is therefore readily considered insightful. Although one of us (D.S.) has suggested in the past that MukBEF foci position ori, based on the results of perturbative experiments (described in the Introduction), it was not entirely clear that it was the case and there was no known or proposed mechanism. Furthermore, the model result that feedback from ori to MukBEF (implemented as preferential loading in our model but there are other possibilities) is necessary for ori partitioning is insightful for understanding the system and interpreting future experiments.</p><p>The concept of a coupling between a self-organising protein gradient and a particle (or genetic locus) and more generally, the idea that protein self-organisation could have a role in chromosome organisation, are also, to our knowledge, new.</p><p>Judging by the final sentence of the editor’s summary, he also agrees that our work is an important contribution and gives mechanistic insight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Are the model assumptions justified? In particular, is a preferential loading ratio of six, which shows the smallest variance of the peaks, realistic?</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, our model is of course effective. The chromosome is not modelled explicitly and we do not know the precise chemical kinetics of MukBEF. Therefore, even if there were experimental measurements of the preferential loading ratio and the region over which it occurs, it is not clear how that would translate into our 1D, lattice model. For this reason, we assign no meaning to, or make an interpretation of, the specific ratio of 6. The is simply a value (and an intermediate one from the point of view of the effect) that reproduces the experimental data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors refer to a measured preferential loading for SMC in B. subtilis. What is the preferential loading ratio here?</p></disp-quote><p>In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, there are population average measurement (ChIP-seq) for SMC binding to parS sites (Minnen et al. 2006, Cell Reports), where a relatively broad signal is observed around parS sites and along each chromosomal arm with a ChIP/input ratio of 2 to 4 at parS sites and 8x at oriC. The 6 most prominent parS sites (of the 8) are scattered within a region surrounding the ori (9% of the genome). Note that these ratios are much less than observed for sequence-specific DNA binding proteins. Given that in our lattice-based model preferential loading occurs only in the compartment containing the ori (1 out of 25 or 4% of the total number of compartments in a 2.5 μm cell), the ratios we investigate are not unreasonable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it possible to get a measurement for MukBEF in E. coli?</p></disp-quote><p>There is no direct evidence in <italic>E. coli</italic> for preferential loading sites (hence we describe it as a hypothesis), yet MukBEF foci do co-localise with ori and, as we have shown, ori appears to be attracted to MukBEF foci rather than to mid-cell per se. The nature of the association between MukBEF and ori is a long-standing question and while we have provided further experimental evidence of the relationship and showed that the hypothesis of preferential loading can, in principle, explain the data including the observed attraction of MukBEF towards ori, we do not have direct experimental evidence for preferential loading.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, is the chosen repulsive interaction strength / range realistic? It might be that, although repulsion contributes to the dynamics of the origins in the</italic> in vivo <italic>system, it is not the main factor because it might not be strong enough.</italic> </p><p>Indeed this might be the case but that is a big question. The importance (but not the existence) of entropic repulsion is a matter of debate and it is not a question we can answer as part of this work. However, we would like to point out that we only require entropic repulsion for initial separation of ori, after which MukBEF takes over and it is no longer necessary. This is an important point as entropic forces are expected to drop sharply after the initial unmixing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The values for the repulsive strength and range are obtained by fitting (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Isn't it trivial that with this fitted choice of parameters the experimental observations are reproduced?</p></disp-quote><p>The statement is a tautology – it is a fitting. We choose the parameters by comparing the model to the experimental observations. However, it is not trivial that we were able to obtain a successful fitting. Indeed, we showed that entropic repulsion alone, no matter how strong, cannot reproduce the observations, nor can preferential loading alone. Both entropic repulsion and preferential loading are required.</p><p>We would also like to respond more fundamentally against the implication in this point that experimental measurement and confirmation need to come before theory. Theory can and often does come first (for example in particle physics) and can provide useful insights to guide future experiments. In this case, our model and our assumption of preferential loading, or rather the assumption there exists a feedback from ori positioning to MukBEF positioning can be used to guide and/or interpret future experimental results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In the model, diffusion of the origins is biased by a gradient of MukBEF. This is an important assumption of the model, which raises several questions: What is the physics behind this assumption, i.e. where does the net force come from?</p></disp-quote><p>The last section of the paper ‘Directed movement of ori can arise from spatially-dependent looping interactions’ was an attempt to give an explanation for the biased motion of the ori. We know that MukBEF forms loops by bridging genomically distant chromosomal sites. We also know that MukBEF is spatially localised within the cell. Finally, we know that MukBEF has a special relationship with ori. Given these facts, if we assume that MukBEF has a higher probability to form loops involving the ori than other genomic loci, then we showed that this can lead, due to the elastic fluctuations of the DNA, to migration of the ori towards the location where MukBEF/the looping probability is highest, similar to the DNA relay model of ParB-parS positioning. This kind of mechanism is also known as a diffusion ratchet, essentially a way to extract useful work from the random fluctuations. This is (one possibility for) the source of the force.</p><p>This section has been expanded with new data on segregating oris and has been improved for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What determines the strength of the bias? Can the strength be measured?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the strength is given by the slope of the velocity profile (Figure 2). We now make this explicit and give the force in Newtons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another assumption of the model is that only the concentration of the slow species (in blue in Figure 2A) is considered for the bias of the origins. Why are not both, the slow and the fast moving, nucleoid-bound species (in green in Figure 2A) considered for the bias? Couldn't the success of the model in explaining the data hinge to a large degree on all these assumptions?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise that we did not show the profile of the fast species. It is almost homogenous and therefore does not contribute much in comparison to the gradient of the sharp peak of the slow species (Murray and Sourjik, 2017). Furthermore, we know experimentally that MukBEF foci are composed of the slowly diffusing dimer of dimer state (Badrinarayanan et al. 2012). We have modified the line in the Introduction and the Materials and methods section to make this clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors justify their assumption of a one-dimensional model with the fact that most of the foci are within 40% of cell width and &quot;There are also technical reason inherent to the method that make nonlinear models in higher dimensions (and the corresponding lower voxel volumes) problematic.&quot; However, 40% of cell width is not a very confined region. Furthermore, could the authors state more clearly, which technical reasons they refer to? If it is the lower bound on the mesh size, there are generalized RDMEs that overcome this limit (Hellander and Petzold, 2016).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to point #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Most of the parameters for the MukBEF dynamics are chosen as previously described (Murray and Sourjik, 2017). This reference should be cited when the parameters are discussed (subsection “Parameters”). The only parameter that is chosen differently is the concentration of MukBEF, which is set to a larger value than the one used before. Why is this choice justified? Couldn't the concentration be measured experimentally? Since the strength of stochastic effects depends on the number of particles, it is crucial to choose realistic concentrations / number of particles as well as realistic rates in the model.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for increasing the total concentration of MukBEF was, as stated, to make splitting of the focus MukBEF occur at cells length more within the range studied in this paper (or equivalently to decrease the wavelength of the pattern). The previous paper simulated cells with lengths 3-6 μm long, whereas in this paper, we simulate cells 2.5-5 μm long (based on our data and the data of Kuwada et al.). The concentration of MukBEF in the cell has been measured experimentally by two different approaches. Single-molecule microscopy gives a value of 438+/-180 molecules of MukB (Badrinarayanan et al. 2012) in minimal media. Ribosome profiling gives values of 1215 and 356 molecules synthesised per generation for MOPS complete and minimal media respectively (Li et al. 2014). An earlier Western blot analysis gives 400 ± 100 molecules per cell (Petrushenko et al., 2006 J.Biol.Chem). Hence, the value we use (520 nM which corresponds to 391 molecules at birth (2.5 μm), is within the biologically justified range. We could alternatively have changed the parameters β and/or γ to obtain a similar result. We have now added these references and made explicit that the value is biologically justified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors did a number of experiments with E. coli cells, in which they imaged the ori location(s) and/or Muk-foci. Together with what is already known in the literature, these experiments constitute the empirical basis for the analysis of the authors. However, instead of presenting this empirical basis in a coherent fashion in the beginning of the Results section, the authors chose to present the results piecemeal. In particular, the results that we found most striking, the &quot;restoring velocities&quot; of Figure 5B and D, are shown very late in the paper and presented only as a confirmation of their hypothesis of preferential Muk-loading onto the ori locus. In our view, this data should be the motivation for the hypothesis – prior to seeing this data we kept wondering what the basis for the hypothesis was.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that the motivation for preferential loading was lost to some extent during editing. The motivation was simply by analogy with SMC, which is specifically loading onto the chromosome at parS sites within the ori region. It was obvious to us from the beginning that ori moving up the MukBEF gradient would not be sufficient for partitioning and therefore preferential loading, inspired by SMC, was a reasonable hypothesis. It was only later that we examined the experimental restoring velocities of ori and MukBEF foci.</p><p>While the ori restoring velocity (panel B) supported the existing hypothesis that ori is attracted to/positioned by MukBEF foci, the MukBEF restoring velocity (panel D) was an experimentally surprising result. That MukBEF foci could be attracted to ori was not considered previously and was a prediction that came directly from the self-organising nature of the model. If MukBEF was not self-organising and was simple recruited to the ori, where it formed foci, then such a dynamic attraction of foci towards ori would not be expected.</p><p>While we think a back-and-forth between theory and experiment is a natural and truthful way to present the work, we can see how moving this data earlier might improve the overall flow of the manuscript for a broader readership. We have therefore re-organised the paper as suggested. Figure 5B and D are now part of Figure 1. However, we still refer back to Panel D as support for our hypothesis of preferential loading.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Then, after finally seeing the &quot;restoring velocities&quot; of Figure 5B and D, we thought that the most logical next step would be to repeat this analysis on different variants of the MukBEF-system, in order to test whether the higher restoring velocity towards MukB than to midcell is lost when the system is modified in one or the other way.</p></disp-quote><p>We have considered this possibility, however the only appropriate mutant that binds chromosome and forms a foci we have, the ATP hydrolysis impaired mutant mukB[E1407Q], shows very little ATP activity. We have no way to modify the activity of the system, while keeping it functional. There are several ways to break the system, but then there are either no foci or foci are no longer properly positioned within the cell (and do not colocalise with ori). Should it become possible in the future to modulate the activity of the system, then this would certainly be a very interesting approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Instead, the authors continued by presenting computer simulations of chromosome dynamics within a dynamic loop model. The presentation was so brief and the analysis of the simulations so minimal that the conclusions from this part of the work remained obscure to us. We think these simulations were meant to explore whether the directed motion of ori (within their model) is due to a real mechanical force on ori (and, if so, where this force comes from), or whether it results from a ratchet-like mechanism. However, what is the conclusion on this question and how do the authors arrive at the conclusion? We think this part of the work should either be eliminated or should be elaborated on and presented much more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We are somewhat surprised by these comments. In point 7, a reviewer specifically asks about the physics behind the assumption that the diffusion of ori is biased by the gradient of MukBEF. This is what the polymer simulations are trying to answer. Thus we are surprised at the suggestion to remove them entirely.</p><p>However, the section was obviously not written clearly enough. We have re-written it for clarity and also added the results of new data on the case of segregating ori.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The logic underlying the simulations of the stochastic model of Figure 2C was much clearer. However, given that this model relies heavily on the prior work of Murray and Sourjik, 2017, it would be good to spell out more clearly what has already been established in that paper and what is added here.</p></disp-quote><p>The core MukBEF model is common to this manuscript and the previous work. We go further by incorporating ori, its attraction up the MukBEF gradient, its effect (via preferential loading) on MukBEF foci and the repulsion between ori and how all these things together give rise robust ori positioning and partitioning. We have edited the Discussion to make it clearer what was previously achieved and what we do in this manuscript (this is already commented on in the Introduction).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the way in which the comparison of these simulations with the experimental data is done is sometimes confusing, in the sense that we did not get a clear sense about &quot;what is put in and what they got out&quot;. For instance, it says &quot;… Note this was based on a direct comparison and not a fit to the experimental distribution.&quot;, while earlier, it says &quot;… We found that by adjusting the diffusion and drift input parameters, we were able to obtain excellent agreement with the experimental results (Figure 2F).&quot; (the latter indicates fitting).</p></disp-quote><p>We have made this clearer by changing the order of presentation and stating the motivation for the preferential loading more clearly. The model was not fit to all existing data. We determined the parameters defining the ori diffusion constant and drift rate by fitting to the mean and variance of the velocity profile (Figure 2F). We then compared (not fitted) other properties of the model with other experimental data, namely the distribution of the ori-MukBEF separation distance, where we found excellent agreement (in the presence of specific loading). As this information was not used to constrain the model, it can be seen as confirmation of a model prediction. This was our point here. We have made this clearer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
