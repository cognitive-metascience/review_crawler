We developed a precision chemoptogenetic approach to target neuronal mitochondria in the intact nervous system in vivo. MG2I, a chemical fluorogen, produces singlet oxygen when bound to the fluorogen-activating protein dL5** and exposed to far-red light. Transgenic zebrafish expressing dL5** within neuronal mitochondria showed dramatic MG2I- and light-dependent neurobehavioral deficits, caused by neuronal bioenergetic crisis and acute neuronal depolarization. These abnormalities resulted from loss of neuronal respiration, associated with mitochondrial fragmentation, swelling and elimination of cristae. Remaining cellular ultrastructure was preserved initially, but cellular pathology downstream of mitochondrial damage eventually culminated in neuronal death. Our work provides powerful new chemoptogenetic tools for investigating mitochondrial homeostasis and pathophysiology and shows a direct relationship between mitochondrial function, neuronal biogenetics and whole-animal behavior.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most life processes require the energy produced by small cellular compartments called mitochondria. Many internal and external factors can harm these miniature powerhouses, potentially leading to cell death. For instance, in patients with Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s disease, dying neurons often show mitochondrial damage. However, it is unclear exactly how injured mitochondria trigger the demise of these cells. Gaining a better understanding of this process requires studying the impact of mitochondrial damage in live neurons, something that is still difficult to do.</p><p>As a response to this challenge, Xie, Jiao, Bai, Ilin et al. designed a new tool that can specifically injure mitochondria in the neurons of live zebrafish larvae at will, and fine-tune the amount of damage inflicted. The zebrafish are genetically engineered so that the mitochondria in their neurons carry a protein which can bind to a chemical compound called MG2I. When attached to each other, MG2I and the protein respond to far-red light by locally creating highly damaging chemicals. This means that whenever far-red light is shone onto the larvae, mitochondria in their neurons are harmed – the brighter the light, the stronger the damage.</p><p>Zebrafish larvae exposed to these conditions immediately stopped swimming: mitochondria in their neurons could not produce enough energy and these cells could therefore no longer communicate properly. The neurons then started to die about 24 hours after exposure to the light, suggesting that the mitochondrial damage triggered other downstream processes that culminated in cell death.</p><p>This new light-controlled tool could help to understand the consequences of mitochondrial damage, potentially revealing new ways to rescue impaired neurons in patients with Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s disease. In the future, the method could be adapted to work in any type of cell and deactivate other cell compartments, so that it can be used to study many types of diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>chemoptogenetics</kwd><kwd>respiration</kwd><kwd>motor function</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES025606</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Qing</given-names></name><name><surname>Kolodieznyi</surname><given-names>Dmytro</given-names></name><name><surname>Opresko</surname><given-names>Patricia L</given-names></name><name><surname>St Croix</surname><given-names>Claudette M</given-names></name><name><surname>Watkins</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><name><surname>Van Houten</surname><given-names>Bennett</given-names></name><name><surname>Bruchez</surname><given-names>Marcel P</given-names></name><name><surname>Burton</surname><given-names>Edward A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES022644</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Qing</given-names></name><name><surname>Ilin</surname><given-names>Vladimir A</given-names></name><name><surname>St. Croix</surname><given-names>Claudette M</given-names></name><name><surname>Burton</surname><given-names>Edward A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</institution-id><institution>National Center for Research Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RR019003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Ming</given-names></name><name><surname>Stolz</surname><given-names>Donna B</given-names></name><name><surname>St. Croix</surname><given-names>Claudette M</given-names></name><name><surname>Watkins</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EB017268</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Ming</given-names></name><name><surname>Stolz</surname><given-names>Donna B</given-names></name><name><surname>St Croix</surname><given-names>Claudette M</given-names></name><name><surname>Watkins</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><name><surname>Bruchez</surname><given-names>Marcel P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Wenting</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiao</surname><given-names>Binxuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Novel transgenic zebrafish lines allow selective ablation of neuronal mitochondria by far red light, providing a powerful tool for investigating mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons and mitochondrial mechanisms in neurological disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>High-resolution intravital imaging, coupled with transgenic expression of fluorescent reporters, provides opportunities to analyze the biology of the intact nervous system. This approach has been particularly successful in larval zebrafish, which combine optical transparency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">White et al., 2008</xref>) with vertebrate CNS structure and genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burton, 2014</xref>), allowing advances in understanding whole-brain activity patterns at cellular resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Portugues et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2013</xref>), the formation of neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tay et al., 2011</xref>), neuronal mitochondrial trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dukes et al., 2016</xref>) and neuronal autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khuansuwan et al., 2019</xref>). Recent developments in light-sensitive channel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cosentino et al., 2015</xref>) and genetically-encoded photosensitizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2016</xref>) provide new opportunities to extend these studies from observations to experimental manipulation of the CNS in vivo, by light-induced activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ljunggren et al., 2014</xref>), inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergeron et al., 2015</xref>) or ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Del Bene et al., 2010</xref>) of genetically-defined neuronal populations. In particular, genetically-encoded photosensitizers should offer the means to analyze neuronal biology with stringent spatial resolution, by damaging or ablating defined neuronal populations, cellular subcompartments, organelles or even specific molecules precisely, to determine their roles in nervous system function and pathophysiology.</p><p>Genetically-encoded photosensitizers often show limited photostability, decreasing the amount of oxidative damage that can be induced by light exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, they are typically excited by blue or green light, which shows limited penetration through living tissues and can cause direct, untargeted, phototoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, constitutively-active photosensitizers allow chronic phototoxicity from passive absorption of ambient light. Chemogenetic systems enable selective targeting of genetically-defined cells by expression of a designer receptor that is only activated after administration of a small molecule ligand that binds the receptor specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roth, 2016</xref>). Far-red light-sensitive channel proteins enable activation in deep tissues – even through the intact skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuong et al., 2014</xref>). For optogenetic applications in vivo, it would be highly advantageous to combine on-demand chemical activation of genetically-targeted cells with photoactivation using far-red light. dL5** is a modified single-chain antibody that can function as a fluorogen-activating protein (FAP) by binding malachite green (MG) fluorogens with picomolar affinity and activating their fluorescence thousands-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Szent-Gyorgyi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szent-Gyorgyi et al., 2013</xref>). It was recently reported that a di-iodine substituted MG derivative, MG2I, becomes a potent photosensitizer on binding to dL5** (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2016</xref>). The dL5**-MG2I complex showed maximal excitation in the highly tissue-penetrant far-red light range, and produced singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, molecular dioxygen in its first electronically excited state) through inter-system crossing, with high quantum yield and with little photobleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, neither dL5** nor MG2I alone produced detectable <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> under far-red illumination, and the dL5**-MG2I complex did not produce <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in the absence of light. This system offers several key advantages as a photosensitizer for use in neuroscience applications in vivo. <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> is highly reactive with organic molecules and thus reacts within a short radius (&lt;20 nm) of its site of formation in living systems (its lifetime is approximately 4μs in water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wilkinson et al., 1995</xref>], but may be as low as 100ns in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moan and Berg, 1991</xref>]). Consequently, oxidative damage can be provoked with a high degree of spatial precision by fusing dL5** to an appropriate protein or targeting sequence, to direct its expression to a specific sub-cellular region, organelle or protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2016</xref>). For example, dL5** fused to TRF1, a component of the shelterin complex, was employed recently to induce 8-oxoguanine formation specifically in the telomeric DNA of cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fouquerel et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, as <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> is generated only during far-red illumination, the onset of oxidative damage from dL5**-MG2I is temporally well-defined, and its severity and rate of induction can be regulated by adjusting light exposure time and power. Finally, dependence of chemoptogenetic production of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> on the presence of MG2I means that dL5**-expressing transgenic animals and cell lines can be generated, bred, handled and shipped in the absence of MG2I, without having to house them in darkness; this is a significant advantage over constitutively active genetic photosensitizers.</p><p>Alterations in neuronal mitochondrial function have been strongly linked to several neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Swerdlow, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carmo et al., 2018</xref>) and there is significant interest in understanding how mitochondrial homeostasis and bioenergetics are maintained in neurons under physiological conditions and following mitochondrial damage. Prior work showed that dL5** could be expressed within the mitochondria of cultured HEK293 cells in vitro when fused to an appropriate targeting signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qian et al., 2019</xref>). Treatment of these cells with MG2I and exposure to far-red light resulted in decreased oxygen consumption, loss of respiratory chain activity, mitochondrial depolarization, compensatory glycolysis, and secondary ROS generation that was sufficient to cause oxidative telomere damage and cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qian et al., 2019</xref>). Unlike transformed cells in culture, however, neurons are generally dependent on mitochondrial function for ATP generation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Laar and Berman, 2013</xref>) and this is known to influence the responses of neuronal mitochondria to perturbing stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Van Laar et al., 2011</xref>). To investigate the consequences of mitochondrial damage in neurons in vivo, we expressed dL5** in the neuronal mitochondria of transgenic zebrafish. In the presence of MG2I, far red light provoked specific disruption of mitochondrial structure, respiration and ATP synthesis, resulting in dramatic neurophysiological and neurobehavioral abnormalities. This highly innovative approach has numerous applications as a tool for understanding neuronal bioenergetics and mitochondrial homeostasis, investigating mitochondrial mechanisms in disease pathogenesis, and manipulating neural circuitry to understand the biological basis of behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction of transgenic NeuMitoFAP zebrafish expressing dL5** in neuronal mitochondria</title><p>We generated transgenic zebrafish expressing the fluorogen-activating protein (FAP) dL5** (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Szent-Gyorgyi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szent-Gyorgyi et al., 2013</xref>) fused to mitochondrial targeting sequences from human COX4 and COX8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Telmer et al., 2015</xref>), and a fluorescent reporter, mCerulean3, to allow visualization of transgene expression in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; dL5** and mCerulean3 are separated by a flexible GGGGSGGGGS linker to allow correct folding of each domain of the fusion protein).

Large sensory neurons of the posterior lateral line ganglion express the <italic>eno2</italic> driver strongly and are located superficially, allowing continuous whole-cell patch clamp recordings in intact zebrafish larvae during light exposure. In control zebrafish, lateral line sensory neurons showed similar stable baseline membrane potentials that changed minimally during 20–30 min of far-red light exposure (baseline versus final membrane potential: WT-MG2I, −66.9 ± 1.4 vs. −63.2 ± 1.2 mV; NeuMitoFAP, −64.4 ± 1.2 vs. −60.8 ± 2.5 mV; mean ± SE; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). Sensory neurons in NeuMitoFAP-MG2I larvae showed similar baseline membrane potential to controls but depolarized progressively during exposure to far-red light, initially reaching threshold potential and firing high-frequency trains of action potentials, then depolarizing further to become refractory (baseline versus final membrane potential −60.8 ± 2.4 mV vs. −29.4 ± 4.5 mV, p&lt;0.0001, 2-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). To determine whether bioenergetic depletion could account for these findings, identical recordings were obtained from NeuMitoFAP-MG2I neurons, but with the addition of phosphocreatine to the patch pipette solution. Phosphocreatine is a substrate for cytoplasmic creatine kinase, allowing the regeneration of ATP from ADP and thereby providing a non-mitochondrial source of ATP. The baseline resting membrane potential was unaltered by phosphocreatine, but its presence prevented depolarization of NeuMitoFAP-MG2I neurons during far-red light exposure (baseline versus final membrane potential: −62.7 ± 1.4 vs. −59.6 ± 2.8 mV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). Overall, 10/10 NeuMitoFAP-MG2I neurons depolarized by ≥20% of their baseline membrane potential following a mean exposure of 44.3 ± 6.3 J/cm<sup>2</sup> far-red light, whereas in the presence of phosphocreatine, only 1/6 neurons depolarized after exposure to &gt;80 J/cm<sup>2</sup> (p=0.0014, Fisher’s exact test). Transient exposures to smaller amounts of far-red light energy caused slower and more modest levels of depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these data show that the acute neurological deficits provoked in NeuMitoFAP-MG2I zebrafish by exposure to far-red light were caused by neuronal depolarization, resulting from depletion of ATP that is necessary to drive the active ionic transporters that maintain transmembrane ionic gradients underlying the resting membrane potential.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Acute neuronal depolarization in NeuMitoFAP zebrafish exposed to MG2I and far-red light.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made from posterior lateral line ganglion (PLLG) sensory neurons. The inset figure shows the preparation and experimental design (the arrow shows a patch-clamp pipette in contact with a mitoFAP-expressing neuron).

Our data show a direct link between neuronal respiration, bioenergetics and physiology; quantify neuronal respiration and its bioenergetic contributions in vivo; and demonstrate that neuronal death following mitochondrial damage is delayed and presumably dependent on secondary mechanisms. The new transgenic lines and methods we report will provide powerful tools for investigating mitochondrial homeostasis and pathophysiology, and for understanding the neural basis of behavior.</p><p>The requirement of all three components of the chemoptogenetic system (dL5**, MG2I and far-red light) shows that the observed phenotypes were caused by singlet oxygen. The subcellular localization of the dL5**-mCerulean3 fusion protein in NeuMitoFAP zebrafish resulted in spatially-restricted <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> production within neuronal mitochondria. Correspondingly, initial damage was confined to mitochondria, as evidenced by preservation of cellular ultrastructure immediately adjacent to severely damaged mitochondria directly after light exposure. Potentially, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> can react with all mitochondrial macromolecules and the biochemical targets of this reactive oxygen species in the mitochondrion are not yet fully resolved. In cultured HEK293 cells expressing mitochondrially-targeted dL5**-mCerulean3, exposure to MG2I and far-red light decreased the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, III and IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qian et al., 2019</xref>). COX4 and COX8 encode subunits of complex IV (CIV, cytochrome C oxidase), and it is possible that the fusion protein is directed to CIV by the COX8 sequence remaining after cleavage of the signal peptide. In this case, localized <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> damage to the CI-CIII<sub>2</sub>-CIV super-complex (‘respirasome’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Letts and Sazanov, 2017</xref>) is predicted to decrease electron transport and thereby dissipate the inner membrane proton gradient, resulting in loss of ATP production and mitochondrial swelling. Although this would account for the loss of respiration and bioenergetic collapse we observed, it is unclear whether respiratory chain function is disrupted by <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> directly. In HEK293 cells expressing mitochondrially-targeted dL5**-mCerulean3, electron transport and respiration following light exposure were more severely disrupted by a secondary wave of ROS produced by damaged mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qian et al., 2019</xref>). Consequently, the presence of oxidative damage does not necessarily imply that a molecule is a primary target of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, the severe ultrastructural changes we observed immediately after light exposure raise the possibility that changes in mitochondrial function could occur as a consequence of disrupted mitochondrial architecture. Mitochondrial cristae are dynamic structures whose organization strongly influences assembly of respiratory chain super-complexes and electron transport function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cogliati et al., 2016</xref>). Primary <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-induced damage to proteins involved in forming or regulating cristae, for example OPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frezza et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patten et al., 2014</xref>) or components of the MICOS complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kozjak-Pavlovic, 2017</xref>), or direct damage to inner membrane lipids, could cause indirect changes in respiratory function by disrupting the topological organization of electron transport chain complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cogliati et al., 2013</xref>). Additional studies will be necessary to determine the initial, direct targets of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in this model.</p><p>FAP-MG2I zebrafish showed a large decrease in whole-animal respiration following exposure to far-red light. The 12 kb <italic>eno2</italic> regulatory element is expressed in the majority of CNS and PNS neurons, most strongly in large projection neurons such as retinal ganglion cells, reticulospinal neurons and motor neurons, that are predicted to be most metabolically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2009</xref>). If it is presumed that light exposure fully disrupted cellular respiration in NeuMitoFAP-MG2I cells, it can be inferred that <italic>eno2</italic>-expressing neurons account for nearly 25% of the baseline O<sub>2</sub> consumption in an immobilized zebrafish larva. The dramatic loss of respiratory activity following light exposure resulted in profound bioenergetic consequences. The overall 10% decrease in whole-animal ATP levels suggests a much larger ATP deficit in <italic>eno2</italic>-expressing neurons that comprise a relatively small fraction of the total cells in a larval zebrafish. It has been estimated that up to 50% energy expenditure in neurons is devoted to maintaining the transmembrane ionic gradients underlying the resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howarth et al., 2012</xref>). Progressive depolarization of NeuMitoFAP-MG2I neurons during light exposure was rescued by phosphocreatine, a substrate for creatine kinase (CK) that allows ATP generation from ADP, independent of oxidative phosphorylation. This observation formally establishes that loss of neural function in this model was attributable to bioenergetic crisis and highlights the importance of mitochondrial respiration for providing the ATP necessary for physiological functions such as active ion transport in neurons. In addition, these findings provide further support to the specificity of the initial oxidative insult. A cysteine residue within the active site of CK is necessary for enzymatic activity, which has been shown in other experimental systems to be readily inactivated by oxidants including dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Van Laar et al., 2008</xref>), superoxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yuan et al., 1992</xref>) and peroxynitrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Konorev et al., 1998</xref>). The preservation of CK function in NeuMitoFAP zebrafish neurons sufficient to allow rescue of cellular bioenergetics by phosphocreatine suggests that <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated damage did not inactivate cytoplasmic CK isoforms, even in the presence of severe mitochondrial disruption.</p><p>The persistence of acute neurobehavioral deficits in the days following light exposure was attributable to cell death. This was maximal 24 hr after light exposure, well after acute neurobehavioral changes were first observed. We predict that the initial mitochondrial damage provoked delayed loss of cellular viability through secondary mechanisms, several of which may be involved. First, ATP depletion is a well-recognized cause of cellular necrosis. In this regard, the reliance of neuronal ATP synthesis on oxidative phosphorylation may be a critical factor distinguishing neurons from cultured cells, which showed compensatory glycolysis and cell cycle arrest, but not loss of viability, following dL5**-MG2I-induced mitochondrial damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qian et al., 2019</xref>). Second, it is likely that cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis was disrupted in NeuMitoFAP-MG2I neurons following far-red light exposure. Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are maintained by ATP-dependent transport of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the endoplasmic reticulum and extracellular space, and by mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering that is dependent on the inner mitochondrial membrane electrochemical potential and its structural integrity. Each of these processes is likely to have been impaired in NeuMitoFAP-MG2I neurons following light exposure. Depending on severity and subcellular distribution, elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> can trigger either necrotic or apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pinton et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, compromised mitochondrial structure may allow release of pro-apoptotic mediators. For example, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> is retained physiologically within cristae folds; consequently, the obliteration of mitochondrial cristae observed in this model is predicted to allow cytochrome <italic>c</italic> efflux into the cytoplasm, where it can initiate <italic>Apaf-1</italic>-dependent apoptosome assembly and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kroemer et al., 2007</xref>). Since morphological markers of both apoptosis and necrosis were visible, it seems unlikely that a single downstream mechanism was responsible for the observed cell death. The bioenergetic requirements of individual neurons vary according to their morphology and activity. Further, dL5** expression varies between different neuronal populations in NeuMitoFAP zebrafish, because the <italic>eno2</italic> regulatory element is expressed differentially in discrete cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2009</xref>). We predict that the mechanisms by which neurons die in this model depend on the relationship between bioenergetic demand and loss of ATP, similar to other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lieberthal et al., 1998</xref>). For example, a cell with high ATP requirements that sustains a severe mitochondrial injury might undergo necrotic cell death rapidly, whereas less prominent damage in a cell with more modest ATP demands might trigger signaling events culminating in delayed programmed cell death.</p><p>Targeting neuronal mitochondrial function with dL5**-MG2I provides new experimental opportunities in vivo, and the tools reported here will be useful for multiple downstream applications. Use of Gal4-UAS genetics will greatly expand the utility of the approach, because the dL5**-mCerulean3 fusion protein can be expressed in the mitochondria of any cell type in vivo, by crossing Tg(<italic>UAS:COX4-COX8-dL5**-mCer3</italic>)<sup>pt427</sup> zebrafish to a tissue-specific Gal4 driver line. Many relevant transgenic driver lines are available that express Gal4 in dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujimoto et al., 2011</xref>) or glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frøyset et al., 2018</xref>) of interest to disease pathogenesis, in addition to larger libraries of enhancer trap Gal4 insertions useful for functional neuroanatomy studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergeron et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawakami et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marquart et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, by exploiting the dependence of neurons on oxidative phosphorylation, our approach provides several improvements on current technology for targeted cell ablation to analyze neural circuits underlying behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergeron et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Godoy et al., 2015</xref>) The most widely applied method for chemogenetic ablation in zebrafish models relies on metronidazole-induced DNA crosslinking in transgenic animals expressing the bacterial enzyme nitroreductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curado et al., 2007</xref>). DNA damage in this model takes many hours, and sometimes days, to accumulate to a level sufficient to ablate the targeted cell groups. In contrast, the rapid light-induced neuronal depolarization caused by mitochondrially-targeted dL5**-MG2I provides temporal certainty regarding lesion onset, avoids pharmacokinetic uncertainties inherent in chemical approaches, and occurs with sufficient rapidity to prevent compensatory changes in circuity that may obscure the resulting neurobehavioral consequences. Furthermore, spatial specificity can be enhanced by directing the activating light to particular neurons or subcellular regions of interest, for example by using a far-red laser beam rather than a diffused light source to excite dL5**-MG2I. This will be of value for future investigations into the compartmentalization of bioenergetics and maintenance of functional mitochondrial biomass in neurons in vivo. Illuminating individual topological domains of NeuMitoFAP neurons may allow direct exploration of how mitochondrial spatial distribution contributes to maintaining bioenergetic requirements and ionic gradients throughout the dendritic arborization, cell body and axonal projection. In addition, mitochondrial quality control has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurological diseases including Parkinson’s disease, but the use of chemicals that non-selectively depolarize all mitochondria simultaneously precludes investigation of the underlying mechanisms in specific neurons. dL5**-MG2I provides several advantages over other genetically-encoded photosensitizers such as KillerRed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulina et al., 2006</xref>) for these applications, including minimal photobleaching, high quantal yield of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, and excitation by tissue-penetrant far-red light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, the necessity for addition of a chemical fluorogen to photosensitize FAP transgenic animals circumvents the practical challenges inherent in generating and propagating transgenic animals expressing constitutively active photosensitizers, which must be raised and handled in the dark.</p><p>Precision subcellular ablation is likely to have broad applications in neuroscience beyond investigation of mitochondrial function and zebrafish models. Future development of this approach will include generation of constructs that direct dL5** to other cellular components, such as nuclear subdomains, lysosomal proteins or key components of pre- or post-synaptic terminals, allowing resolution of their specific contributions to cellular physiology and pathophysiology. In addition, the system is fully portable to other experimental systems, including mammalian models.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA constructs</title><p>pT2KSAGFF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asakawa et al., 2008</xref>) and pT2-5UASMCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asakawa et al., 2008</xref>) were gifts from Dr. Koichi Kawakami, National Institute of Genetics, Tokyo, Japan.

The lines reported here show Mendelian inheritance of single transgene insertions and have been assigned allele designations Tg(<italic>eno2:gal4ff</italic>)<sup>pt425</sup> and Tg(<italic>UAS:COX4-COX8-dL5**-mCer3</italic>)<sup>pt427</sup>. Analyses were carried out using F3 and later generations after backcrosses to WT zebrafish. A minimum of three independent biological replicates were completed for all experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Double transgenic NeuMitoFAP animals were identified by epifluorescence microscopy for the mCerulean3 reporter. Tricaine-anesthetized larvae were positioned in 3% methylcellulose for acquisition of live epifluorescence images using an Olympus MVX-10 stereo zoom microscope and SPOT camera (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). Confocal images of tricaine-anesthetized larvae, mounted in low melting point agarose in contact with the coverslip glass of a MatTek dish (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA), were acquired using an Olympus IX-81 inverted microscope and Fluoview confocal system (Olympus). Acridine Orange-labeled neurons were visualized using an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Olympus IX-71) and counted manually or imaged by confocal microscopy as above. For intravital imaging of mitochondria, zebrafish larvae were anesthetized in tricaine, exposed to far-red light if appropriate and then mounted on their sides in low melting point agarose at the bottom of a Mattek dish, so that the skin was in contact with the glass coverslip allowing visualization of the lateral line nerve. Images were acquired using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope with HC PL APO 1.30 NA 93x glycerol-immersion objective (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). mCer3 was excited at 405 nm and emitted light collected from 447 to 699 nm with temporal gating between 0.6–6 ns using a Leica Acousto-Optical Beam Splitter. Images were taken with a 0.600 ms dwell time and 4x line averaging. Images were analyzed using NIS-Elements (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY), by reducing Z-stacks to 2D images using extended depth focus, then binarizing the resulting images to show regions of CFP fluorescence, allowing automated measurements of circularity, size and number.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Larvae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4°C for 4 hr. 14μm-thick cryosections were incubated with primary antibody (chicken anti-GFP #ab13970, 1:5000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA; rabbit anti-TOM20 sc-11415, 1:1000, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX) at 4°C for 16 hr, washed three times in PBS and incubated in secondary antibody (Alexa 488 goat anti-chicken A11039, 1:10000, and Alexa 555 goat anti-rabbit A11034, 1:10000, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). After three further washes, sections were incubated in DAPI (200 ng/mL in PBS) and mounted in Gelmount (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) for confocal imaging as detailed above. Colocalization analysis was carried out using Olympus FluoView software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Chemoptogenetic ablation</title><p>500 nM MG2I (synthesized as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2016</xref>) was added to larval E3 buffer at 72hpf (hours post fertilization). After treatment with MG2I, NeuMitoFAP zebrafish were housed and handled under green LED safelight illumination (LSM-G3 × 3, SuperBrightLEDs, St. Louis, MO). Tricaine-anesthetized zebrafish were exposed to far-red light in 35 mm Mat-Tek dishes at 5dpf. A Chanzon 100W Deep Red LED array (Amazon, Seattle, WA) was mounted on a heatsink and fan and suspended from a custom-built light stand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), allowing the 35 mm dish to be illuminated from below without heat transfer to the water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The LED power circuit was controlled using a microcontroller board (Arduino Uno, Amazon, Seattle, WA) for precise timing of exposure and adjustable power up to 160 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Larvae were transferred to 96 well plates at 5dpf under green LED illumination using a large-bore Pasteur pipette with a flame-polished aperture, then acclimatized to the recording chamber for 30 min at 28.5°C. The visual motor response was elicited using green light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burton et al., 2017</xref>) and recorded with a USB 3.0 camera (#FL3-U3-13Y3M-C, Point Gray Research, Richmond, BC, Canada) under infrared illumination (#BL812-880, Spectrum Illumination, Montague, MI). Video recordings were analyzed offline using our published open-source MATLAB applications <italic>LSRtrack</italic> and <italic>LSRanalyze</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cario et al., 2011</xref>). All data were derived from recordings with &lt;5% total tracking errors.

The preparation was continuously superfused with extracellular solution (NaCl 131 mM, KCl 2 mM, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.25 mM, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 20 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2 mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.5 mM, Glucose 10 mM, bubbled with 95% oxygen/5% CO<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4) at rate of 2 mL/min throughout recording. A flap of skin was reflected using a fine tungsten probe to expose the posterior lateral line ganglion. The region was imaged during recording using an Olympus BX51WI microscope with 40x water immersion objective and infrared DIC optics, illuminated with an Olympus U-LH100 IR halogen light source with 32BP775 IR bandpass filter (Olympus, Center Valley, PA), and visualized using a USB 3.0 video camera (#FL3-U3-20E4M-C, Point Gray Research, Richmond, BC, Canada). Glass microelectrodes with resistance of 6–10 MΩ were filled with intracellular solution (KGlu 126 mM, KCl 15 mM, NaCl 10 mM, HEPES 10 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2 mM, pH 7.2; phosphocreatine 10 mM was added for one experimental group) and connected to a headstage (HS-9A × 0.1 U, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) mounted on a motorized micromanipulator (MP-225, Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Patch clamp recordings were made from posterior lateral line ganglion neurons in a whole-cell configuration, using a microelectrode amplifier (Axoclamp 900A, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) in current clamp mode. Signals were digitized at 4 kHz sampling rate (Digidata 1440A, Molecular Devices). A far-red LED light source (Chanzon 100W Deep Red LED array, Amazon, Seattle, WA) was mounted on a heatsink under the recording chamber. Baseline membrane potential was recorded for 10 min, following which the LED was activated and recording continued for a further 20–30 min. Data were analyzed offline (Clampfit 10.7 module of pCLAMP, Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Respiration</title><p>Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and bath acidification rate (BAR) were measured using a Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Zebrafish larvae were anesthetized in 0.015% tricaine and then a small cut made in the distal caudal fin to facilitate absorption of drugs from the bath. After incubation in 40 μM d-tubocurarine for 5–10 min until spontaneous and touch-evoked muscle contractions were lost, larvae were transferred into the wells of a Seahorse XF24 Islet microplate (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) containing 800 μL of E3 buffer, positioned in the center of each well using an eyelash, and then secured by islet plate capture screens. Four buffer-only wells on each plate served as negative controls. After sensor calibration, basal OCR and BAR were quantified over 24 cycles, each consisting of 1.5 min mixing and 4 min measurement. For measurements on dissociated cells, freshly-dissected adult NeuMitoFAP zebrafish brains were incubated with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) at 37°C for 20 min, which was inactivated by adding 5 volumes of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in PBS. Samples were pipetted to dissociate cells, centrifuged at 2000 rpm, washed with 2% FBS in PBS and passed through a 40 μm cell strainer (BD Falcon, Corning, NY), following which cells were incubated with 100 nm MG2I in the dark for 20 min at 20°C then washed and exposed to far-red light using the same apparatus as used for zebrafish. 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells in DMEM (# D7777, Sigma, St, Louis, MO) were plated into each well of a 96-well Seahorse Xfe96 FluxPak plate (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and equilibrated at 28°C for one hour prior to running the Seahorse assay. Inhibitors and final concentrations were: Oligomycin (1 μg/mL; Sigma, #O4876), FCCP (300 nM; Sigma, #C2920), rotenone (1 μM; Sigma, R8875), antimycin-A (1μM; Sigma, A8674).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>ATP quantification</title><p>2 hr after exposure to far-red light, groups of 5 larvae were collected and homogenized in 50 µL lysis buffer (tris 30 mM, urea 9M, CHAPS 2% w/v, pH 7.4) on ice, then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min. ATP concentration was measured in the supernatant using a bioluminescence assay (ATP Determination Kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and a luminometer (LMax II, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA), in comparison with a reference curve of known ATP concentrations. Values for each sample were then normalized to protein concentration, measured using a Bradford assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and microplate reader (SPECTRAmax PLUS384, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) in comparison with a reference curve of known bovine albumin concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Acridine Orange labeling</title><p>A 100 mg/mL stock solution of AO in ethanol was stored at 4°C and diluted in E3 buffer immediately before use to a final concentration of 5 μg/mL.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Stephen C Ekker as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jeff S Mumm (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors describe an innovative chemoptogenetic approach for disrupting mitochondrial function in targeted neurons in vivo. Xie et al. have used transgenesis combined with novel chemoptogenetic techniques to create a zebrafish line that can be used to systematically induce oxidative stress in mitochondria of various cell types using tissue specific Gal4 drivers. This line will be incredibly useful to the mitochondrial biology community as it will enable researchers to test the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in disease etiology, a major open question in the field. The authors have gone to great lengths to show the basic system and the complex effects they see are not due to some side-effects or other technical artifacts. There are some concerns, however, about the true mediators of their highly localized induction of activated oxygen. This is appropriate as a resource paper for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Adjustable damage: The authors state, &quot;severity and rate of induction can be regulated by adjusting light exposure time and power&quot;, which was demonstrated for locomotor activity inhibition. Given the potential for providing insight into mechanisms regulating reparative responses to mitochondrial damage and ATP depletion in neurons, an example of sub-lethal induction, i.e., sufficient for a quantifiable change without incurring cell ablation, would provide a valuable demonstration of this property that would further support the adjustable nature of the tool and substantially enhance the impact of the manuscript.</p><p>2) It is unclear if defects to the mitochondria are the cause of the neuronal activity alterations and cell death. Clearly the organelles do not look healthy by TEM but the effect of singlet oxygen on mitochondrial health and function are not tested. Since the mitochondria are already labeled with a fluorescent protein, it would be relatively simple to assess mitochondrial localization and shape after the insult.</p><p>3) The EM analyses were not well described. Such work – even with the extreme dysmorphology reported here – needs to be assessed in a blinded fashion. The authors could take the assembled scans, encode them, and have a blinded assessment to increase rigor of this work.</p><p>4) Statistical analysis: The 1-way and/or 2-way ANOVA used to evaluate data in Figures 2D, 3B-C, 5A, 5C-D, and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B is not sufficient to assess differences between groups. A post hoc analysis with correction for multiple comparisons is required, as per Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 3B-C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B. Figure legends should indicate if dots in scatter plots represent individual fish of a single exemplary experiment or across all replicates.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51845.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Adjustable damage: The authors state, &quot;severity and rate of induction can be regulated by adjusting light exposure time and power&quot;, which was demonstrated for locomotor activity inhibition.

We now show further evidence of the adjustable nature of our approach and the potential for induction of sub-lethal damage: (i) we have measured motor function during far-red light exposure, showing that the earliest abnormality is hyperkinesia, which advances to progressive hypokinesia as far-red light illumination is continued and cumulative energy exposure increases (new Figure 2—figure supplement 4); (ii) we show evidence of a dose-response relationship between far-red light exposure and electrophysiological abnormalities, including non-lethal partial depolarization after transient far-red light exposure (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2); (iii) we show a dose-response relationship between far-red light exposure and mitochondrial respiratory function in dissociated brain cells by Seahorse assay (new Figure 4F and G). Together these data show unequivocally that the severity of mitochondrial damage and the resulting phenotypes are adjustable by far-red light dose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is unclear if defects to the mitochondria are the cause of the neuronal activity alterations and cell death.

Since the mitochondria are already labeled with a fluorescent protein, it would be relatively simple to assess mitochondrial localization and shape after the insult.</p></disp-quote><p>Rescue of electrophysiological abnormalities by phosphocreatine (Figure 3) formally proves that neuronal depolarization was caused by bioenergetic collapse, which is supported by the decreased ATP levels we measured in larvae after light exposure (Figure 4A). In neurons, bioenergetic crisis characteristically results from loss of mitochondrial function. The involvement of singlet oxygen in causing these abnormalities is strongly supported by the absolute requirement of all three components of the chemoptogenetic system (FAP, MG2I and far-red light) to provoke relevant phenotypic changes (Figures 2-6); formal proof that the deleterious cellular effects of FAP/MG2I/far-red light are attributable to singlet oxygen was shown in prior publications<sup>1, 2</sup>. The effect of singlet oxygen on mitochondrial health is shown as (i) loss of mitochondrial respiratory activity in NeuMitoFAP zebrafish exposed to MG2I and far-red light (Figures 4C-E), and (ii) ultrastructural changes in their mitochondria (Figure 5E, F).</p><p>As suggested, further evidence that the chemoptogenetic system targets mitochondria is now provided by new intravital imaging studies, showing mitochondrial fragmentation in lateral line nerve axons of live NeuMitoFAP-MG2I zebrafish immediately after far-red light exposure (new Figure 5A-D).</p><p>Together, these data (along with data in Figure 1 showing localization of the fluorogen activating protein dL5** within mitochondria) provide unambiguous evidence that the phenotypic changes we observed in FAP transgenic animals exposed to MG2I and far-red light are caused by singlet-oxygen induced deficits in mitochondrial structure and function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The EM analyses were not well described. Such work – even with the extreme dysmorphology reported here – needs to be assessed in a blinded fashion. The authors could take the assembled scans, encode them, and have a blinded assessment to increase rigor of this work.</p></disp-quote><p>For each of 6 experimental groups (NeuMitoFAP-no chemical and NeuMitFAP-MG2I, prior to, immediately after, and 24 hours after light exposure), 12 identically-sized fields of view were re-imaged by electron microscopy. The resulting 72 images (containing a total of 69-83 mitochondria per group) were analyzed by an observer not involved in image acquisition and blinded to the identity of the sections (new Figure 5G). The number of mitochondria in each field was counted and each mitochondrion scored as ‘normal’ (multiple tubular or lamellar cristae, elongated shape) or ‘abnormal’ (absent or severely attenuated cristae, rounded shape). NeuMitoFAP-MG2I zebrafish exposed to far-red light showed 90.4 ± 3.5% (immediate post-light) and 95.0 ± 3.0% (24 hours post-light) abnormal mitochondria per section compared with 0 – 1.4% abnormal mitochondria in the control groups. These large differences were statistically significant, showing explicitly that the dramatic abnormalities observed in mitochondrial ultrastructure were specific to transgenic zebrafish exposed to MG2I and far-red light – and therefore attributable to chemoptogenetic damage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Statistical analysis: The 1-way and/or 2-way ANOVA used to evaluate data in Figures 2D, 3B-C, 5A, 5C-D, and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B is not sufficient to assess differences between groups. A post hoc analysis with correction for multiple comparisons is required, as per Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 3B-C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B.
