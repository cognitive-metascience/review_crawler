Thus, it is fundamental to understand how mitochondria relay information within the cell. Here, by investigating mitochondrial-endosomal contact sites we made the surprising observation that the small GTPase Rab5 translocates from early endosomes to mitochondria upon oxidative stress. This process is reversible and accompanied by an increase in Rab5-positive endosomes in contact with mitochondria. Interestingly, activation of Rab5 on mitochondria depends on the Rab5-GEF ALS2/Alsin, encoded by a gene mutated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Alsin-deficient human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived spinal motor neurons are defective in relocating Rab5 to mitochondria and display increased susceptibility to oxidative stress. These findings define a novel pathway whereby Alsin catalyzes the assembly of the Rab5 endocytic machinery on mitochondria. Defects in stress-sensing by endosomes could be crucial for mitochondrial quality control during the onset of ALS.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32282.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The inside of a human cell is divided into compartments called organelles, which are surrounded by membranes. Each organelle plays a specific role in keeping the cell healthy and also has unique mix of molecular markers on its surface. These markers allow other molecules to identify the different organelles, meaning that specific organelles can communicate with each other and coordinate their activities. One way that organelles can do this is via so-called membrane contact sites, which are small areas where the compartments’ outer membranes come close together.</p><p>Mitochondria are organelles that release energy inside human cells. These compartments also work to keep the levels of toxic chemicals called reactive oxygen species in the cell within a safe range. This is important because cells can die if these levels become too high – a state known as oxidative stress. Mitochondria also communicate with other organelles called endosomes, which receive materials from the cell surface, sort and direct them to different destinations throughout the cell.</p><p>In many diseases affecting the nervous system, the mitochondria and endosomes in nerve cells do not work properly. These cells also have higher than normal levels of oxidative stress. Hsu et al. therefore wanted to find out if mitochondria and endosomes worked together to help cells to cope with this kind of stress.</p><p>Hsu et al. triggered oxidative stress in human cancer cells by exposing them first to a dye that stained the mitochondria and then to intense light. In stressed cells, a subset of endosomes called early endosomes formed many more membrane contact sites with mitochondria than in non-stressed cells. At the same time, the protein Rab5, usually found on early endosomes, relocated to the surface of mitochondria. Human cells previously engineered to produce larger than normal amounts of Rab5 were also more likely to survive oxidative stress. These experiments suggested that early endosomes cooperate with mitochondria, via Rab5, to protect cells from oxidative stress.</p><p>So, how is Rab5 relocated to mitochondria? Hsu et al. searched for activators of Rab5 and found that Alsin also migrated to mitochondria in stressed cells. The gene for Alsin is also mutated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a degenerative nerve disorder that remains poorly understood. Next, Hsu et al. deleted the gene for Alsin from human stem cells growing in the laboratory and coaxed these cells into becoming nerve cells. Experiments with these cells showed that the absence of Alsin prevented Rab5 from moving to the mitochondria. Nerve cells lacking Alsin were also more susceptible to oxidative stress than normal cells.</p><p>Together, these findings show that early endosomes work with mitochondria to sense and ward off oxidative stress. They also reveal an unexpected connection between this process and a gene mutated in ALS. Further experiments are now needed to explore if problems with endosomes or mitochondria, and specifically with molecules like Alsin and Rab5, are responsible for other neurodegenerative disorders, like Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inter-organelle signaling</kwd><kwd>membrane contact sites</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>trafficking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000225/2016-L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hsu</surname><given-names>FoSheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 923-2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hsu</surname><given-names>FoSheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zerial</surname><given-names>Marino</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Oxidative stress leads to the translocation of Rab5 from endosome to mitochondria, regulated by ALS/Alsin, a component associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, leading to mitochondrial-endosomal physical contacts and a cytoprotective response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria, the organelle for cellular metabolism and ATP production, play an essential role in a number of other cellular processes such as calcium signaling, lipid synthesis and trafficking, metabolite transport, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mesmin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ott et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rizzuto et al., 2012</xref>). Many of these processes necessitate communication with other cellular compartments. For example, <underline>m</underline>embrane <underline>c</underline>ontact <underline>s</underline>ites (MCS) between <underline>e</underline>ndoplasmic <underline>r</underline>eticulum (ER) and mitochondria are important for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and lipid transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</xref>), mitochondria fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>), and regulation of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Prudent et al., 2015</xref>). Lipid droplets and peroxisomes interact with mitochondria to regulate fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pu et al., 2011</xref>). Oxidized and damaged proteins can be selectively delivered to peroxisomes and lysosomes via mitochondrial-derived vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sugiura et al., 2014</xref>). These examples demonstrate an extensive functional interplay between organelles, either directly via MCS and/or indirectly via vesicular intermediates. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood and, in particular, the functional relationship between mitochondria and the endocytic system is largely unexplored.</p><p>The endocytic pathway is responsible for maintaining cellular homeostasis by internalizing, sorting, recycling and/or degrading distinct types of cargo molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>). Rab GTPases serve as molecular signatures on endosomes, regulating their biogenesis and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pfeffer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zerial and McBride, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhen and Stenmark, 2015</xref>). Ligand-receptor complexes at the plasma membrane (PM) are internalized into <underline>e</underline>arly <underline>e</underline>ndosomes (EE) marked by small GTPase Rab5, followed by either recycling to the PM via Rab4 and Rab11-positive <underline>r</underline>ecycling <underline>e</underline>ndosomes (RE), or routed to <underline>l</underline>ate <underline>e</underline>ndosomes (LE) and lysosomes for degradation. The latter process occurs via the conversion of Rab5-positive EE into Rab7-positive LE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Renzis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sönnichsen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Ullrich et al., 1996</xref>). Rab proteins can thus dynamically associate with the membranes, conferring functional plasticity to organelles. On these endosomal membranes, Rab proteins recruit a plethora of effectors for membrane tethering and fusion, cargo sorting and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sorkin and von Zastrow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stenmark, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zerial and McBride, 2001</xref>). For example, EEA1 is a dimeric coiled-coiled Rab5 effector protein that tethers two vesicles to allow efficient fusion between Rab5-harbouring membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ohya et al., 2009</xref>). Other Rab5 effectors such as APPL1 are involved in regulating metabolic and inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schenck et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wen et al., 2010</xref>). Rab activation, and thus stabilization after recruitment, on the membrane requires guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blümer et al., 2013</xref>). Rab5 GEFs constitute a family of VPS9 domain-containing proteins, including Rabex-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horiuchi et al., 1997</xref>), RME-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sato et al., 2005</xref>), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis protein 2 (ALS2/Alsin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Otomo et al., 2003</xref>), and mammalian Ras and Rab interactor 1, 2, 3 (Rin1-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hu et al., 2005</xref>). The rationale behind this complexity is that Rab5 must be specifically regulated by different GEFs in space and time. In this respect, the function of many Rab5 GEFs remains unclear.</p><p>Physical interactions between the endosomal machinery and mitochondria serve important functions in cell homeostasis, repair and apoptosis. For example, transfer of iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sheftel et al., 2007</xref>) and cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charman et al., 2010</xref>) from endosomes to mitochondria is mediated by physical interactions between the two organelles. Another classical example of mitochondria-endolysosome interactions is autophagy. Autophagy is a clearance mechanism whereby cells identify defective organelles following damage or stress, and eliminate them via the formation of an autophagosome and subsequent fusion with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mizushima and Levine, 2010</xref>). The mechanism of degrading mitochondria has been termed macroautophagy or mitophagy. Intriguingly, the expression of pro-apoptotic factors such as canonical BH3-only proteins drive Rab5- and Rab7-positive endolysosomes into inner mitochondrial compartments via a pathway that appears to differ from autophagy/mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamacher-Brady et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, our previous conducted genome-wide RNAi screen of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collinet et al., 2010</xref>) revealed that ~8% of the hit genes had mitochondrial-related functions, pointing at hitherto unexplored molecular connections between the endosomal system and mitochondria. This led us to hypothesize that other mitochondrial functions may be regulated by endocytic components.</p><p>Here by exploring the interactions between EE and mitochondria, we unexpectedly found that upon laser- or chemically induced oxidative stress in mammalian cells, mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) releases cytochrome c, and concomitantly, triggers the assembly of the Rab5 machinery on mitochondria, in a process which is reversible and independent of mitophagy. Remarkably, we found that the Rab5 GEF responsible for Rab5 activation is ALS2/Alsin, which is necessary for efficient Rab5 recruitment to mitochondria. Our findings suggest that the Rab endocytic machineries interact with mitochondria during oxidative stress as a cytoprotective mechanism, with important implications for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inter-organelle contacts between endosomes and mitochondria</title><p>We first explored the potential physical link between the endosomal system and mitochondria at steady state. HeLa cells stably expressing TagRFP-MTS (mitochondria targeting sequence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Takeuchi et al., 2013</xref>) were incubated with two types of endocytic cargo, Alexa-488-conjugated transferrin (Tfn) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 10 min at 37°C, to visualize the endocytic/recycling and degradative pathway, respectively. Cell were then fixed and imaged via confocal microscopy. We observed a subset of endosomes that appeared to partially overlap with, or were in close proximity to, mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). To avoid potential morphological changes induced by the TagRFP-MTS overexpression, we also performed quantitative measurements in cells stained for mitochondria with MitoTracker-Red CMXRos (Mito-Red) and labeled with Tfn-488 and EGF-488 for 10 and 60 min at 37°C. All acquired images were subjected to chromatic shift correction, deconvolution, and localization analysis (MotionTracking) based on subtraction of random colocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kalaidzidis and Zerial, 2015</xref>). Tfn and EGF were efficiently internalized at 10 min, and further sorted to distinct perinuclear compartments representing RE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maxfield and McGraw, 2004</xref>) and LE/lysosomes, respectively, at 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Unexpectedly, we found that photoirradiation in cells labeled with Mito-Red not only robustly induced alterations in mitochondrial morphology but also the appearance of GFP-Rab5 signals around mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that certain rosamines and rhodamine-derived dyes used to assay mitochondrial functions possess photosensitizing properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hsieh et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, Mito-Red has been used to perturb mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Minamikawa et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the change in Rab5 localization may be a consequence of alterations in mitochondrial function. Consistent with previous reports, low exposure of Mito-Red labeled cells with a 561 nm laser (~5 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) caused a decrease in mitochondrial and an increase in cytoplasmic signal, indicative of MOMP, and accompanied by a globular swelling of mitochondria within min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Remarkably, laser treatment on Mito-Red-labeled cells resulted in the translocation of GFP-Rab5 to mitochondria, marked by increased colocalization with Mito-Red compared to the untreated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, the frequency of GFP-Rab5 EE in close proximity to the stressed mitochondria increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Post-laser arrowheads). This effect was specific to Mito-Red treatment, because cells labeled with MitoTracker Green FM or transfected with RFP-MTS retained their tubular mitochondrial structures under the same laser treatment and did not recruit GFP-Rab5 to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, respectively).

Despite the localized perturbation, the morphological alterations extended to most mitochondria which changed from being tubular to rounded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref>, 10 min). This is consistent with the fact that mitochondria form a dynamically interconnected network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lackner, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) that appears to react to local damage as an ensemble.

However, due to the diffraction limit of standard light microscopy, we could not resolve distances that are closer than 200 nm and endosomes that are &lt;200 nm in diameter. To confirm that these are indeed organelle contacts, we complemented our study by correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) in order to obtain ultrastructural details. We designed our experimental setup to (1) perform live-imaging of an entire cell, (2) visualize the translocation of GFP-Rab5 and GFP-Rab5-positive endosomes onto mitochondria upon laser-induced stress, and (3) re-image the same cell by serial section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). GFP-Rab5 cells labeled with Mito-Red were plated on gridded culture dishes, laser-treated and imaged live on the spinning disk confocal microscope. Upon mitochondrial rounding, cells were immediately fixed and re-imaged to assess organellar morphology following fixation. The fluorescent images showed many distinct GFP-Rab5-positive puncta in close proximity to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Samples were then processed for serial section TEM, and an inset area tracked by live-cell imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, red arrowhead) was re-located in the thin sections by both nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, dotted line) and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, red stars) acting as fiducial markers.

Serial section analysis showed that the endosomal membrane was in very close contact (&lt;5 nm) with the adjacent mitochondrion of a diameter of ~1.5 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, red), which showed few cristae.

We searched for additional evidence to rule out this mechanism. Mitophagy requires the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Narendra et al., 2008</xref>), which is normally located in the cytosol but recruited to damaged mitochondria, followed by the formation of LC3-positive autophagosomes and fusion with Lamp1-positive lysosomes in a process that occurs in hours (hr) to days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dolman et al., 2013</xref>). To test whether the swollen mitochondria observed in our system undergo this process, we examined the localization of these markers. We first labeled BAC GFP-Rab5 cells with Mito-Red in order to image mitochondria and endosomes at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C,E,G</xref>, Untreated) prior to triggering laser-induced stress. Upon fixation, cells were immunostained with specific antibodies to detect endogenous LC3, Lamp1, and Parkin.

Following laser irradiation, cells were monitored live for 60 min. Similar to the endogenous LC3 and Lamp1 staining, a fraction of the puncta was enriched in the perinuclear region, overlapping with small fragmented mitochondria, but not with the rest of the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), suggesting that a low level of autophagy is activated. The GFP-Parkin signals were mostly cytoplasmic in untreated cells but showed a few GFP-Parkin-positive ring-like structures around small fragmented mitochondria, whereas most were devoid of signal in the laser-induced condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>, arrowheads). Even after 3 hr post-treatment, we observed no significant increase in the number of GFP-Parkin mitochondria (data not shown). The GFP-Parkin ring-like recruitment to these small fragmented mitochondria could be a result of over-expression, inducing some level of mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rana et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, similar to endogenous staining, Parkin was not strongly recruited to the majority of mitochondria. Altogether, the fast kinetics of Rab5 recruitment to stressed mitochondria (&lt;10 min), the absence of a double membranous structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and the lack of significant Parkin, LC3 and Lamp1 recruitment argue for a mechanism distinct from autophagy and mitophagy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Apoptotic signaling is partially activated in laser-induced oxidative stress</title><p>The low level of autophagic and mitophagic response raise the question of whether apoptosis is involved. Apoptosis is a programmed cell death pathway which occurs via one of two signaling cascades termed intrinsic and extrinsic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tait and Green, 2010</xref>). The intrinsic pathway is initiated through the activation of the Bax/Bak-mediated MOMP, which leads to the release of cytochrome c to activate effector caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tait and Green, 2010</xref>). Because photoirradiation with Mito-Red engenders oxidative stress in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hsieh et al., 2015</xref>), we also examined the localization of endogenous Bax via immunostaining. At steady state, Bax signals were visible as cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Upon laser-induced stress, we observed increased Bax puncta around mitochondria compared to the untreated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>). As a positive control for the specificity of the antibody, we treated cells with 10 µM protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), which has been shown to cause Bax translocation to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mikhailov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Saikumar et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, cells treated with CCCP exhibited higher Bax fluorescence intensity and colocalization with Mito-Red compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The observed enrichment of Bax on mitochondria upon laser-induced stress led us to ask whether artificially activating apoptosis would also drive Rab5 translocation to mitochondria. One method of triggering mitochondrial-associated apoptosis is the over-expression of the truncated BH3 interacting death domain agonist (tBid), which is a potent inducer of apoptosis by activating Bax and/or self-oligomerization on mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grinberg et al., 2002</xref>). To this end, we infected BAC GFP-Rab5 cells with an adenoviral vector expressing tBid (Ad-tBid) for 12 hr at 37°C followed by TOM20 immunostaining. We found a strong enrichment of GFP-Rab5 on mitochondria only in cells infected with Ad-tBid but not in Ad-control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Our results suggest a mechanism of Rab5 translocation to mitochondria in response to apoptotic signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Hydrogen peroxide triggers Rab5 translocation to mitochondria and affects mitochondrial respiration without disrupting membrane potential</title><p>What could be the signal that drives Rab5 recruitment? Several possible scenarios such as morphological changes to mitochondria and/or release of mitochondrial-derived factor(s) may account for this.

However, this is not a prerequisite. For example, the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP causes mitochondrial swelling and rounding but without immediate cytochrome c release or cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lim et al., 2001</xref>).

Whereas mitochondria were mostly tubular in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>, top panels), the exposure of cells to either CCCP or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 2 hr resulted in mitochondrial rounding and fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>, bottom panels), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Narendra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pletjushkina et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, CCCP did not cause Rab5 enrichment on mitochondria, which was only observed in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>, arrowheads), quantified as colocalization with Mito-Red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Consistent with previous findings, we found that the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol was upregulated in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated, but not in CCCP-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Since cytochrome c is a known factor for activating caspase-dependent programmed cell death, we also assessed the activity of caspase 3/7 via a 4-amino acid peptide (DEVD) conjugated to a DNA-binding dye. Cleavage of the DEVD peptide by caspase 3/7 releases the DNA-binding fragment, yielding a fluorescent signal. Using flow cytometry, we detected ~62% of cells showing strong fluorescent signal in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells, and merely ~0.6% and~6.2% in control and CCCP-treated cells, respectively. As additional controls of the treatment, we showed that only CCCP, but not H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, resulted in the recruitment of GFP-Parkin as well as endogenous Parkin on mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32282.025</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Effects of <italic>CCCP vs H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></italic> on Rab5 recruitment to mitochondria.</title><p>BAC GFP-Rab5 HeLa cells labeled with 100 nM of Mito-Red were treated with either DMSO (Ctrl), 10 μM CCCP (<bold>A</bold>), or 250 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at 37°C for 2 hr (<bold>B</bold>).

To test this, we measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in live HeLa cells grown in the presence of galactose in order to force cells to rely primarily on oxidative phosphorylation as opposed to glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguer et al., 2011</xref>). Upon the addition of CCCP, a sharp increase in OCR was recorded compared to the media control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, purple vs orange curve). This is because CCCP causes the collapse of the proton gradient and the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential. As a result, electrons flow unhindered through the electron transport chain, boosting the OCR. In contrast, injection of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulted in an initially sharp decline in OCR, but quickly returned to its earlier steady state within 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, green curve), suggesting that the effect on OCR is reversible. The decrease in respiration rate by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was similarly reported in intact cardiac mitochondria, in which α-ketoglutarate was used as a respiratory substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nulton-Persson and Szweda, 2001</xref>).

Our live-cell imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) argue that GFP-Rab5 is not delivered to mitochondria by fusion with EE. Rather, it may be released from EE and recruited to mitochondria via a cytosolic intermediate. To test this, we collected the total membrane (M) and cytosolic (C) fractions by subcellular fractionation from HeLa cells treated with/out H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and immunoblotted for Rab5, the endosomal tether Rab5 effector EEA1, GAPDH (as cytosolic marker), and TOM20 (a mitochondrial marker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). It was previously shown that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced stress causes increased Rab5-GDI complex in BHK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cavalli et al., 2001</xref>).

The cytosolic levels of Rab5 then decreased at 2 hr time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lane 4,6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We also detected an increase in the EEA1 pool to the cytosol in the long exposure upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, right blot). Since Rab5 in the M fraction includes both the EE and mitochondrial pool, we specifically measured the EE-associated Rab5 by estimating the colocalization of Rab5 with EEA1 by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. We found a marked (~35%) decrease in the colocalization in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

We initially tested a range of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (100 µM to 1 mM) and incubation times (2 to 24 hr), in order to find an optimal balance between a measurable level of Rab5 translocation to mitochondria and minimal cell death. We found that concentrations up to 500 µM did not cause a noticeable cell rounding by 2 hr (data not shown). Therefore, we pre-incubated cells with 250 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> over a period of 24 hr and quantitatively measured TOM20 levels and Rab5-mitochondria colocalization as a means to assess mitochondrial mass and interaction dynamics. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 6, 12 and 24 hr, and either lysed for western blot analysis or fixed for immunostaining.

We turned our attention to Alsin based on several lines of evidence. Alsin is the gene product of ALS2, which is mutated in multiple neurodegenerative disorders such as juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), juvenile primary lateral sclerosis (JPLS), and infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis (IAHSP). Alsin comprises three GEF domains: (1) a RCC1-like GEF domain for Ran GTPase, (2) a DH-PH domain for Rho GTPase, and (3) a C-terminal VPS9 domain for Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Topp et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Functional studies in ALS mouse models have associated Alsin with neuronal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kanekura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Panzeri et al., 2006</xref>) and endolysosomal trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hadano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hadano et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, corticospinal motor neuron (CSMN) in Alsin KO mice display selective defects in mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gautam et al., 2016</xref>). At steady state, Alsin localized to vesicular structures, showing partial overlap with Rab5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1C</xref>), consistent with the reported localization of Alsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kanekura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Topp et al., 2004</xref>). However, after laser treatment, Alsin exhibited a strong and uniform staining around mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>), where it showed significant colocalization with GFP-Rab5 and Mito-Red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>).</p><p>The spatial and functional connection between Alsin and Rab5 suggest that Alsin may also be implicated in stress-induced response on mitochondria.

It has recently been reported that the absence of Alsin appears to specifically affect the health of corticospinal motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gautam et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, in order to directly probe the role of Alsin in a more physiological background without compromising our ability for genetic and chemical manipulations, we generated Alsin CRISPR knockout cells in human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We confirmed the deletion of the Alsin gene by sequencing (not shown) and RT-PCR, and the encoded protein by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

Similar to hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Hoop et al., 1994</xref>), Rab5 was ubiquitously present on endosomal-like vesicles in the soma, dendrites and axon in iPSC-sMNs. The mitochondrial network in iPSC-sMNs was less tubular and contained more numerous and smaller rounded mitochondria than those in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>, Ctrl). Next, we tested whether iPSC-sMNs would exhibit the same mitochondrial response to oxidative stress as observed in HeLa cells. Noticeably, we found iPSC-sMNs to be more susceptible to detachment and cell rounding than HeLa cells when challenged with 250 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 2 hr under the same conditions (data not shown). We thus lowered the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration to 100 µM such that no immediate cell detachment nor rounding were observed during the treatment. We then examined the morphology of mitochondria, the association of Rab5 with mitochondria, and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. At steady state, we did not observe significant alterations in mitochondria morphology in both WT and Alsin<sup>-/-</sup> iPSC-sMNs. However, WT iPSC-sMNs challenged with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed a robust enrichment of Rab5 on mitochondria, but not in Alsin<sup>-/-</sup> iPSC-sMNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>To corroborate these results, we also performed subcellular fractionation of iPSC-sMNs. In control cells, endogenous Rab5 was detected primarily in the cytosolic fraction and minimally in the mitochondrial fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>, lane 1,2,5,6). On the other hand, cells challenged with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed a strong enrichment of Rab5 co-fractionating with the mitochondrial fraction in WT iPSC-sMNs, but only weakly in Alsin<sup>-/-</sup> iPSC-sMNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>, lane 3,7). The lack of Rab5 enrichment in Alsin<sup>-/-</sup> cells also correlated with a greater susceptibility to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptotic signaling, as assessed by the rapid release of cytochrome c into the cytosol within 1 hr and subsequent accumulation, when compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>). Collectively, our findings demonstrate that Alsin is a key regulator for recruiting Rab5 to mitochondria, which altogether, impart a cytoprotective function for cells against oxidative stress.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We discovered a novel cytoprotective mechanism during oxidative stress entailing the translocation of Rab5 from EE to mitochondria. Interestingly, the activation of Rab5 requires Alsin, which has been implicated in early onset ALS. Our results provide an unexpected mechanistic link between the endosomal system and mitochondria that could be of primary importance for understanding the mechanistic cause of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>Different nutrient or environmental perturbations can affect mitochondria morphology and metabolic activities such as oxidative phosphorylation and programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galloway and Yoon, 2013</xref>). Mitochondria can elicit adaptive responses to oxidative stress that may lead to hypoxia adaptation, inflammation, or programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sena and Chandel, 2012</xref>). Our findings suggest that the endocytic system is a primary responder to mitochondria under oxidative stress. Laser- or exogenous ROS (e.g. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced damage causes MOMP, mitochondrial swelling, and release of cytochrome c, leading to caspase activation and apoptosis. Under these conditions, the endosomal system appears to rapidly respond to damaged mitochondria through a rescue pathway, which results in the recruitment of Alsin and Rab5 to mitochondria, inhibition of cytochrome c release, decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption and hence, increased overall cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). In the course of this study, a mitochondrial clearance mechanism was reported where Rab5-positive EE sequester mitochondria via the ESCRT machinery when cells are treated with the proton uncoupler FCCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hammerling et al., 2017</xref>), an analog of CCCP. Our mechanism appears to be distinct from this as well as the canonical autophagic/mitophagic mechanisms. First, we did not observe the engulfment of mitochondria into Rab5-positive EE but rather, the recruitment of Alsin, Rab5, and Rabenosyn-5 on mitochondria, as well as an increase in early endosomal-mitochondrial MCS in response to stress. This is also distinct from the intra-mitochondrial recruitment of Rab5 and endo-lysosomes upon over-expression of the apoptotic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamacher-Brady et al., 2014</xref>). Second, we did not observe engulfing membraneous structures around stressed mitochondria nor upon CCCP treatment. One explanation could be the use of different cell types and the lower concentration of CCCP employed in our experiments. Third, the recruitment of Rab5 to damaged mitochondria occurs rapidly, that is within min, well preceding any autophagic components that we analyzed in this study. We found that autophagy is restricted to only a subset of small mitochondrial fragments that are LC3<sup>+</sup>, whereas the majority are devoid of known autophagic markers such as Parkin, LC3 and Lamp1. We could not rule out that mitochondrial clearance mechanism may still be activated at a later time. However, our data with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> show that the mechanism described here is reversible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and argue for a mitochondrial-protective role rather than a degradative process. In fact, the reversal and recovery of cells from late-stage apoptosis (i.e. following cytochrome c release and caspase activation) have recently been reported in multiple cells lines including HeLa cells and brain cells in a process called ‘anastasis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tang et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that this may be a general mechanism to cope with cellular stress. We attempted to track the fate of individually damaged mitochondria in a localized region after laser treatment (data not shown), but the continuous photoirradation required to achieve a high spatio-temporal resolution also led to a quick decrease in MitoTracker Red signal and undesirable additional stress to the cell over time, preventing us from determining its precise outcome. The loss of Mito-Red signal is likely due to MOMP, as evident by the release of cytochrome c, and not a result of mitochondrial clearance because the outer mitochondrial membrane can be stained by TOM20 and visualized by the presence of Rab5 ring-like formation.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32282.050</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Schematic model depicting the role of Rab5-Alsin-mitochondria during oxidative stress.</title><p>In the normal condition, mitochondria (Mito, red) are elongated and tubular (left). Rab5 (green) are localized on early endosomes (EE) to assemble the Rab5 machinery for endosomal maturation and membrane trafficking. At steady state, some EE make transient contacts with mitochondria. During oxidative stress (e.g. laser- or chemically-induced), mitochondria undergo MOMP and a dramatic morphological transformation into rounded and swollen structures (right). The release of the apoptotic factor, cytochrome c, from mitochondria into the cytosol is associated with a re-localization event of Rab5 from EE to mitochondria via a cytosolic intermediate, accompanied by an increase in EE-mitochondria MCS. The recruitment and activation of Rab5 on mitochondria depend on the Rab5 GEF Alsin (blue), which leads to a selective recruitment of Rabenosyn-5 (light green). This signaling cascade on mitochondria is a reversible process that regulates the apoptotic program (e.g. cytochrome c release and caspase activation) and thus, promotes overall cell survival.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-32282-fig12-v2"/></fig><p>Which molecular mechanism is responsible for the dissociation of Rab5 from EE and its recruitment to mitochondria? On EE, the levels of Rab5 depend on the equilibrium between the cytosolic pool of Rab5 complexed to Rab GDI and the membrane-associated pool sustained by the Rabex-5/Rabaptin-5 complex and a plethora of Rab5 effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Del Conte-Zerial et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lippé et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zerial and McBride, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Prior studies have shown that such equilibrium, and consequently endocytic trafficking, is adaptive to stress and apoptotic signal. For example, Rabaptin-5 is selectively cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis, thus affecting its interaction with Rab5 and reducing the overall endocytic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cosulich et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Swanton et al., 1999</xref>). The activation of p38 MAPK by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also stimulates the formation of the GDI:Rab5 complex, thus favoring the extraction of Rab5 from the early endosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cavalli et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, p38 MAPK modulates the endosomal function via phosphorylation and membrane association of Rab5 effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Macé et al., 2005</xref>). Such a mechanism may account for the mobilization of Rab5 from the endosomal membrane, which is suggested by increased in cytosolic Rab5 and decreased colocalization of Rab5 with the endosomal EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). These phenotypes correlated to a defect in endosomal sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and a block in transferrin uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>), which may be yet another protective mechanism in order to avoid iron overload and toxicity associated with neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Núñez et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, hippocampal HT-22 neurons exposed to excess iron exhibit mitochondrial fragmentation and a decrease in cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Park et al., 2015</xref>). The metabolic effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on OCR is intriguing. Mitochondria require oxygen to produce ATP to drive energy-consuming reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bratic and Trifunovic, 2010</xref>). The observed decrease in OCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) may serve to lower cellular respiration and prevent further ROS production.</p><p>If the stress response triggers solubilization of Rab5 from EE, then it must also catalyze the activation of Rab5 on mitochondria. We discovered that this step depends on Alsin. The C-terminal VPS9 domain of Alsin has GEF activity towards Rab5, and plays a role in Rab5 endosomal localization and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Otomo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Topp et al., 2004</xref>). However, the physiological role of Alsin with respect to Rab5 and endosomal activity has remained somewhat mysterious. At steady state, Alsin is mainly cytosolic with a fraction localizing to vesicular-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Millecamps et al., 2005</xref>). In stress-induced conditions, however, Alsin re-localizes to mitochondria. The N-terminal RLD of Alsin has been shown to exhibit an autoinhibitory effect on its VPS9 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Otomo et al., 2003</xref>). We posit that mitochondrial-induced stress triggers structural changes in the protein, releasing the autoinhibitory effect of RLD, thereby exposing the VSP9 domain for Rab5 activation and recruitment. Alsin was required for Rab5 translocation to mitochondria as this was severely diminished in Alsin<sup>-/-</sup> iPS-sMN cells. The presence of (low levels) Rabex-5 on mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,C</xref>) detected in HeLa cells suggests that other GEFs may contribute to some Rab5 activation, depending on the cell types, but cannot fully compensate for the loss of Alsin function. A homologous gene, ALS2CL, containing only the carboxyl-terminal half of ALS2, may also play a role by specifically binding to Rab5 and forming a homodimer with the full-length Alsin to membranous compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hadano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Suzuki-Utsunomiya et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>What is the function of the assembly of Rab5 and Rab5 machinery (Alsin and Rabenosyn-5) on mitochondria besides its protective role? The stress response triggers remodeling of mitochondria to confer molecular features characteristic of the endocytic system. The Rab5 machinery may be used to bring mitochondria in close proximity to EE and form MCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These MCS may mediate the transfer of lipids and metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helle et al., 2013</xref>), or involve in ‘patching’ up mitochondrial wounds by recruiting the ESCRT machinery for closure, or other endomembranes for fusion, both of which are observed in the PM-repair response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jimenez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reddy et al., 2001</xref>). Worth noting from our EM study, we observed ER-like membranous structure in contact with stressed mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and considering the role of ER-mitochondria contacts in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pinton et al., 2008</xref>), one may postulate that an orchestrated three-way organelle crosstalk exists.</p><p>Considering that Rab5 is necessary for the biogenesis of the endolysosomal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zeigerer et al., 2012</xref>), the Rab5 translocation may be a priming step of a stress response pathway that subjects mitochondria to interact with the entire endolysosomal system, in order to modulate the mitochondrial apoptotic potential. One quality control mechanism is the formation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs), which are involved in the transport of oxidized or damaged cargo to LE and lysosomes for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Soubannier et al., 2012</xref>). This process depends on PINK1/Parkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McLelland et al., 2014</xref>), but can also occur independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matheoud et al., 2016</xref>). Rab5 may play a role in MDV formation, although we could not detect vesicle budding events in our experimental conditions. Once recruited onto mitochondria, Rab5 activity may not be limited to the recruitment of its effectors, but initiate a more extensive endosomal Rab cascade via the Rab coupling/conversion mechanism. On EE, Rab5 interacts with divalent effectors, coupling its activity to other Rab proteins (e.g. Rab4, Rab11) that are required for receptor recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Renzis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Vitale et al., 1998</xref>). Rab5 also initiates the activation of Rab7, resulting in the conversion of EE into LE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rink et al., 2005</xref>). The Rab coupling/conversion may also be initiated on the mitochondria. Therefore, it is possible that the mitochondria-endosome MCS may evolve over time leading to a Rab7-dependent mitophagic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jimenez-Orgaz et al., 2018</xref>), the engulfment of mitochondria by the EE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hammerling et al., 2017</xref>), or conventional autophagic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stolz et al., 2014</xref>). Future work exploring the dynamics of other endosomal Rab GTPases in relation to Rab5 will be necessary to elucidate the precise role of the endosomal system on mitochondria.</p><p>The physiological role of Alsin, although elusive, has been linked to both endosomes and mitochondria. Cultured hippocampal neurons from Alsin knockout mice display an accumulation of enlarged Rab5 endosomes and a reduced endosomal motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lai et al., 2009</xref>). Mutational and linkage analysis of Alsin from human patients show that the VPS9 domain is critical for Alsin function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daud et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Verschuuren-Bemelmans et al., 2008</xref>). A recent EM study on the corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN) from Alsin KO mice reveals a selective morphological defect in mitochondria with enlarged core and broken cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gautam et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, WT vs Alsin KO CSMN show no change in Parkin expression, suggesting that mitophagy does not play a major role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gautam et al., 2016</xref>). We postulate that the pathological condition of mitochondrial defects in Alsin KO cells is related to a deficiency in Rab5 recruitment to mitochondria, thereby leading to a decline in protection from ROS and oxidative stress associated with aging. In ALS patients, motor neurons likely accumulate more damaged mitochondria as age progresses, which eventually become an overburden for cells.</p><p>The primary cause for ALS is still unclear, but oxidative stress is considered to be a major contributor. Mutations in the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), are associated with motor neuron degeneration. In mouse models, an accumulation of the SOD1 mutant proteins results in mitochondrial swelling and increased oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jaarsma et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, loss of Alsin in the mutant SOD1 transgenic mice exacerbates and accelerates disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hadano et al., 2010</xref>). These studies, along with our findings, corroborate the protective role of Alsin during oxidative stress. The mechanistic link between Rab5 and Alsin may present a general or related mechanism in other neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson disease, the most common mutation in the multidomain Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) protein leads to a hyper-activation of the kinase domain, resulting in hyper-phosphorylation of a number of Rab GTPase substrates including Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Steger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Steger et al., 2016</xref>). This may present yet another mechanism of regulating Rab5 localization and function on mitochondria. Future work using different neurodegenerative disease models in differentiated human neurons will provide deeper insights into the disease etiology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines, cell culture, and growth conditions</title><p>The following cell lines have been validated and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination: HeLa (Kyoto) cell line, BAC HeLa GFP expressing cell lines, and human KOLF_C1 iPSC (kindly provided by Bill Skarnes, Sanger Institute).

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Rab5 and Alsin regulate stress-activated cytoprotective signaling on mitochondria&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor. One of the reviewers, Nicholas T Ktistakis, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript of Hsu et al. focuses on the role of Rab5 and Alsin in mitochondrial protection during oxidative stress. The authors find that Rab5 translocates toward the mitochondrial surface under laser-induced oxidative stress, which seems to occur at contact sites between endosomes and mitochondria. Under these conditions, mitochondria do not become substrates for mitophagy, but are rather protected from degradation. In agreement with this statement, cells lacking Alsin are more susceptible to cytochrome c release and thus cannot presumably take advantage of the Rab5-mediated protection.</p><p>The reviewers unanimously found this work to be very interesting, pointing out that the translocation of Alsin and Rab5 onto mitochondria upon oxidative stress was completely unexpected, but that the story was nevertheless very convincing. However, they also highlighted two areas where they felt more work was needed: further exploration of the mechanism of Alsin/Rab5 translocation, and more quantitative data analysis.</p><p><italic>Quantification:</italic> </p><p>1) The authors highlight the transient contacts between mitochondria and endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and videos), but this is not quantified in any meaningful way. In any case, the colocalization itself does not demonstrate a functional coupling, as the authors themselves state. Do the authors see differential interactions between EGF positive endosomes compared to transferrin? The videos are done primarily with transferrin, but what about the EGF endosome? A more careful comparison of these two types of endosomes could help back up their statement that these observed interactions may be specific. Similarly, it's hard to understand whether the apparent contact sites seen during stress are really significantly increased relative to steady state – or what function that may have. Even in the Discussion the authors state that the contact sites &quot;appear to increase upon stress&quot;, but this seems to be a &quot;feeling&quot; of the authors without concrete quantification.</p><p>2) Not all experiments are quantified, and we are sometimes looking at perhaps one cell over a time course (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The major observations have been quantified, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, but this is a single time point and treatment. An analysis of recruitment over time is needed so we can better understand the kinetics – which is mechanistically very important. The CLEM shows one cell, and there is no negative control. While the technique is appreciated, more informative, quantitative EM could be done with straight immunoEM for the GFP-Rab5 showing recruitment to mitochondria. Again, with a more quantitative EM approach they could also quantify ER contacts, which mediate calcium flux from the ER into mitochondria during almost all death paradigms, again correlating this to Rab5 recruitment.</p><p><italic>Mechanism:</italic> </p><p>1) The reviewers were not convinced that the formation of contact sites between endosomes and mitochondria was all that relevant to the translocation of Alsin and Rab5. Finding out how Rab5 ends up on the mitochondria (vesicular delivery or translocation from the cytosol) is important.</p><p>Deciding on whether this is a Rab5 moonlighting function as opposed to an integrated response of the endocytic system to oxidative stress and accordingly modifying the tone of the text is also critical. A number of experiments were suggested, but upon discussion the reviewers agreed that some of them were beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>2) There were also several more technical comments from reviewers related to the fact that Rab5 is recruited during peroxide and irradiation damage, but not with CCCP – and that they do not observe mitophagy. The focus of a revision should be on sorting the links to the apoptotic program.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32282.054</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The reviewers unanimously found this work to be very interesting, pointing out that the translocation of Alsin and Rab5 onto mitochondria upon oxidative stress was completely unexpected, but that the story was nevertheless very convincing.

We chose to assess the interaction with fixed cells, rather than by live-cell imaging to obtain a statistically significant dataset on a population of cells. Our results indicate a clear preferential interaction of mitochondria with Tfn+ endosomes. This result not only helped us to validate our initial observation of increased endosomal-mitochondrial MCS upon stress but also pinpointed the preferential interaction with early endosomes/recycling endosomes (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). The functional significance of these MCS are further discussed in detail under the revised “Discussion” section. Furthermore, our quantifications do confirm the increase in Rab5-positive vesicles docked onto following Rab5 translocation (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref> and new <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>), suggesting that Rab5 translocation and endosomes-mitochondria docking are sequentially linked.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Not all experiments are quantified, and we are sometimes looking at perhaps one cell over a time course (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Using our CLEM/serial sectioning approach we could describe the ultrastructure of the representative Rab5-positive structure and define the proximity to, and morphology of, the adjacent mitochondrion. We believe the CLEM is therefore an important complement to the fixed and real-time quantitative light microscopy.</p><p>The complex serial section CLEM technique, which was required to identify the mitochondrial-associated endosomes that were visualized by LM, is not a feasible approach for the large analyses required for quantification purposes. To address the reviewer’s suggestion for quantitative EM, we used BAC GFP-Rab5 cells either fixed chemically with paraformaldehyde to make Tokuyasu thawed cryosections, or cryo-fixed using high-pressure freezing, followed by embedding in lowicryl resin HM20. Thin Tokuyasu or HM20 resin sections were immuno-gold labeled using three different GFP antibodies, but all turned out to produce very weak labeling. Since in the BAC cell line GFP-Rab5 is expressed only at a fraction of endogenous Rab5 levels (because the BAC technology intentionally avoids overexpression) and immunogold labeling efficiency is generally low, this result is not surprising. Additionally, we labeled sections with anti-Rab5, which also produced weak labeling, and is consistent with our previous difficulties of immunogold labeling on endogenous Rab5 proteins (Chavrier et al., Cell, 1990). Therefore, despite some observable labeling on mitochondria in stress condition, we conclude that the labeling is too weak to perform reliable quantification.</p><p>While the reviewers’ comments are insightful on pointing out the potential role of ER-mitochondrial contact sites, we believe further and extensive analysis exceeding the scope of our current work would be needed to fully address this question. Nevertheless, we do consider it an important point and have now addressed it in the Results (subsection “Membrane contacts between Rab5-positive mitochondria and endosomes”) and Discussion (fifth paragraph).</p><p>Mechanism:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The reviewers were not convinced that the formation of contact sites between endosomes and mitochondria was all that relevant to the translocation of Alsin and Rab5.

We detected an increase of Rab5 in the cytosolic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). We also detected a decrease in the levels of endosomal Rab5. Altogether, the data point to a translocation mechanism from early endosomes to mitochondria via a cytosolic intermediate, instead of vesicular delivery. We have revised the text to describe this mechanistic finding (Results subsection “Hydrogen peroxide-induced stress triggers Rab5 translocation from EE to mitochondria, increases early endosomal-mitochondrial contacts, and interferes with transferrin uptake” and Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Deciding on whether this is a Rab5 moonlighting function as opposed to an integrated response of the endocytic system to oxidative stress and accordingly modifying the tone of the text is also critical. A number of experiments were suggested, but upon discussion the reviewers agreed that some of them were beyond the scope of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestions and consideration, and have addressed many of them experimentally. With the incorporation of new data, we have edited the text throughout the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There were also several more technical comments from reviewers related to the fact that Rab5 is recruited during peroxide and irradiation damage, but not with CCCP – and that they do not observe mitophagy. The focus of a revision should be on sorting the links to the apoptotic program.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this mechanistic point, we have performed further analysis on the differential Rab5 recruitment between H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and CCCP in cells. It is clear from the literature that both compounds exhibit specific effects on mitochondria. However, the effect on mitochondrial respiration is less defined. Given that our mechanism appears to be cytoprotective, we hypothesize that it may do so by slowing down metabolism as a means to conserve energy. Therefore, we set out to measure the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) by mitochondria in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> vs CCCP conditions, which has led to an interesting and unexpected result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>In short, these two compounds manifest opposite effects: Whereas CCCP increases OCR, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> does the converse but recovers over time. To our knowledge, this has not been simultaneously examined in such an experimental set-up. Importantly, we were also able to show that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced phenotype on Rab5 and mitochondria is reversible (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>In an attempt to examine the link to the apoptotic program, we included the new result of Bax staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which shows some degree of enrichment in the stressed-induced condition. Additionally, we showed that over-expression of tBid can also induce Rab5 enrichment to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Mechanistically, our new findings have also led us to discuss our data with respect to a recently described process called “<italic>anastasis</italic>”, in which cells recover from an apoptotic state normally thought to be irreversible. Our data appear to be in line with this phenomenon (Discussion, second paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
