short-term plasticity. However, the frequency-dependent mobilization of these sub-pools is poorly understood. Using slice recordings and modeling of synaptic activity at cerebellar granule cell to Purkinje cell synapses of mice, we describe two sub-pools in the RRP that can be differentially recruited upon ultrafast changes in the stimulation frequency. We show that at low-frequency stimulations, a first sub-pool is gradually silenced, leading to full blockage of synaptic transmission. Conversely, a second pool of synaptic vesicles that cannot be released by a single stimulus is recruited within milliseconds by high-frequency stimulation and support an ultrafast recovery of neurotransmitter release after low-frequency depression. This frequency-dependent mobilization or silencing of sub-pools in the RRP in terminals of granule cells may play a role in the filtering of sensorimotor information in the cerebellum.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>short-term plasticity</kwd><kwd>Purkinje cell</kwd><kwd>parallel fibers</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicles</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-2010-JCJC-1403-1 MicroCer</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isope</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20140329514</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isope</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isope</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003768</institution-id><institution>Université de Strasbourg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isope</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>INTERREG IV Rhin superieur</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FEDER # A31</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isope</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHM1838</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Hartmut</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR15-37-CE37-0001-01 CeModR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isope</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mobilization or silencing of two heterogeneous pools of synaptic vesicles via different frequencies probably enables granule cell to Purkinje cell synapses to better discriminate between the high-rate code of sensory information and background noise.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In neuronal networks, transfer of information largely relies on the ability of presynaptic terminals to convert changes in the firing rate of action potential (AP) into corresponding changes of neurotransmitter release. During trains of APs, the immediate tuning of synaptic efficacy is determined by the combination of multiple parameters including AP frequency, past firing activity, number of release-competent synaptic vesicles (SVs), also referred as the readily-releasable pool (RRP), vesicular release probability (<italic>p<sub>r</sub></italic>), and number of release sites (<italic>N</italic>). To date, the deciphering of cellular mechanisms underlying synaptic efficacy has been challenged by the contentious definition of the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neher, 2015</xref>). Depending on studies, the RRP either corresponds to a large population of docked SVs releasable by hyperosmotic stimulation or to SVs releasable by a single AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moulder and Mennerick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pan and Zucker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neher, 2015</xref>). Besides, there is increasing evidence that the RRP comprises heterogeneous populations of SVs that are differently poised for exocytosis and sequentially recruited for exocytosis. In the calyx of Held, for example, the RRP can be separated into a fast-releasing pool (FRP) and a slowly releasing one (SRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sakaba and Neher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sakaba, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schneggenburger et al., 2012</xref>). During a train of APs, SRP vesicles are first converted into FRP vesicles and then mature to a fully-releasable state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2013</xref>). In the cerebellar cortex, at synapses between granule cells (GCs) and molecular layer interneurons (MLIs), two subsets of the RRP have been described that are also mobilized by a two-step process, although the transition is faster than at the Calyx of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishiyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that short-term plasticity during high-frequency trains is shaped by the differential mobilization of sub-pools of SVs in the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pan and Zucker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). However, the mechanisms controlling these pools/steps upon a broad bandwidth of stimulation frequencies are still unknown.</p><p>Counter-intuitively, the size of the RRP does not determine the direction of presynaptic plasticity during high-frequency stimulation; at the calyx of Held with a very large RRP (700 to 5000 SVs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borst and Soria van Hoeve, 2012</xref>) synaptic transmission quickly depresses, whereas at the GC to Purkinje cell (PC) synapse, synaptic transmission facilitates during tens of APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kreitzer and Regehr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Valera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>) despite a small RRP (4–8 SVs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu-Friedman et al., 2001</xref>) and a relatively high <italic>p<sub>r</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sims and Hartell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Valera et al., 2012</xref> - but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atluri and Regehr, 1996</xref>). Using computer simulations combined with variance-mean analysis of postsynaptic responses, we previously showed that this striking facilitation is mediated by an increase in the number of release sites within milliseconds upon a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Valera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brachtendorf et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying presynaptic short-term plasticity at GC-PC synapses not only during burst of activity but also upon fast changes in the stimulation frequency, as observed during in vivo recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chadderton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jörntell and Ekerot, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rancz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Beugen et al., 2013</xref>). We describe two subsets of SVs in the RRP with distinct properties: a fully-releasable pool that can be released by a single AP and a reluctant pool that is available for fusion within milliseconds at high stimulation frequencies. Moreover, we show that the fully-releasable pool can be specifically and almost completely silenced by low-frequency stimulation. The ultrafast recruitment of reluctant SVs enables the large facilitation of glutamate release at high frequencies and the rapid recovery of neurotransmitter release following the near complete inactivation of fully-releasable SVs. We finally designed a model demonstrating how two pools of SVs can account for the low-frequency depression of glutamate release and its ultrafast recovery at high frequencies. These results support the idea that the distinct composition of the RRP in presynaptic terminals of GCs implements a dynamic filter of neuronal activity. This may explain how sensory inputs covering a wide range of firing rates are processed within the cerebellar cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Low-frequency depression at the granule cell-Purkinje cell synapse</title><p>In order to better understand the mechanisms underlying the strong facilitation of glutamate release during repetitive stimulations of the GC-PC synapse, we first measured synaptic transmission over a broad range of frequencies using transverse cerebellar slices prepared from young mice (P18 to P25).

Since asynchronous release can be detected by changes in the charge/amplitude ratio, we measured the charge and peak amplitude of EPSC during 50 Hz and 2 Hz stimulation. The perfect superimposition of normalized charges and amplitudes at any stimulus number during 50 Hz and 2 Hz trains suggested that our stimulation protocol did not evoke asynchronous release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then estimated the number of quanta released during stimulation. Values of quantal parameters described at unitary GC-PC synapses of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>) were used to estimate the number of quanta released at GC-PC synapse during stimulation at 2 Hz, 50 Hz and 100 Hz. The number of PFs stimulated in each experiment was estimated by dividing the mean value of EPSC amplitude at 0.033 Hz by the median EPSC amplitude obtained at unitary GC-PC synapses (5.3 pA, including release failure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). The number of quanta released at any synaptic terminal during each protocol was estimated by dividing the cumulative EPSC amplitude by the number of PFs stimulated and by the mean value of the quantal content obtained at unitary GC-PC synapse (8 pA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). Our estimation does not take in account the ~10% of GC boutons that contain two active zones and make contact on two dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu-Friedman et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, the estimation of the number of quanta released at individual GC terminals have been underestimated through overestimations of the number of PFs recruited by external stimulation. Nevertheless, these errors should be constant in all the stimulation paradigms and we believe that the comparison between cumulative values of quanta released at individual GC terminals are relevant information. Cumulative EPSC amplitude plots demonstrate that the total number of quanta released is proportional to the stimulation frequency. However, although initial facilitation during the first two or three pulses is higher at 10 ms than at 20 ms intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Valera et al., 2012</xref>) no difference was observed in the maximal recruitment of releasable SVs between 50 Hz and 100 Hz (number of quanta released per bouton at 50 Hz = 39.47 ± 2.75, <italic>n = 9</italic> compared to 40.14 ± 7.50 at 100 Hz, <italic>n = 27</italic>, p=0.82, <italic>t</italic>-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, at 2 Hz, the synaptic responses did not facilitate during the first stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>) and depressed rapidly after a mean delay of 7 stimuli ± 5 stimuli (<italic>n</italic> = 35) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). We named this rapid blockage of synaptic transmission ‘low frequency depression’ (LFD).

Nevertheless, repetitive extracellular stimulations of PFs can decrease the excitability of fibers excitability due to K<sup>+</sup> accumulation in the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kocsis et al., 1983</xref>). To test, whether LFD was caused by decreased excitability of PFs, we placed the stimulation electrode in the granule cell layer (GCL) to stimulate clusters of GC somata rather than beams of PFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The lack of any significant change in the onset and the kinetics of depression after stimulating GC somata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>) suggested that impaired PF excitability did not cause LFD.</p><p>While the onset and the plateau of LFD varied among PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), the depression could be reliably induced in a given PC as long as the recording of EPSCs could be maintained. In a series of 8 experiments, two LFD (LFD#1 and LFD#2) separated by a resting period of 5 to 10 min were successively induced. EPSC amplitudes fully recovered after the resting period following the end of LFD#1 protocol and the time courses of EPSCs amplitude of LFD#1 LFD#2 were identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>).

To test the latter mechanism, we studied whether the recovery from LFD by a 100 Hz train was affected by previous exhaustion of the reluctant pool. Our results suggested that the reluctant pool can be recruited by short bursts at high frequency (paired-pulse/triplet stimulation at 50 or 100 Hz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Valera et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we modified the stimulation paradigm for LFD and used 100 triplets of stimuli repeated at 2 Hz (LFD<sub>triplet</sub>) instead of the 300 single pulses at 2 Hz (LFD). The total number of stimuli was the same in LFD<sub>triplet</sub> and LFD. The triplet frequency was changed from 10 Hz to 200 Hz during the experiment. Since LFD protocols can be repeated several times after a recovery time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), we systematically applied the LFD and LFD<sub>triplet</sub> protocols to each PC recorded. Strikingly, the level of recovery after LFD<sub>triplet</sub> was inversely proportional to the frequency of triplet stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). For example, when triplets frequency was set at 200 Hz during LFD<sub>triplet</sub>, synaptic transmission hardly recovered (maximal recovery 38.9%±7.19 <italic>n</italic> = 6, compared to 196.7%±8.7, after LFD, <italic>n</italic> = 27, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This finding suggested that LFD<sub>triplet</sub> stimulation depleted or disabled the population of SVs that support the recovery from LFD. If SVs released only during LFD<sub>triplet</sub> (that is, at the second and third pulse of triplet stimulation) and during recovery by 100 Hz train belong to the same pool (the reluctant pool), then the number of quanta released during LFD and recovery train or during LFD<sub>triplet</sub> and recovery train should be the same. We next applied LFD and LFD<sub>triplet</sub> (triplet at 100 Hz) successively in the same cells followed by the application of a 100 Hz recovery train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Cumulative EPSC amplitudes were determined, and the approximate number of quanta released for the whole protocol (LFD or LFD<sub>triplet</sub> +recovery train) was estimated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The normalized cumulative EPSC amplitude was higher during LFD<sub>triplet</sub> than during LFD (6440.9 ± 945% for LFD compared to 9353.5 ± 1199.9% for LFD<sub>triplet</sub>, p&lt;0.001, paired <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>n</italic> = 18, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). This suggests that reluctant SVs were recruited by the triplet stimulation. When the cumulative EPSC amplitude measured during the recovery train was added, no significant differences were observed between the two protocols (11696.3 ± 1163.6% for LFD and recovery train compared to 11379.0 ± 1349.6% for LFD<sub>triplet</sub> and recovery train, p=0.61, paired <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>n</italic> = 18, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). This suggests that SVs recruited only during LFD<sub>triplet</sub> or only during recovery train belong to the same reluctant pool. Accordingly, the calculated number of quanta released during LFD was statistically lower than during LFD<sub>triplet</sub> (42.7 ± 6.2 quanta for LFD compared to 60.8 ± 8.0 quanta for LFD<sub>triplet</sub>, p&lt;0.01, paired t-test, n = 18, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and the total number of quanta released during LFD and recovery train or LFD<sub>triplet</sub> and recovery train were not significantly different (77.5 ± 7.7 quanta released for LFD and recovery train compared to 74.8 ± 8.9 quanta released for LFD<sub>triplet</sub> and recovery, p=0.51, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>n</italic> = 18, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Moreover, the number of quanta released during LFD and solely during recovery train (that is, at stimuli #301 to stimuli #350) were not significantly different (42.7 ± 6.2 quanta released for LFD compared to 32.1 ± 2.3 quanta released for recovery train, p=0.1, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>n</italic> = 18, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These results suggest that releasable SVs in GC boutons segregate in two distinct pools: the fully-releasable pool that can be released by a single AP and a reluctant pool that can only be recruited during bursts of APs reaching frequencies ≥ 20 Hz.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28935.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Short-term facilitation during triple-pulse stimulation at high frequency impedes recovery from LFD via high-frequency trains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Left panels</italic> an example of EPSC amplitudes during LFD followed by a 50 Hz train of stimulation. <italic>Right panel</italic>, <italic>upper trace</italic>, EPSCs elicited by the first stimulation at 2 Hz, <italic>middle traces</italic>, averaged EPSCs recorded during the LFD plateau (stimuli #280 to #300), <italic>bottom traces</italic>, EPSC recorded during the 50 Hz train applied 500 ms after the 2 Hz stimulation (artifacts subtracted).

These SVs become replenished in two steps. The first step corresponds to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent priming step (R<sub>0</sub>→R<sub>1</sub>) and the second one to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent filling step (R<sub>1</sub>→V). In this case, R<sub>0</sub>+R<sub>1</sub> and V correspond to the reluctant and the fully-releasable pool, respectively, as observed in our experiments. In the simulations, release was triggered by Gaussian-shaped Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals with amplitudes of ~22 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent recruitment was assumed to be driven by residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) with an initial amplitude of 520 nM and a decay constant of 42 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brenowitz and Regehr, 2007</xref>). During high-frequency stimulation (100 Hz), this residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> sums linearly during 50 stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brenowitz and Regehr, 2007</xref>), building up to a steady state amplitude of ~2 µM. This high concentration of residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> drove rapid recruitment of SVs from the reluctant pool into the fully-releasable pool causing a transient increase of the latter pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Valera et al., 2012</xref>). Acting in concert with slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> unbinding from the release sensor, which generates a moderate facilitation on the ms timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bornschein et al., 2013</xref>), SV recruitment resulted in prolonged and facilitated release consistent with our experimental observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>, compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). On the other hand, during low-frequency stimulation (2 Hz), residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> dropped back to its resting level between pulses and recruited SVs returned to the reluctant pool between stimuli. This resulted in the progressive depletion of fully-releasable SVs, leading to LFD. Renewed driving of the depressed model at high-frequency reproduced a rapid recovery from LFD and was followed by facilitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), thus illustrating the recruitment of the reluctant pool.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28935.009</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Models of LFD and short-term facilitation. </title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Left,</italic> scheme illustrating the sequential model of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and release at the PF-PC synapse.

The single pool model incorporates an ‘allosteric’ release sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lou et al., 2005</xref>) and a replenishment step at a fixed, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent rate (one-pool model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wölfel et al., 2007</xref>). The parallel pool model postulates two pools of releasable SVs (SRP and FRP, see introduction) with fast and slow intrinsic release rates (parallel two-pool model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wölfel et al., 2007</xref>). In both models, the pools are replenished at a fixed rate independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Both models predict a depression of release during high-frequency stimulation and a strong facilitation during sustained low-frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>). This is in stark contrast to our experimental results that show the opposite behavior of GC synapses. The latter two models successfully described several aspects of release at the depressing calyx of Held synapse that operates with a very large RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sätzler et al., 2002</xref>) but cannot explain the release mechanisms at GC-PC synapses, which are based on a small number of releasable SVs and a rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> driven recruitment of SVs.</p><p>Taken together, these findings show that several aspects of our experimental findings, in particular high-frequency facilitation and LFD, can be reproduced by a simple sequential two-pool model with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent recruitment.

For example, when both the fully-releasable pool and the reluctant pool have been depleted by high-frequency stimulation, the replenishment should start first in the reluctant pool, and then the fully-releasable pool can be reloaded. To test this hypothesis, we determined the recovery kinetics of the fully-releasable pool after LFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, red points) and LFD<sub>triplet</sub> (triplet at 200 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, blue points) by applying low-frequency stimulation at 0.033 Hz starting 30 s after the end of the LFD protocol. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, full recovery after LFD was described by a single exponential function (tau = 153.8 s, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.93), indicating a single-step process. Recovery following LFD<sub>triplet</sub> also followed a single exponential time course (tau = 212.8 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) but started with a long delay. Averaged time courses show that simple 90 s shift led to an identical monoexponential recovery in both LFD (mean tau = 156.3 s, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.98, <italic>n</italic> = 8) and LFD<sub>triplet</sub> (mean tau = 149.3 s, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.96, <italic>n</italic> = 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). The delay preceding the exponential recovery from depression after LFD<sub>triplet</sub> (~90 s) may reflect the time required to reconstitute the reluctant pool. To test this possibility, the following paradigm was designed: SVs from both the reluctant and fully-releasable pools were depleted by LFD<sub>triplet</sub> (triplets at 100 Hz), then a 100 Hz test train was applied after a variable resting period (500 ms, 10 s or 1 min of rest after the end of LFD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, amplitudes of EPSCs during the test trains increased proportionally to the length of the resting period. More interestingly, after 1 min of rest, the first responses in the test train were still fully blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) whereas the amplitudes of the late responses reflecting the recruitment of the releasable pool (after stimuli # 11–12 in the test train) were similar to the corresponding responses in the control train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This demonstrates that even after 1 min of rest, no SVs from the fully-releasable pool were ready to be released, despite partial reconstitution of the reluctant pool.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28935.010</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Kinetics of recovery from LFD and LFD<sub>triplet</sub>. </title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Left</italic>, superimposition of the time course of LFD and LFD<sub>triplet</sub> (triplet stimulation at 200 Hz) elicited successively in the same cell after establishing a baseline of at least 10 successive stimuli at 0.033 Hz. <italic>Right</italic>, recovery from depression probed 30 s after the end of both LFD and LFD<sub>triplet</sub> by a 0.033 Hz stimulation.

Accordingly, LFD and the recovery from LFD by 100 Hz train were monitored before and after application of 10 µM EGTA-AM. Bath application of 10 µM EGTA-AM did not affect the basal release of glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>) and the time course of LFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F–H</xref>) whereas the recovery from LFD was slowed-down and reduced during the first responses of the 100 Hz train.

The reduction in the number of reluctant SVs recruited by a 100 Hz recovery train following an alteration of the spatiotemporal profile of Ca<sup>2+</sup> confirms our simulation that suggests that one transition step from the reluctant state to the fully-releasable is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present work demonstrates that the release of glutamate and the presynaptic short-term plasticity at GC-PC synapses are shaped by two pools of releasable SVs, namely fully-releasable SVs and reluctant SVs, which are differentially poised for exocytosis.

Here, we propose that the RRP is restricted to the fully-releasable pool, that is, to the only SVs that can be released by a single AP (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miki et al., 2016</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mechanism underlying the recruitment of reluctant SVs</title><p>We cannot exclude that GC boutons are heterogeneous and divided in subsets equipped only with the fully-releasable pool, only with the reluctant pool or with both pools. Nevertheless, we previously showed that stimulations of unitary GC-PC synapses and stimulations of beam of PFs gave similar values of the PPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Valera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brachtendorf et al., 2015</xref>). Since the ultrafast recruitment of the reluctant pool underlies part of the strong paired-pulse facilitation observed at GC-PC synapses, we believe that most of GC terminals are equipped with both pools. Our simulation and experimental findings show that the recruitment of reluctant SVs is achieved via both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent steps. Several presynaptic proteins involved in priming stages bear C2-domains that mediate their actions in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent priming processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pinheiro et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, two C2-domain-containing proteins have been implicated in short-term facilitation, synaptotagmin 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jackman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackman and Regehr, 2017</xref>) and Munc13s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augustin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Synaptotagmin 7 is unlikely to play a role in the ultrafast recruitment of SVs from the reluctant pool because of the slow kinetics of its C2A domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hui et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brandt et al., 2012</xref> but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackman and Regehr, 2017</xref>).

The step back to the reluctant state may correspond to an ‘a posteriori’ mechanism impeding the functioning of active release sites in the low-frequency range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wölfel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schneggenburger et al., 2012</xref>). After SV fusion, release sites have to be purged of SV membranes and the time course of this clearance by endocytosis may act as a limiting factor for exocytosis during repetitive activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hosoi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hua et al., 2013</xref>).

Most of this information is conveyed to the granular layer, the input stage of the cerebellar cortex, via the mossy fiber (MF) pathway.

A fast and sequential recruitment of a ‘replacement pool’ in ‘a docked pool’ accounting for paired-pulse facilitation has been recently described at GC-MLI synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). The GC-PC synapse is unique, because it allows for inactivation of the fully-releasable pool by low-frequency stimulation. The combination of both mechanisms endows these synapses with the striking ability to filter repetitive activities around 2 Hz and to invert the orientation of presynaptic plasticity (full depression versus strong facilitation) depending on the stimulation frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Upon joint movement, their firing rate shifts instantaneously into burst mode with frequencies ranging from ~50 Hz to 300 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jörntell and Ekerot, 2006</xref>). Based on our work, we propose that GC-PC synapses filter GC activity. In the absence of sensory activity, GC inputs to PCs are silenced as most SVs are in the reluctant state. During joint movement, the efficient transmission of high-frequency activity from MF to GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saviane and Silver, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rancz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hallermann et al., 2010</xref>) and from GC to PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Valera et al., 2012</xref>) is enabled by the recruitment of the reluctant pool at GC-PC terminals. The efficient filtering of low-frequency activity would enhance the signal to noise ratio and enable PCs to discern sensory signals from spontaneous activity in GCs. Future in vivo studies will reveal whether this model correspond to a realistic process of information in the cerebellar cortex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experimental protocols are in accordance with European and French guidelines for animal experimentation and have been approved by the Bas-Rhin veterinary office, Strasbourg, France (authorization number A 67–311 to FD).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Slice preparation </title><p>Acute horizontal cerebellar slices were prepared from male C57Bl/6 mice aged 18–25 days.

Recordings were made at 34°C in PCs located in the vermis. PCs were visualized using infrared contrast optics on an Olympus BX51WI upright microscope. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices, USA). Pipette (2.5–3 MΩresistance) capacitance was cancelled and series resistance (R<sub>s</sub>) between 5 and 8 mΩ was compensated at 80%.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Doussau et al. examined the organization of the synaptic vesicle pool mediating glutamate release and plasticity at the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse. They found that a long-lasting 2 Hz stimulation depletes a fully-releasable SV pool and that subsequent high frequency stimulation instantaneously recruited a second, reluctant SV pool. This reluctant pool could not be recruited during the 2 Hz single action potential stimulation, yet high frequency triplets applied at 2 Hz recruited both pools. Thus, the authors describe a mechanism that can shift from full depression to maximal strength within a few stimuli at high frequency. This constitutes an efficient mechanism to enhance the signal to noise ratio of distinct sensory inputs.</p><p>Although easily releasable and reluctantly releasable SV pools are conceptually not new, the present study beautifully presents a novel and exciting presynaptic mechanism of information processing that could be of general relevance. The activity-dependent recruitment of various pools could act as second layer that can potentially code relevant information about the previous firing history of the cell. This synapse shows remarkable dichotomy in synaptic plasticity, their plastic properties change in an activity-dependent manner. The question of how this happens is intriguing. The authors' suggestion that this phenomenon can be explained by a two-pool vesicle model is solidly built on previous publication, it is logical and carefully assessed in the manuscript. The first part of the manuscript provides detailed experimental data on the parameters of the bidirectional presynaptic plasticity. These experiments are well thought out and carefully executed. The idea of using triplets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is very clever and creative. The quality of the collected data is high. Using modeling, the authors show that the two-pool model is suitable to explain their experimental observations. This section is very thoughtful, the chosen models are a nice representation of the known models, and the author made a good job describing them to a wider audience who might not have modelling experience.</p><p>While all the reviewers congratulate the authors on high-quality data and on combination of experiments and modelling, there are some points that should be addressed before publication of the manuscript:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>At what frequency range can LFD be triggered in this synapse? This might be important because Jörntell and Ekerot show a range of 5-10 Hz for spontaneous activity.</p><p>Does the recruitment of the reluctant pool also occur after 25-30 stimuli at 2 Hz, when depression has started to set in but is not yet fully expressed? This might be important when considering the results published by Jörntell and Ekerot. The increase in signal to noise may not be as strong in this case as compared to full depression after 300 stimuli.</p><p>How can the authors be sure that they indeed record from a constant and stable set of terminals throughout their experiments? Given a q of 8 pA at a single varicosity Schmidt et al. (2013), the large EPSCs recorded by the authors suggest that in the order of 100 varicosities are typically stimulated, if one PF forms several varicosities per PC and considering multiple AZs (some have two, Xu-Friedman 2001), the number of stimulated PFs could be as low as 20-30. With these assumptions, it is actually a bit surprising that GC stimulation yielded almost the same EPSC amplitudes than PF stimulation. Also, the conclusions with regard to vesicle pools are more complicated because theoretically one group of PFs could have only &quot;fully-releasable&quot; vesicles and another group could have only &quot;reluctant&quot; vesicles. In this case, the overall conclusions would be different, at least when considering a single GC-PC connection rather than an ensemble of such connections.

This might be important because Jörntell and Ekerot show a range of 5-10 Hz for spontaneous activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the frequency range that can trigger LFD is an important issue for cerebellar physiology. Since we hypothesize that LFD may increase the signal to noise ratio, it is important to test whether physiological values of GC spontaneous firing rate (i.e. in absence of sensorimotor inputs) may trigger LFD. in vivo GC recordings was first performed in crus I and IIa by Chadderton et al. (Nature, 2004, PMID 15103377) who found a mean value of 0.4 Hz ± 0.2 Hz. Jörntell and Ekerot (J. Neurosci, 2006, PMID 17093099) found different values and notice that “generally, strong peripheral activation was associated with low spontaneous activity [of GCs] and vice versa”. As mentioned in the Discussion, frequencies chosen in our work for triggering LFD and for the recovery are in the range of the firing frequencies found by Jörntell and Ekerot recorded in GCs responding strongly or moderately to joint movement inputs. However, as mentioned by the reviewers, these GCs fire spontaneously at frequencies higher than 2 Hz (6 Hz ± 3 Hz, Jörntell and Ekerot 2006, Table 3, PMID 17093099).</p><p>Accordingly, we performed a new set of experiments in which sustained low-frequencies stimulation at 0.5 Hz, 2 Hz and 5 Hz were successively applied on the same beam of parallel fibers (PFs) and on the same Purkinje cells (PCs). As now shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, LFD was observed at every frequency applied between 0.5 and 5Hz. We also found that LFD can be induced by random frequencies applied in a range of 0.5 Hz to 10 Hz. It should be noted that 5 Hz stimulation led to LFD with similar kinetics than at 2 Hz. These results confirm that LFD can filter a broad range of spontaneous activities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does the recruitment of the reluctant pool also occur after 25-30 stimuli at 2 Hz, when depression has started to set in but is not yet fully expressed? This might be important when considering the results published by Jörntell and Ekerot.

We therefore designed a specific experiment to address this point.</p><p>The strong paired-pulse ratio facilitation during paired-pulse stimulation elicited at high frequencies is one of the most striking particularities of the behavior of the release machinery in GC boutons. As demonstrated in previous publication, an ultrafast increase in <italic>N</italic> (number of release sites) underlies these high PPR values (Valera et al., 2012; Miki et al., 2016). We then considered high PPR values as a signature of the recruitment of the reluctant pool (see also Miki et al., 2016). To test whether the recruitment of the reluctant pool can occur at any time during LFD, we elicited random paired-pulse stimulation at high frequencies during the course of the LFD protocol at 2Hz or 5Hz (see paradigm of stimulation Figure 4—figure supplement 2). As shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2, extra stimulation leading to paired-pulse high frequency stimulations were associated with unexpectedly high PPR values (that is, PPR&gt;3*z-score of mean PPR value during LFD at 2 Hz and 5 Hz, see Figure 4—figure supplement 2). These high PPR values could be elicited at any time point during the course of LFD protocols and were not correlated to the percentage of inhibition. These new results indicate that the recruitment of the reluctant pool can occur whatever was the state of the fully-releasable pool (available or silenced).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How can the authors be sure that they indeed record from a constant and stable set of terminals throughout their experiments?

The authors should cover these issues in the Discussion (and rather shorten the discussion of molecular mechanisms).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our calculation can only give a rough estimation of the number of quanta released during a given paradigm of stimulation notably because ~10% of PFs establish more than one contact on a single PC (Xu-Friedman et al., 2001, PMID 11517256). Hence, our calculation overestimate the number of PF recruited by external stimulations and therefore underestimate the number of quanta released by varicosity during a given paradigm of stimulation. The percentage of PF establishing more than one active zone per Purkinje is based on observation made on only 39 PFs (Xu-Friedman et al., 2001) and it is not known whether this percentage vary in function of the position of PFs in the molecular layer. Also, 80% of synaptic contact established by PFs on PC are silent (Isope and Barbour, 2002, PMID 12427822) and again, it is not known whether 2 active zones made by a single PF on a same PC are both functional. Anyhow, we added a caveat to mention putative error that can be made in the estimation of the number of quanta released.</p><p>GCL stimulation may lead to large EPSC since numerous GC somata are stimulated by extracellular stimulations. This point was not clear in the previous version of the manuscript and we modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. It should be noted that similar EPSC amplitudes following molecular layer stimulation (i.e. beam of PFs) and GCL were also observed in other studies (for example, Marcaggi and Attwell, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref>, PMID 17110417).</p><p>The segregation of GC terminal in groups having only the fully-releasable pool one or only the reluctant one is an interesting hypothesis. This hypothesis is mentioned in this new version of the Discussion (see first paragraph of the Discussion). Nevertheless, we have previously showed that the properties of the PPR (paired-pulse ratio) are identical between pair recordings (that is at unitary GC-PC synapses) or compound stimulations (Valera et al., 2012, PMID 22378898). Since the ultrafast recruitment of the reluctant pool underlies part of the large paired-pulse facilitation observed at GC synapses (Miki et al., 2016, this study), we believe that most of the GC terminals are equipped with both pools.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: Experiments involving GC stimulation – how do the authors ascertain that only one GC is stimulated? How do they exclude that the hypothesized change in recruitment of PF does not occur with GC stimulation?</p></disp-quote><p>The text mentioning GC stimulation and the corresponding schematic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) were probably confusing. Extracellular stimulation in the GC layer led to stimulation of numerous GC somata localized in the vicinity of the tip of the stimulating electrode.</p><p>We cannot exclude errors due to changes in GC or PF excitability. The fact that values of PPR are identical between unitary GC-PC synapse (stimulation of a single GC, Valera et al. 2012, PMID 22378898, Schmidt 2013) and at PF-PC synapses (stimulation of beam PF, Valera et al., 2012), suggest that GC and PF excitability are not affected by paired-pulse facilitation. However, one can argue that changes in GC or PF excitability may underlie part of the depression during LFD. Because of differences in membrane properties between the soma and axon (Debanne et al., 2011, PMID 21527732), changes in membrane excitability following repetitive activity should be strongly different in both compartments. The fact that the kinetics of LFD after stimulating GC somata or PFs were not significantly different suggests that, change in excitability, if any, weakly contributes to LFD.</p><p>One can also argue that high frequency stimulation may increase PF excitability. However, if an important recruitment of PFs by high frequency trains had taken place through changes in excitability, it would have given rise to a release of glutamate in all conditions and notably after LFD<sub>triplet</sub>. It appears that after LFD<sub>triplet</sub>, the recovery of glutamate release by high-frequency trains can be completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lower panels, blue points); this suggests that, at best, PF recruitment during these trains could hardly contaminate facilitation induced by presynaptic mechanisms. Hence, a recruitment of PF by an increase in PF excitability cannot underlie paired-pulse plasticity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: Why does the magnitude of the response differ between 100 Hz after keeping the synapse at rest and 100 Hz after LFD? If the reluctant pool is independent of the fully-releasable pool, they should both have the same amplitude. The model reflects this quite perfectly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>)!</p></disp-quote><p>At rest, the first responses at 100 Hz (i.e. the second response of the train) rely both on the fully releasable pool and on the reluctant pool. The high value of facilitation observed at 100 Hz is the consequence of i) the well-described increase in <italic>p<sub>r</sub></italic> (due to buffer saturation, residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> …) that leads to a higher recruitment of the fully releasable pool and ii) the ultra-fast recruitment or the reluctant pool. At the end of the LFD protocol, the fully releasable pool has been silenced, then it cannot participate to the first responses of 100 Hz train. In other words, differences in the first responses of 100 Hz train at rest or after LFD are due to differences in the availability of the fully-releasable pool after LFD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Reluctant SVS can be recruited by increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry”: &quot;This indicates that.part of the reluctant pool was actually recruited during LFD upon increase in pr.&quot; Consumption of the reluctant pool during LFD is one interpretation. However, the higher Ca2+ could also have a direct effect on recruiting the reluctant pool during the 100 Hz train, assuming that it does not get partially consumed during LFD.

Subsection “Reluctant SVS can be recruited by increasing Ca2+ entry”: This paragraph should end with a conclusion. My take is that buffering Ca2+ decreases the recruitment of the reluctant pool. However, increasing external Ca2+ also decreased the recruitment of the reluctant pool (see 8A/B). How can this discrepancy be explained?</p></disp-quote><p>In a given presynaptic cterminal, the total number of releasable SVs is supposed to be constant. By increasing extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> from 2 mM to 4 mM, we classically observed a strong increase in the basal level of neurotransmitter release (~2 fold increase in EPSC peak amplitudes). Strikingly, this increase in <italic>p<sub>r</sub></italic> did not affect the properties of LFD when EPSCs were scaled to initial amplitude (onset of depression, plateau of LFD, and decay time constant). Hence, the number of quanta released during LFD upon high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> condition was indeed strongly increased; the previous version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> was confusing and we modified it in the present version to better illustrate this effect. The strong increase in the number of quanta release during LFD in high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> probably reflects a recruitment and a consumption of a substantial fraction of the reluctant pool. Simulations suggest that the fully-releasable SVs can transit back to the reluctant pool during LFD. Potentially, these “newly” reluctant SVs would be recruited by a 100 Hz train but experiments using LFD<sub>triplet</sub> or high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> clearly showed that it was not the case. As mentioned in the Discussion, LFD also involves an “a posteriori” mechanism that might impede the high-frequency dependent recruitment of SVs used during LFD.</p><p>Concerning the EGTA experiments, we also believe that Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering affects the recruitment of the reluctant pool. Therefore, these experiments suggest that the transition from the reluctant state to the fully-releasable one is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent as suggested by in silico simulation of neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim that Synaptotagmin-7 a good candidate for mediating reluctant release.

Whether synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) participates or not to PPF in a central synapse is indeed a controversial theory. This hypothesis proposed by Regehr and Jackman is based or their recent publication (Jackman et al., 2016, PMID 26738595) in which they showed that rescuing the expression of Syt7 in Syt7 KO mice rescued short-term facilitation in hippocampal and thalamic synapses. This finding is surprising because, as mentioned by the reviewers, slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> kinetics of Syt 7 is incompatible with the timing of PPF. We added a caveat in the Discussion.
