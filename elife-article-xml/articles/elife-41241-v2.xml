<italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> is a human-specific gene that, based on its expression pattern in fetal human neocortex and progenitor effects in embryonic mouse neocortex, has been proposed to have a key function in the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex. Here, we study the effects of <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> expression in the developing neocortex of the gyrencephalic ferret. In contrast to its effects in mouse, <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> markedly increases proliferative basal radial glia, a progenitor cell type thought to be instrumental for neocortical expansion, and results in extension of the neurogenic period and an increase in upper-layer neurons. Consequently, the postnatal ferret neocortex exhibits increased neuron density in the upper cortical layers and expands in both the radial and tangential dimensions. Thus, human-specific <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> can elicit hallmarks of neocortical expansion in the developing ferret neocortex.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41241.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human brain owes its characteristic wrinkled appearance to its outer layer, the cerebral cortex. All mammals have a cerebral cortex, but its size varies greatly between species. As the brain evolved, the neocortex, the evolutionarily youngest part of the cerebral cortex, expanded dramatically and so had to fold into wrinkles to fit inside the skull. The human neocortex is roughly three times bigger than that of our closest relatives, the chimpanzees, and helps support advanced cognitive skills such as reasoning and language. But how did the human neocortex become so big?</p><p>The answer may lie in genes that are unique to humans, such as <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic>. Introducing <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> into the neocortex of mouse embryos increases its size and can induce folding. It does this by increasing the number of neural progenitors, the cells that give rise to neurons. But there are two types of neural progenitors in mammalian neocortex: apical and basal. A subtype of the latter – basal radial glia – is thought to drive neocortex growth in human development. Unfortunately, mice have very few basal radial glia. This makes them unsuitable for testing whether <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> acts via basal radial glia to enlarge the human neocortex.</p><p>Kalebic et al. therefore introduced <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> into ferret embryos in the womb. Ferrets have a larger neocortex than mice and possess more basal radial glia. Unlike in mice, introducing this gene into the ferret neocortex markedly increased the number of basal radial glia. It also extended the time window during which the basal radial glia produced neurons. These changes increased the number of neurons, particularly of a specific subtype found mainly in animals with large neocortex and thought to be involved in human cognition.</p><p>Introducing human-specific <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> into embryonic ferrets thus helped expand the ferret neocortex. This suggests that this gene may have a similar role in human brain development. Further experiments are needed to determine whether ferrets with the <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> gene, and thus a larger neocortex, have enhanced cognitive abilities. If they do, testing these animals could provide insights into human cognition. The animals could also be used to model human brain diseases and to test potential treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ferret</kwd><kwd>ARHGAP11B</kwd><kwd>neocortex development</kwd><kwd>neocortex evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 861-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kalebic</surname><given-names>Nereo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 655, A2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huttner</surname><given-names>Wieland B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>250197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huttner</surname><given-names>Wieland B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huttner</surname><given-names>Wieland B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Christiane-Nüsslein-Volhard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albert</surname><given-names>Mareike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010790</institution-id><institution>Erasmus+</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Traineeship program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilardi</surname><given-names>Carlotta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Expression of human-specific gene ARHGAP11B in the developing ferret neocortex leads to an increase in abundance of neural progenitor cells, which results in neocortex expansion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The expansion of the neocortex during primate evolution is thought to constitute one important basis for the unparalleled cognitive abilities of humans.

Whereas APs are highly proliferative in the neocortex of all mammalian species studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Götz and Huttner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rakic, 2003a</xref>), BPs are highly proliferative only in species with an expanded neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borrell and Götz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>). Specifically, a subtype of BPs, called basal (or outer) radial glia (bRG), are thought to play a key role in the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borrell and Götz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lui et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, in species with an expanded neocortex, such as primates or the ferret, the SVZ has been shown to be divided into two distinct histological zones: the inner and outer SVZ (ISVZ and OSVZ, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dehay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reillo and Borrell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smart et al., 2002</xref>). The OSVZ is uniquely important for the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex, as proliferative bRG are particularly abundant in this zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betizeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Poluch and Juliano, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reillo and Borrell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smart et al., 2002</xref>). Increased proliferative capacity of bRG results in an amplification of BP number and is accompanied by a prolonged phase of production of late-born neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geschwind and Rakic, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Otani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rakic, 2009</xref>). As the mammalian cerebral cortex is generated in an inside-out fashion, these late-born neurons occupy the upper-most layers of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lodato and Arlotta, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Molnár et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Molyneaux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rakic, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rakic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sidman and Rakic, 1973</xref>). Thus, an increased generation of upper-layer neurons and increased thickness of the upper layers are also hallmarks of an expanded neocortex.</p><p>The evolutionary expansion of the neocortex is characteristically accompanied by an increase in the abundance of proliferative bRG, in the length of the neurogenic period, and in the relative proportion of upper-layer neurons within the cortical plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borrell and Götz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dehay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geschwind and Rakic, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Molnár et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sousa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wilsch-Bräuninger et al., 2016</xref>). This is most obvious when comparing extant rodents, such as mouse, with primates, such as human. Carnivores, such as ferret, display intermediate features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borrell and Reillo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hutsler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kawasaki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>). Specifically, ferrets exhibit a gyrified neocortex and, during development, a pronounced OSVZ populated with proliferative bRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnette et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borrell and Reillo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kawasaki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kawasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Poluch and Juliano, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sawada and Watanabe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smart and McSherry, 1986a</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smart and McSherry, 1986b</xref> ). In this context, it should be noted that in evolution, the split between the lineages leading to mouse and to human occurred a few million years later than that leading to ferret and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bininda-Emonds et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the above-mentioned features associated with neocortex expansion in general, certain specific aspects of human neocortex expansion are thought to involve human-specific genomic changes. Recent transcriptomic studies established that certain previously identified human-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dennis and Eichler, 2016</xref>) are preferentially expressed in neural progenitor cells and have implicated these genes in human neocortex expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fiddes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Florio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Florio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Florio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suzuki et al., 2018</xref>). Among these genes, the one that showed the most specific expression in human bRG compared to neurons was <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Florio et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> arose in evolution after the split of the human lineage from the chimpanzee lineage, as a product of a partial gene duplication of <italic>ARHGAP11A</italic>, a gene encoding a Rho GTPase activating protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dennis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Florio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Florio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kagawa et al., 2013</xref>). Forced expression of <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> in the embryonic mouse neocortex leads to an increase in BP proliferation and pool size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Florio et al., 2015</xref>). However, as described above, the mouse exhibits only a minute amount of bRG, a cell type thought to be instrumental for neocortex expansion, and the role of ARHGAP11B on the pool size of bRG, therefore, remains elusive. Additionally, the role of ARHGAP11B on the production of upper-layer neurons, another hallmark of the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex, is also unknown. Here, we study the effects of forced expression of <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> in the developing ferret neocortex, which already exhibits several features of an expanded neocortex, including an abundance of bRG and of upper-layer neurons, and as such is a suitable model organism to address the role of ARHGAP11B in the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We expressed ARHGAP11B in the ferret neocortex starting at embryonic day 33 (E33), when both the generation of upper-layer neurons and formation of the OSVZ start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martínez-Martínez et al., 2016</xref>).

To be able to visualize the electroporated area, we co-electroporated ARHGAP11B-expressing and control plasmids with vectors encoding fluorescent markers. For postnatal studies, to be able to distinguish the electroporated kits, the ARHGAP11B-expressing plasmid was co-electroporated with a GFP-encoding plasmid, and the control vector with an mCherry-encoding plasmid, or <italic>vice versa</italic>.

In contrast, human bRG, which exhibit a high proliferative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LaMonica et al., 2013</xref>), largely lack Tbr2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>). Extrapolating from these data on mouse and human BPs to the bRG in embryonic ferret neocortex, many of which express Tbr2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>), it appears justified to assume that a portion of the latter bRG may be neurogenic and exhibit a reduced proliferative capacity. Consistent with this assumption and with the effects of ARHGAP11B expression on neural progenitors in the developing ferret neocortex described so far, we observed, upon expression of ARHGAP11B for 7 days, a decrease in the proportion of Tbr2+ FP+ progenitors in all GZs, which was statistically significant for the VZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>).</p><p>In order to potentially obtain further cues as to the proliferative capacity of the ARHGAP11B-increased bRG in the developing ferret neocortex, we focused our attention on progenitor cells that (i) exhibited a radial morphology, (ii) expressed Sox2, but (iii) lacked Tbr2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Upon ARHGAP11B expression, we observed, in the sum of the GZs, a 20% increase in the proportion of radial Sox2+ cells that were Tbr2– (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This was largely due to an increase in the proportion of these cells in the OSVZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), where more than 90% were Tbr2–. Considering that the ISVZ is the GZ with the highest amount of Tbr2+ BPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we examined the relative proportions of Sox2+ Trb2– and Sox2+ Tbr2+ BPs in the ISVZ and did not observe any significant difference in these proportions between control and ARHGAP11B expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>These findings are consistent with the notion that the ARHGAP11B-increased radial Sox2+ Tbr2– cells in the OSVZ are bRG. Studies in fetal human neocortex have established that such cells in the OSVZ are highly proliferative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hansen et al., 2010</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LaMonica et al., 2013</xref>; for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lui et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, our finding that expression of ARHGAP11B in developing ferret neocortex results in a marked increase in the proportion of these cells suggests that this human-specific gene is sufficient to promote, in a gyrencephalic carnivore, the generation of bRG with putatively increased proliferative capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ARHGAP11B expression in developing ferret neocortex results in an extended neurogenic period</title><p>We investigated the potential consequences of the ARHGAP11B-elicited increase in the abundance of BPs, notably of Sox2+ Tbr2– bRG, for neurogenesis in the developing ferret neocortex.

These data suggested that upon ARHGAP11B expression, either neurons migrate more slowly to the CP, or the neurogenic period is extended.</p><p>To explore the latter scenario, we injected EdU into P5 ferret kits (i.e. 12 days after electroporation), which is the stage when neuronal progenitors undergo their very last neuron-generating cell divisions in the motor and somatosensory areas of the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jackson et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smart and McSherry, 1986a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smart and McSherry, 1986b</xref>). Analysis 11 days after EdU injection, at P16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), revealed a 4-fold increase in the proportion of FP+ cells that were EdU+, in neocortical gyri of ARHGAP11B-expressing kits compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This was consistent with a prolonged, and hence increased, production of cells in ARHGAP11B-expressing kits, which in turn would be in line with the above described finding that ARHGAP11B increases the abundance of proliferative bRG. Importantly, among the EdU+ FP+ cells of the ARHGAP11B-expressing neocortex, 20% were Satb2+ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C' and E</xref>). In contrast, we did not detect a single Satb2+ EdU+ FP+ neuron in any of the control neocortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that neurogenesis in ARHGAP11B-expressing ferret neocortex continues longer than in control neocortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ARHGAP11B expression in developing ferret neocortex results in a greater abundance of upper-layer neurons</title><p>In light of the extension of the neurogenic period upon ARHGAP11B expression, we examined a potential increase in the abundance of the last-born neurons, that is, the upper-layer neurons.

Hence, ARHGAP11B is sufficient to promote neocortex expansion in ferret in the radial dimension.</p><p>We then explored whether ARHGAP11B would also be able to promote neocortex expansion in ferret in the tangential dimension. Here, we exploited the previous findings that during the first week of the ferret postnatal neocortex development, migrating neurons change their migration mode from radial to tangential, which results in an increased lateral dispersion of the late-born neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gertz and Kriegstein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smart and McSherry, 1986a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smart and McSherry, 1986b</xref>). In line with this, the abundance of FP+ cells per 200 µm-wide field of cortical wall decreased about 3-fold from E40/P0 to P16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Yet, the increase in FP+ cells per field of cortical wall due to ARHGAP11B expression was not only observed at P16, confirming the above described analysis of FP+ cell numbers in the CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but was already detected at E40/P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>). The decrease in FP+ cell abundance per 200 µm-wide field of cortical wall from E40/P0 to P16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>) was not accompanied by an increase in cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B–G</xref>). Rather, this decrease reflected an increase in the lateral spread of the progeny of the targeted cells, as evidenced by the ARHGAP11B-elicited increase in the lateral length of the area harbouring FP+ cells that was observed at P16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A</xref> top, B). Of note, the increase in the lateral spread of FP+ cells persisted along the rostro-caudal axis of the FP+ region of the neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5C</xref>) and did not reflect a difference in the electroporation efficiency, as the lateral length of the FP+ area on both the basal and apical side was not different between control and ARHGAP11B-expressing E40/P0 ferret neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5D,E</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the total lateral length of the dorsal neocortex was also increased upon ARHGAP11B expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A</xref> bottom). This increase was observed at different positions along the rostro-caudal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5F</xref>). These data further imply that the increase in the lateral spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A</xref> top, B) did not occur at the expense of the other, FP–, areas. We conclude that ARHGAP11B is sufficient to promote neocortex expansion in ferret also in the tangential dimension.</p><p>Given that the ARHGAP11B-elicited increase in the lateral length of the FP+ area (≈25%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) was greater than the ARHGAP11B-elicited tangential expansion (≈10%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), we explored whether this discrepancy could be resolved by ARHGAP11B expression increasing cell density, specifically in the upper layers of the CP where most of the ARHGAP11B-increased neurons resided. Indeed, our analysis revealed an increase in total cell density (revealed by DAPI staining) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5G,H</xref>) and in neuronal density (revealed by Satb2 immunostaining, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5G,I</xref>) in layers III and IV at P16, but not in layer II, which in general exhibited the highest cell density. Taken together, these data indicate that the ARHGAP11B-induced increase in BP pool size led to an increase in upper-layer neurons that in turn resulted in (i) a thickening of the upper layers, (ii) a higher cell density in those upper layers that were able to accommodate additional neurons, (iii) a greater lateral spread of upper-layer neurons, and (iv) consequently, a greater lateral length of the dorsal neocortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>ARHGAP11B induces the appearance of astrocytes from the targeted progenitors in the developing ferret neocortex</title><p>Neocortex expansion involves not only an increase in the number of neurons, but also of glial cells.

An additional reason to examine astrocytes was that radial glial progenitor cells at later stages of human, monkey and ferret neocortex development are known to differentiate into astrocytic progenitors which then give rise to post-mitotic astrocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rakic, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rakic, 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Voigt, 1989</xref>).</p><p>Upon immunostaining of the P16 ferret neocortex for GFAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>) and Olig2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5E</xref>), no FP+ cells in the CP of control neocortex that were GFAP+ or Olig2+ could be detected. In contrast, while we still did not detect any Olig2+ FP+ cells in the CP of ARHGAP11B-expressing neocortex, about 3% of the CP FP+ cells were GFAP+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Given that ARHGAP11B expression increases the pool size of FP+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>), this translates into an ARHGAP11B-induced appearance of GFAP+ FP+ cells in the CP. All of these GFAP+ FP+ cells were Ki67– (data not shown) and hence post-mitotic astrocytes. To corroborate these data, we performed immunostaining of the P16 ferret neocortex for another astrocyte marker, S100ß (Figure 4–figure supplement 5D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">López-Hidalgo et al., 2016</xref>), and readily identified FP+ S100ß+ astrocytes upon ARHGAP11B expression. These data are consistent with at least two scenarios related to the increased abundance of proliferative bRG upon ARHGAP11B expression. Either this increase results not only in an extension of the neurogenic period but also in the initiation of astrogenesis. Or the greater bRG pool size gives rise to a detectable level of astrocytic cells once the bRG differentiate along the astrocytic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rakic, 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Voigt, 1989</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that expression of a single human-specific gene, <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic>, which has been implicated in the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Florio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Florio et al., 2016</xref>), is sufficient to elicit features in the developing ferret neocortex that are characteristically associated with a further expanded neocortex such as human. These features include (i) an increase in the pool size of proliferative BPs, notably proliferative bRG; (ii) a lengthening of the neurogenic period; (iii) an increased generation of neurons, in particular of upper-layer neurons; and (iv) an increase in the size of the CP that harbours these additional neurons, reflected by a greater thickness of its upper layers and a larger lateral length of the dorsal neocortex.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Increase in proliferative bRG</title><p>The present effects of ARHGAP11B on BPs in developing ferret neocortex are substantially greater than, and significantly different from, those previously observed upon transient <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> expression in embryonic mouse neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Florio et al., 2015</xref>), with regard to BP quantity and quality.

The greater effect of <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> expression on mitotic BP abundance than total BP abundance, in both embryonic mouse and ferret neocortex, indicates that <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> expression increases the proportion of the total duration of the BP cell cycle that is used for M-phase. This in turn would be consistent with ARHGAP11B promoting, in embryonic ferret neocortex, the proliferative rather than neurogenic mode of bRG division.

Furthermore, manipulation of cyclins or cdk/cyclin complexes was shown to lead to an increase in upper layer and callosal projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lange et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nonaka-Kinoshita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pilaz et al., 2009</xref>), which again is consistent with the phenotypes observed in the present study upon expression of ARHGAP11B in the developing ferret neocortex.</p><p>As to BP quality, mouse bRG have been shown to undergo mostly neurogenic cell divisions and to display a limited proliferative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shitamukai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, human bRG are known to be highly proliferative, which is thought to be one of the key factors contributing to the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lui et al., 2011</xref>). The proliferative capacity of bRG in other mammalian species that have been studied appears to follow the general rule that highly proliferative bRG are more often found in species with an expanded neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betizeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, the ARHGAP11B-promoted increase in the number of proliferative (Sox2+ Tbr2–) bRG in the developing ferret neocortex fulfills a key requirement for further neocortex expansion.</p><p>In this context, it should be emphasized that those of the human-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dennis and Eichler, 2016</xref>) that have been shown to be preferentially expressed in cortical progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Florio et al., 2018</xref>) and that have been ectopically expressed in embryonic mouse neocortex, that is <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Florio et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>NOTCH2NL</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fiddes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Florio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suzuki et al., 2018</xref>), show an increase in BP proliferation that mostly involves basal intermediate progenitors. To the best of our knowledge, our study provides first evidence of a human-specific gene increasing the number of proliferative bRG in a gyrencephalic neocortex. As bRG are considered to be instrumental for the evolutionary expansion of neocortex, this suggests that the ferret likely is a model system superior to mouse for studying the role of human-specific genes in neocortex development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Increase in upper-layer neurons</title><p>An increase in the upper layers is a fundamental characteristic of neocortex expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fame et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hutsler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Molnár et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tarabykin et al., 2001</xref>). Layers II-IV are evolutionarily the most novel and mammalian-specific layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Molnár et al., 2006</xref>). Layers II and III, in particular, underwent disproportional expansion during primate evolution. As the layers II-III neurons are the last-born neurons, an increase in the length of the neurogenic period might result in an increase in the number of late-born neurons. In fact, it has been proposed that the length of the neurogenic period may be a contributing factor in explaining the evolutionary increase in neocortex size and neuron number between humans and other great apes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lewitus et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this, we observed a prolonged generation of late-born neurons, increased thickness of layers II-IV, and a marked increase in Satb2+ (3.3-fold) and, in particular, Brn2+ (5.6-fold) neurons in the upper layers of the CP, upon <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> expression (for a data summary, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Thus, also with regard to the key product generated by cortical progenitor cells, that is the neurons, ARHGAP11B is sufficient to promote another feature in the developing ferret neocortex that would be consistent with further neocortex expansion.</p><p>In this context, Satb2+ neurons are of special interest, as Satb2 is essential for establishing callosal projections to the contralateral hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcamo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Britanova et al., 2008</xref>). Callosal projection neurons are considered to play a key role in the high-level associative connectivity, thus contributing significantly to human cognitive abilities, with their impairment causing cognition-related pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fame et al., 2011</xref>). Given that the evolutionary increase in neocortex size is accompanied by an increase in callosal projection neurons, our data show that ARHGAP11B elicits yet another, specific feature in the developing ferret neocortex associated with further neocortex expansion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Neocortex expansion vs. increased thickness and lateral area</title><p>A hallmark of neocortex expansion is neocortical folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borrell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borrell and Götz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kroenke and Bayly, 2018</xref>). Transient expression of <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> in the embryonic mouse neocortex induced cortical folding in about half of the cases in this normally lissencephalic rodent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Florio et al., 2015</xref>). However, expression of ARHGAP11B in the developing ferret neocortex did not significantly increase the GI, gyrus size, or sulcus depth and thickness in this gyrencephalic carnivore. The major morphological signs of neocortical expansion upon <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> expression in developing ferret neocortex that we could detect were (i) an increased gyrus thickness, which reflected the already discussed increase in upper-layer thickness due to the increase in upper-layer neurons, and (ii) a larger lateral area of the CP where these neurons were found. The latter phenotype resulted in a ≈10% increase in the lateral length of the dorsal neocortex, which however did not appear to be sufficient to significantly increase the gyrus size or GI.</p><p>The reason why a 3–5–fold increase in upper-layer neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) resulted in more modest increases in upper-layer thickness and dorsal neocortex lateral length (24% and 10%, respectively) could be that either (i) the increase in the number of FP+ neurons occurred at the expense of FP– neurons, or (ii) that the FP+ neurons added themselves to the FP– neurons already existing in the control condition, thereby increasing neuronal cell density in the upper layers. Our results show that the latter scenario is the case, as we detected a significant increase in both the total cell density and neuronal density in the upper cortical layers upon ARHGAP11B expression. Analysis of cortical neuron density as a function of cortical neuron number across carnivores has revealed that neuron density tends to decrease with increasing neuron number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herculano-Houzel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jardim-Messeder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lewitus et al., 2012</xref>). This trend is much less prominent in primates, which in general exhibit a greater cortical neuron density per cortical neuron number than carnivores. Thus, the increase in upper-layer neuron density upon increasing upper-layer neuron number by the human-specific <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> can be regarded as a form of ‘primatization’ of the ferret neocortex.</p><p>In this context, it is interesting to note that neocortical neuron density across carnivores shows a much greater range of variation than that across primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herculano-Houzel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lewitus et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore hypothesize that the ferret neocortex is plastic enough to accommodate additional neurons, without having to increase neocortex size or folding. A corollary of this notion with regard to ARHGAP11B is that its primary function is to increase the proliferation and thus pool size of BPs, notably of bRG, which results in a lengthening of the neurogenic period and an increased generation of neurons, in particular of upper-layer neurons. In embryonic mouse neocortex, the ARHGAP11B-elicited increase in BPs could induce cortical folding as an indicator of neocortex expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Florio et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, in the developing ferret neocortex studied here, the ARHGAP11B-elicited BP increase did not further increase the GI, although it did increase the neurogenic period and upper-layer neurons. This in turn resulted in a greater thickness of the upper layers, increased neuron density, and a larger lateral length of the dorsal neocortex. The difference between the phenotypes observed in mouse and ferret developing neocortex therefore appears to reflect how species in different mammalian orders tend to deal with an increase in cortical neuron number, rather than the primary function of ARHGAP11B.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Welfare Legislation after approval by the Landesdirektion Sachsen (licences TVV 2/2015 and TVV 21/2017). Timed-pregnant ferrets (<italic>Mustela putorius furo</italic>) were obtained from Marshall BioResources (NY, USA) or Euroferret (Copenhagen, Denmark) and housed at the Biomedical Services Facility (BMS) of MPI-CBG. Observed mating date was set to E0. Animals were kept in standardized hygienic conditions with free access to food and water and with an 16 hr/8 hr light/dark cycle. All experiments were performed in the dorsolateral telencephalon of ferret embryos, at a medial position along the rostro-caudal axis, in the prospective motor and somatosensory cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Plasmids</title><p>All plasmids used in this study were previously published (see the Key Resources table).

Pregnant jills (with embryos at E33) were kept fasted for at least 3 hr before the surgery. They were first placed in the narcosis box with 4% isoflurane. When in deep anesthesia, the ferrets were placed on the operation table and attached to the narcosis mask with a constant 3% isoflurane flow. Subsequently, the ferrets were injected subcutaneously with analgesic (0.1 ml Metamizol, 50 mg/kg), antibiotic (0.13 ml Synulox, 20 mg/kg or 0.1 ml amoxicilin, 10 mg/kg) and glucose (10 ml 5% glucose solution). A drop of Dexpanthenol Ointment solution was placed on their eyes to prevent eye dehydration during the surgical procedure. The ferret bellies were then shaved, sterilized with iodide and surgically opened. The uterus was exposed and embryos were injected intraventricularly with a solution containing 0.1% Fast Green (Sigma) in sterile PBS, 2.5 μg/μl of either pCAGGS vector (control) or pCAGGS-ARHGAP11B vector, in either case together with 1 μg/μl of pCAGGS vector encoding a fluorescent protein (pCAGGS-GFP or pCAGGS-mCherry). For embryonic studies where the position of the electroporated embryos in the uterus was known, the same fluorescent protein-encoding vector was co-electroporated together with either control or ARHGAP11B-expressing vectors. For postnatal studies, pCAGGS and pCAGGS-ARHGAP11B were co-electroporated with different fluorescent protein-encoding vectors to enable distinction of kits. For different experiments, these vectors were alternated. Electroporations were performed with six 50-msec pulses of 100 V at 1 s intervals. Following electroporation, uterus was placed back in the peritoneal cavity and the muscle layer with the peritoneum were sutured using a 4–0 suture. The skin was sutured intracutaneously using the same thickness of the suture. Animals were carefully monitored until they woke up and then underwent postoperative care for the following 3 days (2 x daily 10 mg/kg amoxicilin, 3 x daily 25 mg/kg Metamizol).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>EdU labeling of ferret kits</title><p>For the neurogenic length experiments, a single pulse of EdU was injected intraperitoneally at P5, that is 13 days after <italic>in utero</italic> electroporations, and the animals were sacrificed 11 days later, at P16.

Ferret kits were sacrificed at P0, P10 and P16. For the isolation of embryos, pregnant jills underwent the second surgery that followed the same pre-operative care, anesthesia and analgesia as the first surgery. The sutures from the first operation were carefully removed and the uterus was exposed. A caesarian section was made and embryos were removed from the uterus. Subsequently a complete hysterectomy was performed, after which the muscle layer with peritoneum and skin were sutured and the animal underwent the same post-operative care as after the first surgery. Embryonic brains were isolated and fixed at 4°C for 48 hr in 4% paraformaldehyde in 120 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4.</p><p>For the postnatal time points, the kits were sacrificed by intraperitonal injection of 4 mg/kg Xylazin +40 mg/kg Ketamin. When in deep anaesthesia, the kits were perfused intracardially with PBS, followed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in 120 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at room temperature. Kit brains were then isolated and fixed for 48 hr in 4% paraformaldehyde in 120 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at 4°C.</p><p>Ferret jills whose kits were used postnatally also underwent the second surgery with the hysterectomy. Upon this surgery, they underwent the same post-operative care as after the first surgery. All jills were kept at the BMS of the MPI-CBG for at least two weeks after the second surgery. Afterwards they were donated for adoption. No adult ferrets were sacrificed in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Preparation of ferret brain slices</title><p>Upon fixation ferret brains were sectioned either on a vibratome or cryostat. Vibratome sections were 70 μm thick. Thickness of cryosections varied from 35 to 60 μm.

Antigen retrieval (1 hr incubation with 10 mM citrate buffer pH 6.0 at 70°C in a water bath or oven) was performed for the following samples: all E37 samples, all E40/P0 samples, and vibratome sections of P10 and P16 samples which were used for immunostainings of the nuclear markers (Satb2, Brn2, Sox2, Olig2 and Ki67). When immunofluorescence for Tbr2 (E40/P0) was performed, a modified antigen retrieval protocol was used (1 hr incubation with 10 mM citrate buffer pH 6.0 supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20 at 80°C in a water bath). Antigen retrieval was followed by three washes with PBS.</p><p>All the immunostainings, except the one for ARHGAP11B, were done as follows. Samples were subjected to permeabilization for 30 min in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature, followed by quenching for 30 min in 0.1 M glycine in PBS at room temperature. Blocking was performed in a blocking solution (0.2% gelatin, 300 mM NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min. Primary antibodies were incubated in the blocking solution for 48 hr at 4°C. Subsequently, the sections were washed three times in the blocking solution, incubated with secondary antibodies (1:500) and DAPI (Sigma) in the blocking solution for 1 hr at room temperature, and washed again three times in the blocking solution before being either used for Nissl post-staining or directly mounted on microscopy slides with Mowiol.</p><p>For the immunostaining for ARHGAP11B, permeabilization was performed for 1 hr in the 0.3% Triton X-100 solution at room temperature. Quenching was performed as for the other immunostainings. Blocking was done in 10% horse serum supplemented with 0.3% Triton X-100 (HS blocking solution) for 1 hr. Primary antibodies were incubated in the same solution for 24 hr, at 4°C. Subsequently, sections were washed five times in the HS blocking solution, incubated with the secondary antibodies (1:1000) and DAPI in the HS blocking solution for 1 hr at room temperature, washed five times in PBS and mounted on microscopy slides with Mowiol. ARHGAP11B antibody used in this study is a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against a recombinant full length ARHGAP11B. As the first 220 amino acids of ARHGAP11B are 89% identical to the first 220 amino acids of the ferret Arhgap11a, we showed by immunostaining that the antibody we used did not recognize the endogenous ferret Arhgap11a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Staining with the Nissl fluorescent stain, EdU detection, annexin V labeling, and TUNEL labeling were performed after the antibody stainings. NeuroTrace<sup>TM</sup> 640/660 deep-red fluorescent Nissl stain (Molecular probes) was used, following the manufacturer's instructions. EdU staining was performed using Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Imaging kit (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Annexin V labeling was performed using the Annexin V-Cy5 bright fluorescence reagent (BioVision), following the manufacturer's instructions. TUNEL labeling was performed using the In situ cell death detection kit, TMR red (Sigma-Aldrich), following the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Image acquisition</title><p>Images of whole ferret brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>) were obtained as follows.

The lateral length of the dorsal neocortex was measured at three positions along the rostro-caudal axis (positions 1 and 2, and position 1.5 located between positions 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5C</xref> bottom)), and was defined as a distance between the cingulate gyrus and ectosylvian gyrus along the inner contour, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A</xref> bottom.</p><p>Total cell density was measured as number of DAPI+ nuclei in 50 µm x 50 μm fields. Neuronal density was measured as number of Satb2+ nuclei in the 50 µm x 50 μm fields.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistics analyses were conducted using Prism (GraphPad Software). Sample sizes are reported in each figure legend, where the term ‘one experiment’ would refer to one embryo for analysis at E37 or E40, and to one kit for postnatal analysis. Total number of litters analyzed was as follows: E37, two litters; E40/P0, four litters; P10, two litters; P16, three litters. Embryos or kits from all litters were included in the statistical analyses. Tests used were Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni posttest and Student's <italic>t</italic>-test. For each quantification, the statistical test and significance are indicated in the figure legend.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the Services and Facilities of the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics for the outstanding support provided, notably J Helppi and his team of the Biomedical services (BMS) for the excellent husbandry of ferrets, J Peychl and his team of the Light Microscopy Facility and P Keller and his team of the Antibody Facility.

There is agreement among the reviewers that the work is very important, the experiments well executed and the manuscript well written. The finding that expression of ARHGAP11B in developing ferret cortex leads to increased proliferation of basal progenitors, increased neurogenesis in upper layers, and increased tangential dispersion of neurons but not to an increase in cortex folding, is extremely interesting because this is very different from what seen in mice, which have a smooth cortex.</p><p>From our collective analysis, revisions are minimal should concentrate on some main points.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>First, a more detailed analysis of tangential migration of neurons is necessary. Because of variability in the location of electroporated cells in each animal, it becomes difficult to compare across experiments. The context of the electroporation may be different and thus neurons may migrate differently simply because the environment is distinct (and tangential migration varies by rostro-caudal location). One way to do this would be to co-electroporate the control and experimental construct in the same animal, with distinct reporters.</p><p>Second, neuronal density cannot be estimated by measuring fluorescence. More accurate counts are needed.</p><p>Third, the thickness of the SVZ needs to be measured in the ARGHAP11B condition (Figure 1) to make sure that there is not discrepancy between thickness of SVZ and the fact that PCNA+ cells did not increase.</p><p>Fourth, some text modifications are required, especially in the Introduction and Discussion to integrate the current data within a framework of other published work that looked at the relationship between proliferation of basal progenitors and gyrification in distinct species. Details are outlined below, in the detailed reviews. Reviewer #2 highlights specific regions of the manuscript where more clarity and discussion of prior data is needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a fascinating and excellently executed study that aims at understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the evolutionary expansion of the human cerebral cortex. This lab discovered some years ago a gene present uniquely in the human genome (ARHGAP11B) and highly expressed in human cortical progenitor cells, and they found that expression of this human-specific gene in the developing mouse cortex caused very significant increases in mouse cortical progenitor proliferation and, in turn, it induced folding of the otherwise smooth mouse cortex. In this current study, the authors express this same gene in the developing cerebral cortex of ferret, which naturally develops a folded cortex, aiming to identify any different or additive effects on cortex development with respect to their previous analyses in mouse. The authors conclude that expression of ARHGAP11B in developing ferret cortex leads to increased abundance of proliferative basal progenitors, increased neurogenesis in upper layers, and increased tangential dispersion of cortical neurons (all typical of primates), but enigmatically not to increased cortex folding. The study is well conducted, the manuscript is very well written, figures of high quality and the results are clearly presented. A clear example of a manuscript that should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>My main concern with this study is that some of the main conclusions are based on results that have serious limitations due to the very nature of the experimental design. In particular, effects on the tangential dispersion of cortical neurons cannot be determined by using in utero electroporation, because each different electroporation in a different animal targets a different extent of VZ, and so the tangential extent of cortex containing labeled neurons is also inherently different, and thus not at all comparable between animals nor treatments. If tangential dispersion of neurons is increased upon ARHGAP11B expression, is cortical surface area affected? One would expect to maybe have folding increased, but this is also not. One possible explanation is that non-electroporated cells compensate for those expressing ARHGAP11B, by undergoing less tangential dispersion than normal. It may clarify this important issue (including faithful comparison of experimental conditions) if the authors could do the simple experiment of labeling non-ARHGAP11B cells in the same area containing the ARHGAP11B-expressing cells.</p><p>A similar problem is related to neuron density. The density of fluorescent neurons in the cortex completely depends on the density of electroporated cortical progenitor cells, which varies significantly from animal to animal, even between control animals. Therefore, in this case again, solid conclusions cannot be drawn about neuron density in absolute terms. Because these are two key points in the authors' major, they represent major concerns for me on this, otherwise fantastic, manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The submitted manuscript addresses a very exciting topic and presents a straightforward, well conducted, series of results regarding the effects of overexpressing a human-specific gene specifically expressed in the basal progenitors of the cerebral cortex in the ferret cortex. Interestingly, this work shows that ARGHAP11B over expression in the ferret cortex yields significantly different results from that obtained in the lissencephalic mouse. Indeed, in their seminal study (Florio et al., 2015), the authors reported a de novo formation of sulci in mouse brain at E18, following electroporation at E15. In the ferret, ARGHAP11B over expression has a massive effect on the OSVZ with a 3.5 fold increase in the proportion of PCNA+ progenitors. When performed at E33, ARGHAP 11B leads to a higher proportion of neurons forming layers 2, 3 and 4 being generated, accompanied by an increase in the density of the layers 3 and 4 of the cerebral cortex without significantly modifying the gyrification pattern-albeit an increase of thickness of the affected gyri. The lateral and media lateral dimensions of the electroporated regions are also increased by 25%.</p><p>The novel results by Kalebic et al. inform on species-specific constraints regarding cortical expansion mechanisms. In this context, the present results should be discussed with respect to previous results from the same group (Lange et al., 2009) and others (Pilaz et al., 2009) showing an increase in cortical surface and an increase in the number and density of layers 2 and 3 cortical neurons respectively following an increase of the basal pool of progenitors in the mouse as well as with respect to the results of Nonata-Kinoshita et al., 2013, reporting differential effects of forced amplification of basal progenitors in the mouse (no effect on gyrification) and in the ferret (increased gyrification and increase in cortical surface).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41241.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>First, a more detailed analysis of tangential migration of neurons is necessary. Because of variability in the location of electroporated cells in each animal, it becomes difficult to compare across experiments. The context of the electroporation may be different and thus neurons may migrate differently simply because the environment is distinct (and tangential migration varies by rostro-caudal location). One way to do this would be to co-electroporate the control and experimental construct in the same animal, with distinct reporters.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed a more detailed analysis of the tangential migration of neurons and its consequences for the lateral expansion of the neocortex. We have now included 6 new panels (in Figure 4 and newly-added Figure 4—figure supplement 5) regarding this analysis, as is described below.</p><p>We have not, however, performed the experiment to co-electroporate the control and experimental construct in the same animal, with distinct reporters, as the suggested experimental design would result in the vast majority of cells co-expressing both control and ARHGAP11B constructs, rendering the interpretation of data very difficult. Additionally, this experiment would have required new electroporations at E33 and raising ferrets up to P16, i.e. a total of almost 2 months before we would have been able to begin analyzing the samples; this would have made it impossible to meet the 2-month deadline for resubmission.</p><p>1) To account for potential differences in the rostro-caudal location, we have now measured the lateral length of the area harboring fluorescent protein-expressing cells (FP+ area) at 3 different positions along the rostro-caudal axis. This revealed that there are no differences in the lateral length of the FP+ area along the rostro-caudal axis for control and ARHGAP11B expression, respectively, with a significantly higher lateral length of the FP+ area upon ARHGAP11B expression compared to control in each of the three positions (Figure 4—figure supplement 5C).</p><p>2) Next, to account for the effects of the electroporation itself, we have now measured the lateral length of the FP+ area at an earlier stage, E40/P0 (Figure 4—figure supplement 5D, E). This showed that at this earlier stage there are no differences in apical and basal length of the FP+ area between ARHGAP11B expression and control.</p><p>3) Finally, we have examined the effects of the tangential migration on the lateral expansion of the neocortex. We have measured the lateral length of the dorsal neocortex (as depicted in Figure 4—figure supplement 5A bottom) and, importantly, found a 10% greater lateral length upon ARHGAP11B expression (Figure 4H). Of note, also this increase was observed at each of the three different positions along the rostro-caudal axis (Figure 4—figure supplement 5F). This new data imply that other, fluorescent protein-negative (FP–) cells do not compensate the effects of ARHGAP11B expression and that they do not undergo less tangential migration as a consequence, a possibility raised by reviewer 2 below.</p><p>The lack of compensation is also consistent with data presented in the original version of our manuscript (now Figure 4—figure supplement 5G, H), showing that expression of ARHGAP11B caused an increase in total cell density in the upper layers of the CP (please see also our response to the next comment in the Editors' Decision Letter).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, neuronal density cannot be estimated by measuring fluorescence. More accurate counts are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that there is a misunderstanding here. Neuronal density was not determined by counting fluorescent protein-positive cells (i.e. progeny of electroporated progenitors) in specific layers of the CP, but by counting DAPI-stained nuclei per area, irrespective of whether a nucleus was in a fluorescent protein-positive or -negative cell (see revised Figure 4—figure supplement 5H). This is quite accurate, and we have clarified this in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Furthermore, we have added another quantification of neuronal density that, again, is independent of fluorescent protein expression. Specifically, we have now quantified the density of the Satb2+ nuclei in the upper layers of the CP. As was the case for total cell density (Figure 4—figure supplement 5H), we have found an increase in Satb2+ neuron density in layers III and IV upon ARHGAP11B expression (see revised Figure 4—figure supplement 5I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, the thickness of the SVZ needs to be measured in the ARGHAP11B condition (Figure 1) to make sure that there is not discrepancy between thickness of SVZ and the fact that PCNA+ cells did not increase.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now measured the thickness of the VZ, ISVZ and OSVZ and have not detected any difference between ARHGAP11B-expressing and control neocortex (Figure 1—figure supplement 2F).</p><p>As to the issue of the PCNA+ cells in the SVZ, our previous data (now revised Figure 1B) showed that the <italic>proportion</italic> of PCNA+ FP+ cells was increased in the OSVZ, but not ISVZ, upon ARHGAP11B expression.

This analysis reveals that the total number of FP+ PCNA<sup>+</sup> increased in both ISVZ and OSVZ, but the magnitude of this increase is far greater in the OSVZ. This is consistent with our previous data that the proportion of FP+ cells in the OSVZ that are PCNA+ increased (revised Figure 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fourth, some text modifications are required, especially in the Introduction and Discussion to integrate the current data within a framework of other published work that looked at the relationship between proliferation of basal progenitors and gyrification in distinct species. Details are outlined below, in the detailed reviews. Reviewer #2 highlights specific regions of the manuscript where more clarity and discussion of prior data is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text as requested and as specified in our response to the reviewers' comments below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] My main concern with this study is that some of the main conclusions are based on results that have serious limitations due to the very nature of the experimental design. In particular, effects on the tangential dispersion of cortical neurons cannot be determined by using in utero electroporation, because each different electroporation in a different animal targets a different extent of VZ, and so the tangential extent of cortex containing labeled neurons is also inherently different, and thus not at all comparable between animals nor treatments. If tangential dispersion of neurons is increased upon ARHGAP11B expression, is cortical surface area affected? One would expect to maybe have folding increased, but this is also not. One possible explanation is that non-electroporated cells compensate for those expressing ARHGAP11B, by undergoing less tangential dispersion than normal. It may clarify this important issue (including faithful comparison of experimental conditions) if the authors could do the simple experiment of labeling non-ARHGAP11B cells in the same area containing the ARHGAP11B-expressing cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed a more detailed analysis of the tangential migration of neurons and its consequences for the lateral expansion of the neocortex. We have now included 6 new panels (in Figure 4 and newly-added Figure 4—figure supplement 5) regarding this analysis, as is described below.</p><p>To account for potential differences in the rostro-caudal location, we have now measured the lateral length of the area harboring fluorescent protein-expressing cells (FP+ area) at 3 different positions along the rostro-caudal axis. This revealed that there are no differences in the lateral length of the FP+ area along the rostro-caudal axis for control and ARHGAP11B expression, respectively, with a significantly higher lateral length of the FP+ area upon ARHGAP11B expression compared to control in each of the three positions (Figure 4—figure supplement 5C).</p><p>Next, to account for the effects of the electroporation itself, we have now measured the lateral length of the FP+ area at an earlier stage, E40/P0 (Figure 4—figure supplement 5D, E). This showed that at this earlier stage there are no differences in apical and basal length of the FP+ area between ARHGAP11B expression and control.</p><p>As to the issue of a potential increase in cortical surface area upon ARHGAP11B expression:</p><p>We have now examined the effects of the tangential migration on the lateral expansion of the neocortex. We have measured the lateral length of the dorsal neocortex (as depicted in Figure 4—figure supplement 5A bottom) and, importantly, found a 10% greater lateral length upon ARHGAP11B expression (Figure 4H). Of note, also this increase was observed at each of the three different positions along the rostro-caudal axis (Figure 4—figure supplement 5F). This new data imply that other, fluorescent protein-negative (FP–) cells do not compensate the effects of ARHGAP11B expression and that they do not undergo less tangential migration as a consequence, a possibility raised by the reviewer.</p><p>The lack of compensation is also consistent with data presented in the original version of our manuscript (now Figure 4—figure supplement 5G, H), showing that expression of ARHGAP11B caused an increase in total cell density in the upper layers of the CP.</p><p>We have not, however, performed the experiment of labeling non-ARHGAP11B cells in the same area containing the ARHGAP11B-expressing cells suggested by the Reviewer. Such an experiment would have required new electroporations at E33 and raising ferrets up to P16, i.e. a total of almost 2 months before we would have been able to begin analyzing the samples; this would have made it impossible to meet the 2-month deadline for resubmission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A similar problem is related to neuron density. The density of fluorescent neurons in the cortex completely depends on the density of electroporated cortical progenitor cells, which varies significantly from animal to animal, even between control animals. Therefore, in this case again, solid conclusions cannot be drawn about neuron density in absolute terms. Because these are two key points in the authors' major, they represent major concerns for me on this, otherwise fantastic, manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that there is a misunderstanding here. Neuronal density was not determined by counting fluorescent protein-positive cells (i.e. progeny of electroporated progenitors) in specific layers of the CP, but by counting DAPI-stained nuclei per area, irrespective of whether a nucleus was in a fluorescent protein-positive or -negative cell (see revised Figure 4—figure supplement 5H). This is quite accurate, and we have clarified this in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Furthermore, we have added another quantification of neuronal density that, again, is independent of fluorescent protein expression. Specifically, we have now quantified the density of the Satb2+ nuclei in the upper layers of the CP. As was the case for total cell density (Figure 4—figure supplement 5H), we have found an increase in Satb2+ neuron density in layers III and IV upon ARHGAP11B expression (see revised Figure 4—figure supplement 5I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The novel results by Kalebic et al. inform on species-specific constraints regarding cortical expansion mechanisms. In this context, the present results should be discussed with respect to previous results from the same group (Lange et al., 2009) and others (Pilaz et al., 2009) showing an increase in cortical surface and an increase in the number and density of layers 2 and 3 cortical neurons respectively following an increase of the basal pool of progenitors in the mouse as well as with respect to the results of Nonata-Kinoshita et al., 2013, reporting differential effects of forced amplification of basal progenitors in the mouse (no effect on gyrification) and in the ferret (increased gyrification and increase in cortical surface).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive and insightful suggestion, which we have followed. Specifically, we now discuss our findings with respect to (i) previous studies that manipulated the duration of the G1 phase of the cortical progenitor cell cycle and (ii) the consequences of this manipulation on BP proliferation, neocortex expansion and upper-layer neurons (subsection “Increase in proliferative bRG”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
