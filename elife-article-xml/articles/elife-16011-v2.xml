We demonstrate that human LBR is essential for cholesterol synthesis. LBR mutant derivatives implicated in Greenberg skeletal dysplasia or Pelger-Huët anomaly fail to rescue the cholesterol auxotrophy of a LBR-deficient human cell line, consistent with a loss-of-function mechanism for these congenital disorders. These disease-causing variants fall into two classes: point mutations in the sterol reductase domain perturb enzymatic activity by reducing the affinity for the essential cofactor NADPH, while LBR truncations render the mutant protein metabolically unstable, leading to its rapid degradation at the inner nuclear membrane. Thus, metabolically unstable LBR variants may serve as long-sought-after model substrates enabling previously impossible investigations of poorly understood protein turnover mechanisms at the inner nuclear membrane of higher eukaryotes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16011.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16011.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16011.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In humans, mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called Lamin B receptor can lead to diseases ranging from harmless anomalies of blood cells to fatal developmental defects. The severity of the disease depends on the nature of the specific mutation, and whether one or both copies of the gene are affected. Lamin B receptor – or LBR for short – is found at the envelope that surrounds the cell’s nucleus and was previously proposed to anchor this envelope to an underlying scaffold to provide it with support. LBR can also catalyze a chemical reaction involved in producing cholesterol – an essential component of cell membranes. However, this enzymatic activity was assumed to be less important because a second enzyme named TM7SF2 can perform the same reaction. Thus, it was not clear – at the molecular level – why the mutations in this gene lead to a variety of diseases.</p><p>All disease-causing mutations map to the part of LBR that is responsible for its enzymatic activity. This fact motivated Tsai, Zhao et al. to reassess the importance of LBR for the production of cholesterol. The experiments revealed that many human cells that can be grown in the laboratory strictly depend on LBR to produce cholesterol. As such, these findings challenge the previous assumption that TM7SF2 can compensate for the loss of LBR’s activity and sustain cholesterol synthesis.</p><p>Tsai, Zhao et al. also discovered that all known disease-causing mutations strongly perturb LBR’s ability to engage in cholesterol synthesis, albeit through different mechanisms. Some mutations interfered with the enzyme ability to bind with an essential molecule or cofactor that is required to catalysis; others led to LBR rapidly degrading at the nuclear envelope.</p><p>It was previously not known that proteins could be degraded at the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope of mammalian cells, and LBR mutants may turn out to be useful tools to investigate how this happens in future. Further studies could also test if other diseases caused by mutations in proteins found in the nuclear envelope act in similar ways, or if mutations in these proteins inhibit the nucleus’s protein disposal machinery.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16011.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16011.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>nuclear lamina</kwd><kwd>inner nuclear membrane</kwd><kwd>cholesterol metabolism</kwd><kwd>protein quality control</kwd><kwd>ER-associated degradation (ERAD)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2OD008624-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schlieker</surname><given-names>Christian Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lamin B receptor may provide a long-sought model system enabling unprecedented studies of protein quality control in the nuclear envelope of mammalian cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lamin B receptor (LBR) is an evolutionary conserved, multifunctional protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Olins et al., 2010</xref>).

Two congenital disorders are known to be associated with mutations in LBR: Pelger-Huët anomaly and Greenberg skeletal dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oosterwijk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shultz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wassif et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Waterham et al., 2003</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Using a human cell culture model, we demonstrate that it is this function that is perturbed by LBR mutations associated with Pelger-Huët anomaly and Greenberg skeletal dysplasia, suggesting a loss-of-function mechanism for these congenital disorders. Unexpectedly, disease-causing mutations involving C-terminal truncations of LBR lead to their rapid degradation in the nuclear envelope (NE). Such LBR mutants appear to be dislocated from the INM directly into the nucleoplasm, unlike traditional substrates of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery, which are eliminated in the cytosol after their dislocation from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Claessen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vembar and Brodsky, 2008</xref>). Metabolically unstable LBR mutant proteins will therefore be informative for future studies aimed at elucidating mechanisms of protein quality control at the nuclear envelope of mammalian cells, a site that was previously experimentally inaccessible due to the absence of suitable model substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of LBR knockout HeLa cell lines</title><p>In order to clarify the cellular function of LBR both in cholesterol metabolism and as a structural component of the nuclear lamina, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mali et al., 2013</xref>) to generate LBR knockout HeLa cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

These data, together with our previous observations by immunofluorescence microscopy, indicate that in these cells, LBR does not play a significant role in maintaining NE integrity. We cannot, however, exclude that LBR plays a role in the structural integrity of the nuclear lamina in specific cell types, under conditions of mechanical stress, or developmental stages found only in the context of the living organism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>LBR is required for viability under cholesterol starvation conditions</title><p>Next, we set out to investigate the role of LBR in cholesterol synthesis. In order to determine if LBR is required for cell proliferation under cholesterol-restrictive growth conditions, HeLa WT cells and LBR KO cells were cultured in medium containing lipoprotein-depleted fetal bovine serum. We found that after 4 days under cholesterol-restrictive growth conditions LBR KO, but not WT HeLa cells exhibited slow growth, cell rounding, and detachment, followed quickly by cell death on days 5–7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Addition of 10 µM exogenous cholesterol to the cell culture medium effectively rescued the observed sensitivity of LBR KO cells to low-cholesterol growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that the observed phenotype is in fact due to a deficiency in cholesterol production. The observed growth defect of LBR KO cells was also rescued by the addition of low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, a physiologically relevant cholesterol carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lodish, 2013</xref>), to the cell culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results suggest that the primary function of LBR in our tissue culture model is to sustain cholesterol biogenesis when the extracellular supply of cholesterol is scarce.</p><p>Given that LBR is endowed with sterol C14 reductase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennati et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Silve et al., 1998</xref>), we tested directly whether LBR-deficient cells are compromised in <italic>de novo</italic> cholesterol synthesis. To this end, HeLa WT and LBR KO cells were cultured in lipid-deprived medium for 48 hr, followed by the addition of <sup>14</sup>C acetate to the culture medium. After four hours, cells were harvested, lysed and the extracted lipids were separated via thin layer chromatography (TLC). We readily detected newly synthesized cholesterol in WT cells, as judged by its co-migration with purified <sup>14</sup>C cholesterol, which was included as a standard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Notably, we observed a near-complete loss of cholesterol synthesis in LBR KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), validating our previous assumption that LBR KO cells cannot effectively sustain cholesterol synthesis.</p><p>Finally, we asked whether these findings can be reproduced in other human cell types. We chose human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) to include non-transformed primary cells, as well as commonly used HEK293T cells. In either case, we observed a strong reduction of viability in LBR-silenced cells under cholesterol-restrictive conditions, whereas control cells transfected with non-targeting siRNAs displayed normal cell morphology under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 A,B,D,E</xref>). To validate our RNA interference approach, we subjected the corresponding cell lysates to immunoblotting and observed a robust LBR knockdown efficacy in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,F</xref>). These findings rule out that the cholesterol auxotrophy observed in HeLa LBR KO cells is attributable to their degeneracy or their transformed nature.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16011.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cells with reduced levels of LBR are sensitive to cholesterol restriction despite the presence of TM7SF2 .</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 293T cells were transfected with control siRNA or LBR siRNA, incubated for 48 hr, cultured in cholesterol-restrictive condition for 1 day and imaged via bright-field microscopy.

We therefore asked whether HeLa, HEK293T and HFF cells expressed both TM7SF2 and LBR under normal and cholesterol-restrictive conditions. For this analysis, we isolated total RNA and prepared protein extracts from these three cell types grown under normal and cholesterol-restrictive conditions. TM7SF2 and LBR transcript levels were quantified via qPCR, and the observed fold change under restrictive conditions was normalized relative to the transcript abundance under normal growth conditions, which was set to one. As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennati et al., 2006</xref>), we found that HFF and HeLa cells upregulated TM7SF2 under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), whereas LBR was constitutively expressed and unresponsive to cholesterol starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Interestingly, HEK293T cells did not materially up-regulate TM7SF2 on the transcript level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Similar results were obtained when we monitored the LBR and TM7SF2 protein levels via immunoblotting. The abundance of the TM7SF2 protein in HFF and HeLa cells increased under cholesterol-restrictive conditions, whereas HEK293T cells displayed somewhat higher levels of TM7SF2 even under normal conditions but did not upregulate TM7SF2 to the same degree as HFF or HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we wanted to ascertain that LBR KO cells are capable of mounting a sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP2)-dependent transcriptional response under cholesterol starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and Goldstein, 1997</xref>). We did not observe significant differences between HeLa WT and HeLa LBR KO cells in their ability to up-regulate TM7SF2 on the transcript level, as judged by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similar results were obtained for HMG-CoA reductase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which was included as a control since the HMG-CoA reductase gene is an established target of SREBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and Goldstein, 1997</xref>). In accordance with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennati et al., 2006</xref>), the observed upregulation was dependent on SREBP2, as judged by a profound reduction of TM7SF2 and HMG-CoA reductase on the transcript levels in cells depleted of SREBP2 via RNA interference.</p><p>Finally, to exclude the formal possibility that coding mutations in TM7SF2 are responsible for the observed essential role of LBR in HeLa cells through perturbation of TM7SF2 sterol C14 reductase activity, we cloned and sequenced the corresponding cDNA.

To this end, we used the FlpIn gene integration system to generate HeLa cells that express either WT LBR or LBR disease alleles under doxycycline control from the FlpIn locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Turner et al., 2015</xref>). We focused on two LBR point mutations, one frameshift mutation, and one nonsense mutation, the latter of which results in a truncated LBR C-terminus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clayton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Konstantinidou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Waterham et al., 2003</xref>). The two point mutations, LBR N547D and LBR R583Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), are both associated with Greenberg skeletal dysplasia when both LBR alleles are mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clayton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Konstantinidou et al., 2008</xref>). Both positions are highly conserved in homologous C14 sterol reductases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and are not associated with Pelger-Huët anomaly in heterozygous individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clayton et al., 2010</xref>). For the LBR truncations, the first frameshift mutation results from a single nucleotide deletion in the C-terminal sterol reductase domain of LBR, c.1402delT, which results in the alteration of downstream codons 468–475 and the formation of a premature stop codon at position 475 (p.Y468TfsX475) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clayton et al., 2010</xref>), which we designated LBR 1402TΔ. This mutation results in a C-terminally truncated LBR protein that is missing the final three membrane spanning helices that form the sterol-reductase domain of LBR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and results in Greenberg skeletal dysplasia in homozygous individuals. It is unknown whether individuals heterozygous for the LBR c.1402delT mutation exhibit Pelger-Huët anomaly. The second frameshift mutation causing a distinct C-terminal truncation, LBR c.1599-1605TCTTCTA-&gt;CTAGAAG (LBR p.X534), which we have designated as LBR 1600*, has been shown to cause Pelger-Huët anomaly in heterozygous individuals as well as Greenberg skeletal dysplasia when both LBR alleles are mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Waterham et al., 2003</xref>). This mutation is a seven nucleotide substitution beginning at LBR position 1599 that directly causes the introduction of a premature stop codon at position LBR p.534, resulting in a truncated LBR C-terminus lacking the final two transmembrane helices of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To determine if these mutations are loss-of-function alleles, we expressed each of these as well as wild-type LBR under doxycycline control in our LBR KO HeLa cell line. Cells expressing various LBR alleles in an LBR knockout background were grown under cholesterol-restrictive culture conditions for 7 days. We then imaged and counted the cells and measured total cholesterol content (see Materials and methods). We found that expression of LBR WT from the FlpIn locus completely rescued the growth defect observed for LBR KO cells in cholesterol starvation growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). This excluded off-target effects as a cause for the observed phenotype. Importantly, all four disease-associated LBR alleles failed to rescue the observed growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). LBR KO cells were found to have approximately 40% less total cholesterol content than LBR WT cells after 7 days of cholesterol starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Cellular cholesterol content was fully restored to that of WT cells by expression of LBR WT from the FlpIn locus even at somewhat lower LBR expression levels compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>), but not by expression of any of the four disease-associated LBR alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). From these data we conclude that LBR KO HeLa cells are strongly compromised for cholesterol production. Neither cell growth nor cellular cholesterol content are restored by the expression of LBR N547D, LBR R583Q, LBR 1402TΔ or LBR 1600* in a LBR KO background, indicating that these genetic lesions ultimately result in a failure to sustain cell growth under cholesterol-restrictive conditions.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16011.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cholesterol auxotrophy of LBR KO cells is rescued by wild-type but not disease-mutant LBR .</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain structure of LBR.

Indeed, both affected residues are widely conserved in related reductases, including the sterol reductase from <italic>Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum</italic> (maSR1), the structure of which was recently determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Based on a sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), the LBR N547 and R583 residues correspond to maSR1 N359 and R395, respectively, both of which map to the NADPH binding pocket, with N359 being implicated in a hydrogen bond formation with a phosphate oxygen of NADPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We therefore tested whether these mutants displayed a reduced affinity for NADPH, the cofactor that contributes the electrons for the reduction reaction. WT LBR, LBR N547D, and LBR 583Q were purified and their NADPH binding affinities measured using a spectroscopic approach (see materials and methods). WT LBR displayed hyperbolic saturation for the cofactor with a K<sub>D</sub> of 24.2 µM. Both mutants had a severely decreased binding affinity to NADPH, with N547D having the strongest effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We attribute this lack of affinity to a possible charge repulsion between the introduced Asp side chain and the negatively charged phosphate of the cofactor. Given that the physiological concentration of NADPH is in the range of ~ 100 µM–a concentration range at which the discrepancy of cofactor occupancy of LBR and LBR N547D/LBR R583Q would be maximal– our measurements provide a direct rationale for the inability of those mutants to efficiently rescue the cholesterol auxotrophy (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

In contrast, both truncated LBR variants were produced at levels comparable to WT LBR at the beginning of the chase period but were rapidly degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). These observations are consistent with a post-translational effect on protein stability and argue against a major contribution of NMD.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16011.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>C-terminally truncated LBR mutants associated with Pelger-Huët anomaly and Greenberg skeletal dysplasia are rapidly degraded via the proteasome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>), (<bold>B</bold>) LBR KO cells expressing either WT LBR or the disease-associate LBR mutants were metabolically labeled with <sup>35</sup>S and then chased with an excess of unlabeled cysteine/methionine. LBR was then retrieved at the indicated time points via immunoprecipitation, resolved by SDS-PAGE and imaged via autoradiography.

Both mutants were significantly stabilized by MG132, with minimal degradation taking place in 60 min after synthesis. We conclude that the degradation of truncated LBR variants depends on the proteasome. Notably, the kinetics of LBR 1402TΔ and LBR 1600* degradation were remarkably rapid, with half-lives of 10–15 min, especially considering that these mutant derivatives are polytopic membrane proteins. As a standard of comparison, the half-life of CFTRΔ506, a mutant variant of the polytopic chloride channel responsible for cystic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Turnbull et al., 2007</xref>) which is widely used as model substrate to study protein turnover, is four hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heda et al., 2001</xref>).

In addition, both LBR mutants are clearly excluded from nucleoli in the presence of MG132. Quantification of these results, based on a total projection average of 20 independent z-stack series for each condition, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> for a corresponding z-stack series). We observe that with both mutants, MG132 treatment resulted in a shift from a non-nuclear to a nuclear LBR immunofluorescence signal, with LBR 1402TΔ showing a slightly larger shift in localization than LBR 1600*, which resides primarily in the nuclear compartment even in the absence of MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>).</p><p>These unexpected results indicate that disease-associated, C-terminally truncated LBR mutants surprisingly accumulate in the nuclear compartment, rather than the ER or cytosol, after MG132 treatment. Given that LBR1600* is extremely short-lived but mainly localizes to the INM under steady-state conditions even in the absence of MG132, we suggest that it is here that membrane dislocation occurs.</p><p>The requirement of the AAA+ ATPase p97 for the extraction or dislocation of membrane proteins from the ER membrane is firmly established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ye et al., 2003</xref>). Given that p97 has additional functions in the nuclear compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dantuma and Hoppe, 2012</xref>), we asked whether p97 is implicated in the extraction of LBR 1600* from the INM. LBR KO cells were transfected either with FLAG-LBR 1600* alone or in combination with either p97 WT or p97 QQ, a dominant-negative mutant of p97 that potently blocks p97-dependent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ernst et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ye et al., 2003</xref>). We then performed pulse-chase analyses to monitor the stability of LBR 1600*. As expected, p97 WT had no effect on LBR 1600* degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>). However, p97 QQ inhibited LBR 1600* turnover to an extent that is comparable to proteasomal inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>).</p><p>We next asked whether p97 QQ can block LBR 1600* turnover in the nuclear compartment using confocal microscopy. Cells were again co-transfected with LBR 1600* and either p97 QQ or p97 WT and then treated with MG132 or carrier. This experimental setup allowed us to explore the possibility of an epistatic relationship between p97 QQ and MG132. If p97 is indeed required for the dislocation of LBR 1600* from the INM, we would expect p97 QQ to prevent the accumulation of LBR 1600* in the nucleoplasm upon MG132 treatment. Using double-staining with anti-p97 and anti-LBR antibodies, we indeed found this to be the case. In the presence of both p97 WT and MG132, we observed the expected LBR 1600* accumulation in the nucleoplasm and to a lesser degree, the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), whereas LBR 1600* accumulates nearly quantitatively at the nuclear rim in the presence of p97 QQ even in the presence of MG132. The data are consistent with a blockage of the membrane dislocation step at the INM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, these results are consistent with a mechanism in which only a small percentage of LBR 1600* is degraded by the canonical ERAD pathway. The majority of the truncated protein is localized to the INM, where it appears that a second quality control pathway operates to extract and destroy LBR 1600* in a series of reactions employing both p97 and the UPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16011.019</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for partitioning of metabolically unstable LBR variants between ER- and INM-resident protein turnover pathways.</title><p>C-terminal truncation of LBR (e.g. in LBR 1600* or 1400TΔ) causes the sterol reductase domain (SRD) to misfold, leading to LBR ubiquitylation, membrane dislocation and its subsequent degradation via the Ub/proteasome pathway. A minor portion of LBR1600* is degraded by the canonical ERAD pathway in the ER, whereas the majority will enter the nucleus by virtue of the correctly folded N-terminal domain and be retained by binding to the nuclear lamina. Here, a presumably ERAD-independent pathway is operative, involving both p97 and the Ub/proteasome.

We found LBR to be essential for survival under cholesterol-restrictive growth conditions in three different human cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A–D</xref>). Correspondingly, LBR-deficient HeLa cells cannot efficiently synthesize cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), but are readily rescued by the addition of LDL particles or free cholesterol to the cholesterol starvation medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results are unexpected since previous studies in mice reported that the sterol reductase activities of LBR and TM7SF2 are functionally redundant, suggesting that HEM dysplasia is likely a laminopathy that is unrelated to the sterol reductase activity of LBR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wassif et al., 2007</xref>). In cultured HeLa cells, however, LBR does not play a significant role in NE organization despite being a constitutively expressed, abundant INM component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), possibly due to functional redundancy with some of the multitude of other lamina-associated membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetzer and Wente, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schirmer and Gerace, 2005</xref>). In our opinion, a major role for TM7SF2 in generic cholesterol synthesis is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an overt phenotype upon deletion of TM7SF2 in mice, which are not compromised in cholesterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennati et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, TM7SF2 is expressed under cholesterol-restrictive conditions in all tested human cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), but cannot compensate for the absence of LBR. Nevertheless, it is striking that mice lacking a fully functional LBR allele due to homozygous mutations at the ichthyosis locus (<italic>ic/ic</italic>) are viable, although these animals display numerous phenotypic abnormalities including alopecia, syndactyly and hydrocephalus as well as an increase in embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shultz et al., 2003</xref>). Growth defects were also observed in primary cells isolated from mouse models with mutations in the <italic>LBR</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Subramanian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Verhagen et al., 2012</xref>). Of note, defects in neutrophil maturation in <italic>ic/ic</italic> animals can be recued in vitro by expression of the LBR SRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Subramanian et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It is likely that LBR function is subject to diversification in the course of evolution. For example, human LBR can rescue sterol reductase deficiency in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Silve et al., 1998</xref>), while LBR from <italic>Droshophila melanogaster</italic> does not complement this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wagner et al., 2004</xref>). Since <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is a cholesterol-auxotrophic organism, we speculate that additional LBR functions could involve the N-terminal Tudor domain. While we found this domain to be dispensable for cholesterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), a possible role could involve heterochromatin organiziation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Solovei et al., 2013</xref>), which may be related to the nuclear abnormalities observed in e.g. Pelger-Huet anomaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>) and mouse models of ichtyosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shultz et al., 2003</xref>). Since the LBR SRD is neccesary and sufficient to restore cholesterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and rescues a defect in neutrophil maturation observed in <italic>ic/ic</italic> cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Subramanian et al., 2012</xref>), a knock-in of either the SRD or the Tudor domain (including the first transmembrane domain) into the LBR locus could help to deconvolute distinct functions of the SRD and Tudor domains in mammalian development.</p><p>Given that our study establishes LBR as the major sterol reductase required for cholesterol synthesis in human cells, the question arises why a second, functionally equivalent enzyme is encoded in the human genome. Since cholesterol synthesis can proceed through differential, tissue-specific usage of distinct yet interchangeable segments of the established synthesis pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mitsche et al., 2015</xref>), we speculate that TM7SF2 could be required for cholesterol synthesis in a specific physiological context. Interestingly, a recent study suggested that TM7SF2 may participate in healing of burn wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lei et al., 2016</xref>), possibly representing a case of a more specialized physiological role.</p><p>Based on our finding that all tested disease-causing mutations in LBR fail to complement the cholesterol auxotrophy imposed by an LBR deficiency in our tissue culture model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we believe that animal models of LBR malfunction warrant additional scrutiny from the perspective of cholesterol metabolism. The administration of a low cholesterol diet or inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis in animal models with <italic>LBR</italic> mutations could reveal previously unknown phenotypes and thus provide new insight into disease etiology. Similarly, it would be interesting to explore states in which specific cell types are exposed to conditions of low environmental cholesterol in a physiological context, as for example in the course of embryogenesis, which could help to rationalize the embryonic-lethal phenotypes in Greenberg skeletal dysplasia.</p><p>Another unexpected outcome of this study is that C-terminally truncated LBR proteins found in both Pelger-Huët anomaly and Greenberg skeletal dysplasia are rapidly degraded by a proteasome-dependent protein quality-control pathway that appears to be distinct from the canonical ERAD pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Given that INM-resident proteins are synthesized in the ER prior to their targeting to the INM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lusk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ungricht and Kutay, 2015</xref>), we propose that the correctly folded N-terminal moiety of LBR containing INM targeting information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith and Blobel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soullam and Worman, 1993</xref>) leads to the rapid trafficking of LBR 1600* to the INM before elements of the ERAD pathway can act (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Considering that near-quantitative nuclear accumulation of an HA-tagged LBR variant is achieved in ~20 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ungricht et al., 2015</xref>), and that the half life of LBR 1600* is ~10–15 min, it follows that a significant fraction of LBR 1600* escapes the ERAD system leading to localization to the INM mediated by the intact N-terminal domain, which confers lamin binding (see. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> demonstrating INM localization of LBR 1600* under steady-state conditions). Upon arrival of LBR 1600* at the INM, a system analogous to but distinct from the known ERAD system is responsible for the ubiquitylation of LBR 1600* and its p97-dependent extraction from the INM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>).

interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The Lamin B Receptor is Essential for Cholesterol Synthesis and Perturbed by Disease-causing Mutations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>All three of the reviewers liked this manuscript and thought that, with suitable revisions, it could be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, all three reviewers were insistent that revisions, including additional experiments, are necessary. One reviewer commented that the quality of the writing in this paper is excellent, but the same reviewer was disappointed by the content of the Discussion section.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have shown that the lamin B receptor is not required for maintenance of nuclear structure, but that it is required for cholesterol synthesis-at least in HeLa cells. They carefully characterize lamin B receptor mutants associated with human disease. Finally, they clearly show proteosomal turnover of the lamin B receptor in the nucleus. Their findings help to elucidate mechanisms for turnover of inner nuclear membrane proteins.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is important to determine whether the importance of the lamin B receptor is unique to HeLa cells. Do HeLa cells express TM7SF2 transcripts and protein?</p><p>A survey of LBR and TM7SF2 transcript and protein levels in several different human cell lines would be instructive. Are there coding mutations in TM7SF2 in HeLa cells? <italic>eLife</italic> readers need to have some inkling about whether the essential nature of the LBR for cholesterol synthesis is a peculiarity of one tumor cell line.</p><p>2) Document an accumulation of δ 14 sterols in the LBR-deficient cells.</p><p>3) Measure cholesterol synthesis in LBR-deficient cells.</p><p>4) It would be highly desirable to show that the mutants are ubiquitinylated at more native levels of expression; protein overexpression could induce proteasomal degradation.</p><p>5) It would be desirable to take a fresh look at SREBP control of LBR and TMSSF2 expression.</p><p>6) While the quality of the writing was excellent, the Discussion section was too short and disappointing in terms of the content. Not to discuss the ichthyosis phenotype in the mice and speculate about its etiology was odd.

We chose HEK 293T cells given that they are commonly used in many laboratories as well as human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) to include non-transformed primary cells in our analysis. Both LBR-silenced HEK 293T and HFFs exhibit significant cell death relative to non-targeting siRNA controls under cholesterol-restrictive conditions, corroborating our assignment of LBR to an essential function in cholesterol synthesis. These data are now included as an additional figure (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-F</xref>).</p><p><italic>Do HeLa cells express TM7SF2 transcripts and protein?</italic> </p><p><italic>A survey of LBR and TM7SF2 transcript and protein levels in several different human cell lines would be instructive.</italic> </p><p>This was indeed a deficiency in our original manuscript. We therefore raised antibodies against TM7SF2, allowing us to demonstrate that TM7SF2 is expressed at very low levels under normal growth conditions. TM7SF2 expression is induced when cells are cultured in lipid-depleted growth medium, which we now demonstrate on the transcript and protein level via qPCR and immunoblotting analysis, respectively (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As outlined below (see point #5), we have also added data demonstrating that the transcriptional upregulation depends on SREBP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, different cell types/lines display differences in their TM7SF2 expression, consistent with the recent demonstration of tissue- and cell type-specific differences in cholesterol synthesis (Mitsche et al., e<italic>Life</italic>. 2015 Jun 26;4:e07999. doi: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.07999).</p><p><italic>Are there coding mutations in TM7SF2 in HeLa cells? eLife readers need to have some inkling about whether the essential nature of the LBR for cholesterol synthesis is a peculiarity of one tumor cell line.</italic></p><p>We share the concern of this reviewer. Two major TM7SF2 transcripts are annotated in NCBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7108">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7108</ext-link>), specifying two distinct TM7SF2 isoforms of 46 and 43 kDa, respectively Using a cloning strategy based on RT-PCR in conjunction with an unbiased (not relying on sequence homology to isolate/amplify the 5'-end) 5' RACE approach, we were able to isolate/amplify the cDNA for the longer isoform 1. This isoform does not have a single mutation. Given that the TM7SF2 protein in HeLa cells co-migrates (on SDS gels) with TM7SF2 proteins detected in HFFs and other cell lines (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), we conclude that the longer isoform 1 is the major TM7SF2 gene product in several cell types. The sequencing results are included as new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>. Please note also the newly added data showing that HFFs and HEK 293s similarly rely on LBR to sustain cholesterol synthesis (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–F</xref>). Thus, the essential role of LBR in HeLa cells cannot be attributed to their degeneracy or to a coding mutation in TM7SF2.</p><p><italic>2) Document an accumulation of δ 14 sterols in the LBR-deficient cells.</italic> </p><p>We feel that repeating previously published data is not needed to validate our conclusions for the following reasons: (i) the enzymatic activity of LBR is firmly established via genetic complementation and biochemical experiments, (ii) δ 14 sterols have been detected in several cell types in LBR-deficient ichthyosis mouse models (e.g. J Immunol 188(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">1</xref>):85-102.). (iii) Most importantly, δ 14 sterols were detected in cultured cells of a HEM/Greenberg skeletal dysplasia patient (Am J Hum Genet. 72(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">4</xref>):1013-7). Of note, this fetus carried the same mutation that we characterize in our study. This is the most physiologically relevant demonstration of δ 14 sterol accumulation resulting from LBR mutations that we can think of. We have now included these above-cited references in our revised Discussion, and hope that the reviewers/editor agree that the implementation of the highly specialized GC/MS-based assay required to measure δ 14 sterols is not necessary to validate our conclusions, even more so given that we have now added direct proof for a lack of de novo cholesterol synthesis in LBR-deficient/perturbed cells to the revised manuscript (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>).</p><p>In fact, we feel that our demonstration of the degradation of mutant variants and our demonstration and structural rationalization of a cofactor binding defect allows us to arrive at a more precise definition of the molecular defects associated with the disease-causing mutations. These data are in perfect agreement with the reported accumulation of δ 14 sterols upon LBR perturbation in patient tissues/cells and mouse tissues; therefore, we consider these studies and our work as being perfectly complementary to each other (we note that none of these studies looked at metabolic instability of LBR mutants, cofactor affinity, or provided a structural rationale for disease mutations). We therefore hope that the reviewers/editors agree that our revised study significantly advances our molecular understanding of disease etiology.</p><p><italic>3) Measure cholesterol synthesis in LBR-deficient cells.</italic> </p><p>We reported in the original version of the manuscript that total (or steady-state) cholesterol levels are reduced by ~30% in LBR knockout or mutant cell lines after the starvation period. We believe that this range reflects a viability threshold, i.e. cell death ensues at lower concentrations of cholesterol, making it impossible to accurately quantify this effect and to deconvolute the contribution of de novo synthesis. We have therefore implemented metabolic labeling techniques as suggested by the reviewer to directly measure de novo synthesis using <sup>14</sup>C acetate in conjunction with thin layer chromatography/autoradiography. We are most grateful for the reviewer's suggestion since the resulting data are a clear “black and white” result and are even more convincing than the original data. LBR-deficient cells or those that express disease mutants are in fact completely deficient in de novo synthesis of cholesterol (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). Given our newly added data demonstrating that HeLa cells express TM7SF2 devoid of coding mutations in an LBR deficient background, these data reinforce our central conclusion that LBR is essential for cholesterol synthesis despite the presence of TM7SF2.</p><p><italic>4) It would be highly desirable to show that the mutants are ubiquitinylated at more native levels of expression; protein overexpression could induce proteasomal degradation.</italic> </p><p>We share the reviewer’s general concern about overexpression artifacts. Indeed, most of the data in this study are based on carefully controlled expression levels using defined genetic loci for expression of transgenes at near-endogenous expression levels. However, we want to point out that much of the published literature in the protein turnover/ERAD field relies on strongly overexpressed proteins since it is otherwise difficult to achieve robustly detectable levels of metabolically unstable proteins. Please note that neither LBR1600* nor LBR1400T are detectable under steady-state conditions in immunoblots (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) since they are rapidly degraded, forcing us to increase expression by using a strong promoter to reach the detection limit of immunoblots in our ubiquitin-relevant experiments. Please also note that even when overexpressed, the levels of LBR1600* and LBR1400T are significantly lower than endogenous LBR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref> in which we compare endogenous levels of LBR to the input lysates used for the IP experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Given that overexpressed LBR WT, which we included as control, is not degraded at much higher levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and displays only negligible levels of ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), we hope the reviewer will agree that overexpression cannot account for the ubiquitination or the metabolic instability of LBR mutant derivatives. We have also repeated the pulse-chase experiments that were originally based on transient transfection of LBR1600* and LBR1400T into LBR KO cells. Our new data, which are based on stable cell lines expressing of LBR1600* and LBR1400T at levels below the detection limits of immunoblots (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), faithfully recapitulate our previous result (i.e. rapid turnover/MG132-sensitivity). We have therefore replaced the original panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>/D by these new panels representing our recent data obtained at near-endogenous/lower expression levels.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16011.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16011.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16011.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-16011-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>5) It would be desirable to take a fresh look at SREBP control of LBR and TMSSF2 expression.</italic> </p><p>We followed the reviewer's suggestion and tested whether LBR and TM7SF2 expression is dependent on SREBP2 in HeLa cells. In accordance with the published literature (Biochim Biophys Acta. 2006 Jul;1761(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">7</xref>):677-85), we found that TM7SF2 expression is induced in response to cholesterol starvation (cf. point #1), while LBR is constitutively expressed and not significantly up-regulated (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3 —figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, induction of TM7SF2 expression depends on SREBP2, as judged by a significant reduction of TM7SF2 expression in SREBP2-silenced cells relative to a non-targeting siRNA control. Similar results were obtained for HMGCoAR, LDM and NSDHL. We have not included all of these data in the manuscript since the revision has increased the size of manuscript tremendously, and a detailed analysis of transcriptional control is outside the scope of our study. We also generalized our findings by including HFFs and HEK 293T cells in this analysis (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) While the quality of the writing was excellent, the Discussion section was too short and disappointing in terms of the content.

In the revised version, we place our findings in the context of the literature that was omitted in our original version.
