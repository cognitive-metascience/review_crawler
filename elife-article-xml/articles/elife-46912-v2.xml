However, it was unclear how these interactions were initiated: it was also not clear if they had an impact on the growth of tumour cells. Here, we show that neoplastic cells hijack mechanisms that are usually employed to direct microglial processes towards highly active neurons and injuries in the brain. We show that AKT1+ cells possess dynamically regulated high intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Using a combination of live imaging, genetic and pharmacological tools, we show that these Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients stimulate ATP-mediated interactions with microglia. Interfering with Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, inhibiting ATP release and CRISPR-mediated mutation of the <italic>p2ry12</italic> locus abolishes these interactions. Finally, we show that reducing the number of microglial interactions significantly impairs the proliferation of neoplastic AKT1 cells. In conclusion, neoplastic cells repurpose the endogenous neuron to microglia signalling mechanism via P2ry12 activation to promote their own proliferation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>brain tumour</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>live imaging</kwd><kwd>calcium signalling</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>glioma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C49916/A17494</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sieger</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>P2ry12-mediated microglial interactions stimulate the proliferation of brain tumour initiating cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microglia and infiltrating macrophages are amongst the most abundant cell types in the microenvironment of brain tumours and have been shown to actively promote tumour growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hambardzumyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Quail and Joyce, 2017</xref>). A variety of mechanism contribute to this tumour-promoting activity including modifications of the extracellular matrix, the induction of angiogenesis and the generation of an immunosuppressive environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Markovic et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Komohara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellert-Miklaszewska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pyonteck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hambardzumyan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, direct cellular interactions between microglia and brain tumour cells have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayerl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamilton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Resende et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ricard et al., 2016</xref>). These cellular interactions consist of different types of direct surface contacts between microglia and tumour cells, from microglia constantly extending processes towards tumour cells to microglia flattening their surfaces around tumour cells. Importantly, these interactions were long-lasting and did not appear to be anti-tumoural as phagocytic events were not observed. These observations have been consistently made in a variety of models of orthotopic transplantations of human and mouse glioma cells into mouse or zebrafish brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayerl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamilton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Resende et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ricard et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, we have recently shown that these cellular interactions are initiated during the earliest stages of tumour growth as they can already be observed between microglia and pre-neoplastic AKT1+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chia et al., 2018</xref>). However, the signals that initiate these cellular interactions and their functional impact on tumour cells have not been addressed so far.</p><p>Several elegant studies have described cellular interactions between microglia and neurons under physiological conditions. Microglia have been observed to direct cellular processes towards neurons with increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sieger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eyo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eyo et al., 2015</xref>). These interactions were regulated by ATP/ADP released from the neurons upon intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase and sensed by the microglia via the purinergic P2y12 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sieger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eyo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eyo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we hypothesised that mechanisms employed by healthy neurons to attract microglial processes are hijacked by neoplastic cells to stimulate interactions and that these interactions promote the growth of neoplastic cells. To address these questions, we made use of our recently published zebrafish brain tumour model to analyze interactions between microglia and neoplastic AKT1 overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chia et al., 2018</xref>). We show that AKT1+ cells have significantly increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, which are dynamically regulated. Pharmacological inhibition of NMDA receptor signalling significantly decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in AKT1+ cells and drastically reduced the number of microglial interactions with these cells. In line with these results, inhibition of ATP release and knock out of the <italic>p2y12</italic> receptor abolished microglia interactions with AKT1+ cells, showing that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated ATP signalling is required for these cellular contacts. Intriguingly, we showed that reducing these interactions had a direct functional impact on AKT1 cells and reduced their proliferative capacities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Microglia closely interact with pre-neoplastic AKT1 cells</title><p>We and others have shown previously that microglia show direct cellular interactions with tumour cells and pre-neoplastic AKT1+ cells in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayerl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamilton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Resende et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ricard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chia et al., 2018</xref>). However, the underlying mechanisms promoting these interactions have not been identified. Here we analysed these cellular contacts between microglia and pre-neoplastic AKT1+ cells in more detail. To induce AKT1 expression in neural cells we followed the previously published strategy by expressing AKT1 under the neural-specific beta tubulin (NBT) promoter using a dominant active version of the LexPR transcriptional activator system (ΔLexPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chia et al., 2018</xref>). We co-injected an NBT:∆lexPR-lexOP-pA driver plasmid together with a lexOP:<italic>AKT1</italic>-lexOP:tagRFP construct into mpeg1:EGFP transgenic zebrafish in which all macrophages including microglia are labelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ellett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chia et al., 2018</xref>). Control fish were injected with a lexOP:tagRFP construct. In this model, cellular abnormalities and increased proliferation are detected in AKT1+ cells within the first week of development and solid tumours can be observed from 1 month of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chia et al., 2018</xref>). As described previously, microglia were observed to cluster in areas of AKT1+ cells while their distribution appeared normal in fish injected with the lexOP:tagRFP control construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">2</xref>). Furthermore, direct cellular interactions between microglia and AKT1+ cells seemed to be more frequent compared to interactions between microglia and RFP control cells. Thus, we decided to analyze these interactions in more detail and quantified these interactions. We counted the number of microglia in direct contact with AKT1+ or RFP control cells and normalised by the total number of microglia in the respective sample. Importantly, microglia showed a significantly increased number of direct interactions with AKT1+ cells compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As described before, different types of interactions were observed which ranged from microglia extending processes towards AKT1+ cells to microglia flattening and moving their cellular surface around AKT1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">Figure 1—videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">4</xref>). Furthermore, two or more microglial cells were frequently observed to interact with the same AKT1+ cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">Figure 1—video 4</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of HRASV12 in neural cells as well as overexpression of AKT1 and HRASV12 under control of the zic4 enhancer stimulated similar microglial responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, cells in the brain undergoing oncogenic transformation via AKT1 and HRASV12, seem to possess signals stimulating these long-lasting interactions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46912.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Microglia show increased interactions with AKT1 expressing cells compared to control cells.</title><p>In vivo time-lapse imaging was performed using the mpeg1:EGFP transgenic line to observe microglia behaviour towards control cells and AKT1 cells.

For the analysis, the ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> of any selected cell-of-interest was measured along the time-course and plotted as a function of ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> against time. Interestingly, these recordings showed further differences between control cells and AKT1+ cells. In control RFP cells, calcium activity was observed to be relatively static over time (n = 35 larvae analysed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). With the exception of some spontaneous background firing, there were no spikes or obvious changes in calcium firing pattern recorded in control neural cells throughout the duration of image acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Interestingly, AKT1 expressing cells were observed to temporally regulate calcium activity. Through the course of acquisition,~31% of AKT1-positive cells were observed to strongly up- and down-regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (∆F/F<sub>0</sub> increase &gt;0.05) repeatedly, thus creating a firing pattern (n = 35 larvae analysed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). We did not detect these patterns in any of the analysed control RFP cells (n = 35 larvae analysed). While these dynamic changes in calcium firing were specific to individual AKT1 positive cells, they were more frequently observed in cells within close vicinity to other AKT1 expressing cells. Thus, AKT1 induced pre-neoplastic alterations result in increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, which appear to be dynamically regulated over time. To test if microglia directly respond to increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels we overexpressed AKT1 in b-actin:GCaMP6f/mpeg1:EGFP double transgenic larvae. This combination has the caveat that microglia and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are imaged in the same channel. Thus, imaging settings had to be carefully adjusted to avoid massive overexposure of the microglia while still capturing the GCaMP6f signals. Importantly, we detected microglia directly responding to AKT1+ cells with increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. We observed prolonged cellular contacts between microglia and AKT1+ cells with increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>, arrows) as well as microglia sending processes towards AKT1+ cells that increased their Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels during the time of the acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–H</xref>, arrowheads).

Consequently, inhibiting ATP and P2ry12 signalling abolishes microglial responses to cellular increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. To test if microglial responses to AKT1+ cells were mediated via the same mechanism we reduced ATP release by treating larvae with CBX to block pannexin channels as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sieger et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, inhibiting pannexin channels led to a significant reduction of cellular interactions between microglial cells and AKT1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Finally, we decided to inhibit P2ry12 signalling using a genetic approach. Importantly, <italic>p2ry12</italic> expression is highly specific to microglia in the brain and <italic>p2ry12</italic> is considered to be a microglia signature gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crotti and Ransohoff, 2016</xref>).

Acute injection of the <italic>p2ry12</italic> gRNA efficiently mutated the <italic>p2ry12</italic> gene as shown by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, while injection of a control gRNA did not cause mutation of the <italic>p2ry12</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). RFLP analysis demonstrated the <italic>p2ry12</italic> gRNA had a mutation rate approaching 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). To further confirm efficiency on protein level, we injected gRNA into double transgenic p2ry12-GFP/mpeg1:mCherry zebrafish in which microglia (and all other macrophages) are labelled with mCherry and microglia are additionally labelled by the P2ry12-GFP fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, the p2ry12-GFP zebrafish were created by BAC mediated recombination of a GFP fusion into the genomic <italic>p2ry12</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sieger et al., 2012</xref>), thus allowing assessment of endogenous P2ry12 expression. Injection of a control gRNA into these double transgenic fish did neither alter mCherry nor P2ry12-GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Injection of <italic>p2ry12</italic> gRNA into these fish did not, as expected, impact on mCherry expression on microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Here, we showed that pre-neoplastic cells hijack the same mechanism to attract microglial processes. We showed that increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in AKT1+ cells, the release of ATP from these cells and P2ry12 signalling on microglia are required to stimulate microglial interactions with AKT1+ cells. Intriguingly, we showed that these interactions promote an increase in proliferation of the pre-neoplastic cells. Thus, we have identified a new process that contributes to the pro-tumoural activities of microglia.</p><p>A variety of mechanisms have been described how macrophages and microglia promote the growth of tumours. These mechanisms range from the release of cytokines and chemokines to modifications of the extracellular matrix (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hambardzumyan et al. (2016)</xref>). Here, we identify direct cellular interactions between microglia and pre-neoplastic cells as a cause of increased proliferation. Interestingly, cellular interactions between macrophages and tumour cells have been described recently in other tumour contexts. Roh-Johnson et al. showed direct cellular contacts between macrophages and melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Roh-Johnson et al., 2017</xref>). These cellular contacts resulted in the transfer of cytoplasm from macrophages to melanoma cells which led to an increased dissemination of the melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Roh-Johnson et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, macrophage contacts with breast cancer cells have been shown to induce RhoA GTPase signalling within the cancer cells and to trigger their intravasation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Roh-Johnson et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, several open questions remain to be answered here. What is the content within the transferred cytoplasm that leads to increased invasiveness of melanoma cells? How do macrophages upregulate RhoA GTPase activity within breast cancer cells? How do microglia induce proliferation of pre-neoplastic cells? We hypothesise that microglial processes alter the Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels within the pre-neoplastic cells which might trigger changes in their proliferative capacities. This is in line with previous studies showing a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent increase in transcription factors which are crucial for cellular division, proliferation, as well as cancer cell survival (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Roderick and Cook, 2008</xref>). Future studies will reveal if the microglia-mediated increase in proliferation is mediated via ligand-receptor interactions or via a transfer of cytoplasm as shown for macrophages and melanoma cells previously.</p><p>AKT1+ cells did not only show increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels but also showed a dynamic regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Interestingly, cells that were within close vicinity to other AKT1 expressing cells showed an increased frequency of fluctuations in their Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Thus, it’s tempting to speculate that these cells communicate via Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Interestingly, in an elegant in vivo study, astrocytoma cells have been shown to form a functional network which is connected via tumour microtubes (TMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Osswald et al., 2015</xref>). Astrocytoma cells within the network showed survival benefits and resistance against radiotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Osswald et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients have been observed within this network and a role for the network in brain invasion and proliferation has been described. Future studies will address if the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients within AKT1+ cells shown here resemble early signs of network formation. As we observed microglia to directly interact with these AKT1+ cells and their processes, we speculate that microglia contribute to the establishment of a functional network between tumour cells by promoting the outgrowth of TMs. This might be mediated by factors that have been identified before and shown to be involved in developmental processes. Microglia have been shown for example to promote neuronal survival and axonal growth by providing insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ueno et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it will be interesting to analyse the role of IGF-1 and other developmental factors in the outgrowth of TMs.</p><p>Future studies will reveal if the mechanism identified here is employed by the large variety of brain tumours and if promotion of proliferation by microglial processes is a general phenomenon within brain tumours. As expression of the P2y12 receptor, which mediates these interactions, is specific for microglia in the brain, pharmacological inhibition of the receptor might offer new routes for therapy to reduce proliferation of the tumour cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-PCNA (1:300) (ab18197, abcam) and mouse anti-4C4 (1:50). A series of washes in PBStx was carried out before samples were subsequently incubated in conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 [1:200]; goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 [1:200]; goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 [1:200]; goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 [1:200]) (Life Technologies) overnight at 4°C to reveal primary antibody localizations.

Single time-point live images were acquired through confocal imaging (Zeiss LSM710; 20x/0.8 objective; 2.30 µm intervals; 488-, and 543 nm laser lines). To investigate GCamp6f fluorescence and direct interactions between oncogene-expressing cells and microglia, time-lapse imaging was performed on a spinning disk confocal microscope (Andor iQ3; 20x/0.75 and W40x/1.15 objectives; 1.5–2 µm z-intervals; 488- and 543 nm laser lines).

To determine the fluorescence intensity change (∆F), the ‘Surfaces’ function in Imaris 8.0.2 was utilized to identify and segment all RFP+ neural cells. The mean Ca<sup>2+</sup> (GCaMP6f) intensity levels were recorded for individual cells. The final ∆F used was determined as the average mean intensity of the GCaMP6f fluorescence from all the segmented cells-of-interest.</p><p>Changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels over time were analysed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baraban et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, to quantify changes in calcium activity over time in individual cells, regions of interest (ROI) were manually applied to identify the cell-of-interest. A separate ROI was applied to an area with no GCaMP6f expression to represent background fluorescence. To determine the final ∆F/F<sub>0</sub>, the following formula was applied: ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> = (F <sub>t</sub>−F<sub>0</sub>)/(F<sub>0</sub>−F<sub>background</sub>); where F<sub>t</sub> is the fluorescent intensity in the ROI at time-point ‘<italic>t</italic>’, F<sub>0</sub> represents the average fluorescent intensity of the first 10 frames of the ROI, and F<sub>background</sub> represents the fluorescent intensity of the background ROI at time-point ‘<italic>t</italic>’.</p><p>To observe microglia interactions with RFP control cells and AKT1 positive cells, control RFP or AKT1 expression was induced in the mpeg1:EGFP transgenic zebrafish line. To determine microglial-neural cell interactions, the number of mpeg+ microglia cells in direct contact with control RFP cells or AKT1 cells were counted. To normalise for the difference in microglial numbers across samples this number was divided by the total number of mpeg+ microglial cells of the respective sample. Quantifications were plotted as the percentage of microglial cells in contact with RFP or AKT1 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Pharmacological treatments</title><p>To inhibit ATP release larvae were treated with CBX 50 µM/1% DMSO (Sigma) from 3 dpf until five dpf.

CBX treated larvae appeared inactive compared to controls and showed a reduced escape reaction upon mechanical stimulation. Inhibition of NMDA receptor signalling was achieved by treating larvae with a mixture of MK801 (100 µM) and AP5 (10 µM) (both Sigma) at 7 dpf for 5 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All experiments were performed in at least two replicates with n indicating the total number of larvae.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Brain tumours repurpose endogenous neuron to microglia signalling mechanisms to promote their own proliferation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jean-Pierre Levraud (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this follow-up study to their previous paper, the authors now elucidate a new mechanism for the observe interaction between tumor cells and microglia. As you will see in the individual reviews below, the reviewers are generally enthusiastic about the fundamental observations but have several concerns. Specifically, better quantification to rule out that some of the observed interactions are not simply due to crowding would be important.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this direct follow-up of the manuscript published in <italic>eLife</italic> one year ago, Chia et al. deepen the analysis of the interactions of microglia with pre-tumoral cells in their model of mosaic overexpression of AKT1 in zebrafish neural cells. This time, they show that tumoral neural cells have elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and sometimes pulse, and they propose that, as do active neurons, this attracts microglia via ATP secretion, and induces direct interactions that somehow promote tumor proliferation. In support of their hypothesis, they show that microglia have more frequent contacts with pretumoral cells that control cells and that this is abrogated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry blockade. Furthermore, using CRISPR-mediated deletion of the gene encoding the p2ry12, a purinergic receptor expressed by microglia, they find that both frequency of contacts and proliferation of tumor cells depend on this receptor function.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The efficiency of CRISPR-mediated gene deletion in F<sub>0</sub> fish is impressive, but the controls are improper. Controls should receive CAS9, the TracrRNA and a control guide RNA.</p><p>2) A central tenet of this work is that tumor cells attract microglia at short range. However, the higher frequency or contact of microglia with tumor cells (Figure 1B) could be trivially explained by the larger number of microglial cells (previous paper, Figure 4A) as well as by the larger number of tumor cells (and perhaps also their larger size, see Figure 1A) compared to control cells. Assuming random movements of microglia, frequency of interactions should be, in first approximation, proportional to the product of the frequencies of each cell type. If the measured number of contacts are normalized by this product of cell frequencies, is there still a significant difference?</p><p>I wonder about the specificity of this interaction (although the authors do show videos of the microglia interacting with/directly touching the neural cells) – could they show another cell type in the brain that isn't contacted in the same way as the neural cells?</p><p>3) The authors claim that AKT1+ cells display more frequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> firing and show nice examples (2E, 2F) but a quantification should be provided.</p><p>4) Are tumor cells with the highest Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels more frequently in contact with microglia? This would certainly reinforce the author's claims. This may not be trivial as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter use the same fluorescence channel as the macrophage reporter, but the patterns are very different so it should be doable.</p><p>5) It is satisfying to draw a straight line from AKT1 activation to Ca<sup>2+</sup> to ATP release to p2ry12 receptor. The logic seemed to be that increased calcium leads to ATP release which would link to microglial interactions. But, why would increased AKT1 activity lead to increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>? Is this a direct effect, or are there expected to be many steps between AKT1 and Ca increase? Does AKT1 have other important effects? If Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the primary mediator of the effect, can they induce increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> in neurons via another mechanism (e.g. drug treatment or genetic) and see a similar effect?</p><p>6) Could loss of p2ry12 in microglia lead to other deficiencies/abnormalities in the microglia? They have similar numbers of microglia per the author's data, but do they move around as much? Do they extend the same number of processes? One might predict that increased p2ry12 expression on microglia might lead to increased interactions with neurons (even in the absence of AKT1+ transgene expression with &quot;basal&quot; ATP release) and then even potentially increased neural cell numbers, if this is a primary mechanism by which microglia induce neural cell number increase.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46912.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The efficiency of CRISPR-mediated gene deletion in F<sub>0</sub> fish is impressive, but the controls are improper.

As shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, injection of the control guide RNA did neither cause mutation of the p2ry12 locus nor abolish p2ry12-GFP expression in the p2ry12:p2ry12-GFP transgene. Furthermore, control guide RNA injection did not impact on interactions between microglia and AKT1 positive cells (Figure 4D) and proliferation rates of AKT1 positive cells were not altered in control guide RNA injected larvae (Figure 5B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A central tenet of this work is that tumor cells attract microglia at short range.

If the measured number of contacts are normalized by this product of cell frequencies, is there still a significant difference?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point and in first approximation contacts might be enforced by high density of cells by chance. However, we have already addressed this point in our previous paper (Chia et al., 2018) and have additional lines of evidence showing that the observed interactions are independent of cell density:</p><p>Many of these direct cellular surface interactions were observed for several hours without any interruptions, thus it is unlikely that these were random contacts simply enforced by the high density of microglial and AKT1 positive cells. To address this further, we provided an additional data set in the previous paper. Here, we injected lower amounts of the lexOP:<italic>AKT1</italic>-lexOP:tagRFP construct into oocytes of double transgenic mpeg1:EGFP/NBT:ΔLexPR fish and screened for fish with lower numbers and isolated AKT1 positive cells. In these larvae microglia were frequently seen to interact with AKT1 positive cells (previous paper (Chia et al., 2018): Figure 3C, D; Video 3 and 4, n = 6 samples analyzed). These interactions lasted for several hours and were not seen with control cells (not shown). Thus, we conclude that microglia are pro-actively interacting with AKT1 positive cells.</p><p>We would like to highlight that all quantifications of interactions in this manuscript were performed at 5 dpf. At this developmental age larval zebrafish microglia appear to be sessile and random movements are significantly reduced compared to earlier developmental time points (3 dpf and 4 dpf) (Svahn et al., 2012, Figure 5B). Thus, it is unlikely that microglia randomly contact AKT1 cells because of their movements.</p><p>Furthermore, for the quantifications provided in this manuscript we have normalised for the increased number of microglia in AKT1 samples compared to control samples. The quantifications show the percentage of microglia which displayed interactions with RFP control cells or AKT1 positive cells (number of interacting microglia/number of total microglia x 100). We have added an additional line in the Results and extended our explanation in the Materials and methods now to highlight this point.</p><p>The number of AKT1 cells or RFP control cells varies between samples due to the transient nature of the expression system. We have quantified the number of AKT1 cells and RFP cells in the analysed 5dpf samples and do not detect a significant difference between control and AKT1 samples. The average number of AKT1 cells in these samples (at 5 dpf) was 383 while the average number of RFP cells was 519. Increased proliferation rates in AKT1+ cells are detected from 7 dpf and lead to increased numbers of AKT1+ cells only at later stages. Thus, as numbers of RFP cells and AKT1 are comparable at 5 dpf, this does not impact on possible interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I wonder about the specificity of this interaction (although the authors do show videos of the microglia interacting with/directly touching the neural cells) – could they show another cell type in the brain that isn't contacted in the same way as the neural cells?</p></disp-quote><p>The responses observed appear to be highly specific for cells undergoing malignant transformation. While control RFP neural cells are only sporadically contacted by microglia we see a significant increase in the number of interactions with AKT1 positive neural cells. This is also shown in the Videos 1-4 of the previous manuscript.</p><p>We have now overexpressed the HRASV12 oncogene in neural cells, which stimulates similar microglial responses (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, we have expressed AKT1 and HRASV12 under the zic4 enhancer in proliferating domains of the developing CNS (Distel et al., 2009, Mayrhofer et al., 2017). Here we observe an attraction of microglia to HRASV12 and AKT1 positive zic4 cells and direct cellular interactions as well (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We conclude that these interactions are induced during the process of oncogenic cell transformation, independent of the cell type in the CNS. Future studies will reveal if differences between oncogenes and cell types exist.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors claim that AKT1+ cells display more frequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> firing and show nice examples (2E, 2F) but a quantification should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not provided quantifications here as the observed Ca<sup>2+</sup> firing (∆F/F<sub>0</sub> increase &gt; 0.05) in AKT1 cells has not been observed in any of the analysed control RFP cells. In contrast, 31% of the observed AKT1 cells show these Ca<sup>2+</sup> firing events. The analysed control RFP cells showed only minor changes in their Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (∆F/F<sub>0</sub> increase &lt; 0.03). We have included this information in the text now. We speculate that these significant increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> are caused by the malignant transformation due to AKT1 overexpression and cannot be reached under physiological conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Are tumor cells with the highest Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels more frequently in contact with microglia? This would certainly reinforce the author's claims. This may not be trivial as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter use the same fluorescence channel as the macrophage reporter, but the patterns are very different so it should be doable.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a very interesting question but not trivial to address as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter and the macrophages/microglia are visualised in the same channel. Furthermore, signal levels for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter are significantly lower compared to signal levels from macrophages/microglia. Thus, imaging settings need to be carefully adjusted to visualise Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels but not to massively overexpose macrophages/microglia. We have tested this now and managed to visualise macrophages/microglia and high-level Ca<sup>2+</sup> cells at the same time. We provide a new set of images in the revised version of the manuscript (Figure 3). These images show examples of microglia directly responding to cells upon an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is satisfying to draw a straight line from AKT1 activation to Ca<sup>2+</sup> to ATP release to p2ry12 receptor. The logic seemed to be that increased calcium leads to ATP release which would link to microglial interactions. But, why would increased AKT1 activity lead to increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>? Is this a direct effect, or are there expected to be many steps between AKT1 and Ca increase? Does AKT1 have other important effects? If Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the primary mediator of the effect, can they induce increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> in neurons via another mechanism (e.g. drug treatment or genetic) and see a similar effect?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, based on our data AKT1 activation results in increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, which leads to ATP release and P2ry12 activation. AKT1 signalling is activated in many cancers and governs tumour initiation and progression. AKT1 signalling is involved in a variety of cellular functions such as proliferation, metabolism, cell survival and migration. However, how AKT1 impacts on Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (directly or indirectly) has not been addressed so far. We speculate that the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels is not specific to the oncogene (AKT1 in this case) but is part of the process of oncogenic transformation. We have tested HRASV12 now in addition and see similar increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in HRASV12 positive cells. Future studies will have to reveal how oncogenic transformation leads to an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. As we highlight in the discussion of the manuscript, astrocytoma cells have been shown to form networks and to communicate via Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (Osswald et al., 2015). Ongoing work in the laboratory is currently addressing if the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients observed here resemble the first signs of network formation.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is clearly the primary mediator of the observed interactions. We and others have shown in previous publications that an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in neural cells is sufficient to stimulate microglia interactions. In Sieger et al., 2012, we have injected caged IP3 into single hemispheres of larval brains. Local flash-uncaging of IP3 resulted in increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in single neurons. This resulted in responses of surrounding microglia sending their processes towards the uncaged spot (Sieger et al., 2012, Figure 3G, H and Figure 5 B-D). Furthermore, we could show that these responses to local Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase were dependent on ATP and P2ry12 signalling (Sieger et al., 2012, Figure 5E-J). These results were confirmed by others using different methods. Li et al., 2012, used local uncaging of glutamate in larval zebrafish brains and reported similar responses of microglia. Eyo et al., 2014, used a slice culture model and showed that NMDA mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase in neurons directly attracts microglial processes. In conclusion, there is published evidence using a variety of models and tools showing that the pure increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in neural cells is sufficient to mediate microglial processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Could loss of p2ry12 in microglia lead to other deficiencies/abnormalities in the microglia? They have similar numbers of microglia per the author's data, but do they move around as much? Do they extend the same number of processes? One might predict that increased p2ry12 expression on microglia might lead to increased interactions with neurons (even in the absence of AKT1+ transgene expression with &quot;basal&quot; ATP release) and then even potentially increased neural cell numbers, if this is a primary mechanism by which microglia induce neural cell number increase.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question which has been addressed by us and others in recent years. In Sieger et al., 2012, we used morpholino oligonucleotides and pharmacological tools to inhibit p2ry12 function. We could show that injection of p2ry12 specific morpholinos (as well as pharmacological inhibition) completely abolished microglial responses to injury mediated Ca<sup>2+ –</sup> ATP signalling. In line with these studies we showed that other microglial functions were not altered upon p2ry12 knockdown. Microglia motility, process length and process motility as well as their capacity to respond to bacteria and phagocytose bacteria were similar to controls (Sieger et al., 2012, Figure S1 and S2).</p><p>Haynes et al., 2006 (Nature Neuroscience) analysed p2ry12 deficient mice and showed that these mice have a normal prevalence, distribution and morphology of microglia. Furthermore, they showed that processes from p2ry12 deficient microglia occupy the same area as processes from wt microglia and that baseline process motility of p2ry12 deficient microglia is not altered (Haynes et al., 2016, Supplementary Figure 1). Thus, according to our own published data as well as published data from rodent models, P2ry12 signalling is specifically needed for microglial responses towards extracellular ATP.</p><p>Interestingly, under physiological conditions, ATP-p2ry12 mediated contacts between microglia and neural cells do not impact on the proliferative capacity of neural cells. In Figure 5B of the current manuscript we show that proliferation rates of neural cells in p2ry12 deficient larvae are similar when compared to control larvae. Li et al., 2012, identified the role for microglial process contacts under physiological conditions and showed that highly active neurons stimulate microglial contacts via ATP release and that these contacts lead to a downregulation of neural activity. Thus, the identified role for microglial processes to induce proliferation seems to be specific for neural cells undergoing malignant transformation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
