physiological and pathological processes, including cellular stress. In order to visualise both Poly-, and Mono-, ADP-ribosylation in vivo, we engineered specific fluorescent probes. Using them, we show that amino-acid starvation triggers an unprecedented display of mono-ADP-ribosylation that governs the formation of Sec body, a recently identified stress assembly that forms in Drosophila cells. We show that dPARP16 catalytic activity is necessary and sufficient for both amino-acid starvation induced mono-ADP-ribosylation and subsequent Sec body formation and cell survival. Importantly, dPARP16 catalyses the modification of Sec16, a key Sec body component, and we show that it is a critical event for the formation of this stress assembly. Taken together our findings establish a novel example for the role of mono-ADP-ribosylation in the formation of stress assemblies, and link this modification to a metabolic stress.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21475.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21475.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Sec16</kwd><kwd>PARP16</kwd><kwd>fluorescence probe</kwd><kwd>stress assemblies</kwd><kwd>amino-acid starvation</kwd><kwd>mono-ADP-ribosylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Netherlands Wetenschappelijke Organisatie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>822-020-016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rabouille</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hubrecht Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rabouille</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Amino-acid induced Sec body formation is mediated by PARP16 dependent MARylation of Sec16, a component of the endoplasmic reticulum exit site.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>ADP-ribosylation, either poly (PARylation) or mono (MARylation), is a post-translational modification that refers to the addition of one or multiple ADP-ribose units to protein substrates. It is catalysed by PARPs (also called ADP-Ribose Transferase class D, ARTD), a family of 17 proteins in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hottiger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leung, 2014</xref>). PARPs have emerged as major players in several physiological processes, such as transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodelling and telomere functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krishnakumar and Kraus, 2010</xref>), cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2013</xref>) and cellular signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Watanabe et al., 2016</xref>) as well as pathological ones, such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fujimori et al., 2012</xref>) and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cosi and Marien, 1999</xref>).</p><p>ADP-ribosylation has also been shown to occur during cellular stress. The founding member, the nuclear PARP1, is required for DNA repair during DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gibson and Kraus, 2012</xref>) where it hyper-PARylates itself as well as surrounding histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, MARylation is linked to ER stress via PARP16, the only membrane-anchored member of this family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jwa and Chang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di Paola et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>However, the progress in understanding the role of these modifications is limited by difficulties in identifying individual targets and to validate them during specific biological processes. This is mainly due to the labile bonds between ADP-ribose to the substrate, and the low abundance of this modification in steady state conditions. So far, chemical tools, such as NAD+ analogues, have been used for in vitro approaches, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carter-O'Connell et al., 2016</xref>). Monitoring PARylation has been possible in vitro using the PAR affinity resin (Tulip-4301 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tulipbiolabs.com/4301.html">www.tulipbiolabs.com/4301.html</ext-link>) and monoclonal antibodies, such as 10H and LP96-10. However, these antibodies bind poly-, not mono-ADP-ribose. This represents a serious limitation as most PARPs are predicted to be MARylation enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hottiger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leung, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">BÃ¼tepage et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, the role of this form of the modification in intracellular processes is largely unexplored.</p><p>Several biological modules, known as macrodomains, that specifically recognize either poly- or mono-ADP-ribose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karras et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rack et al., 2016</xref>) have also been used in pull down experiments for large scale proteomics studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vivelo and Leung, 2015</xref>).. Accordingly, macrodomains H2A1.1 show binding specificity for PARylated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kustatscher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Timinszky et al., 2009</xref>). And macrodomains from human PARP14 that exclusively binds Mono-ADP-ribose have being used to pull down MARylated PARP10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Forst et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly these macrodomains do not exhibit hydrolase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rosenthal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jankevicius et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we took advantage of the specificity of these macrodomains to design, build and fine-tune stable MARylation (MAD) and PARylation (PAD) detection probes. We then used them to follow PARylation and MARylation in vivo during cellular stresses, with particular focus on amino-acid starvation that induces the formation of a recently described stress assembly, the Sec body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zacharogianni et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Sec body formation results from the inhibition of a major anabolic pathway, the protein transport through the secretory pathway, upon amino-acid starvation of Drosophila cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amodio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zacharogianni et al., 2014</xref>). The secretory pathway ensures the delivery of signal peptide containing proteins to the extracellular medium and the plasma membrane and to nearly all membrane-bound compartments. After the synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), they exit this organelle in COPII coated vesicles that form and bud at defined sites on the ER, called ER exit sites (ERES). COPII formation requires Sar1, its GEF Sec12 and the structural proteins forming the coat itself, Sec23/24 and Sec13/31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miller and Schekman, 2013</xref>) as well as the large hydrophilic scaffold protein Sec16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sprangers and Rabouille, 2015</xref>). Newly synthesized proteins then reach the Golgi apparatus where they are processed, sorted and dispatch to their final destination.</p><p>The inhibition of protein transport through the secretory pathway upon amino-acid starvation is accompanied by the remodeling of ERES and the formation of a novel type of pro-survival stress assembly with liquid droplet properties, the Sec body, where COPII coat proteins and Sec16 are stored and protected from degradation during the period of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zacharogianni et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Using YFP-PAD, we show that PARylation is not prominent during amino-acid starvation. Conversely, using MAD, we show that MARylation is strongly induced by this nutrient stress. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this modification is required for the formation of Sec bodies. We identify dPARP16 as the enzyme necessary and sufficient to catalyse MARylation and Sec body formation during amino-acid starvation. Last, we identify the ERES component Sec16 as a novel dPARP16 substrate and show that it is MARylated on its C-terminus in an amino-acid starvation specific manner. We propose that this event initiates the formation of the Sec bodies and poses Sec16 as a stress response protein.</p><p>Taken together, our findings establish an unprecedented example for the role of mono-ADP-ribosylation in the formation of stress assemblies, and link this modification to a metabolic stress. Furthermore, this demonstrates that the macrodomain-based probes that we built are useful and specific tools to follow ADP-ribosylation taking place during biological processes in vitro and in vivo. We propose that the visualization of ADP-ribosylation will shed light on PARPs function during specific biological processes and illustrates the physiological relevance of these post-translational modifications during stress. In this regard, we have identified dPARP16 as a novel key factor in cell survival to amino-acid starvation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visualising PARylation and MARylation in vivo upon cellular stress</title><p>To visualise whether PARylation events take place during amino-acid starvation, we engineered a PARylation detection probe (PAD) using the human macrodomain H2A1.1 that specifically recognises poly-ADP-ribose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kustatscher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Timinszky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Forst et al., 2013</xref>) fused to YFP (YFP-PAD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When expressed in Drosophila S2 cells, YFP-PAD is both cytoplasmic and nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Amino-acid starvation only elicits a weak remodelling of the probe in the cytoplasm and an increase of its nuclear pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To validate the functionality of the probe, we treated S2 cells with arsenate, a treatment that, in human cells, elicits PARylation known to be required for stress granules integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leung et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, YFP-PAD forms defined cytoplasmic structures in arsenate treated S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) that partially co-localise with stress granules (marked by FMR1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), showing that YFP-PAD is functional.

To approach this, we engineered an optimised a MARylation detection (MAD) probe based upon the macrodomains 1â3 of human PARP14. Indeed, crystallography of these macrodomains have revealed a conserved fold that binds Mono-ADP-ribose. Furthermore, calorimetric affinity assays show that the affinity for mono-ADP-ribose is contributed by the three macrodomains in a cooperative manner, whereas each macrodomain taken individually does not bind the moiety. Last, hPARP14 macrodomains 1â3 bind specifically MARylated, but not PARylated, substrates in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Forst et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the PARP14 macrodomains 1â3 were GFP-tagged at their N-terminus, and a linker was inserted to preserve their binding capabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21475.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Amino-acid starvation leads to the formation of MARylation spots visualised with GFP-MAD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of the GFP-MAD probe.Â (<bold>B, Bâ</bold>) Fluorescence of GFP-MAD in growing S2 cells (Schneiderâs) and upon amino-acid starvation (KRB) for increasing amount of time as indicated (<bold>B</bold>).

When cells are starved of amino-acids for increasing length of time, GFP-MAD adopts a defined pattern. After 1 hr, it concentrates in one spot in a low percentage of cells (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,Bâ</xref>). After 2 hr, it forms 1â3 spots in a larger number of cells. Thereafter, the number of spots (some of them with a U/donut shape) (arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâE</xref>) increases and they tend to concentrate in the middle of the cell after 4 hr (not shown). These results suggest that amino-acid starvation triggers cytoplasmic MARylation events that are visualised using GFP-MAD.</p><p>To demonstrate that the GFP-MAD spots forming upon amino-acid starvation correspond to the detection of MARylation events, a point mutation (G1055E) was introduced in the macrodomain two of GFP-MAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This mutation affects the ADP-ribose binding pocket and therefore interferes with the ADP-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Forst et al., 2013</xref>) and in vitro to completely abrogate its binding to mono-ADP-ribose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karras et al., 2005</xref>). Strikingly, amino-acid starvation of S2 cells expressing G1055E GFP-MAD does not result in any pattern and the mutant probe remains diffuse in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,Câ</xref>).</p><p>Next, we visualised MARylation events in live cells. This confirms that MAD spots start forming about 1 hr after starvation and accumulate. It also shows that they are overall stable, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), although few appear more transient with an average lifetime of 50 min (not shown). Using a Fluorescence-to-ImmunoEM correlative method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vicidomini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hassink et al., 2012</xref>), we showed that GFP-MAD spots correspond to non-membrane bound structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,Eâ</xref>), ranging from 600 nm to two microns in diameter. We tested their reversibility upon nutrient replenishment following starvation and found that they are fully reversible after 30 min of Schneiderâs addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,Fâ</xref>).

Together, this suggests that MARylation of ERES components is linked to Sec body formation.</p><p>To strengthen the notion that Sec body components are MARylated upon amino-acid starvation, we focused on Sec16, a key Sec body component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zacharogianni et al., 2014</xref>). We set up an in vivo MARylation assay as an alternative to the classical in vitro one that uses purified components. To do this, we designed anÂ anchoring-away strategy whereÂ by Sec16 is tagged at its C-terminus with the CAAX motif of Ras that efficiently anchors it to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hancock et al., 1991</xref>), and is co-expressed with cherry-MAD. Given that this probe specifically binds MARylated substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), the reasoning is that if Sec16-CAAX is MARylated upon amino-acid starvation, it will recruit cherry-MAD to the plasma membrane.</p><p>First, we verified that Sec16-GFP-CAAX expression results in its localisation to the plasma membrane. From there, it is able to recruit other Sec body components specifically upon amino-acid starvation (such as Sec23, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>, arrows). As a result, Sec bodies are no longer formed in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). When cherry-MAD and Sec16-GFP-CAAX are co-transfected in S2 cells in growing conditions, theÂ cherry-MAD remains diffuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). However, it strongly co-localises with Sec16-GFP-CAAX at the plasma membrane upon amino-acid starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Aâ,E</xref>). These results suggest that Sec16 is likely MARylated.

This specificity is sustained by three arguments: (i) MAD is designed and built using PARP14 macrodomains 1â3. Crystallography and calorimetric assays show that each macrodomain has a conserved fold with high binding affinity for mono-ADP-ribose (particularly macrodomains 2 and 3) and the affinity required for in vivo visualisation is provided by the three macrodomains together in a cooperative manner. (ii) We show that the mutated G1055E probe (affecting the binding pocket of macrodomain 2 in such as way that it does not bind mono-ADP-ribose any longer) does not elicit a pattern upon amino-acid starvation in vivo. (iii) The amino-acid starvation GFP-MAD pattern is abrogated upon depletion of dPARP16, the closest homologue of an established human MARylation enzyme PARP16. Conversely, overexpression of dPARP16 elicits GFP-MAD spot formation (but not YFP-PAD spots, which rule out PARylation events). This is confirmed by the use of a PARylation detection probe YFP-PAD. It allows the visualization of PARylation events consistent with those reported to occur to RNA binding proteins upon arsenate treatment leading to stress granule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">GagnÃ© et al., 2008</xref>). However, YFP-PAD is not remodelled during amino-acid starvation suggesting that PARylation is not prominent during this stress. Taken together, these evidences demonstrate the specificity of GFP-MAD in binding mono-ADP-ribose and detecting MARylation events.</p><p>Second, MAD can be used in cells to follow MARylation in real time. In this regard, GFP-MAD allows the visualisation of an unprecedented display of MARylation events upon amino-acid starvation (but not heat shock or arsenate poisoning) under the form of non-membrane bound, reversible spots/rings in the cytoplasm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that MARylation response is visualised in real time during stress.</p><p>Third, GFP-MAD has also allowed us to identify dPARP16 as the enzyme catalysing these events in defined regions of the cytoplasm in a dynamic manner. We propose that GFP-MAD spots represent a concentration of MARylated substrates reflecting local dPARP16 activation. This is supported by their co-localization upon expression of both enzyme and probe. This makes GFP-MAD, an efficient activity sensor of the nutrient stress response and dPARP16 the key MARylation enzyme eliciting this response.</p><p>Fourth, GFP-MAD can be used for in vitro approaches such as IP and this lead us to the identification of Sec16 as a MARylation substrate. Last, GFP-MAD and cherry-MAD can be used in vivo and in an anchor-away MARylation assay as an alternative to in vitro approaches using purified components. This has allowed us to visualized MARylation in real time and map the MARylated region of Sec16.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>dPARP16, Sec16 and Sec body formation</title><p>dPARP16 is necessary and sufficient for Sec body formation upon amino-acid starvation and this creates an unprecedented link between MARylation, metabolic stress and the formation of stress assembly. dPARP16 is necessary for cell survival during amino-acid starvation and recovery. This makes dPARP16 a key enzyme for the cells to specifically cope with amino-acid starvation, as the viability of dPARP16 depleted cells kept in full medium is not compromised. This makes dPARP16 a key survival factor upon amino-acid starvation.</p><p>Nutrient starvation in yeast also leads to storage of metabolic enzymes in reversible assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</xref>), such as glutamine synthetase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Petrovska et al., 2014</xref>) or proteasome subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peters et al., 2013</xref>). Although no PARPs have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the regulation of their organisation might be controlled by SIRT, another class of NAD+ dependent protein that also display ADP-ribosylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">BÃ¼tepage et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, given the abundance of PARPs with predicted MARylation activity in the mammalian genome, it is likely that additional ones, will be required and/or involved in the formation of stress assemblies upon different biological processes, including metabolic stress as described here. We have reported that large Sec bodies did not form in mammalian cells upon conditions used for Drosophila cells, although a remodelling of the early secretory pathway was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zacharogianni et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the fine dissection of the signalling pathways involved in Sec body formation will allow us to recapitulate conditions to trigger their formation in mammalian cells and tissues.</p><p>According to our RNAseq data of S2 cells in growing conditions and upon amino-acid starvation conditions (unpublished), dPARP16 has a very low transcriptional level when compared to most genes, suggesting that its protein level is also low. Because dPARP16 moderate overexpression in growing cells leads the detection of MARylation events, it suggests that dPARP16 overexpression leads to its activation. This also suggests that dPARP16 level needs to be kept low in basal conditions to avoid its activation, challenging the detection of its activity in basal conditions. Conversely, dPARP16 is essential during stress, at least amino-acid starvation as depletion of dPARP16 affects the viability of cells during the stress period. How is PARP16 activated upon amino-acid starvation remains to be elucidated. Given the nature of the stress, TORC1 activation would be an ideal pathway but we have shown that it is not involved in Sec body formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zacharogianni et al., 2014</xref>).Â Another possibility is the fluctuation in the intracellular pH as shownÂ forÂ yeast upon energy deprivation that results in the formation of macromolecular assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Munder et al., 2016</xref>). However, the time scale is very different (minutes for the drop in pH fluctuation versus hours of starvation for Sec body formation). Furthermore, the assemblies thatÂ form upon pH fluctuation do not appear to be mediated by a signalling pathway. This remains to be investigated.</p><p>In mammalian cells, PARP16 is activated via auto-MARylation triggered by ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jwa and Chang, 2012</xref>). As a result, it MARylates two key kinases of the ER stress response UPR, Ire1 and PERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>), leading to their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jwa and Chang, 2012</xref>) and the unfolded Protein Response. As dPARP16 shares many features with its human counterpart, ER stress could in principle lead to Sec body formation. However, we have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zacharogianni et al., 2014</xref>) and our unpublished results) that inducing ER stress does not lead to Sec body formation. Although ER stress might be involved in the amino-acid starvation stress response, it is not sufficient to trigger it. This result is reinforced by the demonstration that cell survival is significantly more affected by amino-acid starvation than by ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>). As a result, dPARP16 appears to be more critical for amino-acid starvation than for ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>This suggests that additional signals are generated during amino-acid starvation. These are under investigation. Another substrate of mammalian PARP16 is karyopherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di Paola et al., 2012</xref>), a component required for nuclear export. However, our unpublished results shows that the pharmacological inhibition of nuclear export does not inhibit Sec body formation (not shown), suggesting that at least during amino-acid starvation, karyopherin might not play a prominent role and that dPARP16 has different substrates.</p><p>One of these substrates is the ERES/Sec body component Sec16 and more specifically a conserved 44 amino-acid sequence (SRDC) in its C-terminus. Indeed, The CAAX version of SRDC recruits cherry MAD to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of SRDC leads to the formation of Sec bodies in a dPARP16 dependent manner, and SRCD rescues Sec body formation in Sec16 depleted cells. This suggests that Sec16-SRDC MARylation is a triggering event in Sec body formation.</p><p>The discovery of a short peptide required for the formation of Sec bodies is reminiscent to the existence of an Amyloid Converting Peptide in proteins found in nuclear amyloid bodies in cells upon several stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Audas et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, amyloidogenesis is mediated by this motif binding a long non-coding RNA that could be equivalent or comparable to the SRDC MARylation during Sec body formation. Whether the SRCD sequence is also also present in other proteins recruited to Sec bodies remains to be investigated.</p><p>In the context of the full-length endogenous protein, SRDC MARylation could act as both a signalling and structural event allowing the recruitment of Sec16 and other ERES components into Sec bodies. However, SRCD on its own is not recruited to Sec bodies, and our interpretation is that it may act only as a signalling event for Sec body formation. The nature of this signalling need to be further investigated. This is in line with the fact that GFP-MAD is not readily observed within the Sec body core. GFP-MAD appears as a ring/spotÂ at the base of Sec bodies. Although this is consistent with the protein packing and competing binding that takes place during the formation of stress assemblies (that most likely would exclude GFP-MAD), it might also suggest that MARylated Sec16 forms a signalling platform. This would lead to the modifications of other Sec body components allowing their incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, PARylation has been proposed to preferentially occur on LCSs (Low complexity sequences, that is, region of poor amino-acid diversity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leung, 2014</xref>). These are normally thought to correspond to disordered regions. Sec16 is rich in LCSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zacharogianni et al., 2014</xref>) and SRDC is intrinsically disordered, therefore accessible to be modified by dPARP16. Taken together, we postulate thatÂ Sec16 isÂ a stress response protein and a new substrate for the pro-survival dPARP16Â upon amino-acid starvation</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, amino acid starvation, depletions (RNAi) and transfections</title><p>Drosophila S2 cells with a non authenticated identity (the original source is unknown but they have been used in the lab for the last 15 years and they are mycoplasma free) were cultured in Schneiderâs medium (Sigma)Â supplemented with 10% insect tested foetal bovine serum at 26Â°C as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kondylis and Rabouille, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kondylis et al., 2007</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;In vivo vizualisation of Mono-ADP-ribosylation by dPARP16 upon amino-acid starvation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Benjamin S Glick (Reviewer #2) and a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. As you can see, the reviewers only have a few suggestions to improve the paper, which mainly have to do with how you lay out the figures and some explanation.</p><p>Aguilera et al. use specifically engineered probes to visualize mono and poly ADP-ribosylation (MAR and PARylation) in living cells. The authors find that in insect cells MARylation is triggered by amino acid starvation. MARylation in these starved cells further leads to the formation of Sec bodies, a stress inducible protein assembly that protect cells from the negative consequences of amino acid depletion. Overall this is an interesting and well executed paper. It adds significantly to our understanding of stress response pathways, and to the function of mono-ADP ribosylation, and of Parp16 in particular. It shows for the first time a link between amino acid metabolism, protein ADP-ribosylation and stress-inducible assemblies.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>One issue raised was the following: Is dPARP16 upregulated or activated upon amino acid starvation? Otherwise, as pointed out in the Discussion, if dPAPR16 were constitutively expressed and active, Sec bodies would form under growing conditions. This issue should be addressed if possible in the experimental section.</p><p>A second point was <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. The cell survival curve strikes this reviewer as very important, more so than several of the molecular details reported in other figures, yet it was very much under-emphasized in the Introduction, Results and Discussion. The role of Parp16 in protecting cells from stress as measured by cell survival should probably be a stand-alone figure, with appropriate methods and discussion, and perhaps a bit more investigation. From a general stress-response perspective knowing if a pathway is important for survival is the most significant point of all. The reviewer was frustrated that the methods used to generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> did not seem to be in the paper, and that the error bars look inappropriate (they may be SEM values which are usually not the right way to quantify error in biological experiments). It was also a surprise that the cells die so quickly in what seems like a relatively mild stress, and wondered if this deserved comment. We would like to see the same curve for a classic ER stressor like tunicamycin or thapsigargin +/- dParp16, since the homolog was implicated in survival in response to these stresses in human cells.</p><p>Another concern is with the error bars on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. They are probably SEM within one experiment, but that isn't a realistic measure of likely overall error. Better to just include all the data, the SD, or some other measure of variability.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21475.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions</italic></p><p><italic>One issue raised was the following: Is dPARP16 upregulated or activated upon amino acid starvation?

This issue should be addressed if possible in the experimental section.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and wish to point out that this experiment has been performed in the original manuscript. Indeed dPARP16 overexpression leads to the formation of Sec bodies in growing conditions (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 D, D</xref>â and E). We therefore concluded that dPARP16 is not only necessary but also sufficient for Sec body formation.</p><p>We hypothesized that dPARP16 overexpression leads to an increased concentration resulting in its activation via dimerization or oligomerization, as it is the case for many plasma membrane receptors. As we pointed out in the discussion, we propose that in basal condition dPARP16 transcription levels are kept very low to ensure that it remains inactive.</p><p>However, it is currently unknown how endogenous PARP16 is activated upon starvation. We have commented on this aspect in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>A second point was <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. The cell survival curve strikes this reviewer as very important, more so than several of the molecular details reported in other figures, yet it was very much under-emphasized in the Introduction, Results and Discussion.

We would like to see the same curve for a classic ER stressor like tunicamycin or thapsigargin +/- dParp16, since the homolog was implicated in survival in response to these stresses in human cells.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have repeated the experiment monitoring the role of dPARP16 in cell survival to amino-acid starvation. As requested, we have also included a classical ER stress (using DTT at 2mM), a concentration known in the field to trigger this stress readily.</p><p>The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref> (as a standalone).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, we confirm that upon amino-acid starvation in dPARP16 depleted cells and that the cell survival is significantly lower compared to the mock depleted. Furthermore, upon stress relief, the cell recovery in dPARP16 depleted cells is significantly lower compared to the mock depleted. Importantly, the cell survival is unaffected in dPARP16 depleted cells that are maintained in growing conditions. Given the role of dPARP16 in Sec body formation (this manuscript) and given the role of Sec bodies in cell survival (Zacharoggianni et al. 2014), we propose that dPARP16 critically helps to protect the cells from amino-acid starvation through its crucial role in the formation of the pro-survival Sec bodies.</p><p>Taken together, this allows us to postulate dPARP16 as a key survival factor during amino-acid starvation. This has been now clearly stated in the Introduction, Results and Discussion.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>, we included the ER stress results thus allowing the comparison between amino-acid starvation and DTT treatment. DTT treatment for 3h only leads to a slight decrease in cell viability when compared to amino-acid starvation. This clearly demonstrates that amino-acid starvation is not a middle stress and is in fact stronger than ER stress (and heat shock as shown in Jevtov et al., 2015). Furthermore, dPARP16 depletion has hardly any effect on the survival to DTT treatment, whereas it has a very strong effect on amino-acid starved cells. This shows that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, dPARP16 is needed to respond to the starvation stress.</p><p>The reason for which we have separated these two sets of results is that the DTT experiment did not fit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> but were best discussed in the context of what is known for human PARP16 in ER stress.</p><p><italic>Another concern is with the error bars on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. They are probably SEM within one experiment, but that isn't a realistic measure of likely overall error. Better to just include all the data, the SD, or some other measure of variability.</italic> </p><p>We now present the results using standard deviation (to display the biological variability, as requested by the reviewer) based on at least 3 biological replicates, each comprising 3 technical replicates that were averaged. We added all the details about the experimental procedure and analysis in the Materials and methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
