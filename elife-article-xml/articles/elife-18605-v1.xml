endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contains a network of membrane tubules, which transitions into sheets during mitosis. Network formation involves curvature-stabilizing proteins, including the reticulons (Rtns), as well as the membrane-fusing GTPase atlastin (ATL) and the lunapark protein (Lnp). Here, we have analyzed how these proteins cooperate. ATL is needed to not only form, but also maintain, the ER network. Maintenance requires a balance between ATL and Rtn, as too little ATL activity or too high Rtn4a concentrations cause ER fragmentation. Lnp only affects the abundance of three-way junctions and tubules. We suggest a model in which ATL-mediated fusion counteracts the instability of free tubule ends. ATL tethers and fuses tubules stabilized by the Rtns, and transiently sits in newly formed three-way junctions. Lnp subsequently moves into the junctional sheets and forms oligomers. Lnp is inactivated by mitotic phosphorylation, which contributes to the tubule-to-sheet conversion of the ER.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18605.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18605.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18605.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The endoplasmic reticulum is a compartment within the cells of plants, animals and other eukaryotes. This compartment plays a number of roles within cells, for example, serving as the site where many proteins and fat molecules are built. Most often the endoplasmic reticulum exists as a network of thin tubules. However, this shape changes during the lifetime of a single cell, and the endoplasmic reticulum converts into flattened structures known as sheets when the cell divides.</p><p>Three classes of proteins are known to affect the shape of the endoplasmic reticulum. Proteins called reticulons (called Rtns for short) stabilize the highly curved membranes that make up the thin tubules, while proteins called atlastins (ATLs) fuse these tubules together to form the interconnected network. However, the exact role of the third protein – called lunapark (Lnp) – is unknown. Moreover, it is not clear how these three proteins work together to coordinate their individual activity to shape the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>Now, Wang, Tukachinsky, Romano et al. have used mammalian cells grown in the laboratory and extracts from the eggs of the frog <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> to study these three proteins in more details. Unexpectedly, the experiments showed that ATL’s activity was not only required to form a tubular network but also to maintain it. When ATL was inactivated, the network disassembled into small spheres called vesicles. Increasing the amount of Rtn within the endoplasmic reticulum also caused it to disassemble, but increasing the amount of ATL could reverse this fragmentation. Thus, maintaining the tubular network requires a balance between the activities of the ATL and Rtn proteins, with ATL appearing to tether and fuse tubules that are stabilized by the Rtns.</p><p>Wang et al. also found that the tubular network of the endoplasmic reticulum can form without Lnp, but fewer tubules and junctions are formed. These findings suggest that Lnp might act to stabilize the junctions between tubules.</p><p>Further experiments showed that Lnp is modified by the addition of phosphate groups before the cell begins to divide. Wang et al. propose that this modification switches Lnp off and helps the endoplasmic reticulum to convert into sheets. Further work is now needed to investigate exactly how Rtn, ATL, and Lnp shape the endoplasmic reticulum. These future experiments will likely have to use simpler systems, in which the purified proteins are incorporated into artificial membranes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18605.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18605.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>organelle morphology</kwd><kwd>membrane structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Songyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Tukachinsky</surname><given-names>Hanna</given-names></name><name><surname>Romano</surname><given-names>Fabian B</given-names></name><name><surname>Rapoport</surname><given-names>Tom A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008601</institution-id><institution>Charles A.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a particularly intriguing organelle, as it consists of morphologically distinct domains that change during differentiation and cell cycle. In interphase, the ER consists of the nuclear envelope and a connected peripheral network of tubules and interspersed sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shibata et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">English and Voeltz, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goyal and Blackstone, 2013</xref>). The network is dynamic, with tubules continuously forming, retracting, and sliding along one another. During mitosis in metazoans, the nuclear envelope disassembles and peripheral ER tubules are transformed into sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). How the network is generated and maintained, and how its morphology changes during the cell cycle, is poorly understood.</p><p>Previous work has suggested that the tubules themselves are shaped by two evolutionarily conserved protein families, the reticulons (Rtns) and DP1/Yop1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Voeltz et al., 2006</xref>). These are abundant membrane proteins that are both necessary and sufficient to generate tubules. Members of these families are found in all eukaryotic cells. The Rtns and DP1/Yop1p seem to stabilize the high membrane curvature seen in cross-sections of tubules and sheet edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shibata et al., 2009</xref>). How these proteins generate and stabilize membrane curvature is uncertain, but they all contain pairs of closely spaced trans-membrane segments and have an amphipathic helix that is required to generate tubules with reconstituted proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brady et al., 2015</xref>). It has been proposed that the Rtns and DP1/Yop1p form wedges in the lipid bilayer and arc-shaped oligomers around the tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shibata et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Connecting tubules into a network requires membrane fusion, which is mediated by membrane-anchored GTPases, the atlastins (ATLs) in metazoans and Sey1p and related proteins in yeast and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Orso et al., 2009</xref>). These proteins contain a cytoplasmic GTPase domain, followed by a helical bundle, two closely spaced trans-membrane segments, and a cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Byrnes and Sondermann, 2011</xref>). Mammals have three isoforms of ATL, with ATL-1 being prominently expressed in neuronal cells. Mutations in ATL-1 can cause hereditary spastic paraplegia, a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the shortening of the axons in corticospinal motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Salinas et al., 2008</xref>). This leads to progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs.</p><p>A role for ATL in membrane fusion is supported by the fact that proteoliposomes containing purified <italic>Drosophila</italic> ATL undergo GTP-dependent fusion in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Orso et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the fusion of ER vesicles in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts is prevented by the addition of ATL antibodies or a cytosolic fragment of ATL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, ATL-depleted <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae have fragmented ER, and the depletion of ATL or expression of dominant-negative ATL mutants in tissue culture cells leads to long, unbranched tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Orso et al., 2009</xref>). Crystal structures and biochemical experiments have led to a model in which ATL molecules sitting in different membranes dimerize through their GTPase domains (trans-interaction), and undergo a conformational change during the GTPase cycle, thereby pulling the two membranes together and fusing them. Interestingly, ATL molecules sitting in the same membrane can also form GTPase-dependent dimers (cis-interaction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The fusion of membrane tubules generates three-way junctions, which are small, triangular sheets with negatively curved edge lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shemesh et al., 2014</xref>). How junctions are maintained is unknown, but it has been suggested that they are stabilized by the lunapark protein (Lnp), a conserved membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shemesh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Lnp contains two closely spaced transmembrane segments and a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Lnp localizes preferentially to three-way junctions, but there is disagreement as to whether it stabilizes newly formed three-way junctions (in mammalian cells), or functions in ring closure, i.e. the disappearance of junctions (in yeast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shemesh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, Sey1p and some isoforms of ATL also localize to three-way junctions and could therefore play a role in their stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">English and Voeltz, 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yan et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the exact role of Lnp is unknown.</p><p>Although the available evidence suggests that Rtns/DP1, ATLs, and Lnp are major proteins responsible for determining ER morphology, it is unknown how they cooperate. For example, it is unclear whether one of these components acts upstream of another, whether they are all equally important to generate an ER network, and whether they have distinct roles in tubule or junction formation. It is also unknown whether any of these proteins are involved in the characteristic tubule-to-sheet conversion during mitosis.</p><p>Mammalian tissue culture cells offer the opportunity to study ER morphology by removing or overexpressing ER-shaping membrane proteins. So far, however, essentially all experiments employed fixed tissue culture cells that transiently express proteins or RNAi constructs, which results in poor viability, heterogeneity among cells, and fixation artifacts. Consequently, ER morphology changes are difficult to interpret. ER morphology can also be studied with extracts from <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> eggs. Both crude extracts and isolated membranes can be used to form a tubular network in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dreier and Rapoport, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). With interphase extracts, the network consists exclusively of tubules connected by three-way junctions, whereas a tubule-to-sheet conversion and a loss of three-way junctions are observed with mitotic (meiotic) extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Because all known components involved in generating ER morphology are integral membrane proteins, their function can be tested with dominant-negative constructs, but not by depletion experiments.</p><p>Here, we have used live-cell imaging of stable mammalian tissue culture cells and <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts to address how the known ER shaping proteins cooperate to generate and maintain a tubular ER network. We demonstrate that ATL function is not only required to form an ER network but, surprisingly, is also needed to maintain it. The integrity of tubules is maintained by a balance of ATL and Rtn function. Lnp is not essential for network formation, but its inactivation or absence causes the loss of three-way junctions and tubules in favor of sheets. Our results suggest mechanisms by which a tubular ER network is formed and maintained, as well as changed during mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ATL is required to maintain tubules and junctions in mammalian cells</title><p>Previous experiments have shown that the transient expression of a dominant-negative ATL mutant in mammalian cells converts the ER network into long, unbranched tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rismanchi et al., 2008</xref>). However, these experiments were performed with fixed overexpressing cells, in which it is difficult to exclude artifacts. We therefore revisited the effect of ATL and its mutant forms, using stable cell lines and live-cell imaging.</p><p>We first used CRISPR technology to generate U2OS cells that express at endogenous levels GFP-calreticulin, an established luminal ER marker. Live-cell imaging by spinning-disk confocal microscopy revealed both a tubular network and interdispersed sheet-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; first column; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The GFP-calreticulin expressing cells were then infected with lentivirus constructs to generate stable cell lines that also express fluorescently-tagged ATL. The expression of wild type ATL isoforms had only a moderate effect on ER morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; second and third columns; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1—figure supplement1B,C</xref>). Fluorescently tagged wild type ATL-1 localized throughout tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; second column), whereas wild type ATL-3 and ATL-2 localized in punctae at three-way junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; third column; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, respectively). Dimerization-defective ATL-1 or ATL-3 mutants, carrying the R217Q or R213Q mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Byrnes and Sondermann, 2011</xref>), respectively, distributed throughout the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, fourth and fifth column). Thus, the punctate localization of ATL-3 to three-way junctions is due to its dimerization with endogenous ATL. The different localization patterns of ATL-1 and ATL-3 have been attributed to the fact that ATL-1 hydrolyzes GTP faster than ATL-3; faster GTP hydrolysis would lead to less concentration in junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yan et al., 2015</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18605.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ATL is required to maintain tubules and junctions in mammalian cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Peripheral ER network of U2OS cells expressing GFP-calreticulin from the endogenous promoter in wild type cells.

Expression of ATL-1 K80A caused the conversion of most of the ER into small vesicles, which rapidly moved around the cell, as shown by time-lapse imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; first column; the lowest row shows three different time points with different colors; see also <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). In many cells, long, unbranched tubules were also seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; second column; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). These membrane tubules were aligned with microtubules and seemed to be pulled out from a membrane reservoir near the nucleus after cell division (not shown). Indeed, treatment of the cells with the microtubule-disassembling drug nocodazole led to the disappearance of the long membrane tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Expression of a double mutant of ATL-1, which is both GTPase- and dimerization- defective (ATL-1 K80A R217Q) left the reticular ER intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; third column), demonstrating that the ATL-1 K80A mutant causes ER morphology changes by forming inactive dimers with endogenous ATL. In agreement with previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rismanchi et al., 2008</xref>), we find that ATL-1 R217Q causes ER morphology defects in cells that express high amounts of this protein, but this is not caused by interference with endogenous ATL, but rather by non-specific membrane crowding.

A cytoplasmic fragment of wild type ATL-1 (cytATL-1-mCherry) only generated long, unbranched tubules, even at high expression levels (fourth column), likely because it interacts with endogenous ATL only transiently during the GTPase cycle and is therefore a weaker inhibitor than cytATL-1 K80A. Consistent with this assumption, cytATL-1 K80A localized more prominently to the ER than wild type cytATL-1 (not shown), and non-dimerizing versions of cytATL-1 K80A or cytATL-1, which carry the R217Q mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Byrnes and Sondermann, 2011</xref>), did not affect the morphology of the ER (columns five and six).</p><p>With the exception of a report in which cytATL was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moss et al., 2011</xref>), ATL inhibition was thought to generate only long, unbranched tubules, rather than cause ER-vesiculation. This is probably due to the use of fixed cells, in which small vesicles are lost or difficult to image.

Occasionally, dynamic sheets were seen from which short tubules emerge and retract (not shown). These structures are possibly explained by residual ATL activity. They were much more abundant during early time points of network formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), or if network formation was slowed down by partial inhibition of ATL, for example, by adding a low concentration of GTP to a membrane-only reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), or by adding GDP and AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> to a reaction consisting of membranes and cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These intermediates in network formation are dynamic, small structures from which tubules continuously emanate and retract, although the disappearance of some tubules may simply be due to their bending or movement out of the focal plane (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Videos 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">5</xref>). These results indicate that during network formation, ATL first mediates the fusion of small vesicles into small, dynamic structures, which subsequently give rise to longer tubules. Inactivation of ATL disassembles the tubules into small membrane structures. Our experiments also indicate that, at endogenous levels, the reticulons and DP1 are insufficient to maintain the integrity of tubules in the absence of ATL function.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18605.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Intermediates during in vitro ER network formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DiIC<sub>18</sub>-prelabeled light membranes were mixed with buffer and an energy regenerating system.

Lnp consists of an N-terminal myristoylated glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moriya et al., 2013</xref>), a coiled-coil domain (CC1), two closely spaced trans-membrane segments (TM1 and TM2), another coiled-coil domain (CC2), a predicted unstructured segment, a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger domain implicated Lnp dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casey et al., 2015</xref>), and a C-terminal unstructured segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). A Lnp mutant, in which the N-terminal myristoylation site was abolished (G2A mutation), failed to localize to junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Likewise, when a short, unrelated linker sequence was inserted after CC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) or before CC2 (not shown), Lnp no longer concentrated in punctae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), suggesting that the two coiled-coil domains need to be in register. Finally, truncation of Lnp before the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger domain also abolished Lnp localization to three-way junctions, whereas a truncation at a more C-terminal site had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). In all cases, localization of Lnp to three-way junctions correlated with the conversion of peripheral sheets into a tubular network, indicating that Lnp exerts its effect on ER morphology at junctions. At high levels, all Lnp mutants generated sheets and aberrant structures (not shown). Taken together, these results show that localization to three-way junctions requires several Lnp features, including the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger implicated in dimerization. Indeed, pull-down experiments with extracts of mammalian cells expressing different Lnp constructs show that the region containing the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger is required for Lnp-Lnp interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18605.023</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Lnp domains important for junction localization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of wild type (WT) Lnp and mutants tested for proper localization in the peripheral ER.

The ER network was restored, and the ATL proteins localized as in wild type cells.

Taken together, these results indicate that ATL affects the localization of Lnp, although the bulk of ATL and Lnp do not seem to interact physically. In agreement with this conclusion, no interaction was seen in pull-down experiments (not shown). Our experiments also suggest that ATL functions upstream of Lnp, a conclusion that is supported by the observation that Lnp overexpression did not significantly affect the localization of the ATLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), and did not reverse ER fragmentation in cells expressing dominant-negative ATL mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18605.025</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Interplay of ATL, Lnp, and Rtn.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Peripheral ER in U2OS cells stably expressing Lnp-mCherry alone or together with GFP-ATL-3 or GFP-ATL-1.

Indeed, when purified cytLnp was added to a crude extract at the beginning of a network formation reaction, small sheets appeared over time, which replaced three-way tubular junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B;</xref> the reduction of three-way junctions is quantitated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). In addition, the tubules of the network became shorter.

In these cases, the junctions were converted into bright membrane structures, which look different from those observed in crude extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). Whether these structures are sheets therefore remains uncertain. Three-way junctions were also abolished when cytLnp was added after network formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

A C-terminal fragment of cytLnp (cytLnp-C) had the same effect on the integrity of three-way junctions as cytLnp, whereas two different N-terminal fragments (cytLnp-N1 and –N2) were inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11F</xref>). Pull-down experiments confirmed that cytLnp and cytLnp-C, but not cytLnp-N1 or –N2, interact with endogenous Lnp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).

Immunoblotting showed that endogenous Lnp increases in size and decreases in abundance in cells arrested in mitosis with the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref>). Like other proteins regulated during the cell cycle in mammalian cells, Lnp seems to be degraded following phosphorylation. Overexpressed Lnp-mCherry also underwent a size shift during mitosis and slightly increased in abundance when its degradation was prevented by addition of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12F</xref>). A Lnp-mCherry mutant in which phosphorylation sites were mutated to Ala did not undergo a size shift in mitosis nor a change in abundance with bortezomib treatment.

These results suggest that mitotic phosphorylation reduces the interaction of Lnp molecules, which in turn leads to the destabilization of three-way junctions and tubules. Consistent with this model, a phosphomimetic mutant of full-length Lnp did not localize to three-way junctions when expressed at low levels in CRISPR knock-out cells, in contrast to a mutant in which the same residues were changed to Ala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Thus, mitotic phosphorylation may cause the disappearance of Lnp from three-way junctions; the junctions are then converted into larger sheets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results provide insight into how the ER-shaping proteins ATL, Rtn, and Lnp cooperate to generate and maintain a tubular ER network. We show that ATL is not only required to form a network, but also has a hitherto unrecognized role in maintaining it. When ATL is inhibited, three-way tubular junctions disappear and much of the network disassembles into small membrane structures, indicating that physiological concentrations of the curvature-stabilizing proteins Rtn and DP1 are insufficient to maintain the integrity of tubules in the absence of ATL function. Overexpression of Rtn4a leads to long, unbranched tubules and fragmented ER. Both phenotypes are restored when ATL is co-overexpressed. Taken together, our data indicate that a balance between ATL and Rtn function is required. Lnp is not essential for network formation or maintenance; its inactivation or deletion only reduces the abundance of three-way junctions and tubules in favor of larger sheets. Lnp is phosphorylated during mitosis, which weakens its oligomerization and may contribute to the characteristic tubule-to-sheet conversion of the ER during mitosis.</p><p>Previous experiments have established that ATL mediates the fusion of ER membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Orso et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bian et al., 2011</xref>). A GTP-hydrolysis- dependent conformational change in ATL trans-dimers pulls the apposing membranes together so that they can fuse. ATL-mediated fusion requires multiple ATL molecules in each membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), and multiple cycles of GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Saini et al., 2014</xref>). It is therefore likely that ATL molecules are concentrated at the site of fusion between two ER tubules. Cis-dimerization in the same membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2015</xref>) and nucleotide-independent interactions through the TM segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) may also increase ATL localization at these sites before and after fusion. Eventually, however, ATL would diffuse away from three way junctions and distribute throughout the tubules. This model may explain why mammalian ATL-2 and ATL-3, as well as <italic>Xenopus</italic> ATL, preferentially localize to three-way junctions. Mammalian ATL-1 is only marginally concentrated, perhaps because fewer molecules are required for a successful fusion event or because it diffuses away more rapidly from the fused junction.</p><p>ATL-mediated fusion of tubules is clearly required to form and maintain an ER network. When ATL function is moderately inhibited, long, unbranched tubules are formed, likely because these cannot be linked into a network. When ATL is more strongly inhibited, even tubules are disrupted. A possible explanation for the essential role of ATL in maintaining the integrity of tubules is based on the observation that free ends of tubules are rarely seen in mammalian cells or in networks generated in vitro with <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts; essentially all tubule ends are anchored either in three-way junctions or are associated with molecular motors or microtubule tips. We therefore propose that tubules are unstable when they have free ends. Free ends have a high membrane curvature at the tip, and the elastic energy would be reduced if they retracted in favor of other tubules that are anchored, or if they shed small vesicles. Shedding of vesicles from a free tubule end would be favored by Rtn, which itself imposes high curvature on the membrane. At physiological concentrations, Rtn would stabilize the high membrane curvature of tubules in cross-section, but it may prefer to sit in a vesicle of the same radius, particularly if it formed a hydrophobic insertion, rather than a scaffold around the bilayer. ATL would be essential for tubule integrity, as it would counteract the vesicle shedding at the tips of tubules by capturing shedding vesicles via its tethering function and then fusing them back onto the tubule. This model is consistent with our observations of early intermediates during network formation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts. Initially, vesicles seem to fuse into dynamic small membrane structures that continuously emanate and retract short tubules. These tubules have free ends and are unstable, and their dynamic nature may correspond to a situation in which their shortening is reversed by their ATL-mediated fusion with small vesicles. Our interpretation implies that the shedding and fusion of vesicles at tubule ends occur at comparable rates, whereas the breakage of tubules or three-way junctions may be kinetically disfavored. Indeed, live-cell imaging of the ER in mammalian cells or <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts shows that tubules rarely undergo fission in the middle of the tubule. Instead, retraction of tubules is a frequent event and might involve the shedding of vesicles at tubule tips.</p><p>In addition to ensuring the integrity of the free ends of tubules, ATL might stabilize the ER network at three way junctions. Because ATL needs multiple cycles of trans-dimerization to achieve fusion, it may tether tubules together at three way junctions that have not yet fused. ATL inactivation would cause the disassembly of a preformed ER network by the untethering of these tubules, leading to the appearance of free, unstable tubule ends. It is unclear whether this model can explain the disassembly of the entire network in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system, as it would imply that a high percentage of three-way junctions is actually only tethered, rather than fused. It is also possible that ATL is required to maintain the integrity of fused three-way junctions, for example, by stabilizing the negatively curved edge line bordering the triangular junctional sheet. We also found that a significantly stronger inhibition of ATL is required to disassemble a preformed network than to prevent its <italic>de nov</italic>o formation. Perhaps, trans-dimerization and fusion are more sensitive to ATL inhibition than ATL concentration at three-way junctions. It has been proposed that the yeast ortholog of ATL, Sey1p, is merely a tethering molecule akin to Rab GTPases, and that the actual fusion is mediated by ER SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). However, mutations in Sey1p and ER SNAREs have synthetic effects in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anwar et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that they function in parallel pathways. Our present results, and those demonstrating that ATL and Sey1p mediate fusion on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Orso et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anwar et al., 2012</xref>), argue that tethering and fusion are just different stages of a reaction carried out by the same protein.</p><p>The proposed balance between ATL and Rtn function may explain our overexpression results. The overexpression of Rtn generates very narrow tubules, from which the luminal protein calreticulin is displaced. Assuming that ATL is also displaced, the appearance of long, unbranched tubules may simply be explained by their inability to form new three-way junctions or to fuse vesicles to the end of tubules. In addition, Rtn overexpression could lead to its oligomerization, which could contribute to the formation and stabilization of long tubules. Rtn4a overexpression also generates membrane fragments, which appear to be larger than those observed upon ATL inactivation. Perhaps, these fragments originate from the breakage of the narrow tubules. Co-overexpression of ATL with Rtn would rescue both phenotypes, unbranched tubules and fragmentation, as it allows ATL to localize into the tubules to restore three-way junction formation and to fuse membrane fragments together. Our studies were restricted to Rtn4a, and it remains to be seen whether other Rtn isoforms and DP1 behave in a similar manner.</p><p>Our results also provide some insight into the function of Lnp. This protein is clearly not essential for the generation or maintenance of an ER network. In mammalian cells, some reticular network is retained in its absence, and even in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts, where Lnp inactivation converts most three-way junctions into larger sheets, there is still a network. Many of these sheets are bordered by negatively curved edge lines, suggesting that Lnp is not a major stabilizer of such edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shemesh et al., 2014</xref>). Based on the observation that Lnp forms sheet-like structures when overexpressed in mammalian cells, it seems possible that Lnp localizes to the sheets of tubular junctions. This is consistent with the fact that ATL-3 sits at the edges of expanded junctional sheets in Lnp-overexpressing cells. Because ATL is absolutely required to generate tubular junctions, one may assume that ATL first forms a native junction and sits at its edges, and then Lnp moves to the interior sheet. Perhaps, a Lnp scaffold prevents the reticulons and DP1 from moving into the three-way junction and thus counteracts junction expansion; when Lnp is absent or inactivated, the three-way junction area could increase into a larger sheet. Alternatively, Lnp may somehow promote the curvature-stabilizing function of the reticulons and DP1, thus helping in tubule formation.</p><p>The localization of Lnp to three-way junctions requires its oligomerization. One domain that is needed for its localization and mediates dimerization is the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger (our results and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casey et al., 2015</xref>]). However, the coiled-coil domains are probably also important. These regions immediately flank the TMs in all species and our experiments suggest that their correct registry is required for Lnp’s localization to three-way junctions. The N-terminal myristic acid is also important, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moriya et al., 2013</xref>), perhaps because it anchors the N-terminus in the membrane. How exactly the different features of Lnp cooperate to localize Lnp to three-way junctions remains to be clarified.</p><p>Our results confirm that the ER in mammalian cells and <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts undergoes a tubule-to-sheet transition during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). The ER in mitotic Xenopus extracts looks strikingly similar to that generated by Lnp inactivation, and the absence of Lnp in mammalian cells also causes a tubule-to-sheet conversion. These results suggest that Lnp inactivation may be responsible for, or at least contribute to, the ER morphology changes during mitosis. Consistent with this idea, Lnp is mitotically phosphorylated in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts and mammalian tissue culture cells. In mammalian cells, Lnp is also degraded, as seen with other mitotically phosphorylated proteins. Phosphorylation of Lnp interferes with its oligomerization, and phosphomimetic Lnp mutants no longer localizes to three-way junctions and have a lower propensity to form oligomers. The effect on oligomerization can be explained by the fact that most phosphorylation sites are located in a region between the second coiled-coil and Zn<sup>2+</sup> finger domains, both of which may be involved in Lnp-Lnp interactions. Taken together, these results suggest that mitotic phosphorylation reduces Lnp’s oligomerization, which in turn results in its departure from three-way junctions. The absorption of membrane lipids into the junctions would result in their expansion into larger sheets. It is possible that other factors, such as the disruption of the ER – cytoskeleton interaction, or the release of translating ribosomes from the ER, contribute to the transition from tubules to sheets during mitosis. Sheet formation during mitosis might be required to accommodate membrane proteins that prefer low membrane curvature areas and sit during interphase in the relatively flat nuclear envelope.</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest a simple model for the generation and maintenance of a tubular ER network. ATL is required to both form and maintain a network. It mediates the fusion of tubules by forming GTP hydrolysis-dependent trans-dimers and transiently sits in the newly formed three-way junctions. Lnp subsequently moves into the junctional sheets, a process that may require its oligomerization. The reticulons stabilize high membrane curvature in tubules and may cause vesicle shedding at free tubule ends, a process counteracted by ATL through its tethering and fusion activity. During mitosis, Lnp is phosphorylated, causing it to dissociate into monomers and leave the three-way junctions. This would result in the expansion of three-way junctions into larger sheets. Experiments with reconstituted, purified ER shaping proteins are required to test this simple model and to understand the exact molecular mechanism of network formation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Maltose-binding protein-cyclin B∆90 (MBP-cyclin B∆90) lacking the N-terminal destruction box of cyclin B was a gift from Dr Randy King (Harvard Medical School, MA).

Briefly, lentivirus was packaged in 293T cells using Trans-IT (Mirus) to co-transfect packaging and lentiviral vectors. Six to twelve hours post-transfection, medium was refreshed, and virus-containing supernatants were collected for 24 hr, spun down, and added to U2OS cells at a 1:5 dilution. No blasticidin selection was used, in order to obtain populations with varying levels of gene expression. For fluorescent-protein-tagged viral constructs, cells were sometimes sorted by flow cytometry to obtain cells with certain levels of expression. For GFP insertions into the genomic <italic>CALR</italic> locus, cells were transfected with guide RNA encoding plasmid, donor DNA, and wild-type Cas9. GFP positive cells were selected several days post-transfection using flow cytometry. For <italic>LNP</italic> deletion, isolated clones were first screened by immunoblotting for absence of Lnp protein and then verified by PCR and sequencing of genomic DNA around the start codon.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Antibodies and reagents used for experiments with mammalian cells</title><p>Primary antibodies used for mammalian cell experiments were: anti-calreticulin from rabbit (Abcam), anti-reticulon 4 from goat (Santa Cruz), anti-Lnp from rabbit (Sigma), HA (Roche), mCherry (polyclonal made in rabbits). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were Alexa-conjugated donkey-antibodies directed against mouse, rabbit, or goat immunoglobulin (Invitrogen). Secondary antibodies for immunoblotting were HRP conjugated anti-goat (Thermo Fisher), aanti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulin (GE Healthcare). Anti-HA affinity matrix (Sigma) was used for pull-down experiments. Nocodazole was purchased from Sigma.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Imaging mammalian cells</title><p>Live imaging of mammalian cells was performed inside an Okolab stage top incubator warmed to 37°C. Cells were grown in #1.5 glass bottom Mat-Tek dishes and switched to phenol red- free Opti-MEM just prior to imaging.</p><p>For immunostaining of fixed cells, U2OS were grown on acid-washed glass coverslips and fixed using 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 min, then washed and quenched with 1 mg/mL sodium borohydride in PBS for 5 min. Cells were permeabilized by incubation in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Primary and secondary antibodies were incubated with coverslips for 45 min each in blocking solution (1% low IgG-containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) in PBS). Coverslips were mounted with mounting medium (Vectashield) on slides.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Fluorescence microscopy</title><p>All samples were visualized using a spinning disk confocal head (CSU-X1; Yokogawa Corporation of America) with Borealis modification (Spectral Applied Research) and a quad bandpass 405/491/561/642 dichroic mirror (Semrock). The confocal was mounted on a Ti inverted microscope (Nikon) equipped with a 60× Plan Apo NA 1.4 oil immersion objective or a 100x Plan Apo 100x NA 1.4 oil immersion objective and the Perfect Focus System for continuous maintenance of focus (Nikon). Green fluorescence images were collected using a 491-nm solid-state laser controlled with an AOTF (Spectral Applied Research) and ET525/50 emission filter (Chroma Technology Corp.). Red fluorescence images were collected using a 561-nm solid-state laser controlled with an AOTF (Spectral Applied Research) and ET620/60 emission filter (Chroma Technology Corp.). All images were acquired with a cooled CCD camera (ORCA AG; Hamamatsu Photonics) controlled with MetaMorph software (version 7.0; Molecular Devices) and archived using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) and Photoshop CS5 (Adobe). In some cases, linear adjustments were applied to enhance the contrast of images using levels in the image adjustment function of ImageJ and Photoshop.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Quantification of the number of three-way junctions</title><p>Three-way junctions in interphase ER networks were quantified automatically using a custom ImageJ script described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shemesh et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman as the Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and another is Craig Blackstone (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers of your paper agree that the article represents an important progress in understanding generation and maintenance of ER morphology by three crucial proteins, Rtn, ATL and Lunapark. It reveals new features of the system such as ER fragmentation upon expression of dominant negative ATLs or overexpression of Rtn4a, tethering role for atlastins in addition to their ability to fuse membranes, the idea that ER structure is in a steady rather than an equilibrium state, which is maintained by a balance between membrane fusion mediated by atlastin and membrane fission.</p><p>At the same time, it is the reviewers' opinion that the article will benefit from taking into account the following comments and suggestions.</p><p>1) While this paper clearly has substantial data already, additional super-resolution or EM data would make the story even stronger.

First, the migration shift in panels A and B could be due to modifications other than phosphorylation (e.g., Sumo, Ubiquitin, etc.), and in fact protein bands look quite crisp for what might be a range of phosphorylation states. Second, just because different sites are identified by mass spectrometry doesn't mean all are simultaneously present in the same lunapark protein (raising questions about the relevance of the phosphomimetic construct used). Third, what does the mitotic western look like in the nocodazole treatment arm in panel C? Overall, the reviewers suggest to leave out the entire figure.

These structures were seen with mitotic cytosol or when a dominant-negative cytoplasmic Lnp fragment was added. We assumed that they were sheets because the equivalent conditions with a crude extract resulted in sheets with a normal appearance. However, we admit that the bright areas seen with the fractionated system look different, and we have therefore added a sentence to the subsection 'Lnp is required to form three-way tubular ER junctions in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts' to concede that they may not be sheets.</p><p>We have tried EM with <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts, but the images are of poor quality because of non-specific binding of proteins and membranes. The only super-resolution light microscopy techniques that would have enough resolution to distinguish a dense tubular network from sheets would be PALM/STORM. We tried STORM, but encountered problems with the fixation of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> extract and with the sensitivity of the ER network to thiols that are needed to induce fluorophore blinking. We also tried 3D-SIM microscopy, but the current technique does not have enough resolution.</p><p><italic>2) The most preliminary part of the study is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> and the reviewers have a number of comments/concerns related to these data. First, the migration shift in panels A and B could be due to modifications other than phosphorylation (e.g., Sumo, Ubiquitin, etc.), and in fact protein bands look quite crisp for what might be a range of phosphorylation states.

The authors could consider a much more detailed investigation of the role of mitotic phosphorylation incorporating studies of other proteins involved in ER network formation such as atlastin.</italic> </p><p>We now provide additional results that support the conclusion that Lnp is mitotically phosphorylated. We therefore prefer to keep <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> in the paper.</p><p>We now show that the removal of phosphorylation sites (mutation of Ser and Thr to Ala) prevents the size shift of overexpressed Lnp during mitosis in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12F</xref>). Thus, the size shift is likely due to mitotic phosphorylation.</p><p>We also provide additional evidence for mitotic phosphorylation in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>). We show that all modifications of Lnp are lost during a pull-down experiment, but that the less shifted band can be maintained in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. Both modified Lnp species can be preserved in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), so it is possible that the upper band corresponds to an additional modification, as the reviewers suggested. In the mammalian system, Lnp is degraded during mitosis and thus likely ubiquitinated after phosphorylation. We have changed the text in the third paragraph of the subsection “Mitotic phosphorylation of Lnp” to discuss these results.</p><p>We now mention that it is unclear whether all phosphorylation sites are equally modified in a given Lnp molecule (subsection “Mitotic phosphorylation of Lnp”).</p><p>There is a misunderstanding about the nocodazole experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref> (formerly 12C), caused by inaccurate labeling of the figure: nocodazole was used to arrest cells in mitosis (rather than added to interphase cells). We apologize for the mistake.</p><p>We also added data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12F</xref>) that show that the abundance of overexpressed Lnp in mitotically arrested cells increases upon addition of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. No change in abundance is seen with a Lnp mutant in which phosphorylation sites are mutated to alanine. These data support the idea that Lnp is first phosphorylated during mitosis and then degraded by the proteasome, at least in mitotically arrested cells.</p><p><italic>3) The reviewers find the manuscript would benefit from more discussion.</italic> </p><p><italic>A) Given the suggested tethering function of atlastin, the authors might consider discussion of the published role of SNAREs in ER tubule fusion as has been shown in yeast (JCB 2015 paper by Y. Jun's lab). Maybe alone the atlastins are weak membrane fusogens and predominantly tether?</italic> </p><p>We now mention this paper in the Discussion (fourth paragraph). However, we do not agree with the conclusions drawn by Y. Jun’s lab, who claim that Sey1p and ER SNAREs function in the same pathway. The best argument against their model is that mutations in SEY1 and ER SNAREs have synthetic effects, indicating that they function in parallel pathways. There is no question that Sey1 and Atl can mediate fusion on their own.</p><p><italic>B) The difference with earlier work should be a little more emphasized. The authors suggest fragmentation was not observed before because fixed cells were used but this is not true in all cases. Also, studies of ER structure in live yeast lacking Sey1 or overexpressing reticulons did not report ER fragmentation. Was fragmentation just missed or what might be the explanation?</italic> </p><p>We do believe that fixation is the main reason for why ER fragmentation was missed previously. “ER discontinuity” (ER fragmentation) has been observed by Orso et al. in <italic>Drosophila</italic> treated with ATL RNAi constructs, and by Moss et al. (2011), who saw “punctate ER” in fixed cells when cytATL was overexpressed. We are not aware of earlier papers in which ATL function was blocked and live-cell imaging was performed.</p><p>The situation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> may be different from that in mammalian cells. Fragmentation of the ER may not occur because ER SNAREs provide an alternative pathway of ER fusion in this organism. It is also possible that some ER fragmentation goes unnoticed because of the small cell size and difficulties in imaging.</p><p>We have changed the wording of the last paragraph of the subsection “ATL is required to maintain tubules and junctions in mammalian cells” and now cite the Moss et al. paper (the Orso et al. paper was cited before).</p><p><italic>C) The manuscript predicts that free ER tubule ends shed vesicles. Is there some way to test this in cells? For example, if ATL is rapidly depleted or inhibited in cells, one would expect to see a significant increase in free ER tubule ends and vesiculation before ER structure is completely disrupted.</italic> </p><p>It is impossible to test the shedding of vesicles in cells, if only because there is no way to rapidly deplete or inhibit ATL. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts, we observed that the inhibition of ATL by cytATL or GTPγS leads to short wiggling tubules and vesicles, but even in this system, it is difficult to demonstrate that the tubules disassemble by shedding vesicles. Our hypothesis is thus mostly based on the fact that free tubule ends are rarely seen in mammalian cells or <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts.</p><p><italic>D) Finally, the authors may consider relation of the results of the present paper to a model they suggested previously (Shemesh et al. PNAS 2014). According to the &quot;phase diagram&quot; of Shemesh et al. paper, reduction of the mole fraction of Lnp (denoted there as S/(S+R)), upon a relatively large total amount of the curvature-generating proteins (S+R), drives transition of 3-way junctions to sheets.</italic> </p><p><italic>Taking this model prediction into account, the scenario of Lnp action might be as follows:</italic> </p><p><italic>ATL generates 3-way junctions through tubule fusion and remains for a while at place in high local concentration, which may exclude from the junction Rtn and Lnp.</italic> </p><p><italic>ATL gets inactivated, which is accompanied by its replacement within the junctions by Lnp generating edges with a highly negative edge-line curvature. This would change the micro-structure of the 3-way junction transforming the latter from a shape of constant positive to the shape of a little sheet with flat middle part and the negatively curved edge.</italic> </p><p><italic>Removal of Lnp by some means, would result in its replacement in the junctions by Rtn, which generates edges with less negative (or vanishing, or positive) edge-line curvature. This would, according to Shemesh's model, drive transformation of 3-way junctions into sheets.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting this interesting model. However, the model would require that Lnp be relatively abundant (which it is not) and that we ignore the overexpression results, which show that Lnp forms sheet-like structures. We therefore feel that our results are not really consistent with the proposed idea. At this point, all models of Lnp function remain rather speculative.</p></body></sub-article></article>
