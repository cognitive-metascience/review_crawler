Collagen content and fiber organization within the tumor stroma are major contributors to biomechanical changes (e., tumor stiffness) and correlated with tumor aggressiveness and outcome. What signals and in what cells control collagen organization within the tumors, and how, is not fully understood. We show in mouse breast tumors that the action of the collagen receptor DDR2 in CAFs controls tumor stiffness by reorganizing collagen fibers specifically at the tumor-stromal boundary. These changes were associated with lung metastases. The action of DDR2 in mouse and human CAFs, and tumors in vivo, was found to influence mechanotransduction by controlling full collagen-binding integrin activation via Rap1-mediated Talin1 and Kindlin2 recruitment. The action of DDR2 in tumor CAFs is thus critical for remodeling collagen fibers at the tumor-stromal boundary to generate a physically permissive tumor microenvironment for tumor cell invasion and metastases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>collagen</kwd><kwd>DDR2</kwd><kwd>Integrins</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA196205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Longmore</surname><given-names>Gregory D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA223758</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Longmore</surname><given-names>Gregory D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54 CA210173</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Longmore</surname><given-names>Gregory D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>131342-PF-17-238-01-CSM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>Priscilla Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30 CA200386</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bayer</surname><given-names>Samantha VH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM07200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bayer</surname><given-names>Samantha VH</given-names></name><name><surname>Grither</surname><given-names>Whitney R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 CA113275</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barcus</surname><given-names>Craig E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The action of the collagen receptor DDR2 in CAFs regulates Rap1-Talin1 mediated Integrin mechanotransduction in breast tumors to impact tumor stiffness and metastases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In addition to inherited and acquired mutations in tumor cells, cancer development, progression, invasion, metastases, and responses to therapy require a permissive tumor microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment consists of activated cells, (e.g., immune, cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells) deposited growth factors and cytokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) and these all differ in number, composition and function from the tissue environment surrounding normal epithelia. For example, biophysical changes resulting from increased matrix deposition and remodeling result in mechanical perturbations, such as increased tissue stiffness. Increased tumor stromal stiffness can influence cell differentiation (transformation), cell proliferation, cell invasion and migration, and biochemical signaling by embedded growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paszek et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Provenzano et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schedin and Keely, 2011</xref>). Increased and altered collagen fiber production as well as ECM collagen fiber remodeling, in particular, are major contributors to the altered stiffness of tumors, especially in pancreatic and breast tumors.</p><p>In breast tumors, stromal collagen fiber characteristics differ significantly from their normal tissue counterparts in amount, composition, architecture, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonnans et al., 2014</xref>). As a result, aggressive breast tumors are stiffer than corresponding normal tissues and this feature can be used to detect, stage, and prognosticate, as well as limit treatment efficacy. Collagen fibers are the most abundant protein in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of breast tumors and women with dense breasts, due in part to increased collagen deposition, have an increased risk for developing breast cancer and when they do their cancers are more aggressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aiello, 2005</xref>). Collagen fiber alignment or orientation at the tumor-stromal boundary, collagen fiber thickness, length, and architecture all affect the mechanical properties, or stiffness, of primary breast tumors and directly impact tumor invasion and metastatic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conklin et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, a clinical tumor associated collagen signature (TACS) has been developed and correlates to aggressiveness of breast tumors. Collagen fibers that are short, curly, and thin are correlated with benign or less aggressive tumors while thicker fibers that align perpendicular to the tumor-stromal interface are indicative of aggressive tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Provenzano et al., 2006</xref>). Despite its clinical importance how tumor associated collagen fiber organization is generated is not fully appreciated.</p><p>Accumulated data indicates that control of ECM matrix in tumors is likely multifactorial, but the major effector cell within the tumor microenvironment most responsible for ECM matrix production and arguably remodeling is the cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhowmick et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to producing ECM components, CAFs remodel the tumor stroma through: (1) secretion of ECM remodeling enzymes such as collagen cross-linking enzymes (e.g., lysyl-oxidases) and proteases (e.g., MMPs and collagenases) and (2) force mediated matrix remodeling. Other cell types within the tumor stroma such as immune cells and tumor cells can also impact ECM remodeling either directly (e.g., secretion of MMPs, LOX, or collagenases) or indirectly (e.g, secretion of growth factors and cytokines that activate CAFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acerbi et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, understanding CAF cell-intrinsic regulation of ECM production and collagen fiber remodeling during cancer progression and metastasis is an important consideration not only for multiple cancers, but also other fibrotic diseases, and treatment strategies for both.</p><p>In this regard, genetically engineered mouse tumor models (GEMM) and syngeneic orthotopic transplant models have been informative. In both these models the action of a cell surface fibrillar collagen receptor DDR2 in tumor cells and tumor stromal cells has been shown to regulate breast cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corsa et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gonzalez et al., 2017</xref>). But, in which cells within the tumor environment the action of DDR2 is important and how is not known. Normal breast epithelium does not express DDR2, however, in invasive human breast tumor cells DDR2 expression is induced in 50–70% of cases and is significantly correlated with poor outcomes, particularly in aggressive TNBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Toy et al., 2015</xref>). DDR2 is also an unusual receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitinger, 2014</xref>). In contrast to other RTKs its ligand is a structural protein (fibrillar collagen) rather than a growth factor or cytokine, and its activation and inactivation kinetics are slow for reasons not understood. Despite its ligand, DDR2 is unlikely to be a significant adhesive receptor alone, but it has been suggested that its action may affect collagen binding Integrin affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). The molecular mechanism(s) and functional significance of this observation has not been determined.</p><p>The other major collagen receptor in tumor cells and tumor stromal cells are the collagen binding Integrins. Genetic and pharmacologic studies have shown that Integrins are also critical for cancer development and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianconi et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamidi and Ivaska, 2018</xref>). In GEMMs deletion of <italic>Ddr2</italic> appears to have a greater impact on breast cancer metastasis than does either α1 or α2 Integrin deletion (two α chains of collagen binding integrins), while β1 Integrin plays a critical role in tumor initiation and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lahlou and Muller, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ramirez et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">White et al., 2004</xref>). Integrin and DDR2 have distinct, non-overlapping binding sites within fibrillar collagens and DDR2 can be activated by collagen in the absence of integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vogel et al., 1997</xref>). In contrast to DDR2, integrins are bona fide adhesion molecules as well as signaling receptors. A major function of integrins is in environmental mechanosensing and mechanotransducing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2016</xref>), and thus, are sensitive and responsive to changes in the mechanical properties of the cellular environment.</p><p>Here we show that genetic deletion of the <italic>Ddr2</italic> gene in breast tumor CAFs, without altering DDR2 expression in tumor cells, impacts their mechanotransduction properties. It does so by activating Rap1 with subsequent activation and, or recruitment of Talin1 and Kindlin2 to cell surface β1 Integrin. As a result, DDR2 is selectively required for full activation of collagen binding Integrins in CAFs, as fibronectin activated Integrins are normal. In vivo, breast tumors in which <italic>Ddr2</italic> is deleted in CAFs are less stiff, have an altered collagen fiber organization particularly at the tumor-stromal boundary, and decreased β1 Integrin activity. These changes are associated with decreased lung metastasis. These data indicate that the action of DDR2 is an important regulator of mechanotransduction in breast tumor CAFs, critical for full activation of collagen-binding Integrins and the formation of a metastasis permissive biophysical tumor environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The action of DDR2 within stromal cells of the primary tumor site, as opposed to a metastatic site, impact breast cancer lung metastases</title><p>DDR2 expression in stromal cells of primary breast tumors as well as in stromal cells of lung metastases is increased, and reciprocal orthotopic syngeneic breast tumor transplant experiments have revealed that the action of DDR2 within stromal cells of the recipient host regulate breast cancer lung metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corsa et al., 2016</xref>). The anatomic site of action (primary tumor or metastatic site or both), the particular stromal cell type(s) responsible, and the cellular molecular mechanisms involved are not known, however. To determine whether the action of DDR2 in metastatic sites was critical, we determined the extent of lung colonization by wild type primary MMTV-PyMT breast tumor cells following tail vein injection of into syngeneic <italic>Ddr2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> or ubiquitous <italic>Ddr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hosts.

Therefore, we asked whether the mechanotransducing effects of DDR2 in CAFs could involve regulation of Integrin activity. All collagen binding Integrins contain variable α chains and a common β1 chain. Human CAFs were plated on collagen I, fixed and stained with the 9EG7 antibody that detects active β1 Integrin in both human and mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzoni et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Su et al., 2016</xref>) or Talin1 and then super-resolution confocal microscopy was performed. The amount of active β1-Integrin and Talin1 at adhesion sites in cellular protrusions was quantified from images. In <italic>Ddr2</italic> depleted hCAFs significantly less active β1 Integrin and Talin1 was present in cell protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>).

Like Talin1, Kindlin2 is another cytoplasmic protein recruited to Integrin adhesive sites and important for full Integrin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calderwood et al., 2013</xref>). Kindlin2 - active β1 Integrin and Talin1-Kindlin2 co-localization in cell protrusion were both significantly decreased in <italic>Ddr2</italic> depleted hCAFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Defects in Talin1 and Kindlin2 recruitment to cell surface Integrin complexes in cell protrusions of <italic>Ddr2</italic> depleted hCAFs suggested the possibility that DDR2 might affect ‘inside-out’ regulation of Integrin activation. A significant regulator of Talin1 activation and recruitment to cell surface Integrins is the cytosolic GTP-binding protein RAP1. When WT control hCAFs were exposed to collagen I, RAP1 was activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In <italic>Ddr2</italic> depleted hCAFs there was less total RAP1 present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and when corrected for the differing amounts of RAP1 protein there was significantly less activation of RAP1 in <italic>Ddr2</italic> depleted hCAFs after plating on collagen I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

FSP1cre mediated deletion of <italic>Ddr2</italic> in MMTV-PyMT breast tumors resulted in tumors with reduced stiffness, particularly at the tumor-stromal boundary, and significantly altered collagen fiber organization again particularly at the tumor-stromal boundary. These changes were associated with a significant decrease in lung metastases. Isolated CAFs from these mouse tumors lack expression of DDR2, as well as human breast tumor CAFs depleted of <italic>Ddr2</italic> exhibit decreased mechanotransduction properties. Their cell spreading on collagen I was decreased and formed smaller FAs without any change in the number of FAs, exhibited decreased collagen I gel contraction in 3D, generated reduced traction forces on collagen I coated hydrogels, and produced an altered collagen matrix. All these phenotypes could be reversed by re-expression of WT DDR2. DDR2 was found to be important for the full activation of collagen binding β1-containing Integrins in CAFs in culture and in CAFs and tumor cells within primary breast tumors in vivo. DDR2 influenced collagen binding β1 Integrin activity by regulating RAP1 mediated Talin1 and Kindlin2 activation and, or recruitment to Integrin complexes at surface adhesion sites. In vivo, breast tumors deleted of <italic>Ddr2</italic> in CAFs or ubiquitously in all cells within tumors exhibit decreased β1 Integrin activation in CAFs, and tumor cells (and CAFs), respectively.</p><p>In addition to regulating Integrin-based mechanotransduction, the action of DDR in CAFs also affects mRNA expression of collagen genes as well as collagen modifying enzymes such as lysyl oxidases and MMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corsa et al., 2016</xref>) that can also contribute to altered matrix collagen fibers, tumor fibrosis and associated with enhanced metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, FIB-SEM analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I and J</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) revealed that within 2–5 microns of the tumor-stromal interface there was less collagen and the collagen fibers present in <italic>Ddr2</italic> deficient tumors were thinner and appeared more fragmented.

SHG analysis of collagen fiber orientation, length, and thickness in the same tumors as above did note changes in collagen fiber structure when <italic>Ddr2</italic> was deleted from CAFs, like in the FIB-SEM result.</p><p>In breast tumors, FSP1cre is expressed not only in CAFs but in the majority of CD45+ myeloid cells. Thus, we cannot exclude a contribution of DDR2’s action in myeloid cells as contributing to the altered CAF function in vivo or altered ECM remodeling in vivo. Inflammatory modulators secreted by cancer associated myeloid derived cells can affect tumor ECM directly (e.g., MMPs) or indirectly through cytokine secretion that activate CAFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ruffell et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, DDR2 has been reported to be expressed in neutrophil cell lines where it regulates migration or chemotaxis through collagen fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afonso et al., 2013</xref>), as well as in dendritic cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Poudel et al., 2012</xref>). However, in ubiquitous <italic>Ddr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> breast tumors there were no differences in the numbers of immune cell types observed compared to WT tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corsa et al., 2016</xref>).

Regardless, the accumulated cellular and in vivo data presented herein lend strong support for the mechanotransduction actions of DDR2 in CAFs as likely being a significant contributor to breast tumor mechanical properties (e.g., stiffness). We can exclude the action of DDR2 in tumor cells as contributing to breast tumor stiffness since deletion of <italic>Ddr2</italic> in breast epithelial cells only, with either MMTV-Cre or K14-Cre, did not affect primary tumor matrix production or organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corsa et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Growth factor RTK signaling can increase integrin expression, activation, and recycling. Integrin signals also affect growth factor RTK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ivaska and Heino, 2011</xref>). Most examples of growth factor RTK activation of Integrins occurs at the cell surface through complex formation with Integrins or possibly during endocytosis and recycling of receptor/Integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ivaska and Heino, 2011</xref>). By super resolution confocal microscopy or co-immunoprecipitation experiments we did not find any supportive evidence that DDR2 and collagen binding Integrins form complexes in cells. Whether DDR2 is endocytosed and recycled, and if so, what the functional consequences are has not been determined. A report has suggested that DDR1b is endocytosed and recycled to the cell surface and that the onset of endocytosis precedes receptor phosphorylation, suggesting that signaling could occur in intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mihai et al., 2006</xref>). Overexpression of DDR2 in HEK293 cells, cells that do not endogenously express DDR2, increase α1β1 and α2βl integrin affinity without affecting the cell surface levels of either Integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). The molecular basis for this observation and the functional significance were not determined.</p><p>During breast cancer development and progression endogenous DDR2 expression is upregulated in CAFs and appears to be critical for their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corsa et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gonzalez et al., 2017</xref>). Herein, we show that DDR2, in breast tumor CAFs, controls collagen binding Integrin activation by activating RAP1 to regulate Talin1 and Kindlin2 activity and, or recruitment to cell surface integrin. Talin1 and Kindlin2 activation and recruitment to cell surface β1 Integrin can be regulated by other positive and negative interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calderwood et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2014</xref>), but since constitutively activated RAP1 and Forskolin treatment rescued the defect almost entirely it is less likely that DDR2 influences these pathways. Precisely how DDR2 activates RAP1 remains to be determined. Inside-out RAP1 signaling regulating Talin1 mediated integrin activation has been well described and shown to be important in hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lagarrigue et al., 2016</xref>), and cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calderwood et al., 1999</xref>). But in mesenchymal cells within tissues, in vivo, where cells such as CAFs are embedded in the presence of excess Integrin ligand (e.g., collagen I), it has been more difficult to ascertain whether the contribution of inside-out signaling to integrin activation is present and important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klapholz and Brown, 2017</xref>). Herein we show that in the absence of full Talin1 activation in response to collagen activated DDR2 there are clear functional sequelae in mesenchymal cells in culture and in tumor progression in vivo.</p><p>Many, if not most, of the observed defective mechanobiologic properties of <italic>Ddr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> CAFs in various culture systems and <italic>Ddr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> tumors in vivo are likely to be manifestations of defective collagen binding β1 integrin activity rather than other DDR2 signaling pathways. DDR2 signaling also regulates the protein level, subcellular localization, and action of SNAIL1, an important mesenchymal cell transcriptional regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stanisavljevic et al., 2015</xref>). SNAIL1 is a critical regulator of the fibrogenic response of fibroblasts and CAFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stanisavljevic et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, mechanical signals (e.g., matrix stiffness) also regulates SNAIL1 levels and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). As a result, the overall tumor matrix organization controlled by DDR2 signaling in tumors, and CAFs specifically, likely involves both its regulation of collagen binding β1 Integrin and SNAIL1. Activation of DDR2 by fibrillar collagens, as defined by tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail, is slow (hours) and sustained (hours - days) for reasons that are unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2013</xref>). DDR2 signals that stabilize SNAIL1 protein in CAFs takes 4–6 hr of exposure to collagen I in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast regulation of collagen binding β1 integrin by DDR2 was apparent within minutes (15–30 min) yet requires the kinase activity of DDR2. This suggests that the DDR2 signaling pathway regulating RAP1 and integrin activity could be distinct from that regulating SNAIL1 activation.</p><p>In summary, we provide evidence and mechanism for the action of the collagen binding receptor DDR2, primarily in cancer associated fibroblasts, as a critical pathway controlling the tumor permissive ECM that forms in aggressive breast cancers and that facilitates or supports tumor cell invasion, migration and metastasis. We also show that inside-out regulation of collagen binding Integrin occurs in mesenchymal cells and in vivo and can have significant impact upon cancer progression to metastasis. As such DDR2 could represent an important therapeutic target to prevent cancer metastasis. Our results also shed light into how the action of DDR2 in tissue fibroblasts may contribute to other organ fibrosis pathologies in response to injury or inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeLeon-Pennell, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells utilized</title><p>Immortalized human breast tumor cancer associated fibroblasts (hCAFs) were kindly provided by Dr. S.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. While the work performed demonstrating the changes in biology in the primary tumor is of sufficient interest, there are some significant issues with the claims about metastasis and with image quantification, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The metastasis part is weak, and the emphasis and claims on metastasis are unwarranted. The claims need to be toned down to state that CAF DDR2 expression is important in tumor progression. Although the paper includes analysis of tumor growth in the lungs, this is based only on tail vein injection assays, which are called &quot;metastasis&quot; but are not. Moreover, there is very little mechanistic work connecting the biology of the primary tumor with development of lung metastases.</p><p>2) In the text, the authors contrast a published role for DDR2 in breast cancer lung metastasis in the presence of a primary tumor only (reciprocal orthotopic syngeneic breast tumor transplant experiments, Corsa CA 2016) with reciprocal tail vein injection in <italic>Ddr2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> vs. <italic>Ddr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> host mice in which metastasis was unaffected by DDR2. Although these orthotopic data are previously published, they are foundational to the authors' overall claim regarding lung metastasis. The authors should repeat the orthotopic experiment and present this alongside the data in Figure 1.</p><p>3) Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Does Kindlin-2 remain at the focal adhesion sites in the shDDR2 cells? A co-localization of Kindlin-2 with total β1 integrin would help address this.</p><p>4) The images in Figure 7 from the tumor organoids are difficult to interpret. It seems that quantification was carried out in 3D z-stacks. The authors state that the active β1 integrin signal was reduced in CAFs but not in tumor cells in the <italic>Ddr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> organoids. It is difficult to see how this assumption can be made based on the type of images shown. Furthermore, the quantification represents total signal throughout the organoid.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45508.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The metastasis part is weak, and the emphasis and claims on metastasis are unwarranted.

In this experimental setup <italic>Ddr2</italic> is deleted in the majority of FAP+ CAFs and myeloid cells (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). The tumor cells are <italic>Ddr2<sup>+/+</sup></italic>. In addition, we have now added an orthotopic transplant model in which <italic>Ddr2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> tumor cells are implanted into the breast of syngeneic <italic>Ddr2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Ddr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hosts (New Figure 1C). We could do this now as we have backcrossed the <italic>Ddr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> allele onto a Balb/C background (&gt;6 generations). In agreement with the spontaneous model we see a significant decrease in the number of lung metastases in <italic>Ddr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> transplanted mice. These 2 experiments indicate that the action of DDR2 in the primary tumor stroma, particularly in CAFs, impact lung metastases.</p><p>Perhaps, the reviewer wanted to see a transplant experiment performed in FSP1-Cre; Ddr2<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice? Due to the 2-month window for a response we did not have a large enough colony FSP1-Cre; <italic>Ddr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice colony on a FVB/N background to perform a syngeneic transplant metastasis model using primary WT PyMT tumor cells (FVB/n), as we did in Corsa et al., 2016. Moreover, the FSP1-Cre; Ddr2<sup>fl/fl</sup> alleles have not been backcrossed onto a pure Balb/C background, which precludes performing a 4T1 syngeneic transplant metastasis experiment.</p><p>With respect to the tail vein injection experiment presented, we completely agree with the reviewer – this is not a metastasis assay. It is a lung colonization assay. In other words, is the action of <italic>Ddr2</italic> in lung parenchymal cells (metastatic site) required for tumor cells to extravasate from the bloodstream, survive and grow in the lungs. This was done to test whether deletion of <italic>Ddr2</italic> in the lung stromal cells affected lung colonization by WT DDR2 tumor cells, as opposed to the action of DDR2 in the stromal cells of the primary tumor (assayed in the orthotopic transplant experiment Figure 1C). Throughout the revised text we have been careful to assure that we refer to this assay only as a lung colonization assay, not a metastasis assay.</p><p>With respect to the comment “Moreover, there is very little mechanistic work connecting the biology of the primary tumor with development of lung metastases” the current paper focuses exclusively on changes in the primary tumor matrix (collagen fiber architecture and physical properties) as a result of deletion of <italic>Ddr2</italic> in CAFs. Mechanistically, we believe we show in the current manuscript that the action of <italic>Ddr2</italic> in primary breast tumor CAFs is critical for the generation of an invasive permissive microenvironment – altered collagen fiber organization (SHG, FIB-SEM) leading to decreased primary tumor stiffness particularly at the tumor stromal boundary (AFM). This appears to be the result of <italic>Ddr2</italic> regulating full activation of collagen-binding Integrins through regulation of inside-out signaling regulating Talin1 activation/recruitment to Integrins. As to the action of DDR2 in primary tumor cells, our original publication in Nature Cell Biology 2012 showed that DDR2 activation by collagen stabilized SNAIL1 to sustain an EMT or mesenchymal phenotype and thus tumor cell invasion and migration through the collagen-rich ECM. Likely, DDR2 regulation of collagen binding Integrins (described in the current manuscript) in tumor cells also contributes to this defect in tumor cell invasion and migration (see Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the text, the authors contrast a published role for DDR2 in breast cancer lung metastasis in the presence of a primary tumor only (reciprocal orthotopic syngeneic breast tumor transplant experiments, Corsa CA 2016) with reciprocal tail vein injection in Ddr2<sup>+/+</sup> vs. Ddr2<sup>-/-</sup> host mice in which metastasis was unaffected by DDR2. Although these orthotopic data are previously published, they are foundational to the authors' overall claim regarding lung metastasis. The authors should repeat the orthotopic experiment and present this alongside the data in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now done this, and it is presented as new Figure 1B and C. Rather than repeat the same experiment as in Corsa et al., we performed a syngeneic orthotopic transplant metastasis assay using mouse 4T1 breast tumor cells. These are TNBC-like cells, that are highly invasive and metastatic. But they are derived from Balb/C mice. Fortunately, we had been backcrossing the <italic>Ddr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> allele onto a pure Balb/C background and there now &gt;6 generations. This allowed us to perform the experiment in the time (2 month) alloted. As shown in new Figure 1B and C, there is significantly decreased lung metastases in <italic>Ddr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice transplanted with <italic>Ddr2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> 4T1 breast tumor cells, compared to <italic>Ddr2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice transplanted with <italic>Ddr2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> 4T1 tumor cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Does Kindlin-2 remain at the focal adhesion sites in the shDDR2 cells? A co-localization of Kindlin-2 with total β1 integrin would help address this.</p></disp-quote><p>This was done. As observed for Talin1 and total β1-Integrin in <italic>Ddr2</italic>-depleted cells (Figure 3B), Kindlin2 and total β1-Integrin (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D) co-localized at focal adhesion sites in cellular protrusions in <italic>Ddr2</italic>-depleted cells, as determined by super-resolution confocal microscopy. This was in contrast to Talin1-active β1-Integrin (Figure 3C) and Kindlin2-active β1-Integrin (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B) which did not co-localize.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The images in Figure 7 from the tumor organoids are difficult to interpret. It seems that quantification was carried out in 3D z-stacks. The authors state that the active β1 integrin signal was reduced in CAFs but not in tumor cells in the Ddr2<sup>-/-</sup> organoids. It is difficult to see how this assumption can be made based on the type of images shown. Furthermore, the quantification represents total signal throughout the organoid.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this we have quantified active β1-Integrin staining in CAFs (FAP+ cells) and non-FAP staining tumor cells in primary tumor organoids. To do so, imaging was performed via confocal microscopy (Zeiss, 63X). Analysis was performed using FIJI to quantify fluorescence (corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) = Integrated Density – (Area of selected cell X Mean fluorescence of background readings)) in the entire tumor organoid as well as in FAP positive cells only. This has been added to Figure 7 as panel E. Results showed that in CAFs (defined as FAP+ cells) in both FSP1-Cre deleted <italic>Ddr2</italic> tumor organoids and ubiquitous <italic>Ddr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> tumor organoids, active β1-Integrin staining was dramatically and significantly reduced.</p></body></sub-article></article>
