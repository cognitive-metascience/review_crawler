However, the role of p53 in aging process and longevity has not been well-established. In humans, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with either arginine (R72) or proline (P72) at codon 72 influences p53 activity; the P72 allele has a weaker p53 activity and function in tumor suppression. Here, employing a mouse model with knock-in of human <italic>TP53</italic> gene carrying codon 72 SNP, we found that despite increased cancer risk, P72 mice that escape tumor development display a longer lifespan than R72 mice. Further, P72 mice have a delayed development of aging-associated phenotypes compared with R72 mice. Mechanistically, P72 mice can better retain the self-renewal function of stem/progenitor cells compared with R72 mice during aging. This study provides direct genetic evidence demonstrating that p53 codon 72 SNP directly impacts aging and longevity, which supports a role of p53 in regulation of longevity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34701.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>How long most animals live depends on the balance between the biological processes that allow them to regenerate their tissues when damaged and those that prevent them from developing cancer. Regeneration relies mostly on cells, in particular stem cells, dividing to make new cells, while cancer occurs when cell division becomes uncontrolled.</p><p>Tumor suppressor genes protect against cancer. One such gene encodes a protein called p53 that eliminates damaged cells before they can become cancerous. The p53 protein is also believed to be involved in regulating how quickly an animal ages and how long it lives, but this second role has not yet been clearly established.</p><p>Previous studies using different strategies to change the activity of p53 in several mouse models have led to inconsistent results. However, the mouse models used in these earlier studies did not reflect how p53 works under normal conditions.</p><p>Zhao et al. have now used mice in which the mouse gene for p53 was replaced with one of two versions of the equivalent human gene to study its impact on lifespan and the aging process. The two versions of p53 only differ slightly; a single building block of the protein, the amino acid at position 72, is a proline in one version but an arginine in the other. This difference makes one version of p53 weaker than the other; in other words, it is less able to eliminate damaged cells. Zhao et al. revealed that the mice with the weaker p53 lived for longer and appeared to age more slowly too. Further experiments showed that the stem cells in the mice with a weaker p53 were able to keep dividing and create new cells for longer. This is important because a decline in this activity – which is known as self-renewal – is a hallmark of aging.</p><p>Together these findings show that a small yet common change in p53 impacts both aging and lifespan, possibly by altering how stem cells are regulated. Further work is now needed to better understand why the different versions of p53 have different effects on stem cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>single nucleotide polymorphism</kwd><kwd>p53 codon 72</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F99CA222734</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yuhan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>New Jersey Commission on Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yue</surname><given-names>Xuetian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01CA227912</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Zhaohui</given-names></name><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Wenwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009160</institution-id><institution>Lawrence Ellison Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New Investigate Award AG-NS-0781-11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Wenwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01CA160558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Wenwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01CA203965</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Wenwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-16-1-0358</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Wenwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mouse model reveals that a p53 SNP impacts longevity via modulating the balance of cancer risk and the self-renewal function of stem/progenitor cells, which supports a role of p53 in regulation of longevity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is a complex process of time-dependent series of progressive loss of functions and structures of all systems, which leads to an increased vulnerability to death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). Cancer is an age-associated disease, which can lead to both premature death and age-associated increase in morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campisi and Yaswen, 2009</xref>). Tumor suppressor p53 plays a pivotal role in tumor prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vousden and Prives, 2009</xref>). Loss or disruption of p53 function is often a prerequisite for tumor initiation and development. In humans, more than 50% of all human tumors contain mutations in the <italic>p53</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Olivier et al., 2002</xref>). In mice, loss of both <italic>Trp53</italic> alleles (p53-/-) leads to the development of tumors early in life and a reduced lifespan compared with wild type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donehower et al., 1992</xref>). Therefore, p53 ensures longevity by preventing cancer development early in life.</p><p>Longevity depends on the balance between tumor suppression and tissue renewal mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campisi and Yaswen, 2009</xref>). While genomic instability is a hallmark of aging, stem cell exhaustion is another important hallmark of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). It has been indicated that the anti-proliferative function of p53 which is crucial for tumor suppression could affect self-renewal function of stem/progenitor cells and contribute to aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Heemst et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donehower, 2002</xref>). However, the precise role of p53 in aging process and longevity has not been clearly established. Inconsistent results on aging and longevity have been reported in different mouse models in which the p53 activity has been manipulated through different strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tyner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dumble et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mendrysa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matheu et al., 2007</xref>). Specifically, transgenic mice with constitutively elevated p53 activity by expression of certain p53 mutants or a short p53 isoform showed increased cancer resistance but premature aging phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tyner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dumble et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). The ‘super p53’ mice with a regulated hyperactive p53 activity by having an extra copy of the wild type <italic>Trp53</italic> gene were resistant to cancer but did not exhibit signs of accelerated aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mendrysa et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, the ‘super p53’ mice with an extra copy of <italic>Ink4</italic>/<italic>Arf</italic> showed extended longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matheu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matheu et al., 2009</xref>). It is worth noting that mouse models used in these studies did not reflect p53 activation under physiological conditions. It is therefore critical to address the role of p53 in the aging process and longevity using a proper mouse model reflecting the p53 activity under physiological conditions.</p><p><italic>TP53</italic> is a haplo-insufficient gene, a little decrease in p53 levels or activity (e.g. 2-fold difference) significantly impacts tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Venkatachalam et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger and Pandolfi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bond et al., 2004</xref>). p53 protein levels and activity are under tight regulation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vousden and Prives, 2009</xref>). In humans, naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the p53 pathway, which modulate the activity or levels of p53, have been found to significantly impact cancer risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bond et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whibley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basu and Murphy, 2016</xref>). p53 codon 72 SNP is a common coding SNP in the <italic>TP53</italic> gene, which results in either an arginine (R72) or a proline (P72) residue at codon 72. We and others have reported that compared with the R72 allele, the P72 allele displays a weaker p53 transcriptional activity towards a group of its target genes, many of which are involved in apoptosis and suppressing cell transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dumont et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeong et al., 2010</xref>). Studies in human populations indicate that p53 codon 72 SNP may modify cancer risk, but currently the consensus has not been reached on this in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Heemst et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whibley et al., 2009</xref>). Several studies of aged or general human populations indicate that the P72 carriers have an increased lifespan despite an increased mortality from cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Heemst et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bojesen and Nordestgaard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smetannikova et al., 2004</xref>). These epidemiological results support the dual functions of p53 in longevity, and suggest that codon 72 SNP may have an impact upon aging and longevity. Considering the genetic background variations of human populations and environmental factors in epidemiological studies, the precise role of p53 codon 72 SNP in aging and longevity remains elusive.</p><p>In this study, we employed a mouse model with knock-in of human <italic>TP53</italic> gene (Hupki) carrying codon 72 SNP to directly investigate the impact of p53 codon 72 SNP upon longevity and its underlying mechanism. The Hupki mice carrying codon 72 SNP recapture the impacts of codon 72 SNP upon p53 transcriptional activity and function in tumor suppression, which is widely used for studies on p53 and codon 72 SNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azzam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reinbold et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frank et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leu et al., 2013</xref>). We found that despite the increased cancer risk, P72 mice that have escaped tumor development have a longer lifespan than R72 mice and display a delay of age-associated phenotypes compared with R72 mice. Mechanistically, P72 mice have a better ability to retain the self-renewal function of stem/progenitor cells compared with R72 mice during the aging process. Long-term stem cells from aging P72 mice have better engraftment and repopulation abilities than aging R72 mice. In turn, P72 mice have less expansion of long-term stem/progenitor cells than R72 mice during the aging process. Taken together, our study provides direct genetic evidence demonstrating that human p53 codon 72 SNP has a direct impact upon aging and longevity in vivo, which supports the role of p53 in longevity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The lifespans of mice carrying human p53 Codon 72 SNP</title><p>To investigate the impact of human p53 codon 72 SNP upon aging and the lifespan, Hupki mice with knock-in of human <italic>TP53</italic> gene carrying codon 72 SNP in place of the corresponding mouse <italic>Trp53</italic> gene were employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frank et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leu et al., 2013</xref>).

Because the lifespan of mice varies among different inbred strains, Hupki mice with p53 codon 72 SNP were backcrossed to mice with different genetic backgrounds, including 129SV<sup>sl</sup> and C57BL/6J, for ten generations to establish p53 codon 72 SNP Hupki mice in 129SV<sup>sl</sup> and C57BL/6J backgrounds, respectively. The lifespan of mice with p53 codon 72 SNP in 129SV<sup>sl</sup> and C57BL/6J backgrounds was measured in a cohort of ~150 mice for each genotype. The median survival age was 740 days in 129SV<sup>sl</sup> mice and 490 days in C57BL/6J mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), which is consistent with previously reported lifespans of these two mouse strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Storer, 1966</xref>).</p><p>In 129SV<sup>sl</sup> mice, P72 mice showed an overall longer lifespan compared with R72 mice; the median survival age was 759 days for P72 mice and 697 days for R72 mice, respectively (Log-rank test: p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The causes of death included tumor, inflammation (including dermatitis), ocular lesion, urinary syndrome, nephropathy, etc., which are common causes of death in 129SV<sup>sl</sup> mice as reported by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marx et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brayton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Radaelli et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For those mice died from non-neoplastic events, P72 mice showed a significantly longer lifespan than R72 mice; the median survival was 768 days for P72 mice and 673 days for R72 mice, respectively (Log-rank test: p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Divergent results have been obtained from different mouse models in which the p53 activity was manipulated through different strategies. The increased p53 activity was reported to lead to accelerated aging in some mouse models, but do not affect the lifespan or even prolong the life span in other mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tyner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dumble et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mendrysa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matheu et al., 2007</xref>). These results indicate that p53 can be pro-aging or pro-longevity depending on the context of its regulation and activity. The precise role of p53 in intrinsic aging process, especially under the physiological condition, remains unclear.</p><p>Longevity depends on a balance between tumor suppression and tissue renewal mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campisi, 2003a</xref>). Declines in stem cells self-renewal and differentiation are critical components of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campisi and Yaswen, 2009</xref>). The anti-proliferative function of p53, which is crucial for suppression of cancer cells, plays a crucial role in eliminating damaged cells including stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">TeKippe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shounan et al., 1996</xref>). The pleiotropic antagonism theory suggests that certain cellular processes that provide beneficial effects in youth, may compromise organismal fitness later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campisi, 2003b</xref>). Currently, it is unclear whether p53 has the antagonistic pleiotropy and how the balance of p53 for tumor surveillance and stem cell regulation is regulated.</p><p>In humans, functional SNPs have been identified in both p53 and its signaling pathway, such as p53 codon 72 SNP and SNP309 in p53 negative regulator MDM2. These SNPs alter the levels and/or function of p53. Some of these SNPs, including p53 codon 72 SNP, appear to have undergone the natural selection, which suggests that p53 has evolutionarily-conserved functions other than tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atwal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atwal et al., 2009</xref>). It is possible that these SNPs modulate the function of p53 in maintaining the balance between tumor surveillance and stem cell regulation, which are important genetic modifiers for human longevity. Up till now, majority studies on p53 codon 72 SNP have focused on its impact upon cancer risk. However, there is no consensus in the literature as to the impact of p53 codon 72 SNP upon cancer risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Heemst et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whibley et al., 2009</xref>). Further, the role of p53 codon 72 SNP in stem cell regulation and aging process remains unclear. Several epidemiological studies of human populations indicate that p53 codon 72 SNP may influence human longevity. A perspective study with an aging human population (≥85 years, n = 1226) reported that individuals homozygous for the P72 allele have a 41% increased survival (p=0.032) despite a 2.54-fold increased mortality from cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Heemst et al., 2005</xref>). Another perspective study of the Danish general population (ages 20–95, n = 9219) reported that the p53 P72 allele is associated with an increased overall survival rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bojesen and Nordestgaard, 2008</xref>). Similarly, a study of long-lived individuals in Novosibirsk and Tyumen Regions (n = 131) reported the enrichment of the p53 P72 allele in the long-lived group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smetannikova et al., 2004</xref>). These findings suggest that p53 activity is reversely associated with aging, and p53 codon 72 SNP may impact the lifespan in humans.</p><p>In this study, we used a genetic approach to investigate whether p53 codon 72 SNP modulates longevity through regulating the balance of p53 functions in tumor surveillance and stem cell regulation by using Hupki mice carrying p53 codon 72 SNP. To exclude the effect of mixed mouse genetic backgrounds on the lifespan and the aging process, mice carrying p53 codon 72 SNP were backcrossed with 129SV<sup>sl</sup> mice and C57BL/6J mice, respectively, for 10 generations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, the lifespan and causes of death of these two mouse strains are very different. p53 codon 72 SNP showed a clear impact upon the lifespan in both strains of mice; P72 mice have a longer lifespan compared with their R72 littermates, although P72 mice have a higher risk for tumor development. This result is consistent with the observation in human populations showing that P72 carriers have a longer lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Heemst et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bojesen and Nordestgaard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smetannikova et al., 2004</xref>). Further, P72 mice display delayed aging-associated phenotypes compared with R72 mice. Results from this study further showed that P72 mice have a better self-renewal ability of stem cells and a delay of compensatory expansion of the stem cell pool compared with R72 mice. Stem cells from older P72 mice have better engraftment and repopulation ability compared with older R72 mice as determined by the bone marrow transplantation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). It has been suggested that p53 codon 72 SNP can influence the basal expression levels of some p53 target genes in humans, including <italic>p21</italic> and <italic>PAI-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salvioli et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Testa et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, it was reported that dermal fibroblasts from P72 carriers display a higher expression of <italic>p21</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salvioli et al., 2005</xref>). In plasma samples from healthy populations, the P72 allele plays an important role in determining PAI-1 levels in aging populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Testa et al., 2009</xref>). Results from this study showed that the bone marrow from P72 mice displays higher expression levels of <italic>p21</italic> but lower expression levels of <italic>Puma</italic> and <italic>Noxa</italic> compared with R72 mice. The differential expression of these target genes may modulate the p53 decision on cell fates towards survival or death, which may contribute to the delayed aging process in HSC function observed in P72 mice. In addition to p53 codon 72, a group of functional SNPs have been identified in the <italic>p53</italic> gene and important genes in the p53 pathway, such as <italic>MDM2</italic>. A very recent study reported that a patient affected by a segmental progeroid syndrome has a germline mutation in the <italic>MDM2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lessel et al., 2017</xref>). This mutation abrogates MDM2 function and leads to increased p53 levels and function, which might be the driving cause for the premature aging phenotype of this patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lessel et al., 2017</xref>). It will be of interest to study how these SNPs in the p53 pathway (individual or in combination) impact aging and longevity in future studies.</p><p>Taken together, results from this study provided the genetic evidence showing that functional p53 codon 72 SNP, which regulates the activity of p53, influences aging and longevity through the regulation of self-renewal function of stem cells. Results from this study strongly support a role of p53 in regulation of stem/progenitor cell function and longevity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Hupki mice carrying either the P72 or R72 allele were generous gifts from Dr. Maureen Murphy (The Wistar Institute) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kung et al., 2016</xref>).

It is a good suggestion to perform the RNA-seq analysis of bone marrow cells from old and young P72 and R72 mice. However, the facility that we routinely used for RNA-seq analysis is currently having a longer than usual time period for sample processing and data analysis. Further, the basal expression levels of many p53 target genes are low and it is possible that the modulation of p53 codon 72 SNP on some p53 target genes only leads to slight changes in their expression levels. Real-time PCR assays are more sensitive in detecting slight difference in expression of low abundant transcripts compared with RNA-seq analysis. Therefore, we performed real-time PCR analysis of some p53 target genes involved in cell cycle arrest (<italic>p21</italic>) and apoptosis (<italic>Puma</italic> and <italic>Noxa</italic>) in the bone marrow from young (6 months) and older (18 months) P72 and R72 129SV<sup>sl</sup> mice as the reviewers suggested.</p><p>As shown in Figure 6C, <italic>p21</italic> mRNA expression levels in the bone marrow were slightly higher in P72 mice compared with R72 mice as determined by real-time PCR assays with this difference being more obvious in older mice than in young mice. This difference in p21 expression levels was confirmed at the protein level as determined by Western-blot assays (Figure 6C). In contrast, the bone marrow from P72 mice displayed slightly lower expression levels of <italic>Puma</italic> and <italic>Noxa</italic> than that from R72 mice (Figure 6C). These results demonstrate the differential regulation of the basal expression levels of <italic>p21, Puma</italic> and <italic>Noxa</italic> by p53 codon 72 SNP in the bone marrow, which may contribute to the delayed aging process in HSC number and function observed in P72 mice.</p><p>In addition to the above-mentioned genes, the expression levels of <italic>PAI-1</italic> were examined in the bone marrow as the reviewer suggested and no obvious difference was observed between the bone marrow from P72 and R72 mice (data not shown).</p><p>We have also referenced the two relevant publications that the reviewers pointed out in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is a question about some of the statistical analyses done by the authors. As one example, Figure 2A, the median survival difference of 481 days and 495.5 days seems hardly significantly different and the survival curves overlap extensively, yet the authors find a p value of 0.0015 using the log rank test. Can the authors please revisit and explain this analysis, which does not seem accurate.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raised a very good question. We re-analyzed the data with the help from two bio-statisticians (Prof. Yiming Zhu, and Ms. Xiaohui Sun as listed in our manuscript as co-authors). The survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier plot and compared by the log-rank test. The p value of the survival results in Figure 2A is 0.015 which shows statistical difference between P72 and R72 mice. We apologize for the mistake of putting the p value in Figure 2A as 0.0015 in our original manuscript. We have corrected this mistake.</p><p>The log-rank test which is the most popular method of comparing the survival of groups, takes the whole follow up period into account. This statistical test is a large-sample chi-square test which calculates the chi-square for each event time for each group and sums the results. The summed results for each group are added to derive the ultimate chi-square to compare the full curves of each group (Rich et al., 2010). The advantage of this analysis is that this analysis does not require us to know anything about the shape of the survival curve or the distribution of survival times (Bland and Altman, 2004). It is therefore possible for survival curves with some overlap to have statistical significant difference. For Figure 2A, while survival curves have some overlap and median survival data are very close, survival curves are different after 75% survival. In both Figure 1 and Figure 2, lines indicating 50% and 75% survival have been labelled in each panel of the survival curve.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Similar to the concern above, the analysis of Lordokyphosis in Figure 3B shows large error bars that overlap and a very small sample size of n=5. Yet the authors indicate a p value under 0.05. How is this being measured? More details of their analysis from a bio-statistician should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we consulted the two above-mentioned bio-statisticians to re-visit the experimental design and re-perform the statistical analysis of all data in the manuscript. Based on survival data of p53 codon 72 SNP mice, we hypothesized that the P72 mice have a delayed development of aging associated phenotypes. Therefore, one-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used for majority of data analysis presented in Figure 3,Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6, including Figure 3B. For data presented in Figure 3, due to the technical requirement, including processing capacity for micro-CT scan analysis, studies were designed with the age and gender-matched mice used as paired sets to reduce incidental variation. This explains that the analysis of Lordokyphosis in Figure 3B found the p value under 0.05 when the sample size was 5/group and the data showed large SD (standard deviation). All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism. All source data have been included in the manuscript with the description of statistical analysis. Source data have been updated with the format displaying 2 digits after decimal point; p values have been updated with the format displaying 3 digits after decimal point. These details have been included in the methods and the source data as suggested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
