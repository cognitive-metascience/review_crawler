Readability formulas can estimate how difficult a text is to read. Here, in a corpus consisting of 709,577 abstracts published between 1881 and 2015 from 123 scientific journals, we show that the readability of science is steadily decreasing. Our analyses show that this trend is indicative of a growing use of general scientific jargon.

The clarity of written language can be quantified using readability formulas, which estimate how understandable written texts are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flesch, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kincaid et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chall and Dale, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Danielson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DuBay, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Štajner et al., 2012</xref>). Texts written at different times can vary in their readability: trends towards simpler language have been observed in US presidential speeches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lim, 2008</xref>), novels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Danielson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jatowt and Tanaka, 2012</xref>) and news articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stevenson, 1964</xref>). There are studies that have investigated linguistic trends within the scientific literature. One study showed an increase in positive sentiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinkers et al., 2015</xref>), finding that positive words such as 'novel' have increased dramatically in scientific texts since the 1970s. A tentative increase in complexity has been reported in scientific texts in a limited dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayes, 1992</xref>), but the extent of this phenomenon and any underlying reasons for such a trend remain unknown.</p><p>To investigate trends in scientific readability over time, we downloaded 709,577 article abstracts from PubMed, from 123 highly cited journals selected from 12 fields of research (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). These journals cover general, biomedical and life sciences. This journal list included, among others, Nature, Science, NEJM, The Lancet, PNAS and JAMA (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and the publication dates ranged from 1881 to 2015. We quantified the reading level of each abstract using two established measures of readability: the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flesch, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kincaid et al., 1975</xref>) and the New Dale-Chall Readability Formula (NDC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chall and Dale, 1995</xref>). The FRE is calculated using the number of syllables per word and the number of words in each sentence. The NDC is calculated using the number of words in each sentence and the percentage of 'difficult words'. Difficult words are defined as those words which do not belong to a predefined list of common words (see Materials and methods). Lower readability is indicated by a low FRE score or a high NDC score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27725.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Data and readability analysis pipeline.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting the major steps in the abstract extraction and analysis pipeline.

The average yearly trends combined with this statistical model reveal that the complexity of scientific writing is increasing with time. In order to explore whether this trend was consistent across all 12 selected fields, we extracted the slopes (random effects) from the mixed effects models for each journal. This showed that the trend of decreasing readability over time is not specific to any particular field, although there are differences in magnitude between fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

We selected the 2,949 most common words which were not included in the NDC common word list from 12,000 abstracts sampled at random (see Materials and methods for procedure). This is analogous to a 'science-specific common word list'. This list also includes topics which have increased over time (e.g. 'gene') and subject-specific words (e.g. 'tumor'), which are not indicative of an in-group scientific vocabulary. We removed such words to create a general scientific jargon list (2,138 words; see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

It is important to put the magnitude of these results in context. A FRE score of 100 is designed to reflect the reading level of a 10- to 11-year old. A score between 0 and 30 is considered understandable by college graduates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flesch, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kincaid et al., 1975</xref>). In 1960, 14% of the texts in our corpus had a FRE below 0. In 2015, this number had risen to 22%. In other words, more than a fifth of scientific abstracts now have a readability considered beyond college graduate level English. However, the absolute readability scores should be interpreted with some caution: scores can vary due to different media (e.g. comics versus news articles; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Štajner et al., 2012</xref>) and education level thresholds can be imprecise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stokes, 1978</xref>). We then validated abstract readability against full text readability, demonstrating that it is a suitable approximation for comparing main texts.</p><p>We investigated two possible reasons why this trend has occurred. First, we found that readability of abstracts correlates with the number of co-authors, but this failed to fully account for the trend through time. Second, we showed that there is an increase in general scientific jargon over years. These general science jargon words should be interpreted as words which scientists frequently use in scientific texts, and not as subject specific jargon. This finding is indicative of a progressively increasing in-group scientific language ('science-ese').</p><p>An alternative explanation for the main finding is that the cumulative growth of scientific knowledge makes an increasingly complex language necessary. This cannot be directly tested, but if this were to fully explain the trend, we would expect a greater diversity of vocabulary as science grows more specialized. While accounting for the original finding of the increase in difficult words and of syllable count, this would <italic>not</italic> explain the increase of general scientific jargon words (e.g. 'furthermore' or 'novel', <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, this possible explanation cannot fully account for our findings.</p><p>Lower readability implies less accessibility, particularly for non-specialists, such as journalists, policy-makers and the wider public. Scientific journalism offers a key role in communicating science to the wider public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bubela et al., 2009</xref>) and scientific credibility can sometimes suffer when reported by journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinnant and Len-Ríos, 2009</xref>). Considering this, decreasing readability cannot be a positive development for efforts to accurately communicate science to non-specialists. Further, amidst concerns that modern societies are becoming less stringent with actual truths, replaced with true-sounding 'post-facts' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manjoo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nordenstedt and Rosling, 2016</xref>) science should be advancing our most accurate knowledge. One way to achieve this is for science to maximize its accessibility to non-specialists.</p><p>Lower readability is also a problem for specialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartley and Benjamin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hartley, 2003</xref>). This was explicitly shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartley (1994</xref>) who demonstrated that rewriting scientific abstracts, to improve their readability, increased academics’ ability to comprehend them. While science is complex, and some jargon is unavoidable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knight, 2003</xref>), this does not justify the continuing trend that we have shown. It is also worth considering the importance of comprehensibility of scientific texts in light of the recent controversy regarding the reproducibility of science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prinz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McNutt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Begley and Ioannidis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nosek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camerer et al., 2016</xref>). Reproducibility requires that findings can be verified independently. To achieve this, reporting of methods and results must be sufficiently understandable.</p><p>Readability formulas are not without their limitations. They provide an estimate of a text’s readability and should not be interpreted as a categorical measure of how well a text will be understood. For example, readability can be affected by text size, line spacing, the use of headers, as well as by the use of visual aids such as tables or graphs, none of which are captured by readability formulas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Badarudeen and Sabharwal, 2010</xref>). Many semantic properties of texts are overlooked, including the complexity of ideas, the rhetorical structure and the overall coherence of the text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruce et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Danielson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zamanian and Heydari, 2012</xref>). Changing a text solely to improve readability scores does not automatically make a text more understandable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duffy and Kabance, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Redish, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Despite the limitations of readability formulas, our study shows that recent scientific texts are, on average, less readable than older scientific texts. This trend was not specific to any one field, even though the size of this association varied across fields. Some fields also had a steeper decline in NDC scores, while less of a decline in FRE scores, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Further research should explore possible reasons for these differences, as it may give clues on how to improve readability. For example, the adoption of structured abstracts which are known to assist readability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartley and Benjamin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hartley, 2003</xref>) might lead to a less steep decline for some fields.</p><p>What more can be done to reverse this trend? The emerging field of science communication deals with ways science can effectively communicate ideas to a wider audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Treise and Weigold, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nielsen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischhoff, 2013</xref>). One suggestion from this field is to create accessible 'lay summaries', which have been implemented by some journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuehne and Olden, 2015</xref>). Others have noted that scientists are increasing their direct communication with the general public through social media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peters et al., 2014</xref>), and this trend could be encouraged. However, while these two suggestions may increase accessibility of scientific results, neither will reverse the readability trend of scientific texts. Another proposal is to make scientific communication a necessary part of undergraduate and graduate education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brownell et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Scientists themselves can estimate their own readability in most word processing software. Further, while some journals aim for high readability, perhaps a more thorough review of article readability should be carried out by journals in the review process. Finally, in an era of data metrics, it is possible to assess a scientist’s average readability, analogous to the h-index for citations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirsch, 2005</xref>). Such an 'r-index' could be considered an asset for those scientists who emphasize clarity in their writing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Journal selection</title><p>We aimed to obtain journals from which articles are highly cited from a representative selection of the biomedical and life sciences, as well as from journals which cover all fields of science, which were indexed on PubMed.

TreeTagger (version 3.2 (Linux); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schmid, 1994</xref>) was used to identify sentence endings and to remove non-words (e.g. numbers) and any remaining punctuation from the abstracts. Scientific texts contain numerous phrasings which TreeTagger did not parse adequately. We did three rounds of quality control where at least 200 preprocessed articles, sampled at random, were compared with their original texts. After identifying irregularities with the TreeTagger performance, regular expression heuristics were created to prepare the abstracts prior to using the TreeTagger algorithm. After the three rounds of quality control, the stripped abstracts contained only words with at least one syllable and periods to end sentences. Sentences containing only one word were ignored.</p><p>The heuristic rules after quality control rounds included: removing all abbreviations, adding spaces after periods when missing, adding a final period at the end of the abstract when missing, removing numbers that ended sentences, identifying sentences that end with 'etc.' and keeping the period, removing all single letter words except 'a', 'A' and 'I', removing nucleic acid sequences, replacing hyphens with a space, removing periods arising from the use of binomial nomenclature, and removing copyright and funding information.

These measures use different language metrics: syllable count, sentence count, word count and percentage of difficult words. Two different readability metrics were chosen to ensure that the results were not induced by a single method. FRE was chosen due to its popularity and consistency with other readability metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Didegah and Thelwall, 2013</xref>), and because it has previously been applied to trends over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lim, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Danielson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jatowt and Tanaka, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stevenson, 1964</xref>).

First, the word was required to have a vowel or a 'y' in it. Second, the word was queried against a dictionary that contained specified syllable counts using the natural language toolkit (NLTK) (version 3.2.2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bird et al., 2009</xref>). If there were multiple possible syllable counts for a given word, the longer alternative was chosen. Third, if the word was not in the dictionary, the number of vowels (excluding diphthongs) was counted. If a word ended in a 'y', this was counted as an additional syllable in this third step.</p><p>Word count was calculated by counting all the words in the abstract that had at least one syllable.

'words', and 'sentences' entail the number of each in the text, respectively. 'Difficult' is the number of words that are not present in the NDC common word list.</p><p>We have used two well-established readability formulas in our analysis. The application of readability formulas has previously been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duffy and Kabance, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Redish and Selzer, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zamanian and Heydari, 2012</xref>) and modern alternatives have been proposed (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benjamin, 2012</xref>). However, NDC has been shown to perform comparably with these more modern methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benjamin, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Science-specific common word and general science jargon lists</title><p>We created two common word lists using the abstracts in our dataset:</p><p><italic>Science-specific common words</italic>: Words frequently used by scientists which are not part of the NDC common word list. This contains units of measurement (e.g. 'mol'), subject-specific words (e.g. 'electrophoresis'), general science jargon words (e.g. 'moreover') and some proper nouns (e.g. 'european').</p><p><italic>General science jargon</italic>: A subset of science-specific common words. These are non-subject-specific words that are frequently used by scientists. This list contains words with a variety of different linguistic functions (e.g. 'endogenous', 'contribute' and 'moreover'). General science jargon can be considered the basic vocabulary of a '<italic>science-ese'</italic>. Science-ese is analogous to <italic>legalese</italic>, which is the general technical language used by legal professionals.</p><p>To construct the science-specific common word list, 12,000 articles were selected to identify words frequently used in the scientific literature. In order to avoid any recency bias, 2,000 articles were randomly selected from six different decades (starting at the 1960s). From these articles, the frequency of all words was calculated. After excluding words in the NDC common word list, the 2,949 most frequent words were selected. The number 2,949 was selected to be the same length as the NDC common word list.</p><p>To validate that this list is identifying a general scientific terminology, we created a verification list by performing the same steps as above on an additional independent set of 12,000 articles. Of the 2,949 words in the science-specific common word list, 90.95% of the words were present in the verification list (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for both word lists). The 24,000 articles used in the derivation and verification of the lists were excluded from all further analysis.</p><p>The general scientific jargon list contained 2,138 words. It was created by manually filtering the science-specific common word list. All four co-authors went through the science-specific common word list and rated each word. The following guidelines were formulated to exclude words from being classed as general science jargon: (1) abbreviations, roman numerals, or units that survived preprocessing (e.g. 'mol'). (2) Field-specific words (e.g. 'hepatitis'). (3) Words whose frequency may be changing through time due to major discoveries (e.g. 'gene'). (4) Nouns and adjectives that refer to non-science objects and could be placed in a general easy word list (e.g. 'mouse', 'green', 'September'). Remaining words were classed as possible general science jargon word. After comparing each co-authors’ ratings, the final list was created. The co-authors performed the ratings to identify jargon words independently. However, half way through the ratings there was a meeting to control that the guidelines were being performed in a similar way. In this meeting, the authors discussed examples from their ratings. Due to this, the ratings can not be classed as completely independent.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Comparison of full texts vs abstracts</title><p>To compare the readability of full texts and abstracts, we chose six journals from the PubMed Central Open Access Subset for which all full texts of articles were available under a Creative Commons or similar license. The journals were BMC Biology, eLife, Genome Biology, PLoS Biology, PLoS Medicine and PLoS ONE. None of them were a part of the original journal list which was used in the main analysis. They were selected as they all cover biomedicine and life sciences and as open access journals, we were legally allowed to bulk-download both abstracts and full texts. However, none of the included journals have existed for a long period of time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). As such, they cannot be said to represent the same time range covered by the 123 journals used in the main analysis. Custom scripts were written to extract the full text in the textfiles downloaded from each respective journal. In total, 143,957 articles were included in the full text analysis. Both article abstracts and full texts were preprocessed according to the procedure outlined above and readability measures were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical modeling was performed in R version 3.3.2.</p><p>We evaluated the relationship between the readability of single abstracts and year of publication separately for FRE and NDC scores. The data can be viewed as hierarchically structured since abstracts belonging to different journals may differ in key aspects. In addition, journals span over different ranges of years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In order to account for this structure, we performed linear mixed effect modeling using the R-packages lme4 version 1.1-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bates et al., 2014</xref>), and lmerTest version 2.0-33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuznetsova et al., 2015</xref>) with maximum likelihood estimation. We compared different models of increasing complexity. The included models were as following: (M0) a null model in which readability score was predicted only by journal as random effect with varying intercepts; (M1) the same as M0, but with an added fixed effect of time; and (M2) the same as M1, but with varying slopes for the random effect of journal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We selected the best fitting model as determined by the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayesian Information Criterion.</p><p>In order to test that the trend was not explained by the increasing number of authors with year, we specified an additional model. It was identical to M2 above, but also included the number of authors as a second fixed effect. Some articles (n = 2,327) lacked author information, and were excluded from the analysis. This model was performed using two sets of the data: i) a subset including only articles with one to ten authors (n = 652,357), ii) a full dataset consisting of all articles with complete author information (n = 707,250) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The motivation for (i) was that abstracts with many authors may bias the results.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This article has a FRE score of 49.

We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within two months.</p><p>Summary</p><p>This manuscript – which first appeared as a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/119370">preprint on bioRxiv</ext-link> – reports a decline in the readability of scientific texts meaning that, on average, papers published in recent decades are harder to read than those from over a century ago. Two possible explanations are tested: an increase in the number of authors per manuscript, and the wider use of uncommon language (referred to as &quot;general scientific jargon&quot;). All three reviewers agree that the manuscript is timely and relevant, and that it has the potential to make a clear contribution to the existing literature. The research design looks sound, and mainly builds on two well-established measures of readability. The analyses appear to be executed in a rigorous and transparent manner, and the authors generate a set of straightforward and intuitive but highly relevant findings. The reviewers hope that this manuscript will raise awareness, and encourage scientists and publishers to take readability into account when authoring or reviewing scientific papers.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are some issues that need to be addressed, and several revisions that would strengthen the manuscript. Most can be handled by editing the text to provide more details or clarity, or by improving the presentation of the figures. One will require a more fine-grained analysis of the data that is already available.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. Both of the readability formulas reported in the Materials and methods section contain mistakes. The constant in the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) formula is incorrectly given as &quot;206.385&quot; instead of &quot;206.835&quot;. The New Dale-Chall (NDC) Readability Formula is repeatedly missing the &quot;× 100&quot; that converts the fraction of &quot;difficult words&quot; to a percentage. The inequality symbols (i.e. &gt; and {less than or equal to}) have also been transposed in the NDC formula meaning that, if followed as written, the scores would not be adjusted properly. From the data provided, it is clear that the correct NDC formula was used for the analyses. But we cannot check the FRE calculations because the &quot;syllable counts&quot; are missing from the data provided (see point 4). Please confirm that the correct FRE formula was used and fix the mistakes described above.</p><p>2. The readability measures chosen appear plausible and test two complementary dimensions of readability. However, please provide some more justification as to why these two measures were chosen and not others.</p><p>3. Please elaborate on the limitations of readability metrics in general, and those linked to text pre-processing. For example, visual aids are not captured even though they might improve comprehension; or the fact that FRE does not take into account parentheses and other ways of structuring text (which might also aid readability).</p><p>4. The authors have agreed to make the data and scripts openly accessible, which is applaudable. However, the data provided with the full submission is missing the syllable counts. Please provide all the data needed to recreate the figures in this version of the manuscript. This also includes the analyses related to the full texts, number of authors, and &quot;general scientific jargon&quot;. Please see the section on &quot;Source Data Files&quot; in eLife's author guide for more details.</p><p>5. The current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>are packed with data and somewhat difficult to follow. Please divide them each into two separate figures. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, separate the summary graphics from the panels showing the main trends. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the data related to number of authors should be separated from that related to &quot;general scientific jargon&quot;.</p><p>6. The phrase &quot;high-impact journals&quot; is used without explanation. The specific meaning of the word &quot;impact&quot; in this context is unclear and could arguably be considered jargon. Please explain this phrase in the text or replace with a more accurate description like &quot;highly cited journals&quot;.</p><p>7. Please elaborate on the criteria used to select the &quot;six representative&quot; open-access journals for the full-text analysis. Please also provide information equivalent to that provided for the journals in the abstract-only analysis.</p><p>8. As it stands now, the analysis remains at a very high level. Digging deeper into the existing data might reveal avenues to pursue to address the poor readability of scientific texts. Please report and discuss the trends in readability (or the average values) for the different journals and/or fields of research. For example, showing that articles in some journals are more readable than others might encourage someone to trace these differences back to specific editorial policies (word limits etc.) that could then be adopted more widely.</p><p>9. The literature on science communication is extensive, covering both the underlying communication process as well as its implications. Please strengthen the manuscript's links to this literature; for example, by discussing to what extent is it necessary that non-specialists can read and understand scientific articles, given that mainstream media and other new outlets have been created to specifically focus on non-specialist audiences in this context. While the reviewers likely agree with the authors' line of argument, some more contextualization and justification would be helpful here.</p><p>10. Please integrate the &quot;Supplementary methods&quot; into the &quot;Materials and methods&quot; section, to avoid the need to jump back and forth in the text. The sections on selecting journal fields and identifying &quot;candidate jargon&quot; would also benefit from being critically edited to improve clarity.</p><p>11. On a related point, please define classifications like &quot;science-specific common words&quot; and &quot;candidate general science jargon&quot; more clearly, and then consistently use them throughout the text. As currently written, some readers would not recognize uncommon/formal words - such as &quot;novel&quot;, &quot;robust&quot;, &quot;moreover&quot; and &quot;therefore&quot; - as scientific jargon. It would also be helpful if the discussion on this topic were expanded.</p><p>12. The FRE score of 48.2 for the submitted manuscript is respectable. However, please look for further opportunities to make the article easier to read, including ways that would not necessarily get picked up by the readability formulas referenced in the article. For example, while most English speakers are likely to know the verb &quot;understand&quot;, fewer will be familiar with the adjective &quot;understandable&quot;, and fewer still the noun &quot;understandability&quot; (which is used in the manuscript's abstract). Please consider using fewer nouns and more verbs throughout the abstract, main text and figure captions (e.g. &quot;Scientific abstracts have become harder to read over time&quot; rather than &quot;Readability of scientific abstracts decreases over time&quot;.)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27725.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential Revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>1.

We further apologise for the syllable count being omitted from the source data we included. This has been fixed and included as source data (see the response to point 4 for a further details regarding the source data).</p><p><italic>2. The readability measures chosen appear plausible and test two complementary dimensions of readability. However, please provide some more justification as to why these two measures were chosen and not others.</italic> </p><p>Our reason for using two measures was to make sure the result was not merely induced by the measure itself. The reasons for using FRE were because of its popularity and because it has been used in looking at temporal trends in other studies. The reason for using NDC was because it includes something different to FRE in how it is calculated (the common word lists). Further it performs comparatively compared to recently proposed readability measures. We have added some sentences to justify the choice of two readability metrics in the first paragraph of the “Language and Readability metrics” subsection of the Material and methods section.</p><p><italic>3. Please elaborate on the limitations of readability metrics in general, and those linked to text pre-processing. For example, visual aids are not captured even though they might improve comprehension; or the fact that FRE does not take into account parentheses and other ways of structuring text (which might also aid readability).</italic> </p><p>We agree that it is important to emphasize the limitations of readability formulas. We have therefore amended the limitations paragraph with examples for text elements which contribute to understanding but which are often removed during pre-processing or not captured by readability formulas.</p><p><italic>4.

We have added a similar file: “<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>” for the analysis on the unpreprocessed data. This allows for full recreation of the relevant figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and its supplement).</p><p>“<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>” and “<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>” is now included and will allow reproduction of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and its supplement.</p><p>“<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>” is now included and allows reproduction of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and its supplements.</p><p>“<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>” contains all the information needed to reproduce <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>“<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>” is also included which allows for the analysis to be reproduced regarding the derivation of the science easy words.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> both use “<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>” as their source data.</p><p>It is associated with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> as most of the data in the file belongs to Figure 2.

Finally, we have placed all the scripts on a public repository on GitHub: https://github.com/wiheto/readabilityinscience and these are now available.</p><p><italic>5. The current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> are packed with data and somewhat difficult to follow. Please divide them each into two separate figures. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, separate the summary graphics from the panels showing the main trends. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the data related to number of authors should be separated from that related to &quot;general scientific jargon&quot;.</italic> </p><p>We have divided up the figures as requested. There are now six figures in total: the summary graphic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); the main readability result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); the random effects per field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; and per journal in the figure supplement); the full text data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>); the number of authors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); the “jargon” analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><italic>6. The phrase &quot;high-impact journals&quot; is used without explanation. The specific meaning of the word &quot;impact&quot; in this context is unclear and could arguably be considered jargon. Please explain this phrase in the text or replace with a more accurate description like &quot;highly cited journals&quot;.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers are correct that this term is unclear, and this term is certainly a form of science-ese. The text has been amended to say “highly cited” both in the introduction and methods.</p><p><italic>7. Please elaborate on the criteria used to select the &quot;six representative&quot; open-access journals for the full-text analysis. Please also provide information equivalent to that provided for the journals in the abstract-only analysis.</italic> </p><p>We have expanded upon the reasons for why these particular six journals have been included in the abstract-full text analysis. Importantly, one of the main reasons to choose these journals was because they were Open Access - and Open Access journals are the only ones that allow us to download full texts en masse without violating the terms and conditions of services like Pubmed. We have added a supplementary file to the manuscript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), which displays information about the journals included in this analysis. Further, we have also now provided additional supplementary figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), demonstrating that the observed correlation between readability for abstracts and full texts is present in each of the journals included in the analysis.</p><p><italic>8. As it stands now, the analysis remains at a very high level. Digging deeper into the existing data might reveal avenues to pursue to address the poor readability of scientific texts. Please report and discuss the trends in readability (or the average values) for the different journals and/or fields of research. For example, showing that articles in some journals are more readable than others might encourage someone to trace these differences back to specific editorial policies (word limits etc.) that could then be adopted more widely.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that a deeper analysis can yield ideas and hypotheses for future research on how to improve readability. We have therefore extracted the random effect (i.e. slope) of each journal from the mixed models and plotted them both by themselves, and as field-summaries, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and its supplement. This shows that the trend is present in all fields, although some journals do not show a decline in readability. We have amended the results section accordingly, and added a discussion about the possibility of future research to examine why there are differences between fields and journals, and how this could yield clues on how to address the problem.</p><p><italic>9. The literature on science communication is extensive, covering both the underlying communication process as well as its implications. Please strengthen the manuscript's links to this literature; for example, by discussing to what extent is it necessary that non-specialists can read and understand scientific articles, given that mainstream media and other new outlets have been created to specifically focus on non-specialist audiences in this context. While the reviewers likely agree with the authors' line of argument, some more contextualization and justification would be helpful here.</italic> </p><p>In answer to this point we have rewritten two paragraphs. The paragraph that begins “Lower readability implies less accessibility, particularly for non-specialists, such as journalists, policy-makers and the wider public” (Discussion, fourth paragraph) now clarifies that “non-specialists” also applies to journalists within the mainstream media. This should clarify that this even affects those that use science journalism as a news source. We have also changed the focus of this paragraph from previously talking about scientific literacy and now focus more on scientific journalism. This is because it is hard to see that scientific literacy is causally affected by our results here, and it was a speculative link of troubling trends.</p><p>Additionally the paragraph that begins “What more can be done to reverse this trend?” (Discussion, penultimate paragraph) makes greater links with the literature in scientific communication. We state some of the more prominent proposals that have been made to make scientific texts more accessible.</p><p><italic>10. Please integrate the &quot;Supplementary methods&quot; into the &quot;Materials and methods&quot; section, to avoid the need to jump back and forth in the text. The sections on selecting journal fields and identifying &quot;candidate jargon&quot; would also benefit from being critically edited to improve clarity.</italic> </p><p>The two sections that were previously in the Supplementary Methods, namely the selection of journal fields and identifying candidate jargon have both been moved to the Materials and methods section. Both sections have been made shorter and clearer.</p><p><italic>11. On a related point, please define classifications like &quot;science-specific common words&quot; and &quot;candidate general science jargon&quot; more clearly, and then consistently use them throughout the text. As currently written, some readers would not recognize uncommon/formal words - such as &quot;novel&quot;, &quot;robust&quot;, &quot;moreover&quot; and &quot;therefore&quot; - as scientific jargon. It would also be helpful if the discussion on this topic were expanded.</italic> </p><p>The Material and methods subsection “Science-specific common word and general science jargon lists” has been completely rewritten where we give clear definitions of what these two terms mean. We have also dropped the term “candidate” from the entire text as it could be considered confusing. The initial reason for including it was to not definitively declare these terms as jargon, since they have been defined only by excluding certain categories of words. An additional sentence has been added to the discussion paragraph to clarify how to interpret general scientific jargon.</p><p><italic>12. The FRE score of 48.2 for the submitted manuscript is respectable. However, please look for further opportunities to make the article easier to read, including ways that would not necessarily get picked up by the readability formulas referenced in the article. For example, while most English speakers are likely to know the verb &quot;understand&quot;, fewer will be familiar with the adjective &quot;understandable&quot;, and fewer still the noun &quot;understandability&quot; (which is used in the manuscript's abstract). Please consider using fewer nouns and more verbs throughout the abstract, main text and figure captions (e.g. &quot;Scientific abstracts have become harder to read over time&quot; rather than &quot;Readability of scientific abstracts decreases over time&quot;.)</italic> </p><p>We have now gone through the manuscript and, to the best of our ability, tried to improve the readability further. For example, sentences have been shortened, nouns have been replaced by verbs when suitable, and complicated words have been replaced by simpler synonyms when this could be done without losing meaning. Further, some parts of the text have been completely rewritten to make them easier to understand, such as the entire journal selection procedure paragraph in the Material and methods section. Please see the track-changed document for all readability improvements in the manuscript.</p><p>In addition to the revisions detailed above requested by the reviewers, we identified three additional issues with the article:</p><p>There was a typo in the FRE calculation of a scalar in the analysis code. The part “1.015 * words/sentences” was incorrectly set to 1.1015. This has led to a very slight increase in all FRE scores when fixed. This change has had no effect on the observed trend. However, the sentence “In other words, more than a quarter of scientific abstracts now have a readability considered beyond college graduate level English.” (Discussion, first paragraph) has been changed to “In other words, more than a fifth of scientific abstracts now have a readability considered beyond college graduate level English.”</p><p>The selection criteria state that 12 journals from each field were included. However, for the field Immunology, only 11 journals had been included by mistake. The Journal “Brain Behav Immun” has now been added. This has increased the number of abstracts from 707,452 to 709,577 and all values reported in the article have been updated accordingly. This includes a new training and verification set for the “general science jargon” analysis, for which there are now 2,138 general jargon words instead of 2,140 previous ones. These changes have not led to any difference in the interpretation of the results.</p><p>We noticed that the language parameters for the TreeTagger software used for preprocessing differed slightly between Linux and Windows versions. Previously the full text analysis had been run on Windows and the abstract analysis on Linux. The full text analysis has now also been run on Linux. This has led to minor differences in readability scores for the full text analysis. These minor differences have no impact on the interpretation of the results. We have also noted relevant package version numbers and the operating system used in the Material and methods section.</p><p>In sum these three changes have no impact on the conclusions drawn from the overall analysis. They however ensure that the analysis is more correct and easier to reproduce.</p></body></sub-article></article>
