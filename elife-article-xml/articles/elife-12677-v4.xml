editing, imaging, and regulating eukaryotic genomes. However, our understanding of how to select single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that mediate efficient Cas9 activity is incomplete, as we lack insight into how chromatin impacts Cas9 targeting. To address this gap, we analyzed large-scale genetic screens performed in human cell lines using either nuclease-active or nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9). We observed that highly active sgRNAs for Cas9 and dCas9 were found almost exclusively in regions of low nucleosome occupancy. In vitro experiments demonstrated that nucleosomes in fact directly impede Cas9 binding and cleavage, while chromatin remodeling can restore Cas9 access. Our results reveal a critical role of eukaryotic chromatin in dictating the targeting specificity of this transplanted bacterial enzyme, and provide rules for selecting Cas9 target sites distinct from and complementary to those based on sequence properties.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12677.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12677.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12677.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many bacteria have a type of immune system known as CRISPR that can target and cut foreign DNA to protect it against viruses. Recently, the CRISPR system was adapted to allow scientists to easily manipulate the genome of humans and many other organisms. However, unlike the loosely organized DNA found in bacteria, the DNA that makes up the human genome is tightly packed and wrapped around complexes of proteins to form structures called nucleosomes. It was not clear whether the CRISPR system was able to effectively target the stretches of DNA in a nucleosome.</p><p>In 2013, researchers developed a modified version of CRISPR, known as CRISPR interference, to block gene activity and in 2014 used it to systematically repress many of the genes in the human genome. Now, Horlbeck, Witkowsky et al. – who include several of the researchers from the 2014 work – have analyzed existing data for a specific type of human cell grown in the laboratory and found that CRISPR interference activity was strongest in certain areas around the start of each gene. However, CRISPR interference was much weaker in other areas of genes that coincided well with stretches of DNA that are known to often be bound by nucleosomes. Nucleosomes also appeared to block CRISPR editing, although the effects were less pronounced.</p><p>Horlbeck, Witkowsky et al. then directly tested whether nucleosomes could prevent the CRISPR system from binding or modifying the DNA. When the individual components were mixed in test tubes, the CRISPR system could readily target “naked” DNA. However, it could not access nucleosome-bound DNA, unless an enzyme that can move nucleosomes along the DNA in the human genome was also added to the mix. These findings suggest one way that CRISPR can manipulate much of the human genome despite the widespread presence of nucleosomes. Future work will now aim to develop computational methods that take the positions of nucleosomes into account when picking DNA sites to target with CRISPR.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

(clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats) prokaryotic adaptive immune systems have yielded transformative tools for manipulating eukaryotic genomes. Most notably, the CRISPR-associated Cas9 protein from <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, together with a single chimeric guide RNA (sgRNA), provides a programmable endonuclease that has revolutionized our ability to edit genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</xref>). Cas9 has been further modified to a nuclease-dead form (dCas9) to provide a programmable DNA-binding protein that can be fused to effector domains, making it possible to turn on or off targeted genes, mark specific genomic loci with fluorescent proteins, or alter epigenetic marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maeder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hilton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kearns et al., 2015</xref>). A central challenge in implementing these tools is identifying effective and specific sgRNAs. While much of the effort to define relevant rules has focused on the sequence of the target site and sgRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doench et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2015</xref>), these only partially predict Cas9 activity and suggest that additional determinants likely exist.</p><p>Chromatin structure may represent a key parameter governing Cas9 efficacy in eukaryotic cells. CRISPR evolved in archea and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>) and is likely not optimized to explore and modify large, chromatin-bound eukaryotic genomes, a hypothesis supported by several studies that point to a correlation between rates of DNA binding and cleavage in regions of open chromatin as measured by DNase I hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, recent single-molecule imaging studies have shown that dCas9 explores euchromatin more frequently than it does heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knight et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that nucleosomes, the basic unit of chromatin structure, are an important impediment to Cas9 recognition. Here, we addressed this hypothesis in vivo by leveraging large datasets collected from over 30 sgRNA tiling and genome-scale genetic screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>). We found that regions of high nucleosome occupancy in vivo, as determined by MNase-seq (micrococcal nuclease sequencing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Valouev et al., 2011</xref>), were strongly depleted of highly active sgRNAs for CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2014</xref>) and nuclease-active Cas9. We complemented these results with in vitro experiments demonstrating that formation of a nucleosome provides a direct and profound block to dCas9 binding and Cas9 cleavage. Despite this strong barrier to Cas9 activity, we found that addition of a chromatin remodeling enzyme to chromatinized DNA in vitro can restore Cas9 access to nucleosomal DNA, highlighting one route by which CRISPR may still be able to modify chromatin in vivo. Our results reveal a fundamental aspect of the mechanism by which this transplanted bacterial enzyme interacts with eukaryotic chromatin, and provide a new dimension for selecting highly active sgRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CRISPRi activity is periodic and out-of-phase with nucleosome positioning</title><p>In order to study the features of chromatin that affect CRISPRi activity, we integrated data from whole-genome screens testing for a wide range of phenotypes performed with a previously described CRISPRi library targeting each gene with ~10 sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>). We selected 30 screens performed in the cell line K562 expressing dCas9-KRAB (ML, BA, BB, CYP, MK, YC, JF, and JN, personal communication) and set a threshold for high-confidence hit genes, which allowed us to assess the relative strength of phenotypes for the sgRNAs targeting these genes. Specifically, we analyzed 18,380 sgRNAs targeting 1539 genes, and generated 'activity scores' by normalizing sgRNA phenotypes to the average of the 3 sgRNAs with the strongest phenotypes for each gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To assess how CRISPRi activity varies with respect to the transcription start site (TSS), we plotted the average sgRNA activity score as a function of distance to the FANTOM-annotated TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forrest et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This analysis revealed a robust, periodic pattern of activity, with peaks at ~190 bp intervals relative to the TSS. This periodicity was highly reminiscent of patterns previously described for nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang and Pugh, 2009</xref>). Indeed, analysis of K562 MNase-seq data from the ENCODE consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Valouev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>) revealed that the average nucleosome signal was strongly anti-correlated with CRISPRi activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that high nucleosome occupancy leads to low CRISPRi activity.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12677.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CRISPRi activity anti-correlates with nucleosome occupancy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Workflow for generating CRISPRi activity scores from pooled genetic screens.

However, not all sgRNAs targeting sites with low nucleosome occupancy were highly active, matching previous findings that sgRNA and target DNA sequence features also influence efficiency of the CRISPR system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doench et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). To exclude the possibility that differences in sequence features alone between nucleosome-bound and -free regions could explain the periodicity of CRISPRi activity (rather than the presence of nucleosomes per se), we performed linear regression using MNase signal, sgRNA length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>), and a validated sgRNA sequence scoring algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doench et al., 2014</xref>). We found that each parameter individually correlated with sgRNA activity (p&lt;10<sup>-58</sup> for each; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Importantly, correction for sequence and length features had minimal impact on the ability of the MNase signal to predict CRISPRi activity (p&lt;10<sup>-85 </sup>after correction). Indeed, a linear fit of all three features provided a still stronger correlation (p&lt;10<sup>-221</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, far right column), suggesting that incorporating nucleosome occupancy in future sgRNA design algorithms could significantly improve predictive value. We have recently developed a comprehensive algorithm for predicting highly active CRISPRi sgRNAs that, by accounting for nucleosome occupancy, higher order sequence features, and non-linear relationships in these parameters, shows even greater correlation with this dataset that was already enriched for active sgRNAs using our original CRISPRi library design principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>) (cross-validation R<sup>2</sup>=0.32; Horlbeck et al., manuscript in preparation).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Nuclease-active Cas9 activity anti-correlates with nucleosome occupancy</title><p>In order to generate a dataset for evaluating the effect of nucleosome positioning on nuclease-active Cas9 in K562 cells, we took advantage of our previously described library densely tiling sgRNAs in 10kb windows around the TSS of 49 genes known to modulate susceptibility to the toxin ricin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassik et al., 2013</xref>) and tested Cas9-expressing cells for resistance or sensitivity to ricin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

For example, (d)Cas9 may bind or cut equally well in nucleosome-bound and un-bound regions, but may exert the observed modulation of gene expression through interference with transcriptional pausing, splicing, regulatory looping, or binding of important regulatory factors, processes which also correlate with nucleosome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jonkers and Lis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Denisov et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Naftelberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Segal and Widom, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tilgner and Guigó, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thurman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hsieh et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether (d)Cas9 activity is indeed directly affected by the presence of nucleosomes, we turned to a purified in vitro reconstituted system. Mouse histones were recombinantly expressed, purified, and assembled into a nucleosome using 147bp of the Widom 601 positioning sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lowary and Widom, 1998</xref>). Conveniently, the 601 sequence contains numerous NGG protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) required for Cas9 recognition, spanning the full length of the DNA at different helical positions, allowing us to test the effects of position and solvent accesibility within the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We first tested the ability of Cas9 to cleave nucleosomal DNA. We pre-loaded purified Cas9 (histidine tagged and HaloTagged) with in vitro transcribed sgRNA, then introduced either naked 601 DNA or that same DNA assembled into a nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Fluorescent labeling of the DNA allowed us to visualize the cleavage products on a denaturing Urea-PAGE gel. In agreement with our in vivo data, the nucleosome protected its DNA from cleavage by Cas9, and complete protection from cleavage was observed to be independent of target position within the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). While our manuscript was under review, a study by Hinz and colleagues reported a similar in vitro finding that Cas9 nuclease activity is inhibited within the nucleosome but not at adjacent linker sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hinz et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, previous single-molecule and biochemical studies have established that nucleosomal DNA undergoes transient unwrapping or breathing at the entry and exit sites, creating a gradient of accessibility along the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Widom, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luger and Hansen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choy and Lee, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tomschik et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Polach and Widom, 1995</xref>). This property is often credited for the observed position-dependent binding patterns of many transcription factors and DNA-binding proteins. Interestingly, our data suggests that the cleavage activity of Cas9 in vitro is not detectably influenced by this effect, although less stable nucleosomes than the Widom 601 nucleosome or target sites closer to the nucleosome edge may exhibit more breathing and thus more accessibility than those tested here.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12677.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cas9 nuclease activity is blocked by the presence of a nucleosome in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the experimental setup for in vitro cleavage assays.

Additionally, the first step in binding, PAM recognition, may be governed by helical location within the nucleosome as well as its proximity to the more dynamic ends. Histones make contacts with the DNA at every helical turn, thus a PAM may fall on the outside of the nucleosome, exposing it to solvent, or on the inside at the DNA-histone interface.

Given the extent of overlapping densities in the two structures, it seems unlikely that the histones and Cas9 could co-occupy the same piece of DNA. Additionally, it may be important to note that unlike other DNA binders such as transcription factors, binding by Cas9 constitutes melting of target DNA, which may pose an additional barrier to binding on a nucleosome. This hypothesis leaves two possible outcomes of targeting Cas9 to nucleosomal DNA: either Cas9 is capable of displacing histones in order to engage nucleosomal DNA, or it is excluded altogether.

Upon addition of yChd1, we observed a shift toward lower molecular weight bands, indicative of dimished protection at HaeIII sites while still maintaining an overall chromatinized state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12677.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Nucleosomes within chromatinized DNA can block cleavage by Cas9, but a chromatin remodeling factor can restore Cas9 access.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the experimental setup.

A panel of unique restriction enzyme sites spanning the 601 sequence were incubated with either the supercoiled plasmid, or the chromatinized plasmid. Cleavage was stopped, and protein was removed by incubation with proteinase K followed by Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation.

Before addition of the remodeler to our chromatinized plasmid, we found that sites within the 601 nucleosome were strongly protected from cleavage by Cas9, consistent with our mononucleosome results (Figure 5E-G, PAM sites without remodeler). However, when the 601 nucleosome was remodeled by yChd1, as indicated by a loss of protection from restriction enzyme cleavage (approaching protection levels similar to those in the linker region), Cas9 cleavage efficiency was restored to around 80% of the corresponding naked plasmid control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5E–G</xref>). Notably, the percent protection at the EcoRI site adjacent to the positioned nucleosome did not decrease upon addition of yChd1, demonstrating that the decrease in protection along the 601 sequence was mediated by the nucleosome displacement activity of yChd1 rather than by a non-specific effect on cleavage efficiency. While our data with the chromatinized plasmid system confirm our findings that a well-positioned nucleosome provides a profound block to Cas9 cleavage, our further finding that chromatin remodeling restores access to nucleosomal DNA provides one potential mechanism by which Cas9 may efficiently modify broad portions of eukaryotic genomes. This plasmid model could be further exploited to assay the activity of Cas9 at nucleosome-free and boundary sites, and thus derive biophysical parameters governing Cas9-chromatin interactions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite its swift success as a repurposed tool for gene editing, imaging, and transcription modulation, the ability of the prokaryotic CRISPR/Cas9 system to effectively navigate eukaryotic chromatin has remained poorly understood. Here, we show that the nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin, poses a strong barrier to Cas9, both in vitro and in vivo. By masking ~147 bp of DNA, the nucleosome effectively reduces the size of the eukaryotic genome available to Cas9. Previous studies using ChIP-seq to assay Cas9 binding have shown that off-target binding at PAM plus seed sequences more frequently occurs in regions of open chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Geen et al., 2015</xref>). Our data expand upon these findings to show that the discrete pattern of nucleosome organization is able to modulate the efficiency of Cas9 binding and cleavage at on-target sites. The practical implications of these observations are underscored by our finding that accounting for nucleosome occupancy offers a significant improvement in predictive power for sgRNA design.</p><p>While our data show that nucleosomes strongly protect their DNA from Cas9 binding and cleavage in vitro, their organization in cells is not static. Transient displacement of nucleosomes occurs during replication, remodeling, and transcription. By adding the chromatin remodeling enzyme yChd1 to nucleosomes in vitro, we demonstrate that this displacement can in fact restore Cas9 access to DNA. However, despite brief exposure of nucleosomal DNA during remodeling and various other cellular processes, we still observe a clear anti-correlation between Cas9 activity and nucleosome occupancy in vivo, suggesting that the barrier to Cas9 target recognition exists even in a cellular environment. Indeed, the balance between nucleosome disruption, turnover, and repositioning in the cell leads to the average level of occupancy and positioning at each site observed by MNase-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Valouev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang and Pugh, 2009</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that it is likely the overall effect of this average nucleosome positioning that leads to the observed anti-correlation with Cas9/sgRNA activity.</p><p>Additionally, it is important to note that there is likely a fundamental difference between applications that use dCas9 versus nuclease-active Cas9. Knock-down of transcription by CRISPRi likely requires persistent binding by dCas9 to continually block transcription, and would be largely ineffective during S-phase when transcription is globally shut down. In contrast, to make a genomic edit, Cas9 must succeed in cleaving DNA only once, and could potentially take advantage of nucleosome turnover during replication. The role these differences play in the dependence of Cas9 on nucleosome position is still not clear. We expect, however, that nucleosome position and occupancy will be of particular concern to applications that use the nuclease-dead Cas9 and require sustained binding. Future investigations into the role of cell cycle and nucleosome disruption may provide an additional piece to our understanding of the mechanism of Cas9 in eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, nucleosome organization represents only one aspect of eukaryotic chromatin, and thus, our results contribute a first step in understanding and exploiting how chromatin affects Cas9 activity to enable more sophisticated and precise rules for targeting Cas9.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Analysis of CRISPRi sgRNA activity</title><p>The K562 dCas9-KRAB-BFP cell line was obtained from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>) and had been constructed from K562 cells obtained from ATCC.

Most screens were conducted in duplicate, and sgRNA phenotypes from the duplicates were averaged. To determine hit genes, each gene was given an effect size (average of strongest 3 sgRNA phenotypes by absolute value) and a confidence value (Mann-Whitney p-value of all ~10 sgRNAs compared to negative controls), and hits were selected using a score that integrates effect size and statistical confidence (| effect Z score * log<sub>10</sub> p-value | ≧ 20 in any screen). For genes with multiple TSS, each TSS was analyzed separately and the gene was assigned the highest score. Finally, sgRNA phenotypes were extracted for hit genes from the screen in which the gene scored as a hit and normalized to the average of the strongest 3 phenotypes to generate the 'sgRNA activity score'.</p><p>sgRNA positions were defined as the genomic coordinate of the 3’ G of the NGG PAM (all genomic coordinates referenced in this text are from hg19).

MNase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis) was resuspended at 200 units/mL in water and then disluted at 1:100, 1:500, or 1:1000 in a solution of 1X MNase reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.9 and 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> dihydrate), 0.1 mg/mL insulin, and 10% glycerol. Chromatinized plasmid assemblies in 1X MNase buffer were added to each MNase dilution. As a control, an equal amount of unchromatinized super-coiled plasmid was added to the lowest MNase dilution. Each reaction was incubated for 11 min at room temperature, then stopped in a solution with final concentrations of 20 mM EGTA, 200 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 20 mg/mL GlycoBlue (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 13.4 mg/mL Proteinase K (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Reactions wer Phenol/Chloroform/Isoamyl Alcohol extracted, ethanol precipitated, and run on a 1.3% agarose gel in 0.5X TBE. 3 μg of the 123 bp DNA ladder (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used as a size standard.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Restriction enzyme accessibility assays</title><p>Either chromatin assemblies or super-coiled plasmid with equivalent amounts of DNA were added to restriction enzyme master mixes for final concentrations of 1X CutSmart buffer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 6 ng/μL DNA, and 0.4 U/μL of the indicated restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs). Reactions were incubated for 1 hr at NEB recommended temperatures. Reactions were stopped in final concentrations of 15 mM EDTA, 0.75% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, and 15 mg/mL Proteinase K and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. DNA was extracted with Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl Alcohol and ethanol precipitated, then resuspended in 1X CutSmart buffer and linearized by digesting with 1 U/μL DraIII-HF (New England Biolabs) at 37°C for 1 hr. The full reactions were run on an agarose gel and quantified as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Chromatin remodeling assays</title><p>Chromatin remodeling assays were performed simmilar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Torigoe et al. (2013)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexiadis (2002)</xref>. Reactions contained 40 mM NaCl, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 25 mM Tris-Acetate pH 7.5, 10 mM Mg-Acetate, 1 mM DTT, 1.2 mM ATP, and 6 ng/μL chromatinized or supercoiled plasmid. For restriction enzyme accessibility, the indicated restriction enzyme was added at 0.5 U/µL. For Cas9 accessiblity, Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoproteins assembled as described above were added at 15.62 nM. A truncated version of the chromatin remodeling enzyme yChd1 was used spanning amino acids 118–1274, also referred to as yChd1<sub>ΔNC</sub> (gift of Dr. Ashok Patel and Dr. Gregory Bowman), and was added to the indicated reactions at a 0.2 μM final concentration. Reactions were incubated at 27°C for 1 hr, then processed as with the restriction enzyme accessibility assay above.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr. Karolin Luger, Pamela Dyer, and Dr. Uma Muthurajan for reagents and training in preparing and working with nucleosomes, and Dr. Ashok Patel and Dr. Gregory Bowman for the kind gift of yChd1.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Horlbeck, Witkowsky et al. deals with the effects of nucleosomes within eukaryotic genomes on the binding and activity of prokaryotic Cas9 proteins. Given the widespread usage of Cas9 and catalytically inactive dCas9 proteins to modulate metazoan gene expression, it is very important to understand how histone occupancy impinges on targeting of the Cas9 module. Previous studies have suggested that nucleosomes may block accessibility of sgRNAs and Cas9, but these involved limited numbers of sgRNAs and resulted in only in the generalization that Cas9 seems to best target regions that are, for example, DNaseI accessible.</p><p>This work tackles the topic head on, analyzing thousands of sgRNAs and MNase data in vivo, coupled with careful biochemical assays. The authors show unequivocally that the organization of DNA in a nucleosome impedes access of Cas9, irrespective of the orientation of the PAMs. The in vitro experiments are technically sound and support the conclusions. Additional strengths of this work include: 1) the very nice anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and sgRNA activity shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref>; 2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, where increased nucleosome phasing is shown to increase the positional dependence on activity of sgRNAs.</p><p>This finding is important, the data is clean and the manuscript well written.</p><p>However, the work does have several weaknesses that should be addressed prior to publication, as noted below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data suggesting that nucleosomes completely block both binding and cleavage would be extremely interesting if it were better documented. In particular, the authors should investigate how longer DNA sequences behave when assembled into nucleosomes, or to test short nucleosomal arrays.</p><p>For example, can the system 'invade' the nucleosome when the PAM is located right outside of the edge of the 147 bp that are protected?</p><p>As the data stands, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> lack a good positive control. It is important to show that a region of DNA outside the nucleosome can be bound and cleaved by Cas9 in this assay, to confirm that things are working as anticipated.</p><p>We recommend that the authors perform a few experiments with a longer DNA fragment containing the Widom 601 element (i.e. ~200 bp or so) or other sequence, and target a non-nucleosomal portion of this DNA with a sgRNA-Cas9.</p><p>Additionally, the 601 sequence is a bit atypical in its stability and 'rigidity', and this should be acknowledged.</p><p>2) Moreover, based on what is shown in the current manuscript, I am not sure one can conclude that 'breathing' on the edges of the nucleosome has no effect on sgRNA-Cas9 binding or activity. There are no sgRNAs targeting the far edge of the nucleosome, and the 2-3 that target the near edge are very poor at binding and cleaving naked DNA (PAM 1, 3, 4). If one were to calculate the 'effect of nucleosomes' as the ratio of binding or cleavage on naked DNA/ nucleosomal DNA, the PAM sequences on the edge would show smaller differences than those in the middle, which is not what the authors conclude. If the authors can't find a way to further probe the DNA farther away from the dyad, they should probably be cautious about what they conclude from this data.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref> the difference in sgRNA activity score is only significant for MNase signals between 0 and 0.75, with little or the opposite trend appearing as nucleosome occupancy becomes higher than 0.75. This raises a number of questions and makes me wish the authors had looked more closely at the sgRNAs that fall in regions with MNase signal between 0 and 0.75.</p><p>Is a trend apparent within the range of 0 and 0.75? This finding would be much more compelling if one could see a trend of decreasing activity across several intervals of MNase signal.</p><p>Or does the data indicate that a region needs an MNase signal near zero to be targeted well? This would important to note if true.</p><p>What are the numbers of sgRNAs in each bin? The figure or legend would benefit from a better designation of what N= for each group.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> makes the point that thinking about nucleosome occupancy improves one's ability to predict the effectiveness of a given sgRNA. However, the Pearson R2 values reported here are still very low, indicating that even when considering sequence, length and MNase signal, one still has very little idea of whether an sgRNA will work. Can the authors comment on why they think our predictive power is still so poor? Are there other components (histone modifications nearby, gene activity level) that the authors might comment on, or investigate that could also be of use in defining a 'good' sgRNA?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12677.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) The data suggesting that nucleosomes completely block both binding and cleavage would be extremely interesting if it were better documented.

While identifying the precise boundary between protected and accessible DNA is an interesting question, we feel this is outside the scope of this project, and will depend strongly on the sequence and environment of the nucleosome in question. In addition, the in vivo measurement of nucleosome position through MNase-seq captures the average nucleosome occupancy at a given site rather than reporting on fixed mononucleosomes, and this average occupancy is likely to explain our observation of differential Cas9 accessibility in vivo. We have revised the Discussion to clarify this point (second paragraph).</p><p><italic>As the data stands, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> lack a good positive control. It is important to show that a region of DNA outside the nucleosome can be bound and cleaved by Cas9 in this assay, to confirm that things are working as anticipated.</italic></p><p>Because the 601 sequence used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> assembles a minimal mono-nucleosome, there is no DNA outside the positioning sequence available to target. The naked DNA experiments provide some control for this concern as they show that indeed, Cas9 is working as anticipated, as it, controls for the sequence dependence of Cas9 cleavage. However, we believe that our new data provides a more complete control to address the reviewers’ concern. We show that in the context of a chromatinized plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we observe near-absolute protection of DNA along the 601 sequence, fully consistent with our previous in vitro results using a minimal mono-nucleosome. To modulate the accessibility of the DNA within the 601 nucleosome, we introduce a remodeler, yChd1. We observe that chromatin remodeling restores the accessibility of DNA to Cas9 at the same underlying sequences previously observed to be fully protected from cleavage. This result shows that the observed protection is due to nucleosome positioning and not another aspect of the experimental set-up (e.g., the buffer conditions).</p><p> <italic>We recommend that the authors perform a few experiments with a longer DNA fragment containing the Widom 601 element (i.e. ~200 bp or so) or other sequence, and target a non-nucleosomal portion of this DNA with a sgRNA-Cas9.</italic> </p><p>As above, we feel this concern can be addressed by our chromatinized plasmid and remodeling experiment but we now indicate in the text that this would be a valuable future direction (Results, last sentence).</p><p> <italic>Additionally, the 601 sequence is a bit atypical in its stability and 'rigidity', and this should be acknowledged.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this point and now address it in the text (subsection “Nucleosomes are sufficient to fully block cleavage by Cas9 in vitro”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Moreover, based on what is shown in the current manuscript, I am not sure one can conclude that 'breathing' on the edges of the nucleosome has no effect on sgRNA-Cas9 binding or activity. There are no sgRNAs targeting the far edge of the nucleosome, and the 2-3 that target the near edge are very poor at binding and cleaving naked DNA (PAM 1, 3, 4). If one were to calculate the 'effect of nucleosomes' as the ratio of binding or cleavage on naked DNA/ nucleosomal DNA, the PAM sequences on the edge would show smaller differences than those in the middle, which is not what the authors conclude. If the authors can't find a way to further probe the DNA farther away from the dyad, they should probably be cautious about what they conclude from this data.</italic> </p><p>This point is well taken. In targeting sites near the edge of the nucleosome, we were limited by the availability of PAMs with a corresponding 20bp target site in the 601 sequence. We have accordingly adjusted our conclusions in the manuscript (subsection “Nucleosomes are sufficient to fully block cleavage by Cas9 in vitro”, second paragraph). Nevertheless, we do express the ratiometric effect of nucleosomes as “% Protection” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> (now revised for clarity), and observe that all sgRNAs show greater than 95% protection regardless of their position relative to the dyad.</p><p>3) <italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref> the difference in sgRNA activity score is only significant for MNase signals between 0 and 0.75, with little or the opposite trend appearing as nucleosome occupancy becomes higher than 0.75.

We have adjusted the boxplot bins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> to better demonstrate the relationship between MNase signal and sgRNA activity. In all three cases, we do in fact observe a decreasing trend in activity between the 0 and 0.8 bins. As before, this decrease is most pronounced in the upper quartiles of the sgRNA activity distribution, consistent with our hypothesis that low nucleosome occupancy enables efficient targeting by CRISPR but is not the sole factor in determining efficiency. We have also added N values for each bin directly to the plot, along with Mann-Whitney p-values comparing each bin to the lowest MNase signal bin.</p><p>4) <italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> makes the point that thinking about nucleosome occupancy improves one's ability to predict the effectiveness of a given sgRNA. However, the Pearson R2 values reported here are still very low, indicating that even when considering sequence, length and MNase signal, one still has very little idea of whether an sgRNA will work. Can the authors comment on why they think our predictive power is still so poor? Are there other components (histone modifications nearby, gene activity level) that the authors might comment on, or investigate that could also be of use in defining a 'good' sgRNA?</italic></p><p>In conducting the analysis displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>, we used simple linear regression to test whether the observed relationship between nucleosome positioning and sgRNA activity was orthogonal to sequence features, and indeed found that each of these provided modest predictive power that was independent of the other variables. As these results are derived from screens using our CRISPRi v1 library, all sgRNAs are already pre-selected for several features – most notably distance to the TSS – which are strongly predictive of activity and in effect bias towards nucleosome free regions.</p><p>We have since used the CRISPRi sgRNA activity data generated for this study as training data for a comprehensive machine learning approach. The resulting sgRNA scoring model achieved a Pearson R2 of ~0.32, sufficient to call highly active sgRNAs with a Receiver Operating Characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) value of 0.81. Again, this result is super-imposed on our v1 library design rules; application of the scoring model to our ricin gene tiling dataset, which was not subjected to the v1 rules, achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.91. This approach differs from the linear regression shown here by accounting for non-linear relationships (e.g. MNase values as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> are not strictly linear) and by incorporating several other features (e.g. higher order sequence features, sgRNA secondary structure). However, we believe the development, characterization, and validation of this sgRNA activity model which led to the construction and testing of a v2 CRISPRi library, is beyond the scope of this study but have added references to this work in the revised manuscript (subsection “CRISPRi activity is periodic and out-of-phase with nucleosome positioning”, last paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
