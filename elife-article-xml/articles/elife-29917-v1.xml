To elucidate the central encoding of this visceral demand, multisite recordings were made within a putative pontine-cortical micturition circuit from the pontine micturition center (PMC), locus coeruleus (LC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during cystometry in unanesthetized rats. PMC neurons had homogeneous firing patterns, characterized by tonic activity and phasic bursts that were temporally associated with distinct phases of the micturition cycle. LC and cortical activation became synchronized 20-30 s prior to micturition. During this pre-micturition interval, a theta oscillation developed in the LC, the mPFC desynchronized and LC-mPFC coherence increased in the theta frequency range. The temporal offset between the shift in LC-mPFC network activity and micturition may allow time to disengage from ongoing behaviors unrelated to micturition and initiate specific voiding behaviors so that micturition occurs in environmentally and socially appropriate conditions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29917.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>How do we know when we need to find a bathroom? As the bladder fills up, it sends signals to the brain to say that it needs emptying. But before the brain sends a message back to the bladder muscles telling them to contract to release urine, it first triggers a change in behavior. By increasing our alertness and arousing our senses, the brain ensures that we begin to look for a place where it is safe and appropriate to urinate. Only when we have found such a place will the brain tell the bladder to empty.</p><p>Previous work has suggested that two brain regions play important roles in this process: the pontine micturition center (PMC) and its neighbor, the locus coeruleus. The PMC is thought to act as an on-off switch. When the bladder reaches a certain level of fullness the PMC activates, which tells the bladder muscles to contract. The locus coeruleus helps animals pay attention to important stimuli by making them more alert and energized whenever such stimuli are present.</p><p>By recording the activity of neurons in the brains of rats while also measuring the pressure inside their bladders, Manohar et al. show that the PMC and the locus coeruleus work together to coordinate behavior and bladder emptying. Filling the bladder causes neurons in the locus coeruleus to activate in synchronized waves. This helps the locus coeruleus communicate with the brain’s outer layer, the cortex, leading to an increase in sensory alertness and arousal. This all happens before the bladder reaches the threshold fullness that activates the PMC, explaining why behavioral changes occur before urination. Manohar et al. show too that PMC neurons also activate when the rat is not urinating, suggesting that the PMC is more than an on-off switch.</p><p>Healthy people experience the sensation of needing to empty their bladder well before the bladder is full, but people who do not receive these sensory signals may be unable to tell when they need to take action. This can lead to bedwetting in children and to incontinence in the elderly. Targeting the brain circuit that responds to bladder signals could lead to new treatments for these conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bladder</kwd><kwd>micturition</kwd><kwd>locus coeruleus</kwd><kwd>Barrington's nucleus</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>voiding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK102367</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zderic</surname><given-names>Stephen A</given-names></name><name><surname>Valentino</surname><given-names>Rita J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Foederer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zderic</surname><given-names>Stephen A</given-names></name><name><surname>Valentino</surname><given-names>Rita J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG052780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zderic</surname><given-names>Stephen A</given-names></name><name><surname>Valentino</surname><given-names>Rita J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neural and network activity within a pontine-cortical micturition circuit are finely coordinated with urodynamics to assure appropriate voiding behaviors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The physiological elimination of urine, micturition, must occur in socially appropriate and environmentally safe conditions. In some species micturition is integral to social communication, for example, with regard to sexual status and social rank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ralls, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Desjardins et al., 1973</xref>). These neurobehavioral aspects of micturition demand precise temporal coordination between bladder activity and the initiation of motor patterns that characterize voiding behavior. For example, bladder filling should increase arousal and shift the focus of attention before pressure reaches the micturition threshold so that ongoing behavior is suspended and voiding behavior is initiated prior to the passage of urine. A lack of coordination between voiding behaviors and micturition characterizes dysfunctional voiding syndromes, such as enuresis that can occur both in children and older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Torrens and Collins, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nevéus, 2017</xref>). This temporal coordination is performed by circuits that convey reciprocal communication between the brain and bladder.</p><p>The pontine micturition center (PMC) is central to a circuit that is positioned to coordinate neurobehavioral and visceral limbs of micturition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Valentino et al., 2011b</xref>). Through its projections to lumbosacral preganglionic neurons that regulate the parasympathetic innervation of the detrusor, the PMC is proposed to function as an all or none switch, whereby the neurons become activated at some threshold pressure and engage the descending limb that initiates bladder contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Groat, 2006</xref>). In contrast to our knowledge of how the brain regulates bladder function, there is a paucity of information on the bottom-up processing of bladder information that is necessary for the neurobehavioral limb of the micturition reflex. Human brain imaging studies using SPECT, PET and fMRI have guided our current thinking about the structures involved in this complex process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Griffiths, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Griffiths et al., 2009</xref>). However, these approaches have limitations with respect to temporal and spatial resolution. Using anatomical and physiological approaches, we described one circuit that is positioned to convey bladder information to cortical regions involved in executive function. We identified a population of spinal-projecting PMC neurons that are retrogradely labeled from both the lumbosacral spinal cord and the pontine noradrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Valentino et al., 1996</xref>). The LC has a widely distributed axonal network that extensively innervates the forebrain and particularly the cortex where norepinephrine serves as a neuromodulator of cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Swanson and Hartman, 1975</xref>). Selective pharmacological or optogenetic activation of LC neurons or activation using Gs-linked DREADDS is sufficient to produce cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) activation indicative of arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berridge and Foote, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vazey and Aston-Jones, 2014</xref>). Notably, LC neurons are activated by bladder and colonic distention and this is temporally linked to cortical EEG activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elam et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Page et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lechner et al., 1997</xref>). In addition to increasing arousal in response to salient stimuli, LC activation is thought to reset attentional networks to shift the focus of attention to salient stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouret and Sara, 2005</xref>). Integrating these findings, we proposed a model whereby increases in bladder pressure could activate PMC neurons that project to the LC and the impact on LC-cortical projections would increase arousal, reorient attention and promote the initiation of a voiding behavioral repertoire while suspending incompatible ongoing behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Valentino et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Valentino et al., 2011a</xref>). Thus, through collateral projections to the LC and spinal cord based on dual retrograde labeling, the PMC could coordinate visceral and neurobehavioral limbs of the micturition reflex.</p><p>To begin to test components of this model we recorded unit activity from PMC neurons and/or LC neurons along with local field potentials (LFP) from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) simultaneously with urodynamic endpoints measured during in vivo cystometry in unanesthetized rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29917.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PMC neuronal activity during micturition cycles in unanesthetized rats.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing proposed circuitry engaged during micturition and recording sites.

Single unit activity was recorded from 36 PMC neurons from three rats during in vivo cystometry. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> shows activity from three single units recorded on one channel in the PMC during two micturition cycles. Whether depicted as the raw waveform trace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) or rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), the pattern of PMC neuronal discharge was relatively homogeneous and this was true across all three rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). The PMC has been proposed to function as a switch such that neuronal activation results in micturition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Groat, 2006</xref>). Consistent with this, in all rats, PMC neurons discharged during micturition until bladder pressure decreased to zero and the bladder was empty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows the change in discharge rate associated with micturition for the individual cells shown in the example rasters. Most neurons increased their discharge rate and no recorded neurons were inhibited at this time. All PMC neurons also exhibited burst activity at different times with respect to micturition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This was particularly apparent within the 20 s period following micturition during which bursts averaging 28 ± 1 Hz frequency and 606 ± 66 ms in duration occurred (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A and C</xref>). These post-micturition bursts were sometimes associated with a very small, transient increase in bladder pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> asterisks). Notably, in all PMC cells similar bursts (28 ± 2 Hz, 432 ± 35 ms duration) occurred regularly during inter-micturition intervals when bladder pressure was low (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Burst activity was rare during the pre-micturition period (20 s prior to micturition).

Simultaneous local field potential recordings (LFP) in LC and mPFC demonstrate a shift from low frequency activity at baseline (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B1</xref>, 0–47 s) to a prominent theta oscillation in the LC during the pre-micturition period (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B1</xref>, 47–77 s). This was accompanied by a desynchronization of the mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A2, B2</xref>). Interestingly, although the mPFC LFP magnitude was small during the 30 s period prior to micturition relative to the preceding baseline interval, there was still evidence of a theta oscillation in the mPFC during this time as well (white arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, cf., red and black lines). This effect was consistent as indicated by the mean power spectra of LC and mPFC LFP activity generated from each of 3 rats recorded across 8 micturition cycles (3, 2, and 3 for the individual rats) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Thus, LC activity recorded from 60 to 30 s before micturition shifted from mixed low frequency activity to a prominent theta oscillation occurring 30–0 s before micturition. In concert, the mPFC power spectrum shifted from high amplitude, low frequency activity (0–5 Hz) to much lower amplitude oscillations and a decrease of power in all frequencies, characteristic of desynchronization. An increase in coherence between the LC and mPFC in the theta frequency characterized this pre-micturition interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This change in LC and mPFC LFP activity reverted with bladder emptying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29917.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Synchronization between LC and cortical network activity prior to micturition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A1 shows a ratemeter record of a single LC unit (bin size = 1 s).

Neuronal activity was relatively homogeneous both within the PMC and the LC. As predicted, PMC neuronal activity was temporally correlated with micturition. However, a novel finding was the consistent high frequency bursts of activity following micturition and the repeated patterns of similar bursts during the intermicturition interval when bladder pressure was low. These patterns suggest that the PMC is more than an on-off switch in the regulation of micturition. Importantly, the findings demonstrated a temporal offset between LC neuronal activation and micturition during which a theta oscillation develops in the LC, LC-mPFC coherence is increased and the mPFC becomes desynchronized. These changes in the LC-mPFC network activity may facilitate the initiation of voiding behaviors prior to micturition by increasing arousal and shifting attention towards visceral demands.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Caveats</title><p>The present findings should be interpreted with consideration of certain technical limitations. In vivo cystometry was used to monitor and regulate micturition cycles. However, it does not mimic natural micturition cycles, which would be longer in the absence of steady bladder infusion. Although the multiwire recording technique allows for sampling activity from multiple neurons within the same nucleus, the results are inevitably biased toward activity that the wires can record from and that can be reliably discriminated. We cannot rule out the possibility that certain neuronal populations in a nucleus were not sampled. This may be a particular problem for PMC which is neurochemically heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sutin and Jacobowitz, 1988</xref>). This is less of a caveat for the LC, which is relatively homogeneous in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aston-Jones et al., 1995</xref>). Only females were used in the study because the bladder surgery is somewhat easier. The surgery was relatively complex because of the need to electrophysiologically localize brain electrodes as well as to implant the catheter, so that we chose to use females. Therefore, there is a caveat that our interpretations may not extend to both sexes. However, we previously demonstrated the same temporal correlation between cortical activation and peak bladder pressure in male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kiddoo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rickenbacher et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PMC neuronal activity</title><p>Most previous studies of PMC neuronal activity with relation to bladder pressure were done in anesthetized rats or cats with the bladder distended under isotonic conditions such that reflex contractions would occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Willette et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tanaka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Groat and Wickens, 2013</xref>). Three general neuronal types were identified in these conditions, neurons that discharge before and during reflex bladder contractions, neurons that are inhibited during contractions and active between contractions and neurons that fire transiently at the beginning of the contractions. The majority of recorded neurons in those studies were of the second type. One study recorded activity throughout the pons and medulla during cystometry in the absence of anesthesia in the decerebrate cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sugaya et al., 2003</xref>). This study also reported neurons that were either activated, inhibited or unaffected during the contraction with the majority being inhibited. Notably, in that study the mapping of these neuronal types demonstrated that nearly all neurons that were inhibited during bladder contraction were ventral to the region corresponding to the PMC, whereas most neurons within the PMC were activated during bladder contraction.</p><p>The present study is unique in recording single unit activity from the PMC in the intact unanesthetized and freely moving rat during cystometry. PMC neurons recorded in this study were homogeneous in the temporal correlation of their discharge pattern with the micturition cycle and resembled the previously described excitatory neurons. Notably, the present results are consistent with recent studies using photometry to measure the calcium currents in genetically-identified CRF-PMC neurons in unanesthetized mice during cystometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hou et al., 2016</xref>). These studies demonstrated a signal that was most prominent coincident with and up to 10 s after micturition. The present unit recordings have temporal resolution to detect changes in discharge rates and patterns such as bursts, that underlie the encoding of information. The post-micturition burst was consistent across all PMC neurons. If this results in increased glutamate release, it could be a mechanism to assure complete emptying. However, CRF is co-localized with glutamate in PMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hou et al., 2016</xref>) and evidence suggests that CRF is inhibitory in this pathway and may counteract the excitatory effects of glutamate neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pavcovich and Valentino, 1995</xref>). Higher frequency bursts that favor neuropeptide release could be a mechanism for switching the function of the nucleus from one that facilitates active emptying to one that facilitates storage by countering detrusor contraction. Repetition of this high frequency burst during the intermicturition phases when bladder pressure is low would also be consistent with that. Future studies of simultaneous manipulation and recording of PMC neurons during cystometry would better address this question.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>LC neuronal activity</title><p>Rat LC neurons are relatively homogeneous in that they are all noradrenergic and have similar electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aston-Jones et al., 1995</xref>). A characteristic property of LC neurons of both anesthetized and unanesthetized rats is their activation by salient sensory stimuli of all modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981b</xref>). LC neurons are also activated by diverse physiological stimuli including hypotension and non-noxious distention of the bladder or colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elam et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elam et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Valentino and Wehby, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Page et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lechner et al., 1997</xref>). In the present study, LC neuronal recordings during in vivo cystometry in unanesthetized rats revealed an exquisite sensitivity of LC neurons in that they become tonically activated approximately 20 s prior to micturition and in most cases before the steady pressure rise to micturition threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Possibly, this is a response to bladder wall stretching rather than an increase in intravesicular pressure. The timing of activation of LC neurons and PMC neurons with respect to micturition argues against our hypothesis that PMC projections to the LC drive its activation by bladder stimuli. This was particularly apparent in the one case in which both LC and PMC neurons could be recorded in the same subject. However, because only a small subpopulation of PMC neurons project to the LC, it is possible that our neuronal sampling did not detect PMC-LC projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Valentino et al., 1996</xref>). Previous lesion studies provided evidence that LC activation by colonic distention was mediated by PMC but bladder distention was not examined in that study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rouzade-Dominguez et al., 2001</xref>). Another route by which the LC could receive bladder information is through the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG). Anterogradely labeled vlPAG fibers innervate both PMC and the rostromedial peri-LC and synaptically contact LC dendrites in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bajic et al., 2000</xref>). The PAG then could regulate both the LC and the PMC in response to bladder related stimuli. The apparent lack of temporal coordination between LC and PMC neuronal discharge could then be explained if they received distinct vlPAG afferents.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Coordination between the bladder, LC and cortical activity</title><p>The LC-norepinephrine system densely innervates the mPFC and modulates its activity and executive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnsten and Li, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnsten, 2011</xref>). Regionally selective pharmacological activation of the LC or activation using Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD) technology produces a desynchronization of the cortical EEG (an arousal response) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berridge and Foote, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vazey and Aston-Jones, 2014</xref>). Moreover, LC activation by certain stimuli is necessary for their ability to elicit cortical arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Valentino et al., 1991</xref>). This includes bladder distention produced by injection of saline in anesthetized rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Page et al., 1992</xref>). In addition to increasing arousal, the LC-norepinephrine system has been implicated in shifting attention towards salient stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>). The present results identified an important temporal relationship between LC activity, mPFC activity and bladder pressure, with LC and cortical activation being synchronized to occur approximately 20 s prior to micturition. The examination of network activity in the LC and between the LC and mPFC revealed that during this pre-micturition interval when LC neuronal activity is elevated, network activity shifts from low frequency oscillations to a prominent theta oscillation. At the same time mPFC activity desynchronizes as characterized by a decreased power in all frequencies but LC-mPFC coherence, specifically in the theta frequency, is increased. This network shift that is temporally offset from micturition may be a neural code to increase arousal and reset behavior prior to micturition so that voiding occurs in appropriate environments.</p><p>Taken together, the present results highlight the complex synchronization of pontine and cortical neurons with bladder afferent information that is required to maintain coordination between voiding behavior and urination. Just as normal bladder signals are relayed to the cortex, signals arising from bladder-related pathology could impact on cortical function through these same networks. Consistent with this, partial bladder outlet obstruction produces an abnormal urodynamic pattern that is associated with robust changes in cortical network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rickenbacher et al., 2008</xref>). This condition is characterized by frequent non-micturition contractions that are temporally correlated with persistent cortical theta oscillations. Selective lesion of LC-forebrain projections using the toxin, DSP-4, prevented the cortical changes without affecting the abnormal urodynamics. This underscores the importance of the LC-cortical network in communicating bladder status to the cortex and suggests that dysregulation of this network could be a prominent signature of underlying bladder pathology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Female adult Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were maintained in a temperature and light controlled environment (20°C, 12 hr light-dark cycle, lights on at 0700 hr) with food and water available <italic>ad libitum</italic>.

Surgery for implantation of an 8-microwire bundle electrode (NB Labs, Denison, TX) into the locus coeruleus (LC) was identical to that previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Curtis et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with an isoflurane-air mixture and positioned in a stereotaxic frame. Body temperature was maintained at 37.5<sup>o</sup> C by a feedback controlled heating unit. A hole (4 mm diameter) was drilled in the skull centered at 3.7 mm caudal and 1.2 mm lateral to lambda for approaching the LC. Additional holes were drilled to insert skull screws for fixing the microwire bundle electrode to the skull with dental cement.</p><p>Neuronal recordings with glass micropipettes (2–4 μm diameter tip, 4–7 MOhm) filled with 0.5 M sodium acetate buffer were used to initially localize the LC. These were advanced toward the LC with a micromanipulator. Neuronal signals were amplified, filtered and monitored with an oscilloscope and a loudspeaker. LC neurons were tentatively identified during recording by their spontaneous discharge rates (0.5–5 Hz), entirely positive, notched waveforms (2–3 ms duration), and biphasic excitatory–inhibitory responses to contralateral hindpaw or tail pinch. Trajectories where LC units were encountered with the glass micropipette for at least 400 μm (dorsal-ventral penetration) were targeted for implantation with the microwire electrode bundle (NB Labs, Denison, TX) consisting of 8 Teflon insulated stainless steel wires (50 μm diameter) that were gathered in a circular bundle (7–8 mm long) and cut to produce bare wire tips for recording. A ground wire from the electrode encircled a skull screw and was in contact with brain tissue through another hole drilled next to the anchoring skull screw. The multiwire bundle was attached to a Microstar head stage and connected to a 16-channel data acquisition system (AlphaLab; Alpha Omega; Nazareth Illit, Israel). Accurate placement was aided by recording neuronal activity through the multiwire bundle during the implantation procedure. After detecting LC activity, the multiwire bundle was affixed to the skull and screws with dental cement. The scalp wound was sutured closed.</p><p>Surgery was similar for targeting of the electrode into the PMC, which is just rostral and medial to the ventral LC. As for the LC, the PMC was first localized with a glass micropipette as previously described. First the LC was localized and then the micropipette was repositioned rostrally until LC activity was no longer encountered. The multiwire bundle was then repositioned 200 μm medial to this point.</p><p>Rats had an additional depth electrode (tungsten microelectrode, 250 μm diameter) implanted into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (+3.2 AP, −0.6 ML, −3.0 DV) for mPFC local field potential (LFP) recordings.

The catheter end, which had been previously cauterized and flared, was brought intraperitoneally and inserted into the bladder dome and sutured above the flare. The exposed catheter end was connected to a port that allowed infusion of saline into the bladder.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Experimental protocol</title><p>Three days after the bladder catheter implantation rats were placed into a cystometry chamber (Med Associates, St. Albans, CT).

Neuronal activity was recorded from PMC neurons and/or LC neurons and LFPs were recorded simultaneously through micturition cycles. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> illustrates points along the pontine-cortical micturition circuit at which recordings were taken.

The results show that the activity in the locus coeruleus precedes an increase in firing in Barrington's nucleus and the activity in the locus coeruleus drives asynchronous activity in the prefrontal cortex. Upon micturition the activity in the locus coeruleus declines dramatically. The firing of neurons in Barrington's nucleus drives micturition. In addition, there are bursts of activity in Barrington's nucleus following micturition. The work defines a sequence of events resulting in a key biological process that requires a focused attention and a satisfying outcome.</p><p>1) Using awake behaving animals is a key step in obtaining the results.</p><p>2) The presentation of the results is stepwise and clear.</p><p>3) The numbers of animals is small but the clarity of the results do not justify or require a large number of animals.

A strength of their work is the combination of neuronal recordings and bladder cystometry in awake animals, and their attempting to record multiple groups of neurons. A weakness of the paper is the lack of any experiment attempting to test their hypothesis that these neurons are in fact connected (that activity in one can be triggered or interrupted by manipulating the others) or that any of this activity influences behavior in the way they hypothesize at the end of the abstract. There are some uncertainties inherent to their approach, detailed below, which undercut the certainty expressed in conclusions throughout the text (see below).</p><p>More importantly, after comparing their results with previous examples of micturition-related unit activity in the dorsolateral pons (including results published from the same lab) I am not convinced that they recorded neurons inside the specific, tiny populations they claim to have stabbed with their electrodes. Finding LC-like activity and then targeting that region (or something ventral-medial to that region) as described in the methods did get their electrodes into the right ballpark, but from there, based on the histology and unit data shown in the figures, it does not appear that neurons in what they call Barrington's nucleus, or having any of the characteristics of a BN neuron (firing just before and during micturition, causing bladder contraction) were recorded in the &quot;BN&quot; unit group. Instead, some or most of the units labeled &quot;LC&quot; appear likely to represent neuronal activity of BN neurons. Showing electrode tracts from exemplary cases in neutral-red (Nissl) stained tissue is better than not showing anything, but it does not reveal the neurons that were recorded or in any way support the claim that any of them were part of the now-well-defined populations that the authors were attempting to record. Previous work from the authors used juxtacellular labeling (Rouzade-Dominguez et al., 2003) to reveal the location and peptidergic identity of neurons in this region, and newer molecular-genetic techniques allow definitive identification using Cre-conditional optrode stimulation/recording or calcium imaging. Lacking any of these more specific methods for cellular identification, suppositional labels like &quot;LC&quot; or &quot;BN&quot; are unwarranted -- these labels should be dropped, especially given that the only units with a BN/PMC-like pattern of activity (beginning prior to bladder contraction, increasing as bladder pressure rises, and then stopping ~once the sphincter opens and bladder pressure falls) were grouped as &quot;LC&quot;.</p><p>Another concern I had relates to the numbers of animals and numbers of units in each analysis. The animal N and unit n in certain analyses from the Results section through the Materials and methods was left a bit hazy, and should be clarified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29917.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This study provides novel and exciting insight into the hindbrain circuit activity supporting micturition in the behaving rat.

The figures have been redone as suggested. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, which had several parts was divided into two figures and a supplemental figure. The lettering on the axes have been made larger. The traces are now black on white and records of spontaneous rate have been added. A reason for not including the ratemeter records originally is that PMC neurons dramatically increase rates during bursts and rate plots don’t have the resolution to show the details of bursts or even that the cells show occasional tonic activity because it is relatively so low, i.e., the pattern and low firing rate activity is lost in the ratemeter record when there are short duration high frequency bursts. Therefore, we kept rasters and raw waveform traces. The raster in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is now black on white. The original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> was divided into two figures. The lettering on the axes was enlarged. We want to emphasize that our goal in most cases was to show as much data from individual neurons as possible rather than means because this underscores how firing rates and patterns were consistently affected by changes in bladder pressure in a particular nucleus.</p><p>Electrode localization. The terms Barrington’s nucleus (BN) and the pontine micturition center (PMC) have been used interchangeably to refer to the area in the dorsolateral pons containing neurons that project to the lumbosacral spinal cord which when electrically or chemically stimulated elicit bladder contraction. However, neurons in this region that are transsynaptically labeled from the bladder extend outside of the counterstained oval cluster that has come to be known as the BN. Given this and the comments of Reviewer 4 we replaced our reference to BN with the PMC and this is also consistent with the nomenclature used by Hou et al., (2016). Chronic recordings in unanesthetized rats require multiwire microelectrodes. A limitation with recordings from multiwire electrodes is that one cannot precisely identify the neurons being recorded. Unlike experiments in anesthetized head-fixed rats in which neurons can be recorded with glass microelectrodes filled with biocytin, one cannot juxtacellularly label neurons with wire electrodes and determine their identity later. And the limitation to recordings in anesthetized rats is that anesthesia confounds the micturition reflex so this experiment could not have been done using juxtacellular labeling. It is not valid to compare the characteristics of the CRF+PMC neurons recorded in the paper by Hou et al., (2016) to our PMC neurons for two reasons. Neural recordings made from electrodes in the Hou et al., (2016) paper were whole cell recordings done in slices and activity was evoked by current injection. The in vivo recordings performed during micturition in the Hou paper used fiber photometry which measures calcium transients, not action potentials. This type of recording does not detect rate or pattern and cannot detect bursts that we see in our electrode recordings. Nonetheless, their findings are notably consistent with our data in showing that the largest activation of PMC neurons occurs following (and not before) the peak bladder pressure for several seconds and this similarity is now highlighted the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>We have recorded from locus coeruleus (LC) neurons in anesthetized and unanesthetized rats for over 30 years and are familiar with the distinct electrophysiological characteristics of the neurons which we identify prior to securing the electrode. These are described in the Matierials and methods. During recordings in unanesthetized rats, LC neurons show a characteristic positive correlation with the arousal state as indicated by cortical electroencephalographic or local field potential (LFP) activity (Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981). This was an important aspect of our findings, where bladder pressure served as the eliciting stimulus. However, it can also be seen in our traces at other times, i.e., when LC discharge rate is low, cortical LFP activity is synchronous and of high amplitude and low frequency, consistent with low arousal state. When LC discharge is high, cortical activity becomes desynchronized (low amplitude, high frequency) characteristic of arousal. This is very characteristic of LC neurons and was observed in all of our LC traces. These electrophysiological characteristics coupled with the histology provide evidence that our LC recordings were indeed in LC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are some writing issues to fix which are detailed in the specific comments.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments.

However, in past studies in which we performed cystometry and cortical LFP recordings in unanesthetized male rats, we also demonstrated that cortical desynchronization preceded peak micturition pressure and micturition (Kiddoo et al., 2006; Rickenbacher et al.,2008).

We discuss how the data (with caveats) argue against the hypothesis that Barrington’s nucleus is signaling bladder information to the LC and this was important. As an alternative we speculate that LC activation prior to micturition may be through periaqueductal gray afferents. However, the examination of other afferents to the LC was beyond the scope of this manuscript and the subject of future studies. There is a well-established literature that the LC projects to the mPFC and modulates its activity. With regards to bladder related activity, we previously demonstrated that LC activation was required for cortical activation evoked by bladder distention in anesthetized rats (Page et al., 1992) and that is now mentioned in the Discussion section. We also discuss our previous study that provided evidence that the LC was necessary for the development of cortical theta oscillations in rats with partial bladder outlet obstruction (Rickenbacher et al., 2008). Along with this literature, our demonstration in the present study of the consistent temporal correlation between LC and mPFC activation during the micturition cycle, accompanied by increased LC-mPFC coherence at the time preceding micturition support the hypothesis that LC activation initiates arousal prior to micturition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More importantly, after comparing their results with previous examples of micturition-related unit activity in the dorsolateral pons (including results published from the same lab) I am not convinced that they recorded neurons inside the specific, tiny populations they claim to have stabbed with their electrodes.

To reiterate, our LC recordings were in the LC based not only on histological verification, but on the neuronal discharge characteristics in unanesthetized rats described by our laboratory and others (Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981). Importantly, BN neurons would not be expected to exhibit a regular tonic discharge rate in the absence of bladder pressure increases followed by an activation 20-30 s prior to micturition as was consistently observed in the LC neurons of this study. Conversely LC neurons do not go from being nearly silent to a 25 Hz burst of 600 ms duration like the neurons we indicate are BN neurons. This is not at all characteristic of LC neurons. Even when the bladder is mechanically distended to bring pressure up to 70 mm Hg (greater than in this study), LC neuronal discharge only increases to 50-100% of its baseline rate (Elam et al., 1986; Page et al., 1992). Finally, as reproduced above, the findings of Hou et al., 2017 using optical recordings from genetically-identified CRF+ BN neurons were consistent with ours by showing activation with the onset and following micturition, not 20-30 s before.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another concern I had relates to the numbers of animals and numbers of units in each analysis.
