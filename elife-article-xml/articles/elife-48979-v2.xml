The rotation is generated by the stator–rotor interaction, coupled with an ion flux through the torque-generating stator.

By analyzing the motor structures of wild-type and stator-deletion mutants, we not only localized the stator complex in situ, but also revealed the stator–rotor interaction at an unprecedented detail. Importantly, the stator–rotor interaction induces a conformational change in the flagella C-ring. Given our observation that a non-motile mutant, in which proton flux is blocked, cannot generate the similar conformational change, we propose that the proton-driven torque is responsible for the conformational change required for flagellar rotation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bacterial flagella</kwd><kwd>nanomachine</kwd><kwd>motility</kwd><kwd>spirochete</kwd><kwd>protein-protein interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI087946</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI132818</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Motaleb</surname><given-names>MD A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM107629</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In situ structural analysis of bacterial flagellar motor in the Lyme disease spirochete reveals novel conformational change driven by proton motive force.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many bacterial pathogens require motility to infect, disseminate, and cause disease in humans and other mammalian hosts. Among diverse motility machineries, the flagellum is the best understood among bacteria. The flagellum consists of a motor, hook, and long filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Macnab, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Terashima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg, 2003</xref>). The motor is a sophisticated nanomachine composed of a rotor, which is the rotary part, and a stator, which surrounds the rotor. The rotation of the motor is driven by the interaction between the rotor and the stator, which is powered by the proton or sodium gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sowa and Berry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Minamino et al., 2008</xref>). However, how the ion gradient couples the mechanical rotation remains elusive at the molecular level.</p><p>The stator has been extensively characterized in <italic>Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica</italic>, and several other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Macnab, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Terashima et al., 2008</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beeby et al., 2016</xref>). Each stator complex is composed of two transmembrane proteins: MotA and MotB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun and Blair, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kojima and Blair, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sato and Homma, 2000</xref>). MotA has a large cytoplasmic domain, which contains conserved charged residues that are critical for the interaction with the rotor-associated protein FliG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou and Blair, 1997</xref>). MotB has a large periplasmic domain that is believed to bind to the peptidoglycan layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chun and Parkinson, 1988</xref>). However, stator complexes in some motor are constantly exchanged with those in the membrane pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leake et al., 2006</xref>), resulting in the dynamic nature and variable assembly of the stator complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block and Berg, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blair and Berg, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reid et al., 2006</xref>). The assembly of the stator is mediated by ion flow in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tipping et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukuoka et al., 2009</xref>), as its disruption leads to reversible stator complex diffusion away from the motor. A conserved aspartic acid residue in the transmembrane segment of MotB (D32 in <italic>E. coli</italic> and D33 in <italic>S. enterica</italic>) is the predicted proton-binding site and plays a crucial role for torque generation and bacterial motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 1998a</xref>). It is thought that proton binding/dissociation at this residue triggers conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain of MotA to produce a power-stroke on the C-ring that drives flagellar rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kojima and Blair, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Many electron microscopy techniques have been deployed to visualize the stator complexes. Electron micrographs of freeze-fractured membrane showed the stator complexes as stud-like particles in <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, and <italic>Aquaspirillum serpens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Khan et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coulton and Murray, 1978</xref>). Recently, electron microscopy of purified PomA/PomB (a MotA/MotB homolog) revealed two arm-like periplasmic domains and a large cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yonekura et al., 2011</xref>). However, the isolated stator unit without its context is insufficient for determining how stator complexes are arranged in an intact flagellar motor. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has recently emerged as an advanced approach for visualizing the intact flagellar motor in a bacterial envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kudryashev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beeby et al., 2016</xref>). However, detailed visualization of stator units remains challenging in many bacterial species including <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. enterica</italic>, because the stator complexes are highly dynamic and wild type cells are often too large for high resolution cryo-ET imaging. In contrast, stator complexes have been observed in many intact flagellar motors, including spirochetal flagellar motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kudryashev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>) and polar flagellar motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beeby et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu et al., 2017b</xref>). Presumably, the stators in these motors either are not exchanged, or exchange occurs without disrupting the overall arrangement of the stator units. Nevertheless, previous structure images of spirochetal flagellar motors were relatively low in resolution, and thus insufficient for identifying the stator complexes and their interaction with other motor components in detail.</p><p><italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, one of the agents of <italic>Lyme</italic> disease, is the model system for understanding unique aspects of spirochetes. The flagella in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> are enclosed between the outer membrane and the peptidoglycan layer and are thus called periplasmic flagella. The flagellar motors are found at both cell poles and rotate coordinately to enable the cell to run, pause, or flex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charon et al., 2012</xref>). The rotations of periplasmic flagella cause the cell to form a flat-wave shape to efficiently bore its way through tissue and viscous environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moriarty et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Motaleb et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Motaleb et al., 2015</xref>). Although the <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> motor differs in some aspects from the <italic>E. coli</italic> motor (e.g. the presence of a prominent ‘collar’ structure), genome sequence analyses as well as in situ structural analyses suggest that the major flagellar components are remarkably similar to those of other bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Studies of many flagellar rod mutants have yielded insights concerning rod assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, studies of <italic>fliI</italic> and <italic>fliH</italic> mutants have provided structural information about the export apparatus and its role in the assembly of periplasmic flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qin et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, membrane protein FliL was identified as an important player that controls periplasmic flagellar orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Motaleb et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, the collar (a spirochete-specific feature) was determined to play an important role in recruiting and stabilizing the stator complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moon et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> is a tractable model organism for studying the structure and function of bacterial flagellar motors at molecular resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we focused primarily on determining the structure and function of the stator complex in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. By comparative analysis of the motor structures from wild-type, stator mutants, and complemented strains, we localized the stator complexes in the spirochetal flagellar motor. Importantly, detailed analysis of the stator–rotor interaction revealed a novel conformational change that is necessary for transmitting torque from the stator to the C-ring.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MotA/MotB complex in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> is the torque-generating unit powered by proton gradient</title><p>Previous studies have shown that wild-type (WT) <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> cells were immobilized after being treated with proton uncoupler Carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), indicating that the proton gradient is used for flagellar rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Motaleb et al., 2000</xref>).

Noticeably, FliG proteins are relatively far away from the periphery of the MS-ring, and the C-ring appears to be disengaged from the MS-ring.

The additional shifts of the FliG proteins enables the C-ring to engage with the MS-ring at its periphery.

Spirochetes are unique in their evolution of periplasmic flagella, resulting in a form of locomotion effective in viscous environments such as host tissues. Spirochetal flagellar motors not only are significantly larger than those found in <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>S. enterica</italic>, but also possess a unique periplasmic collar structure. In this study, the relative stability and high occupancy rate of the <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> stator, together with the availability of key mutants, permitted the use of cryo-ET analysis to reveal the structure of the stator complex and its interactions with the rotor at high resolution, and thus provided new insights into the mechanisms underlying flagellar motor assembly and rotation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The unique structure of periplasmic flagella is critical to stator assembly</title><p>The periplasmic collar constitutes a large, turbine-like complex in the flagellar motor of spirochetes. This structure plays an important role in the assembly of periplasmic flagella, and hence, in determining cell morphology and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moon et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to the highly dynamic stator complexes in the <italic>E. coli</italic> flagellar motor, sixteen stator complexes in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> appear to be stably assembled around the collar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In the absence of the collar, the stator complexes were no longer visible in sub-tomogram averages, suggesting that the collar is important for assembling and stabilizing the stator in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moon et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, FliL forms additional periplasmic structures between the stator and the collar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Motaleb et al., 2011</xref>). Deletion of <italic>fliL</italic> resulted in cells with defects in motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Motaleb et al., 2011</xref>) and a flagellar motor with fewer stator units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that FliL also plays an important role in stator assembly in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. Together, both the collar and FliL in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> enable us to visualize the stator assembly and its impacts on the C-ring.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Impact of the proton gradient on stator and C-ring assembly in periplasmic flagella</title><p>The proton gradient is not only essential for flagellar rotation but also critical for assembly of the stators around the motor in <italic>E. coli</italic> and other model systems. By altering the putative proton channel in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, we found that the average number of stator units decreased significantly in the less motile <italic>motB</italic>-D24E (65% occupancy) and non-motile <italic>motB</italic>-D24N (45% occupancy) motors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, even in the non-motile <italic>motB</italic>-D24N cells, some stator units remained associated with the motor. This finding is different from the observations in <italic>E. coli</italic> and other model systems, in which stator units were found to dissociate from both Na<sup>+</sup>- and H<sup>+</sup>-driven motors when the ion motive force was disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tipping et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukuoka et al., 2009</xref>). The periplasmic collar in spirochetes may be the key reason underlying the difference, as deletion of genes that encode the proteins of the collar also disrupt the assembly of the stator units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moon et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>It has been proposed that proton flow through the motor triggers conformational changes in the stator that generate a power stroke to the C-ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kojima and Blair, 2001</xref>). However, it has been difficult to directly observe the conformational changes in the stator complex, partly because of the dynamic nature of the stator and its interactions with the C-ring. To visualize the conformational changes in detail, we took advantage of several unique features in the <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> flagellar system: 1) the large periplasmic collar and FliL help to recruit sixteen stator units to each motor; 2) a higher torque is presumably required to drive the rotation of periplasmic flagella and the entire cell body; 3) multiple motors located at the skinny poles enable high-resolution cryoET imaging; 4) recent advances in the genetic tools available for <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> enable specific mutations. As a result, we were able to observe a large C-ring conformational change resulting from stator assembly, proton transport, and torque generation. Importantly, by comparing the structures of ∆<italic>motB</italic>, <italic>motB</italic>-D24N, and <italic>motB</italic>-D24E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), we found that the conformational change of the C-ring from <italic>motB</italic>-D24N to <italic>motB</italic>-D24E (conformational change of the top portion and 3.4° tilt angle change) is much more significant than that from ∆<italic>motB</italic> to <italic>motB</italic>-D24N (no change of the top portion and only 1.2° tilt angle change). This indicates that stator-binding alone is not sufficient to induce the large C-ring conformational changes because stator complexes associated with the <italic>motB</italic>-D24N motor are not able to interact effectively with the C-ring and drive flagellar rotation, as proton conduction is blocked in the <italic>motB</italic>-D24N motor. Therefore, we conclude that the torque induced by proton flux is required for the C-ring conformational changes and flagellar rotation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Stator–rotor interaction and its impacts on flagellar C-ring and rotation</title><p>Our in situ structural analysis of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> flagellar motors enables us to propose a model for stator assembly and stator–rotor interactions. Before assembly of the stator complexes, the <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> flagellar motor is composed of the MS-ring, the rod, the export apparatus, the collar with 16-fold symmetry, and the C-ring with 46-fold symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The collar and the associated FliL protein provide 16 well-defined locations for the recruitment of stator complexes, which assemble around the collar and the C-ring. Stator complexes with blocked proton conduction only partially occupy the 16 possible locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). There is little conformational change in the C-ring at the stator–rotor interface. As proton conduction increases, more stator positions become occupied. Larger conformational changes of the C-ring occur with higher torque generated by stator complexes with increasing proton-conduction capability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48979.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic of stator assembly and stator-rotor interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Side and top views of stator assembly. A flagellar motor without stators is shown in the left panels. The WT motor with 16 fully assembled stators is shown in the right panels. Several key flagellar components are annotated: C-ring (green), export apparatus (EXP), collar (light blue) embedded in the inner membrane (IM), and hook. Two intermediates in stator assembly show partial occupancy of motors with blocked or attenuated proton conduction by the torque-generating units. (<bold>C</bold>) Top views of the C-rings from the motors shown in panels A and B. Without proton conduction (as shown in themotB-D24Nmutant), some stators (tan squares) interact with the FliG units (colored in dark green circles), yet there is relatively little conformational change in the C-ring. When protons flow through the stator channels, the torque generated by the stator induces conformational changes in the FliG units with which they are in contact (colored in light green). In themotB-D24E motor, fewer stator units are engaged, and they have a decreased proton flow. As a consequence, the deformations of the C-ring are not as large as in the WT motor, in which the 16 stator units assembled around the C-ring are rapidly conducting protons and generating torque. We propose that the increasing deformation of the C-ring observed with increasing number and activity of assembled stator complexes reflects conformational changes induced by the power strokes of the cytoplasmic MotA loops pushing against the FliGc domain.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48979-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In summary, high resolution in situ structural analysis of the flagellar motor from wild-type and mutant in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> has provided new insights into the assembly of torque-generating stators and their interactions with other flagellar components in both the periplasm and cytoplasm.

To reveal any conformational change with statistical significance, we analyzed over thousands of motors in each strain and then determined in situ motor structures at high resolution by subtomogram averaging. The C-ring structures are well resolved in the global averages, suggesting that the flexibility of the C-ring does not have severe impact on our in situ structural analysis and comparison. It is worthy to emphasize that the specific stator-induced conformational change of the C-ring has not been observed previously. To understand the mechanism underlying the conformational change, we specifically constructed a point mutant (motB-D24N), in which the MotB stator subunit is unable to conduct protons for torque generation. The conformation of the C-ring in motB-D24N is similar to that in Δ<italic>motB</italic>, suggesting that the torque generated by the stator is critical for the C-ring conformational change observed in the WT motor. Furthermore, we found that the C-ring has less conformational change in another point mutant (motBD24E), in which the MotB stator subunit is known to have lowered proton-conducting activity. Therefore, we strongly believe that the conformational change of the C-ring observed here is mechanistically relevant to the torque generated by the stator.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Use of the word &quot;essential&quot; in the title is inaccurate: nothing in the results reveals that these conformational changes are essential for flagellar rotation.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the title to reflect the key message of the manuscript: “<italic>Structural insights into</italic> flagellar stator-rotor interactions”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Materials and methods section, and descriptions of procedures used in the Results section, is entirely inadequate, and needs considerable elaboration, as follows.</p><p>– How did the authors identify 46-fold symmetry?

This needs considerably greater description.</p></disp-quote><p>To estimate the stator occupancy, we took advantage of a unique spirochete-specific “collar” and the striking difference between averaged structures of the motors from WT and a <italic>ΔmotB</italic> mutant. Specifically, the unique collar structure with 16-fold symmetry is present in the motors from WT and the <italic>ΔmotB</italic> mutant. It provides 16 spots to interact with stator complexes. There is no stator in the Δ<italic>motB</italic> motor. In contrast, 16 stator complexes are visible in averaged structure of the WT motor. Because the collar feature provides well-defined spots for stator binding, we were able to analyze each of the 16 stator-corresponding spots from each motor after initial alignment of entire motors. Through focused alignment and classification, we generated class averages. Among the class averages, some have stator densities and others have no stator density. Therefore we were able to estimate the stator occupancy in each motor from several different strains. Importantly, our estimation from the Δ<italic>motB</italic> mutant and WT matches well with our visual observation from the motor average structures of the Δ<italic>motB</italic> mutant and WT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There is a contradiction between the author's claim that the collar is likely &quot;a scaffold for assembling and stabilizing the torque-generating stator units&quot; and their observation that stator occupancy is a function of ion flux. The authors must clarify which they believe is stabilizing the stator units.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that both collar and ion flux are important for the assembly and function of the stator complexes. First, it has been well documented that ion flux is important for the assembly of the stator in <italic>E. coli</italic> and many other bacteria. We also showed in this manuscript that the stator occupancy reduced significantly in a point mutant motB-D24N in which the MotB stator subunit is unable conduct protons for torque generation. Second, the collar plays an important role in recruiting the stator complexes in <italic>Borrelia</italic>, which is supported by our recent study. Indeed, in several mutants lacking genes essential for the collar formation, both collar and stator are absent. Third, we showed in this study that stator complexes are still present in two point mutants (motB-D24N and motB-D24E). Together, our data suggested that the collar helps to recruit and stabilize stator complexes and ion flux is needed to generate the torque and to increase stator occupancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors suggest that their results show that proton flux is required for stator binding to the motor, but they do no experiments where PMF is manipulated; rather, all their results show is that amino acid point mutations change stator occupancy, which is considerably less conclusive than their stated conclusions. To be able to claim that stator occupancy is proton flux dependent I would argue that additional experiments using CCCP to dissipate the PMF are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>MotB contains a highly conserved aspartic acid residue (Asp32 in <italic>E. coli</italic>, Asp24 in <italic>Borrelia</italic>). Extensive studies in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> indicated that it is located inside a proton channel and plays an essential role in proton transfer through the flagellar motor. Importantly, a conservative mutation D32N in <italic>E. coli</italic> abolished motor function, and another conservative mutation D32E retained reduced motor function. Here we showed the conservative mutations (D24E and D24N) in <italic>Borrelia</italic> have similar motility phenotypes as those in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In addition, we provided direct evidence that the mutations not only altered the stator occupancy but also reduced or even abolished the PMF-driven torque and the C-ring conformational change.</p><p>To further support our model, we did additional CCCP experiments as suggested by the reviewer. CCCP has been shown to rapidly cause immobilization of flagellar rotation in many bacteria including <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> (Motaleb et al., 2000). CCCP-treated cells of wild-type <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> were immobilized within 15 min (Motaleb et al., 2000). The paralyzed cells retained their flat-wave morphology. The averaged motor structure from the CCCP-treated cells is similar to that from motile WT cells. The stator complexes remain attached to the collar and the C-ring. However, the C-ring conformation in the CCCP-treated motor is different from that in motile WT motor. In contrast, the C-ring conformation in the CCCP-treated motor resembles those in the motB motor or the motBD24N motor. These results from CCCP-treated motor further support that PMF-driventorque induces C-ring conformational change required for flagellar rotation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “CryoEM sample preparation”: more details on which grids used, approximate parameters of manual blotting, types of filter paper, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Our cryoEM sample preparation of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> has been described extensively in many papers (Liu et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2017).
