These parameters are controlled at the active zone and vary across synapses, but how such synapse specific control is achieved is not understood. ELKS proteins are enriched at vertebrate active zones and enhance P at inhibitory hippocampal synapses, but ELKS functions at excitatory synapses are not known. Studying conditional knockout mice for ELKS, we find that ELKS enhances the RRP at excitatory synapses without affecting P. Surprisingly, ELKS C-terminal sequences, which interact with RIM, are dispensable for RRP enhancement. Instead, the N-terminal ELKS coiled-coil domains that bind to Liprin-α and Bassoon are necessary to control RRP. Thus, ELKS removal has differential, synapse-specific effects on RRP and P, and our findings establish important roles for ELKS N-terminal domains in synaptic vesicle priming.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14862.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14862.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14862.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells in the brain communicate with one another at connections known as synapses: one nerve cell releases signaling molecules called neurotransmitters into the synapse, which are then sensed by the second cell. For the brain to work correctly, it is important that the nerve cells control when and how much neurotransmitter they release. Nerve cells package neurotransmitters into small packets called vesicles. These vesicles can be released at the so-called active zones of each synapse, though only a small subset of vesicles at a synapse are releasable.</p><p>Many proteins at the active zone control the release of vesicles to influence how nerve cells communicate with each another. ELKS is one of the proteins found at the active zones of nerve cells that release either of the two most common neurotransmitters in the brain: glutamate and GABA. Held et al. have now found that the ELKS protein affects the release of these two neurotransmitters in different ways in the two types of nerve cells. The experiments showed that the number of releasable neurotransmitter-filled vesicles was lower in mouse nerve cells that release glutamate when the genes for the ELKS proteins were deleted in these cells. When the ELKS genes were deleted in the nerve cells that release GABA, the number of releasable vesicles remained the same, though the vesicles were less likely to be released.</p><p>The fact that removing ELKS has different effects at these two types of synapses suggests that the active zone is not the same at all synapses. Furthermore, these results imply that ELKS is capable of fine-tuning the communication between nerve cells. Future experiments will address how glutamate- and GABA-releasing active zones differ at the molecular and structural levels. Ultimately, this will lead to a better understanding of how information is processed in the brain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14862.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14862.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>active zone</kwd><kwd>ELKS</kwd><kwd>presynaptic strength</kwd><kwd>release probability</kwd><kwd>readily releasable pool</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS083898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007429</institution-id><institution>Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Junior Faculty MeRIT fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000882</institution-id><institution>Brain Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Seed Grant, BRFSG-2013-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alice and Joseph Brooks Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Changliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Harvard Brain Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HBI Bipolar Disorder Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student fellowship, F31NS089077</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Held</surname><given-names>Richard G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lefler Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lefler Small Grant Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The presynaptic active zone protein ELKS provides synapse-specific control of the pool of readily releasable vesicles and release probability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Within a presynaptic nerve terminal, synaptic vesicle exocytosis is restricted to sites of neurotransmitter release called active zones. The active zone is a dense protein complex that is attached to the presynaptic plasma membrane and is exactly opposed to postsynaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Couteaux and Pecot-Dechavassine, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schoch and Gundelfinger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Südhof, 2012</xref>). At the active zone, a small subset of the synaptic vesicles are primed in close proximity to presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels such that the incoming action potential leads to neurotransmitter release with minimal delay. The proteins of the active zone control the size of this pool of primed, readily releasable vesicles (RRP) and the release probability of those vesicles in response to an action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaeser and Regehr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alabi and Tsien, 2012</xref>). Vesicular release probability, referred to in this paper as P, and RRP size together act to set synaptic strength, sometimes referred to as the synaptic probability of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stevens, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>). It is well known that RRP size and vesicular release probability differ across synapses, contributing to the generation of unique release properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Regehr, 2004</xref>). In the hippocampus, for example, excitatory and inhibitory synapses have markedly different properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kraushaar and Jonas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salin et al., 1996</xref>). The underlying molecular mechanisms that control RRP and P are still only partially understood, and it is not known what components of the release machinery account for their synapse specific control.</p><p>ELKS, RIM, Munc13, RIM-binding protein (RIM-BP), Bassoon/Piccolo, and Liprin-α proteins form a protein complex that defines the active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schoch and Gundelfinger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Südhof, 2012</xref>). This protein complex includes many additional proteins that are not active zone specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyken et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schoch and Gundelfinger, 2006</xref>). ELKS (also called Erc, CAST, and Rab6IP2) was identified as an active zone protein through its interactions with RIM and named for its high content in the amino acids E, L, K, and S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nakata et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Monier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ohtsuka et al., 2002</xref>). ELKS has known in vitro interactions with many active zone proteins and additional neuronal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It contains a C-terminal region that binds to the PDZ domain of RIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ohtsuka et al., 2002</xref>) and multiple coiled-coil stretches, which we have subdivided based on homology between the various vertebrate and invertebrate ELKS isoforms into four coiled-coil domains (CC<sub>A</sub>-CC<sub>D</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The coiled-coil stretches bind in vitro to Liprin-α (CC<sub>A</sub>-CC<sub>C</sub>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ko et al., 2003</xref>]), Bassoon (CC<sub>C</sub>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takao-Rikitsu et al., 2004</xref>]), and β-subunits of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (CC<sub>D</sub>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kiyonaka et al., 2012</xref>]). Vertebrate genomes contain two genes for ELKS, <italic>Erc1</italic> and <italic>Erc2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2002</xref>), whereas <italic>C.elegans</italic> expresses a single ELKS homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deken et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> expresses a protein called Brp with homology to ELKS in the N-terminal but not the C-terminal half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wagh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kittel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Monier et al., 2002</xref>). Vertebrate ELKS proteins are expressed as predominant, synaptic α-isoforms and shorter β-variants, which account for less than 5% of ELKS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaeser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, ELKS C-terminal variants determine RIM-binding: the B-isoforms are prominently expressed in the brain and contain the RIM binding site, whereas A-isoforms are expressed outside the brain and lack RIM binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaeser et al., 2009</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14862.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ELKS1α and ELKS2α are co-expressed at excitatory synapses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of ELKS protein structure.

Invertebrate studies offer mixed support to this hypothesis. Loss of Brp disrupts the T-bar structures at the fly neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kittel et al., 2006</xref>), but this function involves the C-terminal region of Brp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fouquet et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, <italic>C. elegans</italic> ELKS is not required for recruitment of other active zone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deken et al., 2005</xref>), but a gain of function mutation in syd-2, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Liprin-α homologue, requires ELKS for its synaptogenic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Relatively little is known about the role and molecular mechanisms of ELKS in neurotransmitter release at vertebrate synapses. Previous studies showed that ELKS1α/2α boost Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at inhibitory synapses, whereas ELKS2α has a regulatory, non-essential function in RRP at these synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaeser et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, at excitatory ribbon synapses of rod photoreceptors, ELKS2α/CAST may have a structural role to enhance synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">tom Dieck et al., 2012</xref>). These studies suggest the interesting possibility that ELKS may have differential roles in synaptic transmission between synapses. Thus far, ELKS functions have not been studied at small, excitatory synapses, the most abundant synapses in the vertebrate brain. Here, we establish that ELKS is prominently expressed at excitatory hippocampal synapses. In contrast to its roles in enhancing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and release probability at inhibitory synapses, ELKS1α/2α control the size of the RRP at excitatory hippocampal synapses. These data establish that removal of ELKS has differential, synapse-specific effects on RRP size and P: boosting RRP at excitatory synapses but enhancing P at inhibitory synapses. Using structure-function rescue experiments, we then determine the sequences within ELKS required for RRP enhancement at excitatory synapses. Surprisingly, RIM-binding sequences are dispensable for this function, but CC<sub>A</sub>-CC<sub>C</sub>, which include binding sites for Liprin-α and Bassoon, control excitatory RRP size. Together, these data show that ELKS selectively controls RRP at excitatory synapses through its N-terminal protein interaction motifs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ELKS1α and ELKS2α are enriched at excitatory hippocampal synapses</title><p>The distribution of individual ELKS proteins at excitatory and inhibitory synapses is not known. We generated ELKS2α specific antisera by immunization of rabbits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) and used this, in addition to an available ELKS1α specific antibody, to determine if either or both ELKS proteins are present at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We employed immunostainings for ELKS1α and ELKS2α in cultured hippocampal neurons and analyzed their distribution using confocal microscopy. Both ELKS proteins were present at excitatory and inhibitory synapses and we observed higher intensity staining at excitatory synapses compared to inhibitory synapses for ELKS1α and ELKS2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A recent proteomic study of release site composition found that overall differences between excitatory and inhibitory release sites are small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyken et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, however, ELKS1 and ELKS2 were modestly enriched at docking sites for glutamatergic vesicles, consistent with our observation. We next examined the distribution of ELKS relative to one another to determine whether levels of individual ELKS proteins correlate positively or negatively at excitatory or inhibitory synapses. Synaptic markers for either excitatory or inhibitory synapses were used to define regions of interest (ROI) and co-stained for both ELKS1α and ELKS2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

In all experiments, control neurons were genetically identical with the exception that they were infected with lentiviruses that expressed an inactive, truncated cre protein. We only analyzed cultures in which no non-infected neurons could be detected.</p><p>Using focal stimulation, we recorded action-potential evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and directly compared effects to inhibitory PSCs (IPSCs). Similar to the effect on IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), EPSCs were reduced to ~50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). At inhibitory synapses, removal of ELKS resulted in a 30% decrease in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx which led to a reduction in P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2014</xref>) and prolonged IPSC rise times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When we examined the EPSC rise times, there was no effect of ELKS1α/2α cDKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), suggesting that ELKS may operate differently at excitatory synapses. To determine whether the deficit in excitatory transmission was presynaptic, we recorded miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in the presence of TTX. mEPSC frequency was reduced by ~50%, but there was no change in mEPSC amplitude, rise time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), or decay kinetics (control τ = 5.727 ms, n = 16/3; cDKO τ = 6.321 ms, n = 15/3; p&gt;0.05). The number and size of excitatory synapses was also unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, ELKS1α/2α cDKO reduces release from excitatory presynaptic nerve terminals, but the mechanisms may be different from inhibitory synapses.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14862.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ELKS1α/2α control neurotransmitter release at excitatory synapses.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Sample traces and quantification of IPSC (<bold>A</bold>), AMPAR-EPSC (<bold>B</bold>), and NMDAR-EPSC (<bold>C</bold>) amplitudes and rise times in control and ELKS1α/2α cDKO neurons.

Although the hypertonic stimulus is non-physiological, this method has been used as a snapshot measurement of RRP in cultured neurons and has been insightful for genotype comparisons and for dissecting molecular mechanisms of RRP control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</xref>).

To control for this possibility, we conducted a series of experiments analyzing RRP size and P (as measured by PPRs) for inhibitory and excitatory transmission in the same cultures and matching sample size for all conditions. Both inhibitory and excitatory synapses had a reduction in action potential-evoked EPSC and IPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). At inhibitory synapses, ELKS1α/2α cDKO increased the PPR at low interstimulus intervals but had no significant effect on RRP size, consistent with a reduction of P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>) and with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, excitatory synapses in the same cultures showed no change in PPR but a reduction in RRP size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>). Notably, there was a small, non-significant trend towards a reduced RRP at inhibitory synapses in this experiment. To further rule out that there is a reproducible RRP reduction at inhibitory hippocampal synapses, we conducted a second experiment measuring RRP with a slightly different protocol as described in the methods section and used in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Again, no change in RRP was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

These data confirm our previous experiments and establish synapse-specific roles for ELKS in neurotransmitter release: at excitatory synapses ELKS1α/2α primarily boost the RRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), whereas at inhibitory synapses ELKS1α/2α mainly control action potential induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to enhance P (also see Figures 5 and 8 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14862.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Direct comparison of IPSC and EPSC phenotypes of ELKS1α/2α cDKO.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example traces (top) showing overlayed IPSC responses to pairs of stimuli at 10, 20, 100, and 500 ms interstimulus intervals.

We generated rescue constructs lacking N-terminal coiled-coils (corresponding to ELKS1βB) or the central coiled-coil region (△CC<sub>C</sub>). ELKS1αB and ELKS1-△CC<sub>D</sub>B were used as positive rescue controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). All rescue constructs were successfully expressed, albeit at variable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Compellingly, neither ELKS1βB nor ELKS1-△CC<sub>C</sub> rescued the RRP in ELKS1α/2α cDKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The lack of rescue could be due to either a local function of the deleted coiled-coil regions or to a role for these regions in localizing ELKS to synapses. We distinguished between these possibilities by assessing the localization of each rescue construct using confocal microscopy. Since ELKS1βB lacks the antigen recognized by our ELKS1 antibody we stained for either the HA tag included in all rescue proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or for ELKS1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). Synaptic expression of the rescue constructs ranged from 50–200% of wild-type levels of ELKS1. Importantly, all constructs localized to synapses. Thus vertebrate ELKS1 can be localized to synapses likely through multiple redundant interactions. While synaptic levels of rescue ELKS1αB were low, it rescued entirely. In contrast, ELKS1βB and ELKS1-△CC<sub>C</sub> both failed to rescue, but were expressed above ELKS1αB levels. Removal of ELKS reveals differential impairments of RRP and P at excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To test whether such differential effects are also reflected in the ELKS sequences that mediate rescue at each synapse, we tested whether ELKS1βB, an ELKS isoform that failed to rescue the excitatory RRP, was sufficient to restore inhibitory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). ELKS1βB was able to rescue action-potential evoked IPSC amplitudes, establishing that ELKS’ role in controlling P at inhibitory synapses does not require the N-terminal coiled-coil regions that control the excitatory RRP. Together, these experiments establish that the N-terminal coiled-coil sequences of ELKS1α are necessary for ELKS' role in enhancing the RRP at excitatory synapses, but not necessary for localizing ELKS to synapses.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14862.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>N-terminal coiled-coil domains of ELKS control RRP size at excitatory synapses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of ELKS1 rescue constructs; CC<sub>A-D</sub>: coiled-coil regions A-D, B: PDZ-binding motif; H: human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag, black bar: antigen recognized by the ELKS1α antibody (E-1) used in figure supplement 1C.

They extend beyond previous understanding of the role of ELKS in supporting presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2014</xref>) and demonstrate that this is not the primary function across all synapses. Most current molecular models of active zone function imply that active zones operate essentially identically across synapses despite the notion that the parameters they control, RRP and P, vary greatly between different types of synapses. Thus far, this assumption has proven principally true for genetic analyses of active zone protein function. For example, it is widely accepted that Munc13 is required at all synapses to prime vesicles and RIMs anchor and activate Munc13 to support priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews-Zwilling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calakos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>). Our findings are a starting point for the dissection of synapse-specific architecture and function of the active zone.</p><p>One possibility to explain synapse-specific roles is that ELKS1α and ELKS2α account for different functions, and that they are localized to specific subsets of synapses. Such differences have been observed for roles of Munc13-1 and bMunc13-2 in short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rosenmund et al., 2002</xref>). Our data make this possibility unlikely in the case of ELKS, because there is a strong positive correlation between ELKS1α and ELKS2α levels at all synapses. Furthermore, no ELKS isoform-specific protein interactions are described in the literature, and the interaction sequences are generally well conserved between ELKS1α and ELKS2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Monier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Another possibility is that interaction partners of ELKS that mediate RRP control are distributed in a synapse specific fashion, and ELKS protein interactions at the active zone may be engaged differentially depending on the presence of specific interacting proteins. This model is supported by the observation that the sequence requirements for rescue of the excitatory RRP or the IPSC are different. ELKS interacts in vitro with many active zone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ohtsuka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schoch and Gundelfinger, 2006</xref>). We find that ELKS N-terminal, but not C-terminal, sequences are required for RRP control. These N-terminal sequences have been shown to bind to Liprin-α via CC<sub>A</sub>-CC<sub>C</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ko et al., 2003</xref>), to Bassoon via CC<sub>C</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takao-Rikitsu et al., 2004</xref>), and they may mediate binding to Rab6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Monier et al., 2002</xref>). Because constructs including CC<sub>C</sub> but lacking CC<sub>A/B</sub> localize to synapses but do not to rescue, one possible explanation is that Liprin-α binding is required for ELKS function in controlling the excitatory RRP. Vertebrate genomes contain four genes encoding Liprin-α, but it is not known whether Liprin-α isoforms are differentially distributed to specific active zones. In fact, it is currently not clear for any of the vertebrate Liprin-α isoforms whether there is a tight association with the presynaptic active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zurner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spangler et al., 2011</xref>). Functional roles of vertebrate Liprin-α in synaptic transmission are not well understood, but a recent study supports presynaptic roles for Liprin-α2 at hippocampal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spangler et al., 2013</xref>). In invertebrates, Liprin-α/syd-2 has synaptogenic activities, and effects of a gain of function mutation in syd-2 require ELKS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patel et al., 2006</xref>), indicating important synaptic roles for Liprin-α/ELKS interactions. Thus, these previous studies are consistent with the hypothesis that ELKS controls RRP through Liprin-α. Nevertheless, it is possible that binding to Bassoon, Rab6, or unknown proteins mediate the role of ELKS in enhancing RRP. A recent proteomic analysis of vesicle docking complexes revealed only modest differences in the composition of docking sites at glutamatergic compared to GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyken et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, however, Bassoon and ELKS were found to be enriched in glutamatergic synapses in this study, perhaps supporting a role for these proteins for promoting excitatory transmission in concert with one another. Furthermore, a recent study showed that Bassoon regulates release indirectly via RIM-BP through a specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel subunit, which could result in a synapse-specific roles for Bassoon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davydova et al., 2014</xref>). In summary, these studies provide support for the hypothesis that ELKS may operate with Bassoon or Liprin-α to promote release in a synapse-specific fashion.</p><p>Our studies also reveal that ELKS1α and ELKS2α are not required for active zone assembly and maintenance at hippocampal synapses, consistent with studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deken et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patel et al., 2006</xref>). At the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> neuromuscular junction, however, Brp is essential for the formation of T-bars. The ELKS homology of Brp is limited to the N-terminal half of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kittel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Monier et al., 2002</xref>), making it possible that such strong scaffolding functions are specific to Brp and absent in ELKS. Alternatively, an ELKS scaffolding function may not be detected in our experiments due to redundant scaffolding activities in other proteins, for example β-ELKS or RIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schoch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaeser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Several studies suggested that there is a good correlation between the number of docked vesicles and the size of the RRP at hippocampal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schikorski and Stevens, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Imig et al., 2014</xref>), but electron microscopic analysis of ELKS1α/2α cDKO synapses using conventional fixation has not revealed a deficit in vesicle docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Recent work has achieved better resolution in the analysis of docking by combining high-pressure freezing with EM tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Imig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siksou et al., 2007</xref>). We can currently not rule out the possibility that ELKS1α/2α cDKO causes a subtle vesicle docking phenotype undetectable by the methods used in our previous work. An alternative hypothesis to a reduction of RRP at each excitatory synapse is the possibility that a subpopulation of excitatory synapses is very strongly affected by the removal of ELKS. Because the distribution of ELKS fluorescence intensity across excitatory synapses has a single peak, it is unlikely that ELKS only operates at a subset of excitatory synapses and that these synapses are silent in the absence of ELKS. However, additional work at clearly defined synapse populations with less heterogeneity than mixed hippocampal cultures will be necessary to address these questions.</p><p>Finally, although ELKS1α/2α cDKO neurons do not reveal an RRP deficit as measured by hypertonic stimuli at inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), ELKS is known to regulate RRP at these synapses. Enhancing P by increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> cannot completely rescue synaptic transmission at inhibitory ELKS1α/2α cDKO synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), and removal of ELKS2α alone leads to an increase in the RRP at inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaeser et al., 2009</xref>). These experiments suggest that there may be molecular regulation of the RRP at inhibitory synapses through interplay between ELKS1 and ELKS2, which are both present at inhibitory active zones.</p><p>In the long-term, it will be important to understand how the synapse-specific molecular control of RRP and P contribute to circuit function. Human genetic experiments reveal that mutations in <italic>ERC1</italic>/ELKS1 may contribute to autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Silva et al., 2014</xref>), and it is possible that the pathophysiology arises from synapse-specific misregulation of neurotransmitter release.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse lines</title><p>All experiments using mice were performed according to institutional guidelines at Harvard University.

For evoked NMDAR excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) picrotoxin (PTX, 50 μM) and 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 20 μM) were added to the bath.

Cells were held at at −70 mV for AMPAR-EPSC and IPSC recordings, at +40 mV for NMDAR-EPSC recordings and. Access resistance was monitored during recording and cells were discarded if access exceeded 15 MΩ or 20 MΩ during recording of evoked or spontaneous synaptic currents, respectively. Action potentials in presynaptic neurons were elicited with a bipolar focal stimulation electrode fabricated from nichrome wire. The RRP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> was measured by application of 0.5 M sucrose in extracellular solution applied via a microinjector syringe pump for 10 s at a flow rate of 10 μL/min.

For action potential and sucrose-evoked responses, data were acquired at 5 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz. For miniature recordings data were acquired at 10 kHz. All data acquisition and analysis was done using pClamp10.

Presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were examined at DIV15 - 18 in whole cell patch clamp configuration at room temperature. The extracellular solution contained (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 Glucose, 0.05 APV, 0.02 CNQX, 0.05 PTX, 10 HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4, ~310 mOsm). Glass pipettes were filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM) 140 K Gluconate, 0.1 EGTA, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 1 NaGTP, 0.3 Fluo-5F, 0.03 Alexa Fluor 594, 10 HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4, ~300 mOsm). Neurons were filled for 7 min and axons and dendrites were identified in the red channel. Presynaptic boutons were identified by their typical bead-like morphology. Neurons in which the distinction between axons and dendrites was unclear were discarded. 10 min after break-in, presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were induced by a single action potential evoked via somatic current injection (5 ms, 800–1200 pA) and monitored via Fluo-5F fluorescence. Images were acquired using an Olympus BX51 microscope with a 60x, 1.0 numerical aperture objective. Fluorescence signals were excited by a light-emitting diode at 470 nm, and were collected with a scientific complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor camera at 100 frames/s for 200 ms before and 1s after the action potential. After the experiment, coverslips were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline. Neurons were stained with GAD67 antibodies as described above and imaged neurons, identified post-hoc by their Alexa 594 filling, were identified as either inhibitory or excitatory neurons using confocal microscopy. In additional experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), distinction between excitatory and inhibitory cultured neurons was further characterized by labeling excitatory neurons using a lentivirus expressing tandem dimer tomato (TdTomato) under a CamKII promoter (pFCK(1.3)tdimer2W; gift from Pavel Osten; Addgene plasmid #27233, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dittgen et al., 2004</xref>]). Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were quantified using ImageJ. For the analysis in boutons, ROIs were defined using pictures taken in the red channel, and 7–10 boutons were randomly selected from each neuron. Background was subtracted using the rolling ball method with a radius of 1.5 μm. After background subtraction, (F−F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub> was calculated (F = average green emission in a bouton at a given time point, F<sub>0</sub> = average fluorescent intensity in frames 0 to 20 before action potential induction). For dendritic measurements, a second order dendrite was selected from each neuron, and the fluorescence from a nearby empty region was referred to as background and subtracted from the ROI. For all Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, the experimenter was blind to the genotype throughout data acquisition and analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical significance was set at *p≤0.05, **p≤0.01, and ***p≤0.001. Unless otherwise noted in the figure legends, all tests were performed using Student’s t tests to compare means. In cases where significance was determined by one-way ANOVA, Holm-Sidak multiple comparisons tests were used to compare all conditions against the cDKO condition to assess rescue. All experiments were done with using a minimum of three independent cultures and in each culture multiple cells (typically 5–10 per culture and genotype) or images (typically 5–10 images per culture and genotype) were analyzed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Lydia Bickford and Jennifer Wang for technical support, Dr. Nils Brose and Dr. Thomas Südhof for antibodies, and Dr. Wade Regehr and all members of the Kaeser laboratory for insightful discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, the authors study the function of ELKS at excitatory synapses in cultured neurons. Previous work showed that at inhibitory synapses ELKS stimulates release probability (P) by stimulating calcium influx. Here, the authors find that the removal of both ELKS proteins cause a reduction in Readily Releasable Pool (RRP) in excitatory synapses, indicating that the mechanism of action of ELKS proteins at inhibitory and excitatory synapses is fundamentally different. Molecular dissection shows that the three N-terminal, but not the C-terminal, coiled-coils are responsible.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agree that the study is interesting and novel, but that more evidence is required to unequivocally prove that the molecular function of the ELKS proteins is indeed fundamentally different in excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Most importantly, this requires, in our opinion, that key experiments are carried out in parallel at excitatory and inhibitory neurons instead of basing all conclusions on comparing the present data with the previously published work. In the prior J. Neurosci. paper, the conclusion that the RRP was unchanged was based on a low number of cells (and on average the RRP was lower in the cDKO) – and the finding that increasing calcium concentrations did not rescue release in inhibitory neurons indicates that the RRP must have been lower. Conversely, in the present paper the PPR was actually slightly higher in the cDKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and comparing the change in AP-evoked and sucrose-evoked EPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) seems to indicate that the vesicular release probability is reduced in the cDKO. Moreover, the results with single KOs also indicate that ELKS affect the RRP in inhibitory synapses, as discussed by the authors. Therefore, the question arises whether ELKS has effects on both P and RRP in both types of synapses, but due to a different organization of the two types of terminals, one effect will be more conspicuous in inhibitory synapses, and another effect will be conspicuous in excitatory synapses. In this case, the differences will not be indicative of a different function of ELKS in the two neuronal types. Thus, we recommend parallel experiments of release probability and RRP in excitatory and inhibitory neurons from the same cultures, while matching the powers of the analysis (i.e. similar number of cells in the two types of neurons). Furthermore, the statistical analysis for multiple comparisons is not appropriate and needs to be corrected.</p><p>The second major issue is that there is presently no mechanistic/molecular explanation for the difference between the synapses, particularly when considering that the molecular machinery involved in vesicle docking and fusion is very similar. While we understand that addressing this point may exceed the scope of this study, this is puzzling and needs to be thoughtfully discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14862.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>All reviewers agree that the study is interesting and novel, but that more evidence is required to unequivocally prove that the molecular function of the ELKS proteins is indeed fundamentally different in excitatory and inhibitory synapses.

As suggested, we have performed a systematic comparison of vesicular release probability and the size of the RRP for excitatory and inhibitory transmission. All eight parameters (PPR and RRP, excitatory and inhibitory synapses, cDKO and control) were measured in each of three cultures and with identical sample numbers. These data are now presented in a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The results of these experiments match with both our previously published experiments from Liu et al. 2014 and the data included in the previous version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>In the prior J. Neurosci. paper, the conclusion that the RRP was unchanged was based on a low number of cells (and on average the RRP was lower in the cDKO) – and the finding that increasing calcium concentrations did not rescue release in inhibitory neurons indicates that the RRP must have been lower.</italic></p><p>As pointed out by the reviewers, the RRP measured at inhibitory synapses in the Liu et al. 2014 paper revealed a very slight trend toward a reduction, though this difference was not significant. Similarly, the inhibitory RRP measured in our current experiments, using a larger sample number, is slightly below the control but the difference is not significant (p = 0.2440). Furthermore, we have included a third independent experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), which again failed to detect a significant difference in RRP size at inhibitory synapses. However, as we have pointed out in the Discussion there is clearly some role for ELKS in RRP at inhibitory synapses that our methods cannot easily capture. This is evident in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> titration experiments shown in Liu et al. 2014 and in the ELKS2α single cKO analyzed in Kaeser et al. 2009. While we acknowledge and discuss these findings, we do not feel that they negate the main observation that removal of ELKS1α/2α has differential effects on the release properties of different synapses.</p><p><italic>Conversely, in the present paper the PPR was actually slightly higher in the cDKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and comparing the change in AP-evoked and sucrose-evoked EPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) seems to indicate that the vesicular release probability is reduced in the cDKO.</italic></p><p>In our new experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> the slight difference pointed out by the reviewers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> appears to trend in the opposite direction. We believe that these differences simply reflect the variation inherent in the experiment, as opposed to a true change in vesicular release probability. Furthermore, at inhibitory synapses the reduction in P is caused by reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx, which is unaffected at excitatory synapses. Similarly, as discussed in detail below in response to reviewer 2, division of the AP-evoked charge transfer by the sucrose evoked RRP charge requires that both parameters be measured from the same inputs and the same cells. The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> were collected from independent cultures and we hesitate to attribute differences in phenotype magnitude in the range of 10% to anything other than variability between cultures.</p><p><italic>Moreover, the results with single KOs also indicate that ELKS affect the RRP in inhibitory synapses, as discussed by the authors. Therefore, the question arises whether ELKS has effects on both P and RRP in both types of synapses, but due to a different organization of the two types of terminals, one effect will be more conspicuous in inhibitory synapses, and another effect will be conspicuous in excitatory synapses. In this case, the differences will not be indicative of a different function of ELKS in the two neuronal types. Thus, we recommend parallel experiments of release probability and RRP in excitatory and inhibitory neurons from the same cultures, while matching the powers of the analysis (i.e. similar number of cells in the two types of neurons).</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion of this systematic comparison and performed this exact experiment. Comparing release probability and RRP in excitatory and inhibitory neurons from the same cultures (with matched sample size) confirms our initial finding of a significant reduction of RRP (with normal PPR) at excitatory synapses, and a significant reduction of P (with near normal RRP) at inhibitory synapses. The results are presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>In respect to the interpretation of this result, we did not intend to make the point that ELKS serves completely separable, non-overlapping molecular functions at inhibitory versus excitatory synapses. Our own previous work has demonstrated that ELKS can regulate the RRP at inhibitory synapses and we cannot entirely rule out small effects on release probability at excitatory synapses in the ELKS cDKO. We can, however, confidently state that removal of ELKS1α/2α has differential effects on the properties of release (i.e. RRP size and release probability) at different synapses. This observation is significant because it is clear that synaptic properties between inhibitory and excitatory synapses are different, but molecular differences at these synapses are not well understood. ELKS removal has differential effects on transmission and thus strongly suggests that some element of the active zone, be it its molecular components or the structural or functional organization of the same components, are different between synaptic subtypes. Our study is one of the first that starts dissecting such differences by manipulations at the molecular level.</p><p>We apologize that we did not make this more clear in the initial version, and we have made changes throughout the text to soften the impression that our findings imply a hard binary function of ELKS at inhibitory and excitatory synapses.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, the statistical analysis for multiple comparisons is not appropriate and needs to be corrected.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this error and we have changed our analysis to compare each condition against the cDKO and now use one-way ANOVA followed by a Holm-Sidak post-hoc test, which corrects for multiple comparisons. We have also added additional rescue data to the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> to strengthen our conclusions.</p><p><italic>The second major issue is that there is presently no mechanistic/molecular explanation for the difference between the synapses, particularly when considering that the molecular machinery involved in vesicle docking and fusion is very similar. While we understand that addressing this point may exceed the scope of this study, this is puzzling and needs to be thoughtfully discussed.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is a puzzling point, but we also think it is important. A large body of literature supports that synapses are functionally diverse, but the molecular diversity that underlies this functional diversity is not well understood. Even though differences in the molecular make up of release sites between excitatory and inhibitory synapses are currently not well known, the molecular mechanisms behind the functional differences are important to resolve. It is interesting that a recent paper (Boyken et al., 2013) found few differences between docking sites of inhibitory vs. excitatory synapses, but there were differences in their levels of Bassoon, ELKS1, and ELKS2 (see supplemental table 5, Boyken et al., 2013). At this time, no single potential mechanism stands out in our data, and no previous study has found a compelling molecular explanation for the functional differences. We have made an effort throughout the manuscript to thoughtfully address potential mechanisms in experiment (using structure-function rescue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) and text. In the revised manuscript, we have added new data to show that the sequences that are necessary to rescue the excitatory RRP are not needed for rescue of the IPSC, further supporting differential functions of ELKS at different synapses. In the Discussion, we have outlined which protein interactions map on these sequences, which gives first hints towards mechanisms.</p><p>Unambiguously determining the exact molecular mechanism is difficult at this point and we strongly feel that it goes beyond the scope of this study. In order to directly test each individual protein interaction without affecting other functions/interactions of ELKS, exact structural information on the binding sites would be necessary. Unfortunately, structural information on ELKS and its interactions with potential targets such as Liprin-α or Bassoon is not available. It is thus not easily possible to dissect roles for potential interactions with precise mutations in the α-helical coils of ELKS that only affect one interaction at a time. Identification of point mutations to selectively change individual interactions would require a massive screening or structural effort, which is not possible for a revision.</p><p>We hope that the reviewers agree that with the new data, the additional considerations in Results and Discussion, and in view of these explanations, our structure-function analysis provides significant advance, but that an exact molecular understanding of ELKS function at each synapse will require much more groundwork on the structure of these fascinating but enigmatic proteins.</p></body></sub-article></article>
