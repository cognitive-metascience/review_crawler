lysine-specific demethylase 1 (Lsd1/KDM1a), which demethylates histone H3 on Lys4 or Lys9 (H3K4/K9), is an indispensible epigenetic governor of hematopoietic differentiation. Integrative genomic analysis, combining global occupancy of Lsd1, genome-wide analysis of its substrates H3K4 monomethylation and dimethylation, and gene expression profiling, reveals that Lsd1 represses hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) gene expression programs during hematopoietic differentiation. We found that Lsd1 acts at transcription start sites, as well as enhancer regions. Loss of Lsd1 was associated with increased H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 methylation on HSPC genes and gene derepression. Failure to fully silence HSPC genes compromised differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells as well as mature blood cell lineages. Collectively, our data indicate that Lsd1-mediated concurrent repression of enhancer and promoter activity of stem and progenitor cell genes is a pivotal epigenetic mechanism required for proper hematopoietic maturation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00633.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00633.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00633.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our blood contains many different types of cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body, whereas white blood cells are a key part of our immune system. All these different types of blood cells are derived from special cells in our bone marrow called hematopoietic stem cells. The type of blood cell that the stem cell becomes depends on the genes that are expressed as proteins in that stem cell.</p><p>Gene expression can be controlled in a number of ways, including epigenetic process that influence the expression of genes without altering the underlying sequence of bases in the DNA. For example, DNA is wrapped around histone proteins and the addition of a methyl group to these proteins, a process known as histone methylation, can increase the expression of a gene, whereas the removal of a methyl group (demethylation) can repress gene expression. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (Lsd1) is an enzyme that is known to mediate the demethylation of lysine amino acids on histone proteins. The role of Lsd1 in embryonic stem cells has been widely studied, and deletion of the gene that codes for Lsd1 is known to result in the death of mice embryos. However, very little is known about its roles in the later stages of mammalian development.</p><p>Here, Kerenyi et al. use new genetic tools to knock out the gene for Lsd1 at different stages of development in order to examine its impact on the formation of new blood cells. They find that Lsd1 is required for the successful differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into different types of blood cells, and that knocking out <italic>Lsd1</italic> results in a severe loss of white and red blood cells. Moreover, they show that the lack of Lsd1 causes problems during both the early and later stages of development.</p><p>Kerenyi et al. go on to demonstrate that Lsd1 regulates the activity of promoters and enhancers of various genes associated with hematopoietic stem cells. They also show that knocking out the <italic>Lsd1</italic> gene results in impaired silencing of these genes, and that the incomplete expression of these genes is not compatible with the maturation of blood cells.</p><p>Lsd1 has recently been proposed as the potential target for the treatment of leukemia and other blood disorders. However, the fact that a loss of Lsd1 function has adverse effects during both the early and later stages of blood cell development suggests that research into drugs that target Lsd1 should not begin until a suitable time window for the administration of such drugs can be identified.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00633.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00633.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>histone demethylase</kwd><kwd>Lsd1</kwd><kwd>KDM1</kwd><kwd>HSC</kwd><kwd>granulocyte</kwd><kwd>enhancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL075735</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kerenyi</surname><given-names>Marc A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orkin</surname><given-names>Stuart H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Austrian Science Fund (FWF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>J 2948-B19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kerenyi</surname><given-names>Marc A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (Lsd1) has an essential role during both the early and later stages of blood cell development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epigenetic modifications, such as histone lysine methylation, promote or repress gene expression, depending on the specific lysine residue modified, the number of methyl moieties present, and the genomic positioning of the lysine modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jenuwein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>). While active promoters are typically marked by dimethylation and trimethylation at Lys4 of histone H3 (H3K4) around transcriptional start sites (TSS), enhancer elements are characterized by high levels of H3K4 monomethylation and low levels of H3K4 trimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heintzman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koch et al., 2007</xref>). The regulation of lysine methyl modifications is a dynamic process, tightly controlled by the opposing forces of lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and lysine demethylases (KDMs). Histone monomethylation, dimethylation, and trimethylation of H3K4 are mediated by a group of SET domain-containing lysine methyltransferases, for example, MLL1-5 and ASH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruthenburg et al., 2007</xref>). Among KDMs, KDM2B is restricted to removal of trimethylated H3K4, whereas the KDM5 family (KDM5 AâD) and NO66 demethylate H3K4me2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cloos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kooistra and Helin, 2012</xref>). Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (Lsd1/KDM1A) and its homolog KDM1B, however, demethylate monomethylated and dimethylated H3K4, but not H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4a">Ciccone et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, Lsd1/KDM1A and KDM1B are the only KDMs known with substrate specificity for H3K4me1, a crucial enhancer mark. Lsd1 mediates its repressive functions as part of the CoREST (corepressor for element-1-silencing transcription factor; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2005</xref>) or NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2009b</xref>) repressor complexes, but has also been implicated in gene activation, however, only when in complex with androgen or estrogen receptors through demethylation of H3K9me1/me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Metzger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruthenburg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wissmann et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Although the biochemical functions of Lsd1 have been studied in detail (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cloos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kooistra and Helin, 2012</xref>), mechanistic understanding of Lsd1 in complex biological systems is limited. Targeted deletion of Lsd1 in mice is lethal. In Lsd1<sup>â/â</sup> embryos, the egg cylinder fails to elongate and gastrulate, resulting in developmental arrest around embryonic day (E) 5.5 and loss of Lsd1<sup>â/â</sup> embryos by E7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2009a</xref>). Human and murine Lsd1<sup>â/â</sup> embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have proliferation and differentiation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Whyte et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, recent evidence suggests that Lsd1 may be a point of vulnerability for acute myeloid leukemia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schenk et al., 2012</xref>). However, the significance of Lsd1 in adult differentiation processes remains largely unexplored.</p><p>Here, we have examined the in vivo roles of Lsd1 in hematopoiesis through conditional inactivation in the mouse. We identified Lsd1 as an indispensible epigenetic governor of hematopoietic differentiation. Consequences of Lsd1 loss are profound, including defects in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) self-renewal and stark impairment of LT-HSC as well as mature lineage hematopoietic differentiation. We found that Lsd1 represses genes that are normally expressed in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and that failure to silence HSPC gene signatures during differentiation is incompatible with terminal maturation of multiple blood lineages resulting in severe pancytopenia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deletion of Lsd1 in hematopoietic stem cells results in pancytopenia</title><p>We generated a conditional Lsd1 allele in which Cre-recombinaseâmediated excision of exons 5 and 6 generates a frame shift and premature stop in the mRNA. Exons 5 and 6 encode a flavin adenine dinucleotide binding site and the N-terminal portion of the amine oxidase domain, both essential for Lsd1 enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> and âMaterial and methodsâ).</p><p>Consistent with findings of other laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2009a</xref>), germline deletion of Lsd1 resulted in early embryonic lethality â¼E7.5 (data not shown), thus precluding analysis of early blood cell differentiation. To bypass early embryonic lethality, we used VavCre to delete Lsd1. VavCre typically enables gene deletion across all hematopoietic cells as early as embryonic day 9.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stadtfeld, 2004</xref>). Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> VavCre animals were born at Mendelian ratios, but died neonatally of severe anemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Deletion of Lsd1 during embryonic development was incomplete, as evidenced by the presence of Lsd1 protein in knockout and control fetal liver (FL) lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), precluding analysis of embryonic hematopoiesis. We could, however, study fetal hematopoiesis since Lsd1 protein was completely absent in newborn Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> VavCre bone marrow (BM) samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00633.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Deletion of Lsd1 results in pancytopenia.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> VavCre cohort statistics 0 and 10 days after birth (n = 146 pups).

These findings are indicative of defects in the most immature bone marrow cells. Indeed, the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartment of Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> VavCre animals was vastly distorted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Frequency and absolute numbers of lineage-negative Sca-1<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells (i.e., LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>; encompassing hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors [MPP]) as well as lineage-negative Sca-1<sup>â</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells (LS<sup>â</sup>K<sup>+</sup> cells; encompassing myeloid progenitor cells) were reduced over 30-fold in Lsd1<sup>fl/lf</sup> VavCre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

Together, these data suggested early hematopoietic differentiation defects in the absence of Lsd1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Deletion of Lsd1 impairs differentiation of LT-HSCs</title><p>To test whether deletion of Lsd1 during adult hematopoiesis also results in hematopoietic stem cell defects, Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were interbred with the Mx1Cre mouse line, which allows inducible deletion of Lsd1 throughout all hematopoietic lineages and hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">KÃ¼hn et al., 1995</xref>). Injection of Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> and Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre mice with the dsRNA poly(I:C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) resulted in efficient Lsd1 inactivation and a massive reduction in peripheral blood counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1BâD</xref>). In keeping with this, the majority of Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre mice died with severe anemia 7â10 days after the final dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). As in Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> VavCre animals, Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre animals were largely deficient in LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup> as well as LS<sup>â</sup>K<sup>+</sup> cells, again at the expense of LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>â</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We suspected that loss of Lsd1 might alter the immunophenotype of stem and progenitor cells and therefore adopted an additional FACS-gating strategy to allow the potential identification of LT-HSCs. We inverted the commonly used stem cell gating strategy (i.e., LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup> CD150<sup>+</sup> CD48<sup>â</sup>), by first gating on lineage-negative CD150<sup>+</sup> CD48<sup>â</sup> cells, succeeded by Sca-1 and c-Kit analysis. With this approach, we identified a population of cells in Lsd1 knockout animals, resembling immunophenotypic LT-HSCs, albeit with slightly decreased c-Kit expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the frequency of Lsd1 knockout lin<sup>â</sup> CD150<sup>+</sup> CD48<sup>â</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells was increased about fourfold (pâ¤0.001). In keeping with this, we found that twice as many Lsd1 knockout lin<sup>â</sup> CD150<sup>+</sup> CD48<sup>â</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells were proliferating, and their apoptosis levels were not significantly altered compared to Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A,B</xref>). This suggests compensatory LT-HSC expansion due to downstream differentiation defects.

We profiled single Lsd1 knockout LT-HSCs for &gt;30 cell surface markers by highly multiplexed microfluidics qPCR (for complete gene list and data set, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>). We further applied this method to determine whether immunophenotypically altered myeloid progenitor cells, such as granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs), were concealed in the Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>â</sup> cell population, and if not, to categorize these cells. We performed hierarchical clustering of the resulting gene expression matrices of Lsd1 knockout LT-HSCs and LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>â</sup> cells, with data sets consisting of â¼30 defined wild-type hematopoietic cell types also characterized by multiplexed microfluidics qPCR (Guo et al., complete data set will be published elsewhere). Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre LT-HSCs clustered closest with wild-type LT-HSCs, further substantiating that knockout lin<sup>â</sup> CD150<sup>+</sup> CD48<sup>â</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells represent authentic LT-HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2E,F</xref>; LT-HSC cluster).

However, about 50% of knockout LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>â</sup> cells displayed features of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, characterized by high expression of toll-like receptor 9 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guiducci, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heng et al., 2008</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.immgen.org">http://www.immgen.org</ext-link>). Nevertheless, all knockout LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>â</sup> populations clustered separately from wild-type granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs), suggesting that Lsd1 knockout animals indeed lack LS<sup>â</sup>K<sup>+</sup> myeloid progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D,F</xref>; GMP cluster).</p><p>To test whether the lack of myeloid progenitor cells might be due directly to a LT-HSC differentiation defect, we cultured Lsd1-deficient lin<sup>â</sup> CD150<sup>+</sup> CD48<sup>â</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells in methylcellulose. LT-HSCs from control and Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre animals were purified prior to Lsd1 deletion. This strategy ensured that control and Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre cells would be comparable (i.e., immunophenotypically identical LT-HSCs). To delete Lsd1 in vitro, we added interferon alpha (IFNÎ±) to control and Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and although colony numbers were comparable between Lsd1 knockout and control, stark differences in colony and cell morphology were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,F</xref>). Control LT-HSCs generated large colonies of multipotential granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, and megakaryocyte progenitor identity (CFU-GEMM), whereas Lsd1-deficient colonies were smaller and consisted almost exclusively of immature blasts. Lsd1 knockout colonies primarily consisted of lineage-negative c-Kit<sup>+</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitor cells, whereas wild-type colonies were largely composed of mature Gr1<sup>+</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,GâJ</xref>). Together, the absence of LS<sup>â</sup>K<sup>+</sup> myeloid progenitors determined by flow cytometry, the single cell multiplex qPCR immunoprofiling data, and colony assays indicate that Lsd1 function is vital for efficient differentiation of LT-HSCs into more mature myeloid progenitor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Lsd1 is required for HSC self-renewal</title><p>Self-renewal capacity of Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre HSCs was assessed by competitive BM transplantation.

After poly(I:C) treatment, we evaluated the kinetics of peripheral blood (PB) multilineage donor contribution. The initial contribution of Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre or Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> cells to mature myeloid and lymphoid lineages was equivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). By 4 weeks after poly(I:C), the contribution of Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre cells to the myeloid lineage was barely detectable and remained low for 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Indeed, mature Gr1<sup>high</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> granulocytes were almost absent from the bone marrow of Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). The concomitant accumulation of immature Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells, a population containing immature granulocytes, bipotential granulocytic/monocytic precursor cells, and monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hestdal et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walkley et al., 2002</xref>), indicated a defect in granulocytic maturation. We tested whether increased apoptosis or reduced proliferation of Lsd1 knockout Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells could lead to the loss of Gr1<sup>high</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells, but could not observe differences compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Further analysis with antibodies specific for neutrophils (Neutr.7/4) and macrophages/monocytes (F4/80) confirmed loss of mature neutrophils (i.e., Neutr.7/4<sup>+</sup> F4/80<sup>â</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>) in Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre animals with a concomitant increase in bipotential granulocytic/monocytic precursor cells (i.e., Neutr.7/4<sup>+</sup> F4/80<sup>+</sup>). The number of Neutr.7/4<sup>â</sup> F4/80<sup>+</sup> monocytes was unaffected. Cytospin preparations of Gr1<sup>+</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells confirmed the lack of mature neutrophils and the accumulation of immature myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, loss of Lsd1 culminates in a differentiation block at the transition of immature Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> to mature Gr1<sup>high</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> granulocytes. Next, we used EpoRCre mice to perform erythroid-specific gene inactivation of Lsd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heinrich et al., 2004</xref>). As EpoRCre-mediated deletion of Lsd1 was lethal in the prenatal period, we analyzed Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> EpoRCre embryos. Combinatorial FACS staining of the cell surface markers CD71 and Ter119, or combination of CD71 with c-Kit, were used to stage erythroid maturation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al. 2003</xref>). Lsd1 knockout embryos displayed a 300% increase of CD71<sup>high</sup> Ter119<sup>low</sup> proerythroblasts (R2), but a 20-fold reduction of reticulocytes and erythrocytes (R5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). Similar results were obtained using c-Kit and CD71 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). Thus, erythroid cell maturation in Lsd1-deficient embryos is impaired at the transition from proerythroblasts/R2 to basophilic erythroblasts/R3. In keeping with this, enucleated mature definitive erythroid cells were markedly reduced in Lsd1-deficient fetal livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Overall, Lsd1-deficient embryos were small and exhibited pale fetal livers at E13.5, similarly consistent with compromised erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). By E14.5, embryos displayed grave developmental defects, most likely due to insufficient oxygenation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Cross sections of E13.5 fetal livers showed a disturbed architecture with multiple pyknotic cells displaying karyorrhexis, indicative of increased cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1E</xref>), also confirmed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

However, mRNA expression levels of these master transcription factors were not downregulated in Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells or in CD71<sup>+</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> proerythroblasts, indicating that the block in terminal differentiation could not be ascribed simply to the reduced expression of these regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). In order to identify signaling pathways that potentially drive or maintain the upregulation of a stem and progenitor cell gene signature, we again performed gene set enrichment analysis and found that Hox genes, which are typically associated with early hematopoiesis, were significantly upregulated in Lsd1 knockout cells (NES: â1.46; FDR â¤ 0.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In keeping with this, we discovered significant enrichment of HoxA7-driven (Z-score: 2.746; p=1.63 Ã 10<sup>â8</sup>) and HoxA9-driven (Z-score: 2.314; p=1.13 Ã 10<sup>â3</sup>) gene expression networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>) by performing pathway enrichment analysis with the âIngenuity Systemsâ pathway analysis tool.

We focused our search for direct Lsd1 target genes within the granulocytic lineage. Sufficient cellular material for Lsd1 ChIP-Seq could not be prepared from primary Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells to generate high-quality occupancy data. Therefore, we used an immature murine granulocytic cell line (i.e., 32D) that can be differentiated into mature neutrophils upon addition of G-CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rovera et al., 1987</xref>). In total, we identified a total of 25,173 Lsd1 binding sites (peaks) from the ChIP-Seq data set. We chose 18 peaks for validation by ChIP-qPCR in primary Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells. We found that 16 (&gt;85%) of these binding sites were also occupied by Lsd1 in Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

We found that both KO-specific enhancer-associated H3K4me1 (ES: 2.31; p=4.5 Ã 10<sup>â14</sup>) and the promoter-associated H3K4me2 (ES: 2.60; p=9.7 Ã 10<sup>â19</sup>) peak target genes were highly enriched among the LSK signature genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

We reasoned that genes downregulated in Lsd1 knockout Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells should not show considerable enrichment of KO-specific methylation marks.

To assess direct involvement of Lsd1 in the regulation of HSPC genes, we examined the occupancy of Lsd1 on LSK and granulocyte signature genes. We divided Lsd1 target genes into three groups: genes that had Lsd1 either bound at distal sites and at the promoter (1), only at distal regions (2), or only at the proximal promoter (3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 6âsource data 2</xref>).

As expected, none of the three groups were significantly enriched in the granulocyte signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), suggesting that Lsd1 is directly involved in the repression of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell genes but not in the activation of mature granulocyte genes.

As Lsd1 has been proposed recently as a target for therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schenk et al., 2012</xref>), elucidation of its in vivo requirements is highly relevant to both normal and malignant hematopoiesis.</p><p>Through study of blood lineageâspecific conditional knockout mice, we established that Lsd1 is an indispensable factor for hematopoietic differentiation. Conditional deletion of Lsd1 resulted in severe pancytopenia, the consequence of combined defects in early hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and terminal blood cell maturation. We used Cre recombinase mouse strains to permit deletion of Lsd1 at early or later developmental stages. In this manner, we dissected the complex phenotypes ensuing from Lsd1 loss. We established that Lsd1 is crucial not only for immature hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, as might have been expected from the previous ES cell studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Whyte et al., 2012</xref>), but also critical for differentiation of mature hematopoietic cells. Taken together, we found that Lsd1-deficient HSCs were severely impaired in their capacity to mature into immature progenitors. Deletion of Lsd1 not only compromised early hematopoietic differentiation but also strongly interfered with terminal granulocytic and erythroid differentiation. Our data are most consistent with a requirement for Lsd1 at promoters and enhancers of stem and progenitor cell genes in hematopoietic cells. As a consequence, differentiating Lsd1 knockout cells aberrantly express HSPC genes normally expressed only in HSCs and progenitors. We propose that failure to silence these LSK-associated genes in Lsd1 mutants interferes with proper differentiation, culminating in detrimental consequences for hematopoiesis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> for model).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00633.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Cellular and molecular effects of Lsd1 loss during hematopoietic differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Characterization of the stem/progenitor cell compartment of Lsd1 knockout mice demonstrated the presence LT-HSCs (CD150<sup>+</sup> CD48<sup>â</sup> LSK), while having lost all LS<sup>â</sup>K<sup>+</sup> myeloid progenitor cells (i.e., CMP, GMP, and MEP) in the bone marrow.

Collectively, our data suggested that the inability to silence HSPC genes keeps Lsd1 knockout LT-HSCs from differentiating into myeloid progenitor cells and lineage commitment. (<bold>B</bold>) Lsd1 deficiency in granulocytic and erythroid cells resulted in erroneous derepression of stem and progenitor cell gene sets, which resulted in stark maturation defects in the mature erythroid and granulocytic cell lineages. These findings suggested that Lsd1 is required to maintain appropriate expression levels of HSPC genes during early, as well as late hematopoietic differentiation and that the failure to so, is incompatible with terminal differentiation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00633.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00633.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00633-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>Conditional deletion of Lsd1 in fetal (VavCre) as well as adult (Mx1Cre) HSCs resulted in pancytopenia, consistent with a prominent role for Lsd1 in HSC homeostasis. Indeed, we found that Lsd1-deficient hematopoietic stem cells were impaired in their in vitro differentiation capacity. Lsd1 knockout LT-HSCs mostly gave rise to cells with immature blast morphology and an LSK immunophenotype while being largely unable to contribute mature cell progeny in methylcellulose colony-forming cell assays. In a competitive bone marrow transplantation setting, Lsd1-deficient bone marrow cells were not only unable to significantly contribute to peripheral myeloid and B and T lymphoid lineages but more importantly CD150<sup>+</sup> LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells, CD150<sup>â</sup> LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup> multipotent progenitor cells, and various lineage-negative myeloid progenitor cells (i.e., GMP, PreGM, PreMegE, MkP, PreCFU-E, CFU-E) were almost undetectable. While the reduced contribution of mature cells could be explained, among other things, by differentiation defects, the loss of Lsd1-deficient HSCs in the competitive transplantation setting indicates that Lsd1 is also vital for LT-HSC self-renewal.</p><p>We also observed that Lsd1 is essential not only for early hematopoietic differentiation but also for the final steps of terminal blood cell maturation in multiple lineages. We found that mature Gr1<sup>high</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> granulocytes were virtually absent from the peripheral blood and bone marrow of Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre mice. The concomitant increase of immature Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells, a population containing immature granulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hestdal et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walkley et al., 2002</xref>), indicated a defect in granulocytic maturation. Similarly, we found that erythroid-specific Lsd1 deletion resulted in lethal embryonic anemia. Lsd1-deficient embryos were small and exhibited pale fetal livers at E13.5, which could be ascribed to a 20-fold reduction of reticulocytes and erythrocytes. The combination of rapid lethality of Lsd1 knockout mice and the relatively long half-life of lymphoid lineage cells did not allow us to study the long-term effects of Lsd1 loss in lymphoid cells. Although we did not observe a decrease of peripheral B or T cells in Lsd1 Mx1Cre mice (data not shown), future studies on the role of Lsd1 in lymphoid development are warranted.</p><p>Some of our phenotypic discoveries (i.e., granulocytic and erythroid maturation defects) are independently confirmed in a recent study that used shRNA-mediated knockdown rather than gene excision to affect Lsd1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">SprÃ¼ssel et al., 2012</xref>). As might be anticipated, in vivo knockdown of Lsd1 revealed attenuated phenotypes when compared to the consequences of gene knockout. For example, we found that Lsd1 deletion with VavCre or Mx1Cre resulted in severe HSC differentiation and self-renewal defects resulting in complete loss of lineage-negative c-Kit<sup>+</sup> myeloid progenitor cells, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">SprÃ¼ssel et al. (2012)</xref> did not observe a defect in LT-HSCs. It seems likely that incomplete inactivation of Lsd1 by knockdown may account for these phenotypic differences.</p><p>Two recent reports propose Lsd1 as a potential target for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schenk et al., 2012</xref>). These studies described that chemical inhibition of the enzymatic activity, as well as knockdown of Lsd1, resulted in increased apoptosis and impaired leukemogenicity of MLL-AF9- and PML-RARÎ±-transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schenk et al., 2012</xref>). Two independent studies have described that RNAi-mediated or chemical inhibition of Lsd1 enhances Î³-globin expression in human erythroid cells and quite modestly in human Î²-locus transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), which would alleviate symptoms of Î²-hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease and Î²-thalassemia. Although these findings illustrate favorable features of Lsd1 as a potential drug target, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">SprÃ¼ssel et al. (2012)</xref>, Xu et al., and this study demonstrate that Lsd1 serves critical roles in hematopoietic differentiation and that appreciable or complete inhibition of Lsd1 could have undesired side effects. Therefore, prospects for the utility of small-molecule inhibitors against Lsd1 for therapy of hematologic diseases will rest on the availability of an adequate therapeutic window.</p><p>Importantly, in addition to analyzing phenotypic effects of Lsd1 loss, we also examined how Lsd1 deficiency leads to molecular and gene expression changes that culminate in hematopoietic deficiencies. Previously, no comprehensive analysis of Lsd1 function has been performed in adult cell types, such as hematopoietic cells. Previous reports studying effects of Lsd1 loss in hematopoietic cells were largely performed in cancer cell lines and did not include Lsd1 ChIP-Seq or analysis of global H3K4me1 methylation changes upon Lsd1 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schenk et al., 2012</xref>). Our studies are the first to integrate genome-wide Lsd1 occupancy data, H3K4me2, and H3K4me1 mark status in primary wild-type and Lsd1 knockout cells with microarray data in an effort to reveal a more comprehensive picture of the biomolecular function of Lsd1 in hematopoietic cells.</p><p>Through comprehensive, integrative epigenomic analyses, we established that Lsd1 function in hematopoietic cells is associated with reduced methylation of H3K4me2 at transcription start sites and reduced methylation of H3K4me1 at enhancers. Failure of proper H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 regulation is associated with derepression and upregulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells signatures, which is ultimately incompatible with early HSC, as well as terminal blood cell, differentiation. The finding that Lsd1 acts not only at transcriptions start sites but also at enhancers is of particular interest, given the genome-wide enhancer mapping studies that highlight enhancers as major determinants of cell typeâspecific gene expression and cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lupien et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heintzman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Enhancers function by recruiting sequence-specific transcription factors into chromatin-associated multiprotein complexes. However, the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the regulation and fine-tuning of enhancer activity are still incompletely understood. Our findings strongly suggest that Lsd1 serves a critical role in regulating enhancer activity in hematopoietic cells.</p><p>Lsd1-occupancy data generated from murine and human embryonic stem cells suggested that Lsd1 occupies and regulates virtually all enhancers of embryonic stem cell genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ram et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Whyte et al., 2012</xref>), whereas our data interestingly reveal that Lsd1 occupies only about 30% of active enhancers in mature myeloid cells. Although this is still a considerable number of enhancers, it clearly points toward a somewhat unexpected complexity of enhancer regulation in more mature cells compared to ES cells. In this regard, it is relevant to recall that ES cell chromatin exists in an unique and unusual configuration with widely dispersed open chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Efroni et al., 2008</xref>), and that following differentiation, there is extensive epigenetic reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meshorer and Misteli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Efroni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hiratani et al., 2010</xref>). Recent genome-wide comparisons between fetal and adult hematopoietic cells have illustrated how the epigenetic profile of fetal blood cells differs from adult blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). In light of the global differences in the architecture of embryonic, fetal, and adult epigenetic landscapes, it is noteworthy that our data suggest a somewhat differential requirement for Lsd1 in ES cells vs mature cells, and hence open new avenues to study how other histone demethylases, or other chromatin remodeling factors, participate in the regulation of enhancers during adult tissue differentiation.</p><p>It is critical to discuss that Lsd1 deletion may impact gene expression in additional ways other than misregulation of histone demethylation. For example, loss of Lsd1 protein has been suggested to destabilize the CoREST complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foster et al., 2010</xref>), which has been demonstrated to result in increased global H3K56 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foster et al., 2010</xref>). Future studies will be necessary to dissect whether increased H3K56 acetylation also contributes to the hematopoietic phenotypes observed in this study. Lsd1 is also essential for the stability of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2009a</xref>). We have considered the possibility that a reduction in Dnmt1 levels might contribute to the observed phenotypes in the Lsd1 knockout animals. However, given the subtle hematopoietic phenotypes observed in conditional Dnmt1 knockout animals during steady-state hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">BrÃ¶ske et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Trowbridge et al., 2009</xref>), we believe this to be unlikely.</p><p>Collectively, we identified Lsd1 as indispensible for hematopoietic differentiation. We propose that Lsd1 is an epigenetic governor required broadly for repression of stem cell gene expression programs during embryonic stem cell as well as somatic cell differentiation. Given its crucial role in hematopoietic differentiation, the possibility of Lsd1 as a potential drug target in hematopoietic malignancies will have to be carefully evaluated in the context of potentially detrimental side effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mx1Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">KÃ¼hn et al., 1995</xref>), VavCre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stadtfeld, 2004</xref>), and EpoRCre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heinrich et al., 2004</xref>) mice were described previously and maintained in HEPA filtered cages on a mixed C57BL/6J background.

The deletion of these exons results in a frameshift, causing a premature stop in the mRNA, leading to nonsense-mediated decay of the Lsd1 transcript. Additionally, exons 5 and 6 encode both a flavin adenine dinucleotide (an essential cofactor for Lsd1 enzymatic activity) binding site and the N-terminal portion of the amine oxidase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Total genomic DNA isolated from CJ7 ES cells was used as a template to generate short (1.5-kb) and long (6.2-kb) arms of homology as well as a DNA fragment carrying exons 5 and 6. The homology arms and exons 5 and 6 were cloned using standard techniques into a vector carrying a neomycin resistance cassette to be used for positive selection and expressing thymidine kinase for negative selection (i.e., pBS XF PGKNeo FX TK(r), kind gift from Huafeng Xie, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA). The sequence-verified targeting vector was linearized and electroporated into feeder-dependent CJ9 ES cells (129sv background), followed by selection with 300 Î¼g/ml G418 and ganciclovir. Homologous recombination was identified via Southern blot analysis. For the short arm, EcoRI-digested genomic DNA was screened with a 505-bp external probe.

Products of â¼200 Â± 25 bp (insert plus adaptor and PCR primer sequences) were band isolated from an agarose gel, purified using Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Hercules, CA), and PCR amplified using Phusion Polymerase with Illumina primers for 18 cycles. Amplified fragments were then purified using QIAquick PCR purification Kit (Qiagen, Hercules, CA). The purified DNA was captured on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation. Libraries generated from Lsd1-ChIP (from 32D cells + matching input control), H3K4me1-ChIP, and H3K27ac-ChIP (from wild-type and Lsd1 knockout Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells + matching input control) were sequenced on a HiSeq2000 sequencing system of the Center for Cancer Computational Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute following the manufacturerâs protocols. Raw ChIP-Seq data were processed using the Illumina software pipeline. ChIP-Seq reads were aligned to the reference mouse genome (mm9, NCBI Build 37).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>Helicos</title><p>For ChIP-Seq analysis using the HeliScope Single Molecule Sequencer, ChIP DNA was processed for 3â² polyA tailing, followed by 3â² ddATP-blocking as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thompson and Steinmann, 2010</xref>). Processing samples by ligation, amplification, and size selection are not required by Helicos sequencing. Briefly, 6â10 ng of ChIP DNA or input DNA was used in the 3â² polyA tailing reaction in 14.8 Î¼l containing 2 Î¼l of 2.5 mM CoCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 Î¼l of 10Ã terminal transferase buffer, and nuclease-free water. The reaction mixture was denatured in 95Â°C for 5 min, followed by rapid cooling in ice water slurry. Then 1 U of terminal transferase, 4 Î¼l of 50 Î¼M dATP, and 0.2 Î¼l of NEB BSA were added to the mixture. Samples were incubated in a thermocycler at 37Â°C for 1 hr and 70Â°C for 10 min, followed by denaturing at 95Â°C for 5 min and rapid cooling in ice water slurry. For 3â² ddATP-blocking, 0.5 Î¼l of 200 Î¼M ddATP, 1 Î¼l of 10Ã terminal transferase, 1 Î¼l of 2.5 mM CoCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 U of terminal transferase, and 6.5 Î¼l of nuclear-free water were added to the above reaction. Samples were incubated in a thermocycler at 37Â°C for 1 hr and 70Â°C for 20 min. Then 2 pmol of carrier oligonucleotide were added to the reaction, and samples (H3K4me2-ChIP and H3K4me3-ChIP from wild-type and Lsd1 knockout Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells + matching input control) were hybridized to the Helicos flow cells for sequencing at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) Molecular Biology Core Facility. Sequencing reads were aligned to mouse genome assembly mm9 (NCBI Build 37) using Helisphere software with default parameters. Only the reads that were uniquely aligned to reference genome with read alignment score higher than 4.5 were retained for further analysis.</p><p>Unique reads were mapped to NCBI Build 37 (mm9 assembly) using Bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>). Peaks significantly enriched of ChIP-Seq tags were identified by using Model-based Analysis for ChIP-Seq (MACS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Distribution of enrichment peaks in the distal promoters (â10 kb to â4 kb of TSS), proximal promoters (â4 kb to +2 kb of TSS), exons, introns, and intergenic regions (outside of these defined regions) was calculated. Identified peaks were then mapped to RefSeq annotated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pruitt et al., 2004</xref>) for downstream analyses. To use âMAnormâ normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shao et al., 2012</xref>), one assumes that the true intensities of most common peaks are the same between two ChIP-Seq samples. This assumption is valid when the binding regions represented by the common peaks show a much higher level of colocalization between samples than that expected at random, and thus binding at the common peaks should be determined by similar mechanisms and exhibit similar global binding intensity between samples. Second, the observed differences in sequence read density in common peaks are presumed to reflect the scaling relationship of ChIP-Seq signals between two samples, which can thus be applied to all peaks. Based on these hypotheses, the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of read density between two samples M = log<sub>2</sub> (read density in Lsd1 knockout sample/read density in wild-type sample) was plotted against the average log<sub>2</sub> read density A = 0.5 Ã log<sub>2</sub> (read density in Lsd1 knockout sample Ã read density in wild-type sample) for all peaks, and robust linear regression was applied to fit the global dependence between the M-A values of common peaks for H3K27ac and H3K4me3, whereas only those common peaks that did not overlap with identified Lsd1 peaks were used to fit the model for H3K4me1 and H3K4me2. Finally, the derived linear model was used as a reference for normalization and extrapolated to all peaks. The normalized M value was then used as a quantitative measure of differential binding in each peak region between two samples, with peak regions associated with larger absolute M values exhibiting greater differences in binding. Peaks that displayed twofold higher normalized read density in knockout cells were defined as Lsd1 knockoutâspecific (KO-specific). A similar analysis was performed to identify wild typeâspecific peaks (wt-specific). Peaks with less than twofold changed normalized read densities were defined as common peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2AâD</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Kerenyi et al. shows that hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoiesis depend upon the ability of the Lsd1 demethylase to repress genes that are normally expressed by primitive hematopoietic progenitors. Derepression of these genes in the absence of Lsd1 is associated with HSC depletion, hematopoietic failure, and impaired myeloid differentiation. The manuscript is technically well done. A strength of the manuscript is that it integrates CHIP-seq data with gene expression profiling and an analysis of the knockout mouse phenotype. The observation that Lsd1 activity is required to repress genes expressed by primitive cells, that it appears to regulate enhancer elements, and that failure of this impedes myeloid differentiation is conceptually interesting. On the other hand, Lsd1 has already been shown to be required for hematopoiesis (Sprussel et al, Leukemia 2012) and there was previously published evidence of activity at enhancer elements (Whyte et al. Nature, 2012; Cai et al. Cancer Cell 2011).</p><p>1) Is Lsd1 broadly required for the epigenetic regulation of many cells or is it preferentially required to regulate certain kinds of cells (such as primitive cells)? Is Lsd1 regulating a particular kind of gene expression in multiple systems (is it particularly required by stem cells?) or is it used in different ways by many different kinds of cells such that it is difficult to gain generalizable insights by studying Lsd1 function in a single system? Obviously, this question falls largely outside of the scope of this study; however, some insight into this question would help to indicate whether this study provides insights of general relevance to other systems.</p><p>2) The authors provide evidence that Lsd1 mediates gene expression changes via alterations in H3K4me at enhancer regions (particularly when in combination with changes at promoter regions). While this is a provocative and interesting possibility supported by their studies and studies in ES cells (Whyte et al, Nature 2012), it is worth commenting on possible other Lsd1-mediated mechanisms that may also contribute to gene expression changes and the hematopoietic defects. In the Introduction, they mention work from others on Lsd1-associated mechanisms of gene expression, but they limit their discussion solely to the possibilities they tested and find most novel (namely enhancer effects). The authors should also comment on how other Lsd1-mediated mechanisms of gene expression regulation (changes in DNA methylation, acetylation changes due to disruption of CoREST complex) may also contribute to the phenotypes observed for Lsd1 deficient hematopoietic cells.</p><p>3) The text suggests that Lsd1 deficiency profoundly reduces HSC frequency and function, though this is not apparent when the authors gate on definitive markers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. It would be helpful if a bar graph were included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> indicating HSC frequency.</p><p>4) Do the authors observe any global changes in H3K4me2/me1 levels that correlate with the reduction in Lsd1 levels?</p><p>5) Sprussel et al. (Leukemia 2012) state that Lsd1 deficiency leads to pancytopenia and apoptosis in erythroid cells. Do Kerenyi et al. observe increases in cell death or changes in proliferation among LSK cells, erythroid, or myeloid progenitors?</p><p>6) Abstract and Introduction: the authors emphasize prior studies by other investigators documenting LSD1 association with promoters and stress that their new results support a role at enhancers. However, multiple studies have provided evidence for important LSD1 functions through enhancers, including, but not limited to Whyte et al. Nature, 2012 and Cai et al. Cancer Cell 2011. It is therefore not ideal to make statements such as, ânot restricted to transcription start sites, as suggested by other studiesâ, as published data exist to support a variety of LSD1 target sites.</p><p>7) The authors describe changes in certain parameters with words such as âstarkâ, âsubstantialâ, âdrasticâ, and âprofoundâ.

Med. paper from the Engel group arguing that LSD1 is a target for therapeutic reactivation of fetal globin gene expression. It would be ideal to incorporate a short discussion of how the current results impact upon the concept that LSD1 is a promising therapeutic target for hemoglobinopathies.

Obviously, this question falls largely outside of the scope of this study; however, some insight into this question would help to indicate whether this study provides insights of general relevance to other systems</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers raise an interesting question. Looking at Lsd1 gene expression across numerous murine tissues and cell types using the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://BioGPS.org">BioGPS.org</ext-link> (Wu et al. 2009) online platform (Affymetrix probe sets for murine Lsd1: 1426761_at and 1426762_s_at), it seems that, with few exceptions, Lsd1 mRNA is expressed at similar levels throughout murine tissues/cell types. We did not find evidence that Lsd1 functions specifically in primitive cells. One may speculate that different cell type/lineage specific transcription factors recruit Lsd1 to different target genes and therefore drive other gene expression programs. However, taking into account that we observed derepression of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell gene signatures in fully committed cells such as Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells, CD71<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> proerythroblasts, as well as primitive hematopoietic stem cells, suggests that Lsd1 is regulating this particular kind of gene expression program in multiple cell types. Our data, however, cannot exclude the possibility that Lsd1 regulates additional functions in hematopoietic or other cell types. It is interesting to note that Lsd1 is very highly expressed in murine embryonic stem cells. In line with our findings, downregulation of Lsd1 in murine embryonic stem cells impairs their differentiation capacity and interferes with downregulation of pluripotency genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Whyte et al. 2012</xref>). Taken together, the findings in ESCs and our findings in hematopoietic stem cells, one can conclude that Lsd1 is critically important in two kinds of primitive cells, but it remains to be tested in other developmental contexts.</p><p><italic>2) The authors provide evidence that Lsd1 mediates gene expression changes via alterations in H3K4me at enhancer regions (particularly when in combination with changes at promoter regions). While this is a provocative and interesting possibility supported by their studies and studies in ES cells (Whyte et al, Nature 2012), it is worth commenting on possible other Lsd1-mediated mechanisms that may also contribute to gene expression changes and the hematopoietic defects. In the Introduction, they mention work from others on Lsd1-associated mechanisms of gene expression, but they limit their discussion solely to the possibilities they tested and find most novel (namely enhancer effects). The authors should also comment on how other Lsd1-mediated mechanisms of gene expression regulation (changes in DNA methylation, acetylation changes due to disruption of CoREST complex) may also contribute to the phenotypes observed for Lsd1 deficient hematopoietic cells</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers and we have now incorporated a new section into the Discussion deliberating on a potential contributing effect of changes in DNA methylation due to reduced stability of DNMT1 in the absence of Lsd1. We also reflect on the possibility of altered histone acetylation due to disruption of the CoREST complex contributing to the observed hematopoietic phenotype.</p><p><italic>3) The text suggests that Lsd1 deficiency profoundly reduces HSC frequency and function, though this is not apparent when the authors gate on definitive markers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. It would be helpful if a bar graph were included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> indicating HSC frequency</italic>.</p><p>Using the alternative gating strategy outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> we found that lineage negative CD150<sup>+</sup> CD48<sup>-</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> LT-HSCs were actually even increased. We have now clarified this in the text and included the LT-HSC frequencies into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) Do the authors observe any global changes in H3K4me2/me1 levels that correlate with the reduction in Lsd1 levels</italic>?</p><p>This is an important point, which is addressed by Western blot analysis of all Lsd1 substrates (H3K4me2/me1 and H3K9me2/me1) on Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> as well as Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre whole bone marrow lysates. We did not observe global changes in H3K4me2/me1 or H3K9me2/me1 levels in Lsd1 knockout samples. We have described this in the text and added a new panel to the manuscript showing this Western blot as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) Sprussel et al. (Leukemia 2012) state that Lsd1 deficiency leads to pancytopenia and apoptosis in erythroid cells. Do Kerenyi et al. observe increases in cell death or changes in proliferation among LSK cells, erythroid, or myeloid progenitors</italic>?</p><p>In order to address this question we performed Annexin V staining followed by flow cytometry of Lsd1 knockout LT-HSCs, Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells and CD71<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> proerythroblasts. Like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">SprÃ¼ssel et al. 2012</xref>) we observed increased apoptosis in CD71<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> proerythroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We did not detect significant changes in the levels of apoptosis in Lsd1 knockout LT-HSCs or Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We also determined the cell cycle status of the same cell types using Hoechst 33,342 uptake. We did not observe an increase in proliferation in Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells or CD71<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> proerythroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). We did, however, observe a 2- fold increase in the number of proliferating knockout LT-HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). This finding is in keeping with the increased frequency of LT-HSCs observed in Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and suggests compensatory LT-HSC expansion due to downstream differentiation defects.</p><p><italic>6) Abstract and Introduction: the authors emphasize prior studies by other investigators documenting LSD1 association with promoters and stress that their new results support a role at enhancers. However, multiple studies have provided evidence for important LSD1 functions through enhancers, including, but not limited to Whyte et al. Nature, 2012 and Cai et al. Cancer Cell 2011.

We are aware and referenced that Lsd1 has been described before to be involved in the regulation of enhancer sites.

We have now included a brief discussion of the two recent papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shi et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al. 2013</xref>) that demonstrate that inhibition of Lsd1 results in upregulation of Î³-globin gene expression. We indicated in the Discussion that prospects for the utility of small molecule inhibitors against Lsd1 for therapy of hematologic diseases rests on the availability of an adequate therapeutic window.</p><p>References:</p><p>Harris, W.J. et al., 2012.
