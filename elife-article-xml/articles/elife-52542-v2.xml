chromatin in eukaryotes and fundamental to our understanding of eukaryotic gene regulation. In archaea, histones are widespread but not universal: several lineages have lost histone genes. What prompted or facilitated these losses and how archaea without histones organize their chromatin remains largely unknown. Here, we elucidate primary chromatin architecture in an archaeon without histones, <italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum,</italic> which harbors a HU family protein (HTa) that protects part of the genome from micrococcal nuclease digestion. Charting HTa-based chromatin architecture in vitro, in vivo and in an HTa-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, we present evidence that HTa is an archaeal histone analog. HTa preferentially binds to GC-rich sequences, exhibits invariant positioning throughout the growth cycle, and shows archaeal histone-like oligomerization behavior. Our results suggest that HTa, a DNA-binding protein of bacterial origin, has converged onto an architectural role filled by histones in other archaea.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Thermoplasma acidophilum</kwd><kwd>Methanothermus fervidus</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>histones</kwd><kwd>convergent evolution</kwd><kwd>archaea</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_A658_5TY40</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warnecke</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In <italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum</italic>, an archaeon without histones, a DNA-binding protein acquired from bacteria via horizontal gene transfer mediates histone-like chromatin architecture.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Across all domains of life, DNA is intimately associated with proteins that wrap, package, and protect it. Bacteria typically encode multiple small basic proteins that are dynamically expressed and fulfill a variety of architectural roles by bridging, wrapping, or bending DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dillon and Dorman, 2010</xref>). Some of these proteins are phylogenetically widespread, others restricted to specific lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Swiercz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lagomarsino et al., 2015</xref>). Bacterial chromatin, on the whole, is diverse and dynamic over both physiological and evolutionary timescales. In contrast, a single group of proteins has come to dominate chromatin in eukaryotes: histones. Assembling into octameric complexes that wrap ~ 147 bp of DNA, eukaryotic histones not only mediate genome compaction but also establish a basal landscape of differential accessibility, elaborated via a plethora of post-translational modifications, that is fundamental to our understanding of eukaryotic gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jiang and Pugh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bai and Morozov, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Histones are also widespread in archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henneman et al., 2018</xref>). They have the same core fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Decanniere et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>) as eukaryotic histones, but lack N- and typically also C-terminal tails, the principal substrates for post-translational modifications in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henneman et al., 2018</xref>). Dimers in solution, they assemble into tetramers that wrap ~ 60 bp of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bailey et al., 1999</xref>). This minimal nucleosomal unit can be extended, at least in some archaea, into a longer oligomer via incorporation of additional dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xie and Reeve, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maruyama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>). Like their eukaryotic counterparts, archaeal nucleosomes preferentially bind sequences that facilitate wrapping, for example by means of periodically spaced GC/GG/AA/TT dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bailey and Reeve, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bailey et al., 2000</xref>). On average, nucleosome occupancy is higher on more GC-rich sequences and lower around transcriptional start and end sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ammar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nalabothula et al., 2013</xref>), which tend to be AT-rich. The precise role of archaeal histones in transcription regulation, however, remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gehring et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although widespread, archaeal histones are less entrenched than histones in eukaryotes: they have been deleted experimentally in several species without dramatic effects on transcription and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heinicke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weidenbach et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dulmage et al., 2015</xref>) and lost altogether from a handful of archaeal lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2017</xref>). A particularly intriguing case concerns the thermophilic acidophile <italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum,</italic> which lacks histone genes but instead encodes a protein named HTa (<bold>H</bold>istone-like protein of <bold><italic>T</italic></bold><italic>hermoplasma <bold>a</bold>cidophilum</italic>). Based on its primary sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeLange et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drlica and Rouviere-Yaniv, 1987</xref>) and predicted secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>), HTa is a member of the HU family of proteins. As in <italic>E. coli,</italic> where the average cell during exponential growth contains an estimated 30,000–55,000 HU molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali Azam et al., 1999</xref>), HU proteins are often abundant constituents of bacterial chromatin. They are also frequently essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grove, 2011</xref>) and broadly distributed across bacterial phyla (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Although individual members of the HU family have diverged in their DNA binding properties, even distant homologs display functional similarities, constraining negative supercoils and binding not only B-form but also structurally unusual DNA such as cruciforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grove, 2011</xref>). Outside bacteria, HU proteins are comparatively rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). They are found with a modicum of phylogenetic persistence only in some single-celled eukaryotes, where they are known to play important functional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sasaki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gornik et al., 2012</xref>), and in a single clade of archaea: the Thermoplasmatales/deep-sea hydrothermal vent euryarchaeota (DHVE2 group). Phylogenetic reconstruction of the HTa/HU gene family suggests that HTa was acquired via horizontal gene transfer from bacteria at the root of this clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, see Materials and methods).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Predicted structure and measured abundance of HTa.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Predicted secondary structures of HTa (<italic>T. acidophilum</italic>), the bacterial HU protein HupA (<italic>E. coli</italic>), and the archaeal histone protein HmfA (<italic>M. fervidus</italic>).

Pioneering work by Searcy and colleagues showed that MNase digestion of native <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> chromatin yields two distinct fragment sizes of ~ 40 bp and ~ 80 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Searcy and Stein, 1980</xref>). The same authors observed a similar banding pattern when they digested calf thymus DNA following in vitro reconstitution with purified HTa, suggesting that native HTa is sufficient for and likely the principal mediator of protection from MNase digestion in <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Searcy and Stein, 1980</xref>). It remains unknown, however, where HTa binds to the <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> genome in vivo; whether HTa binds in a sequence-specific manner or promiscuously; whether it requires particular post-translational modifications to carry out its functions; whether binding is dynamic in response to environmental changes; and how binding relates to functional genomic landmarks. Crucially, we do not know how HTa-mediated chromatin organization in <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> compares to that in histone-encoding archaea: do HTa and histones fill similar functional and architectural niches? Or are their binding patterns and functional repercussions entirely distinct?</p><p>Here, to begin to address these questions, we characterize genome-wide chromatin organization in <italic>T. acidophilum</italic>. Using MNase treatment coupled to high-throughput sequencing, we find footprints of protection throughout the genome. Confirming prior results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Searcy and Stein, 1980</xref>), we observe a bimodal distribution of protected fragment sizes and subsequently infer small and large binding footprints. The more common smaller footprints are well predicted by simple sequence features and display a general preference for GC-rich sequences. We observe the same preferences in an HTa-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, when we reconstitute chromatin using purified HTa and <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> genomic DNA, and in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) of GC-variable DNA oligos, consistent with sequence as a key determinant of HTa binding in vivo. HTa sequence preferences, positioning around transcription start sites, and static behavior throughout the growth cycle are reminiscent of archaeal histones rather than well-characterized bacterial HU homologs. In addition, we present evidence that larger fragments are frequently derived from nucleation-extension events akin to oligomerization of archaeal histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maruyama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nalabothula et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>). Our results suggest that, in key aspects of its molecular behavior, HTa can be regarded as an archaeal histone analog.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Primary chromatin structure across the <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> growth cycle</title><p>To elucidate genome-wide HTa binding in vivo, we carried out a series of MNase experiments across the <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> growth cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Throughout, MNase digestion yielded protected fragments of two distinct sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), in line with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Searcy and Stein, 1980</xref>). MNase digestion of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells expressing recombinant HTa produced a very similar protection pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). This demonstrates that HTa readily binds DNA outside its native cellular environment and does not require <italic>T. acidophilum</italic>-specific post-translational modifications or binding partners to protect from MNase digestion, consistent with previous in vitro reconstitution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Searcy and Stein, 1980</xref>). In contrast, native <italic>E. coli</italic> HU (HupA), even when strongly over-expressed from the same plasmid, does not confer significant protection under equivalent digestion conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Neither do HU orthologs from <italic>Thermobacillus composti</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus floricola</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which have higher sequence identity to HTa (37% and 39% compared to 27% for <italic>E. coli</italic> HupA).

At least in part, this reflects digestion conditions: fragments obtained after doubling digestion time from 15 to 30 min are shorter and map inside larger footprints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). We chose and persisted with a somewhat milder digest here to avoid over-digestion of small fragments.</p><p>We then mapped fragments, irrespective of their size, to the <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> genome (see Materials and methods). Protection across the genome is both ubiquitous and heterogeneous, with relatively even coverage along the origin-terminus axis once increased copy number of early replicating regions is taken into account (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f–g</xref>). Major drop-offs in coverage correspond to areas of low GC content, as evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, formally shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, and further explored below. For any given growth phase, genome-wide occupancy is highly correlated across replicates (mean ρ = 0.89, p&lt;2.2e-16 for all pairwise comparisons). For each time point, we therefore merged reads across replicates and called peaks independently for small and large fragments (see Materials and methods). Globally, peak locations vary little across the growth cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). Below, we will focus on data from exponential phase (day 2), where we observe 13,915 narrow and 6887 broad peaks, before discussing variability of HTa-mediated chromatin architecture across the growth cycle in the context of transcriptional changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Analysis of HTa binding footprints suggests histone-like oligomerization behavior</title><p>Considering read coverage around called peaks, it is evident that small and large fragments often overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,f</xref>), indicating the presence of different protective entities in the same location across cells. Importantly, broad peaks are typically a combination of small and large fragments and often show asymmetric coverage (caused by smaller fragments) around the summit of the inferred peak (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> for an example).

As the MNase signal broadly tracks GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>), we first considered nucleotide enrichment patterns associated with peaks. At a coarse level, we find that both broad and narrow peaks exhibit relatively elevated GC content at their center and are flanked by short stretches of GC depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i,j</xref>). In line with promiscuous binding, a specific binding motif, as one would observe for most transcription factors, is not evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For broader peaks, it is worth noting that, in both <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> and <italic>M. fervidus</italic>, once we have re-oriented the small fragment coverage signal as described above, peak-internal GC content positively tracks small fragment abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j,k</xref>), supporting a model where nucleation happens on more GC-rich sites whereas sequence need not be as favorable for subsequent extension events. Note, however, that while sequence might be more important for nucleation than extension, it is by no means irrelevant for the latter: narrow peaks where large fragments are rare tend to be flanked by more AT-rich sequence in both <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> and <italic>M. fervidus</italic>, suggesting that sequence can prevent or at least predispose against oligomer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>).</p><p>We then considered dinucleotide frequencies in reads of defined lengths, restricting the analysis to reads that overlap previously defined peaks by at least 90% and discarding duplicate reads that mapped to the same genomic location, so as not to bias results towards highly occupied footprints.

Expectedly, local enrichment patterns get weaker and eventually disappear when considering reads increasingly further away from modal fragment lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Unexpectedly, we also find mononucleotide and RR/YY (R = A or G; Y = T or C) profiles similar to those previously observed for – and attributed to the unique geometry of – eukaryotic histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reynolds et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ioshikhes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quintales et al., 2015</xref>).

We selected five 100 bp regions across the <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> genome with very low to very high (5<sup>th</sup>, 25<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup>, 75<sup>th</sup>, 95<sup>th</sup> percentile) occupancy in vivo and similarly low/high occupancy in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). These ‘backbone’ oligos were then further diversified by introducing eight random dinucleotides at defined positions along the backbone to generate a large library of double-stranded DNA oligos with variable nucleotide content (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Addition of HTa retards the migration of a subset of dsDNA oligos in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c,d</xref>). At high HTa:DNA mass ratios, the majority of oligos are subject to retardation, as expected from proteins that, like histones, have compositional preferences but are capable of binding most sequences. To understand HTa binding preferences, we need to investigate differences at low HTa:DNA stoichiometry. To identify sequences preferentially bound by HTa when HTa is limiting, we therefore excised and sequenced individual bands from two replicate experiments carried out at an HTa:DNA mass ratio of 0.2 (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). To determine whether the different oligo backbones act as anticipated even outside their native genomic context, we considered the proportion of reads derived from a given backbone that were found in the slowest-migrating band (‘HTa-bound slow’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). The expectation here is that backbones with higher occupancy in vivo and in vitro should be bound more readily or with greater affinity by HTa and therefore be relatively enriched in the slowest-migrating band (quantified as the proportion of reads of a given type, <italic>P<sub>slow</sub></italic>, found in the HTa-bound slow band, see Materials and methods). The data confirm this expectation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), with the exception of the most AT-rich oligo, which exhibits unexpectedly high <italic>P<sub>slow</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), a phenomenon previously also observed for eukaryotic histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tillo and Hughes, 2009</xref>). We exclude sequences derived from this backbone, whose low occupancy in vivo and in vitro might be contingent on wider sequence context, from further analysis. For the remaining oligos, we then ask if <italic>P<sub>slow</sub></italic> varies as a function of nucleotide content, as predicted by our MNase-Seq data. We find this to be the case. <italic>P<sub>slow</sub></italic> is positively correlated with GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) and, even more strikingly, with the number of GpC dinucleotides in the oligo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). The latter is noteworthy because GpC dinucleotide content is the strongest individual predictor in Lasso models for in vivo chromatin occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). This orthogonal experiment corroborates that HTa has an unusual, histone-like preference for GC-rich DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A hidden diversity of large fragments in exponential phase</title><p>As demonstrated above, the Lasso model trained on in vivo chromatin predicts small fragment occupancy across the growth cycle well (ρ &gt; 0.7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Curiously, it performs much worse when trying to predict large fragment coverage in exponential phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, day 2, ρ = 0.43, p&lt;2.2e-16). Why would this be? We reasoned that larger fragments might come from a mixture of protective binding events. For example, in addition to nucleation-extension events, larger fragments might results from a different mode of HTa binding that is independent of prior sequence-driven nucleation (‘independent fragments’). Alternatively, larger fragments may reflect the binding of an altogether different protein or protein complex that happens to protect a similar-sized piece of DNA. To explore this hypothesis, we divided broad peaks into deciles based on the relative coverage of small fragments at these peaks. Doing so, we find that broad peaks where small fragments are rarest show strongly divergent sequence composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>).

Whereas well-characterized HU homologs exhibit elevated occupancy in AT-rich regions, prefer an AT-rich motif at the center of the binding footprint, or bind sequence non-selectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Swinger and Rice, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grove, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prieto et al., 2012</xref>), HTa shows a more histone-like preference for GC and even exhibits asymmetric mononucleotide/RR/YY profiles across the dyad. The in vitro experiments we present above make a cogent argument for sequence as a principal determinant of HTa binding in vivo. Sequence-driven positioning around functional genomic landmarks, footprint extension dynamics, and relative positional stability throughout the growth cycle are also reminiscent of archaeal histones, as is the ability of HTa to protect DNA from MNase digestion. Based on these observations, we propose that HTa can be regarded as an archaeal histone analog.</p><p>This analogy is, of course, preliminary. Structural work will be required to characterize how HTa interacts with DNA and to determine whether large HTa-protected fragments reflect closely spaced binding events or, in further analogy to archaeal histones, the presence of contiguous HTa polymers. The observation that even larger protected fragments can be formed when HTa is expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) or reconstituted in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) is interesting in this regard and deserves further exploration. Additional work is also required to elucidate the interaction partners and physiological functions of HTa, including its involvement in transcription. Although we find no obvious global link between changes in HTa occupancy and transcriptional output, this does not preclude local effects or dynamics at a time-scale where information on nascent transcription – rather than steady-state RNA levels – would be required to implicate HTa. Neither do our results rule out an important but constitutive role in transcription, for example in binding to and constraining negative supercoils similar to what has been observed for other HU homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grove, 2011</xref>) and archaeal chromatin proteins such as MC1, Sul7, and Cren7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Of course, the main function(s) of HTa might simply not lie in transcription. Searcy and co-workers showed that HTa facilitates re-annealing following DNA denaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stein and Searcy, 1978</xref>), suggesting that HTa might assist DNA renaturation after thermal stress. Our finding of heterogeneous but predictable HTa occupancy across the genome implies that re-annealing would proceed differentially in genic and intergenic regions, leaving the latter unbound and free to engage in binding of protein complexes for transcription. However, the physiological importance of HTa-mediated reannealing remains to be established and is put into perspective by the observation that <italic>E. coli</italic> HU, when added to naked DNA, also significantly raises its melting temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drlica and Rouviere-Yaniv, 1987</xref>). Another possibility is that HTa is involved in higher order genome structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bohrmann et al., 1990</xref>) or, like many HU family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grove, 2011</xref>), in DNA repair. To dissect these and other hypothetical biological functions in vivo in the future and address whether archaeal histones can functionally substitute for HTa, the development of genetic tools for <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> is highly desirable.</p><p>Finally, from an evolutionary perspective, it is worth highlighting dinoflagellates as a second case where histones have lost their pre-eminent role in genome compaction and organization to other small basic proteins. Even though histones remain encoded in dinoflagellate genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marinov and Lynch, 2016</xref>), and might continue to play important roles in transcription or other processes, they are no longer the main protein constituent of chromatin. Instead, proteins with homologs in phycodnaviruses have become the principal mediators of compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gornik et al., 2012</xref>). In a subset of species, these dinoflagellate/viral nucleoproteins (DVNPs) act alongside HU-like proteins that were likely acquired from bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Janouškovec et al., 2017</xref>) and might be involved in the genesis and maintenance of DNA loop structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan and Wong, 2007</xref>). If not exactly a precedent, the case of dinoflagellates nonetheless serves to illustrate that HU proteins are versatile, evolvable and have been independently co-opted into important chromatin architectural roles following horizontal transfer. It also highlights that histones or a subset of their functions can be replaced, under the right circumstances, by alternative DNA-binding proteins with fundamentally different folds. At the same time, our results demonstrate that such replacements, even though they appear radical, need not necessarily go hand in hand with fundamental changes to the architectural layout of chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Thermoplasma acidophilum <italic>culture</italic></title><p><italic>T. acidophilum</italic> strain 122-1B2 was obtained from DSMZ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dsmz.de/">https://www.dsmz.de/</ext-link>) and cultured using the medium described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Searcy and Stein (1980)</xref>, supplemented to a final concentration of 2 g/L yeast extract (BD Biosciences).

Based on the domain identification, we then selected only those sequences from each set that contained a single, complete domain. The bacterial set was further reduced by selecting only those sequences less than or equal to 110 amino acids. Given the relative scarcity of sequences in the other kingdoms, their sequences were not size-filtered. The final set comprised 30 archaeal, 164 eukaryotic, 112 viral, and 1920 bacterial sequences.</p><p>We note that the hits to archaeal (N = 30) and eukaryotic (N = 164) genomes that we obtained, arguably fall into two classes. The first class comprises putative homologs that are isolated from other archaeal/eukaryotic hits on the phylogeny in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>. In principle, these putative homologs might constitute rare cases of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), with a narrow phylogenetic footprint indicating recent arrival. In many, if not most instances, however, these cases likely represent bacterial contaminants in published genome assemblies. This particularly concerns a number of cases where purportedly eukaryotic/archaeal sequences branch with high support with a bacterial sequence. Some examples of such pairs are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. Further indicating likely contamination, several phylogenetically haphazard hits are found even in, for example, mammalian genomes, where rates of horizontal transfer are thought to be extremely low. A striking example is the genome of the Tibetan antelope (<italic>Pantholops hodgsonii</italic>), which – at face value – harbors three different HU proteins affiliated with divergent branches of the bacterial HU phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Contamination might also be the most conservative (and parsimonious) explanation for some hits to phylogenetically isolated archaeal genomes, especially when these were assembled from metagenomic samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>Hits belonging to the second class, in contrast, have at least some phylogenetic persistence and coherence, indicative of vertical inheritance. Amongst eukaryotes, this notably includes homologs in dinoflagellates, some algae, and apicomplexa (including Plasmodium, Theileria, and Babesia species) – all single-celled organism, which have either acquired HU proteins from their resident organelles or unrelated HGT events. As mentioned above, functional roles for HU proteins have been described for at least some species in these clades.</p><p>There are few putative HU homologs in archaeal genomes, with the majority of hits (23/30) belonging to the Thermoplasmatales/DHVE2 clade. Thermoplasmatales/DHVE2 hits are monophyletic (85% bootstrap support, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), with the exception of a single sequence (Thermoplasmata M8B2D, PNX46291.1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), which clusters with 71% bootstrap support with HU from <italic>Desulfobacula toluolica</italic>, a proteobacterium, potentially indicative of contamination or recent HGT. A small number of sequences (4) from halophilic archaea, including <italic>Halorubrum aidingense</italic> JCM 13560 (EMA66313.1), are embedded amongst Bacteriodetes sequences and appear to form a reasonably coherent phylogenetic unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Note, however, that the sequence search space contained many other genomes from halophilic archaea, including model organisms such as <italic>Haloferax volcanii,</italic> which did not yield any hits, suggesting that HU proteins in these four species might, again, represent recent acquisitions or assembly contaminants rather than established parts of the functional genome.</p><p>Regarding the likely origin of HTa in the Thermoplasmatales/DHVE2 clade, we note that relationships amongst deeper nodes are generally very poorly resolved (as illustrated by smaller node sizes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), including in relation to the Thermoplasmatales/DHVE2 clade. There is no strongly supported relationship with particular bacterial sequences that would suggest an ancestral bacterial donor clade. However, HGT remains the most parsimonious explanation for the phyletic distribution of hits, especially in light of the observation that HTa is absent from other members of the larger Diaforarchaea clade, within which Thermoplasmatales/DHVE2 branch.</p><p>Sequences were aligned using the Constraint-based Multiple Alignment Tool (COBALT) through the NCBI web-interface (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/cobalt/cobalt.cgi">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/cobalt/cobalt.cgi</ext-link>) with default parameters.

protein of <italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum</italic>, a hyperthermophilic archaeal species. HTa is a homologue of the bacterial HU protein; HU has been investigated extensively for its role in bacterial genome organization and gene regulation. Unlike many other archaeal species, <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> lacks histones. The authors show that HTa functions to package <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> DNA into a chromatin-like structure. Thus, the paper provides strong evidence that HTa functions equivalently to an archaeal histone. This is an important discovery because it shows there is more than one evolutionary path to packaging DNA into chromatin, and it explains how some archaea manage without histones. It will be exciting to see how HTa impacts <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> physiology, and whether other archaeal species lacking histones have evolved alternative ways to package their DNA.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;The DNA-binding protein HTa from <italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum</italic> is an archaeal histone analog&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Amy Schmid (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The two major concerns of the reviewers, which I share, are (i) insufficient evidence that the genome-wide pattern of MNase-protected fragments in <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> is due to HTa, and (ii) uncertainty as to whether the HTa sequence specificity inferred from the MNase/sequencing datasets are due to HTa binding, or occur as a result of MNase biases. Both of these points are addressable with additional experiments. For example, point (i) could be addressed by analyzing the MNase-protected fragments from <italic>E. coli</italic> expressing HTa or immunoprecipitating HTa prior to MNase treatment, and point (ii) could be addressed by making libraries from genomic DNA digested with MNase and comparing to the MNase-protected DNA from living cells. Given the length of time it would take to perform these experiments, the manuscript has been rejected. However, if you were to do these experiments, and the overall conclusions of the study remained the same, we would encourage you to resubmit.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Most archaeal species, but not all, encode histone proteins. Although the utility and requirements for histones differ between species, interest remains in how non-histone encoding archaeal species organize their genomes. A plethora of small basic proteins have been identified, primarily in the Crenarchaeaota, which impact genomic architectures. The manuscript in review approaches an outstanding question of whether the apparently horizontally transferred HU-like proteins found in some archaeal genomes plays a dominant role in chromosome organization. Unfortunately, the manuscript fails to resolve impactful questions of archaeal biology, chromosome organization, or the biological role of HTa to an extent that could warrant publication.</p><p>Hocher et al. present a detailed statistical analysis of MNase-seq data from the archaeon <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> to propose that a HU-like protein (HTa) binds the genome and organizes such in an manner analogous to the organization resultant from histone-binding in histone-encoding archaeal species. The results presented suggest that HTa may play a role in genome organization but no evidence for transcriptional regulation is supported by the current data. Through extensive mathematically and statistical manipulations, the authors largely come to the conclusions supported by work in the late 70s and early 80s… HTa is abundant, binds most of the genome, and likely can bind at adjacent positions or multimerize to generate larger complexes that result in larger regions of protection.</p><p>All of the conclusions and interpretations are from MNase-seq data, with no supporting in vitro data with purified HTa to support sequence-binding preferences or oligomerization potential. This is a major flaw. Genetic systems are not available for <italic>T. acidophilum</italic>, thus no biologically manipulations are possible and no inferences from the MNase-seq data can be borne-out at the organismal level. Although outside of the scope of what could be requested, the absence of biologically relevant data is disappointing. The results are thus likely of limited utility to the archaeal, chromatin, or transcription communities. Some of the mathematical modeling and statistical analyses could be of value to the community, but as applied here, offer little to no insight into biological function. Throughout the text, the authors repeatedly state that the existing data are not sufficient to support interpretations of biological function.</p><p>The current experimental work is not sufficient to support interpretations beyond broad interpretations that have been in the literature for ~40 years. While technically sound, the manuscript lacks impact and will not alter the course of future experimentation, inferences concerning archaeal evolution, genomic architecture, or transcription regulation in the third domain.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Hocher et al. investigate the chromatin structure of <italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum</italic>, a hyperthermophilic archaeal species. In particular, they provide evidence that HTa, a homolog of bacterial HU, functions as a major chromatin protein of this species. The paper is built around MNase digestion and a thorough analysis of MNase-Seq data, including comparisons to other species. The experiments and analyses are well-designed, reporting the genome-wide positioning of chromatin DNA, its sequence preferences, possible oligomerisation of the HU molecular, as well as differences with its known bacterial homologs and convergence with archaeal histones. The data provides strong evidence that HTa acts as an archaeal histone analog, the central hypothesis of the paper. The work is exciting and novel from several standpoints. First, the study examines the chromatin structure of an archaeon that lacks a histone homolog, which has not yet been attempted. Second, and more importantly, the paper adds significantly to a small body of evidence that supports a new hypothesis that archaeal chromatin proteins are diverse, dynamic, and vary by phylogenetic lineage in terms of structure and function. There are a few points where further clarity on the analysis and text revisions are needed to support the main conclusions.</p><p>1) Was MNase-seq performed on <italic>E. coli</italic> heterologously expressing HTa? If so, this would help confirm which signals observed in the native host are specific to HTa and which require other proteins (e.g. those signals attributed to nucleation-dependent vs independent fragments). If not, please explain why.</p><p>2) Figure 4 I,J. This analysis reveals that protected segments are GC-rich. In particular, the analysis about the possible oligomerization: &quot;nucleation&quot; by a single molecule and extension to form a larger chromatin structure, mediated by GC-richness and hindered by ATrich sequences, is very thorough. However, as the authors note in subsection “HTa exhibits histone-like sequence preferences”, it has been reported that MNase preferentially digests DNA at AT-rich sequences, and hence the GC-richness of the apparent peaks could partly result from enzyme bias. In addition, the paper the authors cite regarding this issue (Allan et al., 2012) reports an insignificant difference in binding occupancy based on MNase vs CAD digestion, but to my knowledge, does not report on differences in sequence bias of regions protected during digestion by each of these enzymes. In contrast, (Chung et al., 2010) suggest using a matched control with MNase-digested naked DNA to correct for the bias. The authors of the current study mention a sonicated naked DNA control to correct for &quot;…bias in coverage associated with replication…&quot;, but it is unclear whether the MNase-digested naked DNA control was performed as well. In support of the claims made, the authors do note &quot;read-internal&quot; sequence enrichments and AT-rich regions within protected fragments, neither of which would be expected from MNase bias alone. However, the sequence patterns of protected regions is a major conclusion of the paper. Given the data on hand, is there any way to correct for MNase digestion bias across the sequence analyses? If not, can the authors explain more clearly and specifically explain how the sequence bias of MNase could impact their results, for example differential digestion (complete vs incomplete) as an alternative cause/ interpretation of the different peak widths, and as an alternative explanation for the AT boundaries for small fragments, etc?</p><p>3) Figure 5. The authors examine nucleotide frequencies within the dyad. Interestingly, they appear to find a pattern of repeating AT or GC dinucleotides. It has been suggested (Struhl and Segal Nat Struct Mol Biol 2014) that a 10bp periodic repeat of such dinucleotides could facilitate histone-DNA interaction. Did the authors detect any periodicity in the observed MNase sequences? Across the genome as a whole?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The DNA-binding protein HTa from <italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum</italic> is an archaeal histone analog&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

First, to address point (i), we have analysed MNase-Seq data from <italic>E. coli</italic> expressing HTa. We find qualitatively identical nucleotide enrichment patterns in the fragments retrieved from HTa-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> but not in reads from an <italic>E. coli</italic> genomic DNA digest (Figure 5F in the manuscript). This finding, discussed in subsection “HTa exhibits histone-like sequence preferences” of the revised manuscript, supports the notion that the patterns observed in <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> chiefly reflect HTa binding.</p><p>To address point (ii), we made libraries from MNase-digested <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> naked genomic DNA. These libraries exhibit the typical MNase cleavage signature at the end of reads, demonstrating that MNase worked as expected. Importantly, however, the correlation in coverage between native chromatin and genomic DNA is poor (ρ=0.07, Figure 5G) and we find no nucleotide enrichment patterns inside reads from our genomic DNA library (Figure 5F). These results, also discussed in subsection “HTa exhibits histone-like sequence preferences” of the revised manuscript, argue strongly against the possibility that the native chromatin digest is to any great extent a reflection of MNase digestion biases.</p><p>We wanted to go further than the experiments suggested by the reviewers and establish beyond reasonable doubt that HTa exhibits a preference for GC-rich sequences and that, as we suggested in the initial version of the manuscript, intrinsic sequence preferences are a key driver of HTa binding in vivo. We therefore carried out two experiments not explicitly requested by the reviewers but which we thought would best allay lingering doubts (discussed in subsection “HTa exhibits histone-like sequence preferences” of the revised manuscript).</p><p>First, we reconstituted HTa and <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> genomic DNA in vitro, digested the samples with MNase, and sequenced the resulting fragments. We find an excellent correlation between HTa occupancy in vitro and in vivo (small fragments: ρ=0.62, P&lt; 2.2e-16) and a LASSO model trained on the in vitro data predicts the observed in vivo data remarkably well (new Figure 6B, ρ=0.68, P&lt; 2.2e-16), strongly supporting the view that sequence is the principal determinant of HTa occupancy in vivo.</p><p>Second, to provide orthogonal evidence for sequence preferences that does not involve MNase digestion, we designed and carried out an EMSA-seq experiment. Briefly, based on the <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> in vivo digest, we selected five 100bp regions across the <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> genome with very low to very high (5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th percentile) occupancy. We then generated a large and diverse library of double-stranded DNA oligos with different GC contents by introducing random dinucleotides at 8 defined positions along these five backbones. Combining this library with purified HTa, we then carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), which revealed distinct bands corresponding to differential HTa binding (new Figure 6C,D). Analyzing differential composition of oligos across bands migrating at different speed, we find a marked enrichment for GC-rich sequences in the slow-migrating HTa-bound band (Figure 6E,F and figure supplements).</p><p>Thus, MNase digestion of HTa-expressing <italic>E. coli, T. acidophilum</italic> genomic DNA, in vitro reconstituted <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> chromatin and orthogonal EMSA experiments all support and further bolster our original conclusions, that HTa prefers GC-rich sequences, positions according to intrinsic sequence preferences in vivo and therefore exhibits key characteristics associated with histones in other organisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Most archaeal species, but not all, encode histone proteins.

Rather, in charting the binding footprints of HTa genome-wide – and thereby providing the first global chromatin landscape in an archaeon without histones – we discovered something unexpected. HTa, unlike its bacterial orthologs, does not prefer AT-biased sequences or lacks sequence preferences altogether. Instead, it favours GC-rich sequences in a fashion remarkably reminiscent of histones. As we see it, the main impact of this manuscript does not lie in providing a detailed mechanistic understanding of the functional role(s) of HTa in <italic>T. acidophilum</italic>, but in the demonstration that a protein of bacterial origin has converged onto properties normally associated with histone proteins, with broad implications for our understanding of chromatin evolution and evolvability. To name but one: our results show that the presence of different principal building blocks need not imply different chromatin architecture but that, in fact, two proteins with fundamentally different folds can give rise to very similar types of organization.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that much remains to be done in dissecting the biological roles of HTa.

We therefore think it honest and scholarly to highlight the fact that current data offer little insight into biological function. Since we did generate steady state transcriptomic data, we thought it interesting to ask whether there are correlations between HTa binding and transcriptional change. We did not see any such correlations. Whether this is because HTa has genuinely no dynamic role in regulating transcription will, as we point out, require further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The current experimental work is not sufficient to support interpretations beyond broad interpretations that have been in the literature for ~40 years.
