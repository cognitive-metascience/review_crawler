malaria incidence and mortality worldwide. Understanding the biology of these important and related parasites was previously constrained by the lack of robust molecular and genetic approaches. Here, we establish CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in a culture-adapted <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> strain and define parameters for optimal homology-driven repair. We establish a scalable protocol for the production of repair templates by PCR and demonstrate the flexibility of the system by tagging proteins with distinct cellular localisations. Using iterative rounds of genome-editing we generate a transgenic line expressing <italic>P. vivax</italic> Duffy binding protein (PvDBP), a lead vaccine candidate. We demonstrate that PvDBP plays no role in reticulocyte restriction but can alter the macaque/human host cell tropism of <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>. Critically, antibodies raised against the <italic>P. vivax</italic> antigen potently inhibit proliferation of this strain, providing an invaluable tool to support vaccine development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Plasmodium knowlesi</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Plasmodium

over 216 million cases annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">WHO, 2018</xref>). <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is responsible for 99% of estimated malaria cases in sub-Saharan Africa. Outside Africa, <italic>P. vivax</italic> is the predominant parasite and causesÂ ~Â 7.4 million clinical cases annually. Despite extensive efforts, in 2016 the number of malaria cases were on the rise again for the first time in several years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">WHO, 2018</xref>). Achieving global malaria eradication requires new tools and approaches for addressing emerging drug resistance, relapsing <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections, and emerging zoonotic <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> infections, which represent significant causes of severe disease and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh and Daneshvar, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanboonkunupakarn and White, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Menard and Dondorp, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although <italic>P. vivax</italic> displays some distinctive features to <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>, including the formation of latent hypnozoites stages in the liver and restriction to reticulocytes in the blood, the two parasites are closely related, occupying a separate simian parasite clade to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pacheco et al., 2018</xref>). Host cell invasion by <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> relies on the Duffy binding proteins (DBP) PvDBP and PkDBPÎ±, respectively, both ligands for human red blood cell (RBC) Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Horuk et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller et al., 1975</xref>). The critical binding motif of the ligands is the cysteine-rich region 2 (DBP-RII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chitnis and Miller, 1994</xref>), withÂ ~70% identity between PkDBPÎ± and PvDBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ranjan and Chitnis, 1999</xref>). Despite their similarity, PvDBP has also been implicated in both <italic>P. vivax</italic> reticulocyte restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ovchynnikova et al., 2017</xref>) and as a host tropism factor preventing <italic>P. vivax</italic> from infecting macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tachibana et al., 2015</xref>). PvDBP-RII is also the leading blood stage vaccine candidate for <italic>P. vivax</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ntumngia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Payne et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singh et al., 2018</xref>), with antibodies targeting PvDBP-RII blocking parasite invasion in ex vivo <italic>P. vivax</italic> assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russell et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> additionally contains two PkDBPÎ± paralogues, namely DBPÎ² and DBPÎ³ which share high levels of amino acid identity (68â88%) to PkDBPÎ± but bind to distinct receptors via N-glycolylneuraminic acid - a sialic acid found on the surface of macaque RBCs, but absent from human RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dankwa et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Due to the lack of a long-term in vitro culture system for <italic>P. vivax,</italic> vaccine development currently relies on recombinant protein assays, or low throughput ex vivo studies, primate infections or controlled human malaria infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">ArÃ©valo-Herrera et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shakri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Payne et al., 2017b</xref>). Thus, higher throughput parasitological assays to assess antisera and antigens, prior to escalation to in vivo work, are desperately needed. The evolutionary similarity between <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> means the adaptation of <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> to long-term culture in human RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lim et al., 2013</xref>) provides unique opportunities to study DARC-dependent invasion processes in both species. While adaptation of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system to the most prevalent malaria parasite, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghorbal et al., 2014</xref>), provided a powerful tool for studying parasite biology, scalable approaches for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> remain constrained by inefficient transfection and very high genome AT-content (averaging 80.6%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gardner et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> offers significant experimental advantage<italic>s</italic> over <italic>P. falciparum</italic> including a more balanced genome AT-content of 62.5% and orders-of-magnitude-more-efficient transgenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">GrÃ¼ring et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kocken et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Here, we establish CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>. Using an optimised and scalable PCR-based approach for generating targeting constructs we define critical parameters determining effective genome editing and apply the technique to introduce epitope/fluorescent protein tags to a variety of proteins with distinct cellular locations. We then use these tools to replace the <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> PkDBPÎ± gene with its PvDBP orthologue, and delete the <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> DBP paralogues to create a transgenic <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> line reliant on the PvDBP protein for invasion of RBCs. The additional deletion of the PkDBP paralogues not only excludes interference through antibody cross-reactivity during growth inhibition assays, but also allows us to demonstrate that, in contrast to previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ovchynnikova et al., 2017</xref>), PvDBP plays no role in reticulocyte restriction, but has an effect on macaque/human host cell preference. Finally, we show that antibodies raised against the <italic>P. vivax</italic> antigen are potent inhibitors of <italic>P. knowlesi/</italic>PvDBP transgenic parasites, providing an invaluable tool to support <italic>P. vivax</italic> vaccine development. Thus, we have developed a robust and flexible system for genome editing in an important human malaria parasite and generated essential new tools to accelerate both basic and applied malaria research.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Homology mediated CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is highly efficient in <italic>P. knowlesi</italic></title><p><italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites lack a canonical non-homologous end joining pathway, instead relying almost exclusively on homology-directed repair of double-stranded breaks (DSBs), such as those introduced by the Cas9 endonuclease. Effective CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing of malaria parasites therefore requires expression cassettes for the guide RNA and the Cas9 nuclease, and a DSB repair template (donor DNA) containing the desired change, flanked by two regions of homology to the genomic target.</p><p>Whilst a variety of approaches have been used in <italic>P. falciparum,</italic> many of the earlier methods embed these elements into two plasmids, each expressing a different drug-selectable marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghorbal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crawford et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mogollon et al., 2016</xref>).Â This allows for selection of very rare events, but complicates construct design and is not ideal for multiple modifications of a given line â as both selectable markers must then be recycled. As transfection efficiency is significantly higher in <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> than <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">GrÃ¼ring et al., 2014</xref>), we reasoned that we may be able to use a single positive drug selectable marker to cover all the required components for editing. Pairing the guide and Cas9 cassette on a single âsuicideâ plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2016</xref>) with positive and negative selection cassettes would allow for indirect selection of a separate plasmid containing the repair template, as only parasites that took up the repair template as well as the Cas9 plasmid would be able to repair the DSB. A similar approach to this has been used successfully in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and has allowed the generation of lines entirely free of resistant cassettes after dilution cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Knuepfer et al., 2017</xref>). Supporting this approach, co-transfection of plasmids expressing eGFP or mCherry revealed thatÂ ~30% of <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> transgenic parasites took up both plasmids, although the proportion expressing both declined rapidly in the following days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Our two-plasmid CRISPR-Cas9 system comprises one plasmid (pCas9/sg) that provides Cas9, sgRNA (driven by the PkU6 promoter) and a hDHFR-yFCU fusion product for positive/negative selection, and a second plasmid (pDonor) providing the donor DNA with homology regions (HRs) flanking the DSB for repair by homologous recombination. To test this system, we designed constructs to integrate an eGFP expression cassette into the non-essential <italic>p230p</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). A 20 bp guide sequence targeting a seed sequence upstream of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) within the <italic>p230p</italic> gene was cloned into pCas9/sg (pCas9/sg_<italic>p230p</italic>), and a repair template plasmid was synthesized by including an eGFP expression cassette flanked by 400 bp HRs targeting either side of the PAM sequence (pDonor_<italic>p230p</italic>). Both plasmids (each 20 Î¼g) were combined and introduced into <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> schizonts via electroporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moon et al., 2013</xref>) along with control transfections (pCas9/sg without guide sequence and repair template). To simplify synchronisation of parasites, the transfection procedure was altered to additionally include a 2 hr incubation of purified schizonts with 1 Î¼M of the schizont egress inhibitor compound 2, immediately prior to transfection. This compound reversibly inhibits the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collins et al., 2013</xref>) and facilitates accumulation of the fully segmented forms required for transfection. Parasites were placed under selection with pyrimethamine for 5 days after transfection and successful integration monitored by PCR. Correct integration at the <italic>p230p</italic> locus was detectable by PCR within 3 days of transfection and only low levels of wild type DNA was detectable after day 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Expression of eGFP was confirmed by live microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The eGFP positivity rate was calculated the day after transfection (day 1), to evaluate transfection efficiency (8.4%Â±2.1 SD). In <italic>P. knowlesi,</italic> expression of GFP can be detected in any parasites that take up the eGFP cassette after transfection, regardless of whether on an episomal or linearised construct. This indicates that 8.4% of parasites successfully take up the construct, but only a very small fraction of these are likely to be integrated at this stage. Only the plasmid pCas9/sg is selected for with pyrimethamine, and so the number of parasites with non-integrated linear donor DNA decreases rapidly over time. The eGFP positivity was assessed again once parasites reached 0.5% parasitemia (day 12), indicating 83.3% (Â±1.8 SD) of the parasites had integrated the construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>);Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>. Parasites transfected with pCas9/sg_<italic>p230p</italic> without providing pDonor_<italic>p230p</italic> were visible in culture several days after the integrated lines. An intact guide and PAM site was detected in these parasites, suggesting that a small population of parasites did not form DSB. Parasites transfected with pCas9/sg without a cloned sgRNA appeared in culture within a few days after transfection, with comparable growth rates to the eGFP plasmid, suggesting the Cas9 expression without a targeting sgRNA is not toxic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>);Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>.

To determine how distance from DSB affected efficiency of integration, we used the same <italic>p230p</italic> PAM site and moved our 400 bp HRs varying distances away from the DSB, ranging from 0 to 5 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

We therefore used the PCR-based approach for fusion of fluorescent or epitope tags to proteins of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For C-terminal tags, the PCR repair templates were generated by creating fusions of the tag with HRs targeting the 3âend of the gene and the 3âUTR. Similarly, N-terminal tag repair templates were created by flanking the tag with HRs targeting the 5âUTR and 5âend of the coding region. In each case a PAM site was selected so that the 20 bp guide sequence crossed the stop codon (for C-terminal) or start codon (for N-terminal) such that integration of the tag alone, with no other exogenous sequence, was sufficient to disrupt the guide sequence. For genes, such as the Chloroquine Resistance Transporter (CRT), where the PAM site preceded the stop codon, intervening sequences were recodonised when generating the 5âHR to disrupt the PAM site using silent mutations. We selected five genes with disparate subcellular locations and functions to test this approach: the micronemal protein apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bannister et al., 2003</xref>), rhoptry neck protein 2 (RON2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2009</xref>), inner membrane complex protein myosin A (MyoA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baum et al., 2006</xref>), digestive vacuole membrane protein involved in drug resistance CRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ehlgen et al., 2012</xref>), and a protein involved in artemisinin resistance in cytoplasmic foci Kelch13 (K13) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birnbaum et al., 2017</xref>).

Whilst likely functionally equivalent, the DBP orthologues are antigenically distinct (~70% amino acid identity in binding region II) so we used genome-editing to generate transgenic <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> parasites in which DARC binding is provided solely by PvDBP. The donor DNA constructs required to fully reconstitute the DBP coding regions were large and UTR and coding sequences for each of the three PkDBP paralogues highly similar at the nucleotide level. Therefore, HRs were amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into a plasmid vector containing the recodonized PkDBPÎ± or PvDBP genes rather than using the 3-step PCR to generate repair templatesÂ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4âsource data 2</xref>). This allowed us to verify amplification of the correct DBP locus and avoid any chance of mutations within the 4.3 kb sized template DNA.

As a control we also exchanged PkDBPÎ± with a recodonised PkDBPÎ± gene (PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>) using the same sgRNA.

The PkDBPÎ± sgRNA was carefully designed to be distinct to equivalent DBPÎ² and DBPÎ³ target sequences (85% identical to DBPÎ³ and 47.8% to DBPÎ²), because, as in other systems, off-target Cas9-induced DSBs are a major issue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zischewski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wagner et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore sequenced the four most similar target sequences, including one in DBPÎ³, in the PvDBP<sup>OR</sup> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and did not detect any off-target mutations, suggesting that as for other malaria parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghorbal et al., 2014</xref>) the absence of non-homologous end joining ameliorates the potential for off-target mutations. However, diagnostic PCRs for DBPÎ² failed, as well as PCRs in genes flanking the DBPÎ² locus. Whole genome sequencing and mapping against the A1-H.1 reference genome revealed that the PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup> and PvDBP<sup>OR</sup> line have aÂ ~Â 44 kb truncation at one end of chromosome 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>), which also harbours DBPÎ², therefore we renamed the lines PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14 and PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14. The loss of theÂ ~44 kb of chromosome 14 is also present in parasites that have been transfected simultaneously with pCas/sg_<italic>p230p</italic>, suggesting that the 44 kb deletion occurred in the A1-H.1 parental parasite line (wt/Î14) prior to transfection and was not an artefact caused by targeting DBPÎ±. Similar spontaneous deletions have been reported previously, includingÂ ~66 kb loss at the other end of chromosome 14 in the <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> A1-C line maintained in cynomolgus macaque blood that included the invasion ligand NBPXa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moon et al., 2016</xref>), and a deletion of DBPÎ³ in the PkYH1 line at the end of chromosome 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dankwa et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the PAM site of the DBPÎ± targeting guide sequence is absent in DBPÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>) which makes it unlikely that the disruption of DBPÎ² was induced by Cas9 during DBPÎ± targeting. To confirm this, another PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup> clonal line was generated in an independent transfection using the A1-H.1 parental parasite line with intact DBPÎ² locus.</p><p>Having established accurate targeting of the PkDBPÎ± locus, we investigated the role of the paralogues in human and macaque red cell invasion and whether they could interfere with inhibitory effects of test antibodies. Reasoning that as the Î14 truncation may have provided a selective advantage to the parasites and thus may well reoccur, we took advantage of the spontaneous DBPÎ² loss (PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14 or PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14) and then used pCas9/sg plasmid recycling to additionally delete the DBPÎ³ locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), generating PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ and PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³.

This confirmed that the <italic>P. vivax</italic> protein was able to complement the role of its <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> orthologue. It also demonstrated, that not only are PkDBPÎ² and Î³ proteins dispensable for multiplication in humans RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dankwa et al., 2016</xref>), but as their loss leads to increased multiplication rate, they may actually impede invasion in human RBCs. A further experiment comparing multiplication rates in 21 Duffy positive blood donations revealed significant higher growth rates of the PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ line (8.9 fold) compared to the 6.9 fold multiplication of the wild type line and PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ line (p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4âsource data 1</xref>), confirming that knockout of the two paralogues increases multiplication rate in human RBCs but also revealing a minor growth reduction in the PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ line compared to its control line.</p><p>To investigate how these modifications affect host preference we compared the growth rates in human RBCs with growth rates in RBCs from the natural host of <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>, the long tailed macaque (<italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>).

Interestingly, loss of DBPÎ² and DBPÎ³ in the PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ line did not reduce the parasite multiplication rate in macaque RBC but rather slightly increased it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), with the lines retaining a macaque preference ratio (macaque fold growth/human fold growth) of 1.43, similar to both the wild type (1.26) and PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14 (1.33). This demonstrates that both PkDBPÎ² and PkDBPÎ³ are dispensable for invasion of macaque RBCs, and PkDBPÎ± is sufficient to retain full growth rate in macaque cells. Unlike <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>, <italic>P. vivax</italic> is unable to infect macaques, and sequence differences between the DARC receptor in the two hosts have been suggested to underlie this restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tachibana et al., 2015</xref>). Whilst inÂ macaque RBCs theÂ multiplication rates and host preference ratio (1.16) were unaffected for the PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14 line, the additional deletion of DBPÎ³ in the PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ line resulted in a 40% reduction in macaque multiplication rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) which caused a shift to human RBC preference with a ratio of 0.75. This suggests that in the absence of redundant DBP pathways, PvDBP is less effective at facilitating invasion of macaque cells than of human cells, but nevertheless can support invasion of both host cell types.</p><p>The Duffy gene exists as three distinct alleles, Fy<sup>a</sup>, Fy<sup>b</sup> and Fy<sup>null</sup>. Whilst the Fy null phenotype has long been established to protect individuals from <italic>P. vivax</italic>/<italic>P. knowlesi</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller et al., 1976</xref>), previous studies have also shown stronger binding of recombinant PvDBPRII to Fy<sup>(aâb+)</sup> and Fy<sup>(a+b+)</sup> human RBCs compared to Fy<sup>(a+bâ)</sup> as well as higher risks of clinical episodes of <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria in Fy<sup>(aâb+)</sup>. This suggests that <italic>P. vivax</italic> may invade to Fy<sup>(a+bâ)</sup> RBCs less efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">King et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kano et al., 2018</xref>). Whilst we have previously been unable to detect any Fy subtype preference in <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> A1-H.1 (22), the PvDBP<sup>OR</sup> lines provided an opportunity to see if multiplication rate was sensitive to the Duffy subtype when the parasites used PvDBP for invasion. Schizonts of the wild type, PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ and PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ lines were added in duplicate to washed RBC from 21 volunteers of the three Duffy-positive phenotypes (7x Fy<sup>a</sup>, 9x Fy<sup>b</sup>, and 5x Fy<sup>(a+b+)</sup>) at 0.5% parasitaemia. Parasites were maintained in 96-well microtiter plates for 24 hr and the parasitaemia monitored by FACS. For all three lines the average growth rates in each of the three Fy subtypes were similar and there was no significant difference between growth in Fy<sup>a</sup> and Fy<sup>b</sup> RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4EâG</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4âsource data 1</xref>).</p><p>Growth inhibition activity (GIA) assays revealed that all lines remained equally susceptible to invasion inhibition by both an anti-DARC camelid nanobody CA111 and a polyclonal Î±PkMSP1<sub>19</sub> antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, purified IgGs from polyclonal rabbit sera raised against PvDBP_RII, demonstrated low-level GIA activity for wild type and PkDBPa<sup>OR</sup>/ÎÎ²ÎÎ³ lines (~30% inhibition at 10 mg/ml) but a significantly stronger GIA activity against the PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14 and PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/ÎÎ²ÎÎ³ lines, reaching a maximum inhibition ofÂ ~75% at 10 mg/ml and around 50% at 4 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). At 2.5 mg/ml IgG the GIA activity against the PvDBP <sup>OR</sup>/Î14 and PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/ÎÎ²ÎÎ³ lines were 29.6Â Â±Â 3.3 and 24.6 Â± 2.6% and significantly higher compared to wild type and PkDBPa<sup>OR</sup>/ÎÎ²ÎÎ³ lines (p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). The PvDBP<sup>OR</sup> parasite lines could thus be readily inhibited by antibodies against the <italic>P. vivax</italic> protein and the PkDBPÎ± orthologues PkDBPÎ³ and Î² appeared to play no interactive role.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45829.020</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Transgenic <italic>P.Â knowlesi</italic> orthologue replacement lines provide surrogates for <italic>P. vivax</italic> vaccine development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graph showing growth inhibition activity (GIA, %) of anti-DARC nanobody at 1.5 and 3 Î¼g/ml and anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> purified total rabbit IgG at 2.5 and 5 mg/ml on the parasite lines.

Whilst various approaches for CRISPR-Cas9 have been used for other malaria parasites, here we combine a plasmid containing a single recyclable positive selection marker with a fusion PCR-based approach for generation of repair templates. This allows for seamless insertion or deletion at any location within a gene and unlimited iterative modifications of the genome. Genome-wide reverse genetics screens have been applied with great success to the rodent malaria parasite, <italic>P. berghei,</italic> but they have remained challenging for <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, and impossible for <italic>P. vivax</italic>. The tools presented here will enable scalable construct assembly and genome-wide systematic knockout or tagging screens in an alternative human infective species, thus providing a complementary tool to address both shared and species-specific biology. The analysis of lines with multiple tagged or deleted genes is particularly valuable for multigene families with highly redundant functions, as exemplified by our modification of all three <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> DBP genes.</p><p>Here we investigate key parameters associated with successful genome editing and show that the process is also highly robust; targeting of the <italic>p230p</italic> locus demonstrated successful editing for 25/25 transfections and only 1/10 sgRNAs targeting different loci failed to generate an edited line. The failure of an sgRNA guide (<named-content content-type="sequence">AGAAAATAGTGAAAACCCAT</named-content>) designed to target the DBPÎ² locus, a non-essential gene, suggests that multiple guides may need to be tested for some loci. All sgRNA guides used are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3âsource data 1</xref>. We did not detect any off-target effects, consistent with other reports of CRISPR-Cas9 use in malaria parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghorbal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wagner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Negative selection of the pCas9/sg plasmid then enables generation of markerless lines allowing unlimited iterative modifications of the genome, with each round requiring onlyÂ ~30 days (including dilution cloning). Whilst the generation of markerless Cas9 modifications in the genome of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> has been possible for some time, initial systems contained multiple different selectable markers and relied on passive loss of episomes to recycle at least one marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghorbal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mogollon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wagner et al., 2014</xref>). Whilst this is possible in some cases, it can create difficulties particularly if long selection protocols are necessary which may result in stabilisation/integration of episomes. Our format is similar to a more recent system developed in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Knuepfer et al., 2017</xref>), which by using only one bifunctional positive/negative selection cassette enables complete recycling of selectable markers. This has critically enabled generation of important base lines such as marker-free dimerisable Cre recombinase lines used for conditional knockouts in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Knuepfer et al., 2017</xref>). More extensive modifications using Cas9, such as the three sequential genetic modifications undertaken for <italic>P. yoelli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), remains relatively uncommon suggesting that the timescales involved in generation of these lines is still a challenge.</p><p>One clear disadvantage of this system is that we do still see a background remnant of wild type parasites for many of the modifications that are made. This may mean that modifications resulting in slow growing phenotypes could create a challenge for generating clonal lines. In our subsequent experience this is largely mitigated by the relatively fast grow out times and in extreme instances may be combated by immediately cloning after transfection. The selection-linked integration (SLI) method used in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> rapidly selects for genomic integration by using an additional selectable marker that is only expressed when correctly integrated, resulting in transgenic lines that do not require cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birnbaum et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lyth et al., 2018</xref>). The disadvantage of this approach is that multiple selectable markers are required and at least one of them cannot be recycled in the final transgenic line, limiting scope for subsequent modifications. In our experience, the ability to extensively and iteratively modify parasites has been perhaps the most transformative aspect of this method and was integral to our work to modify all members of the PkDBP family. Importantly, as Cas9 modified lines are markerless, the two systems are entirely compatible, such that a baseline containing a range of Cas9 induced modifications could then be modified again using a SLI-based approach to enable access to more challenging slow growing mutants.</p><p>Parasites with integration of eGFP into the p230p locus reached 1% parasitaemia in 8 to 14 days after transfection. However for the most efficient transfections we were able to observe parasites reaching 1% at only 5 to 6 days suggesting significant differences in targeting efficiency at different loci and with different gRNAs. Whilst <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> grows slightly faster (with 3â4 fold per cycle equating to around 9-fold in 48 hr) than <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, this still indicates orders of magnitude greater modification rates than achieved for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> - which can take 2â6 weeks for transgenic parasites to be detected in culture depending on the transfection system used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghorbal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mogollon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Knuepfer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wagner et al., 2014</xref>). Despite the relatively fast recovery time it is also clear that as more than 8% of parasites are able to take up donor DNA during transfection it still takes more than a week for integrated parasites to grow out, indicating that efficiency of homology mediated repair is still the major bottleneck and the majority of Cas9 induced DSBs are not successfully repaired.</p><p>We systematically tested key parameters associated with successful genome editing and found increasing HR length enhanced integration efficiency proportionately, a trend seen in both <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. berghei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wagner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacPherson and Scherf, 2015</xref>). Whilst integration was detected with HRs as short as 50 bp, efficient editing was achieved with HRs between 200â800 bp. We were also able to examine how distance from the DSB affected editing efficiency. Whilst in other systems editing efficiency decreases rapidly as the DSB distance increases, we saw only a steady decline with distance, an effect which could be ameliorated by simply increasing HR length. The use of PCR products as repair templates is particularly well adapted for tagging and knockout approaches which tend to be relatively short. For relatively large or complex constructs, such as those for gene replacement, or those targeting multigenic families conventional cloning may be preferable, as shown here for the PkDBP family.</p><p>By applying these techniques to the <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> DBP family we have been able to examine the role of these genes in host and reticulocyte preference of the two species. Even after long-term adaptation to culture with human RBCs, <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> parasites can retain a strong preference for invasion of macaque RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dankwa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moon et al., 2016</xref>). Both DBPÎ³ and DBPÎ² have been shown to bind to proteins with a distinct sialic acid residue found in non-human primates, but absent in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dankwa et al., 2016</xref>). Deletion of these genes led to a significant increase in growth rates in human RBCs, and interestingly also a similar, but non-significant, increase in growth rates in macaque RBCs. This suggests that PkDBPÎ± alone is sufficient to retain the multiplication capacity and that the PkDBP paralogues are not responsible for the macaque cell preference retained in the A1-H.1 human adapted line. Whilst likely non-functional for invasion of human RBCs, both PkDBPÎ³ and DBPÎ² would still compete for surface space and potentially some of the same interacting proteins as DBPÎ±, which may account for the increased growth rate when they are deleted. The increased growth rate in macaque cells, would suggest that even here, where DBPÎ³ and DBPÎ² are functional, PkDBPÎ± is the preferred and more efficient pathway for invasion in macaque cells. In vivo, this advantage would be countered by the significant benefits provided by redundancy both to combat host blood cell polymorphisms and antibody responses. Importantly, this data suggests that loss of DBPÎ³ and DBPÎ² could provide an adaptation route to increased growth/virulence within human infections. However, to do so the parasites would need to sacrifice redundancy within its primary macaque hosts â a situation only likely to occur with prolonged human to human transmission. Further work to analyse the effect of these mutations through long-term parasite competition assays will enable us to determine the precise extent of this advantage and determine how quickly such mutations could move to fixation within a parasite population.</p><p>Despite being closely related to <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> and other macaque infecting species such as <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>, <italic>P. vivax</italic> cannot infect macaques and the PvDBP protein has been suggested to play a role in enforcing this tropism, as key interacting residues are missing within the macaque DARC protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tachibana et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> parasites expressing PvDBP in the absence of DBP paralogues demonstrate a significant reduction in growth in macaque cells, resulting in an overall shift towards preference for human cells consistent with PvDBP binding macaque DARC less efficiently. Nevertheless as the multiplication rate remained quite close to that seen for human RBCs it seems unlikely that the PvDBP protein alone represents a significant barrier to <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection of macaques.</p><p>Previous work has shown that PvDBP_RII binds more strongly to RBCs expressing the Fy<sup>b</sup> allele of the Duffy antigen than Fy<sup>a</sup>, with studies using recombinant protein demonstrating that the binding efficiency is 50% lower for Fy<sup>a</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kano et al., 2018</xref>). This effect was shown to correlate with a 30â80% reduced risk of clinical vivax malaria amongst patients with the FyA phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">King et al., 2011</xref>). A similar effect of reduced DBP-FyA binding has also been demonstrated using recombinant PkDBPÎ± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fong et al., 2018</xref>) but experiments to examine this with human RBC culture adapted <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> parasites failed to demonstrate any difference in multiplication rates in either Fy<sup>b+</sup> or Fy<sup>a+</sup> RBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moon et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we also did not observe a significant association between growth of the PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ line and Duffy haplotype. Whilst the size of our dataset cannot rule out relatively subtle effects on parasite growth rate, which over the course of an infection could become clinically relevant, it does rule out major growth differences and demonstrates that the invasion process is very tolerant of even quite large changes in receptor-ligand affinity. Notably, the study first identifying a role for Duffy polymorphisms in <italic>P. vivax</italic> clinical susceptibility also demonstrated that the Fy<sup>a+</sup> RBCs demonstrate increased sensitivity to invasion-blocking antibodies, so protective effects may stem from this rather than a direct effect on invasion efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">King et al., 2011</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moon et al., 2013</xref>). Subsequent experiments using these lines could readily test this hypothesis.</p><p>Another key difference between the two species is that unlike <italic>P. knowlesi, P. vivax</italic> has a strict restriction to invasion of reticulocytes. A second family of RBC binding proteins, known as the reticulocyte binding-like proteins (RBPs) have previously been implicated in this tropism. More recently, the PvDBP protein itself has been implicated with work using recombinant PvDBP_RII suggesting that whilst DARC is present on both reticulocytes and mature normocytes, changes during red cell maturation mean that DARC is only accessible to PvDBP binding in young reticulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ovchynnikova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haynes et al., 1988</xref>). Here we show that transgenic <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> parasites using PvDBP for invasion have no such restriction, invading human RBCs (which typically contain less than 0.5% reticulocytes) with the same efficiency as those expressing PkDBPÎ± â thus providing compelling evidence that PvDBP plays no role in the reticulocyte tropism. Further, recent work determining that PvRBP2b, which lacks an orthologue in <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>, binds to the reticulocyte specific marker CD71 further asserts the RBPs as the key to reticulocyte tropism. Importantly, the ability to compare and contrast activity of Pk/Pv DBP family members in parasitological assays will provide a vital new tool to test hypotheses and models arising from studies that have until now relied on assays using recombinant protein fragments.</p><p>Using a combination of binding assays, mutagenesis and structural studies with recombinant PvDBP_RII, previous work has identified residues involved in DBP-DARC interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">VanBuskirk et al., 2004</xref>), as well as a DBP dimerization domain thought to drive the stepwise engagement with DARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batchelor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batchelor et al., 2011</xref>). Efforts to develop a <italic>P. vivax</italic> vaccine to elicit antibodies against the lead candidate PvDBP have predominantly relied on using ELISA-based assays, which assess the ability of antibodies to block recombinant PvDBP_RII binding to DARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shakri et al., 2012</xref>). This has successfully identified a range of binding inhibitory antibodies mapped to residues involved in DARC binding, dimerization as well as subdomain 3, which is distant from the DARC binding site, demonstrating that multiple mechanisms of inhibition may be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chootong et al., 2010</xref>). However, validation of these findings in a parasitological assay is critical. Some epitopes identified in recombinant protein assays may be inaccessible in the context of invasion and it is also possible that not all inhibitory antibodies block receptor binding. DARC-DBP binding is only one step in the multi-step invasion process, with subsequent conformational changes and potential downstream signalling roles for the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batchelor et al., 2011</xref>). The full-length DBP antigen is 140 kDa which contains a C-terminal transmembrane domain and as such structural and biochemical analysis of the protein has almost exclusively focused on the PvDBP_RII fragment alone. Whilst efforts to standardise ex vivo <italic>P. vivax</italic> assays have been successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russell et al., 2011</xref>), they remain hugely challenging, low throughput and rely on genetically diverse <italic>P. vivax</italic> clinical isolates, that are maintained in culture for a only a single cycle of RBC invasion. The <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> PvDBP<sup>OR</sup> line thus provides an opportunity to interrogate the function of the full-length protein in an accessible and scalable manner.</p><p>Whilst the relationship between in vitro GIA and in vivo protection against malaria challenge has not always been clear, previous studies have shown that there is a strong correlative link between activity in the in vitro assay of GIA and in vivo protection from challenge of two different species of human malaria (<italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>) in two different non-human primate models (Aotus monkeys and rhesus macaques) targeting three different merozoite proteins (PfAMA1, PfRH5, PfMSP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Douglas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mahdi Abdel Hamid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Singh et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, Douglas et al. in 2015 determined a threshold value for in vitro GIA assay which must be reached before protection from malaria challenge is afforded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Douglas et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the ability to readily assess <italic>P. vivax</italic> candidates in an in vitro GIA offers an important mechanism to determine whether candidates are appropriate for moving on to challenge studies.</p><p>A vaccine against <italic>P. vivax</italic> must ultimately elicit antibodies with strain-transcending inhibitory activity, but the ability to test on a defined genetic background can provide a significant advantage when it comes to benchmarking and prioritising target epitopes and characterising sera raised against them. Here we use the PvDBP sequence from the SalI reference strain, but multiple lines expressing distinct PvDBP variants could be generated in future, as has already been used for recombinant ELISA based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ntumngia et al., 2012</xref>), to systematically examine inhibition in heterologous strains. Isolates refractory to a given test antibody in ex vivo assays can then be sequenced and direct the generation of new transgenic <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> PvDBP<sup>OR</sup> variant lines to support rational vaccine development. These assays in turn can provide vital triaging for non-human primate models, and controlled human challenge infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Payne et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">ArÃ©valo-Herrera et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Payne et al., 2017b</xref>) â both of which carry the imperative to ensure that only highly optimised antigens are tested. The transgenic <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> OR lines developed here represent the ideal platform for scalable testing of polyclonal and monoclonal sera from vaccine trials and natural <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections. This will enable detailed investigation of epitopes providing invasion inhibitory activity and a means for systematic development of a strain-transcending vaccine. Our work also revealed low-level cross-reactivity of PvDBP_RII antibodies against <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> and suggests cross-immunity between the two species could exist in the field, which may have a significant impact on disease outcome. Understanding the precise epitopes involved could facilitate development of a dual species vaccine, and epitopes conserved across species are also more likely to be conserved across polymorphic strains of <italic>P. vivax</italic>. The same approach could readily be applied to other potential vaccine candidates, novel drug targets or to investigate mechanisms of drug resistance, which are also thought to differ between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Price et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that adaptation of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> provides a powerful system for scalable genome editing of malaria parasites and can provide critical new tools for studying both shared and species-specific biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

The HRs contained at least 20 bp and 58Â°C Tm overhangs with homology to the insert DNA (HR1 with C-term overhang homologous to the N-term of insert DNA and HR2 with N-term overhang homologous to the C-term of the insert DNA). All duplicates were pooled and products were extracted from agarose gel (Qiagen) to remove primers and background amplicons. In a second nested PCR HR1 was fused to the donor amplicon in duplicate with double the amount of time allowed for the elongation step (10 s/kb) and again the product was gel extracted.

Six to eight 50 Î¼l reactions of the final construct PCRs were pooled (300 to 400 Î¼l final volume and 20 Î¼g DNA), ethanol precipitated and resuspended into sterile TE buffer for transfection. DNA concentrations were determined using Nano-Drop and band intensity measurement with BioRad Image lab software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>DNA analysis</title><p>Genomic DNA from transfected parasite lines was extracted (QIAGEN) and analysed by PCR with GoTaq Master Mix (Promega) using the following conditions: 3 min at 96Â°C, then 30 cycles of 25 s at 96Â°C, 25 s at 52Â°C, and 1 min/kb at 64Â°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Western blotting</title><p>To detect tagged proteins of interest, soluble cell extracts were prepared by lysing Nycodenz-enriched schizonts in 0.15% saponin. Parasite pellets were washed several times with cold PBS and centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 3 min at 4Â°C to remove haemoglobin and red cell debris. Pellets were lysed in five pellet volumes of RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5, 1x Roche Protease Inhibitors) supplemented with 50 units BaseMuncher (Expedeon) on ice for 20 min. This whole cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4Â°C. Soluble extracts were separated on Mini-Protean 4â20% TGX gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose using the Trans-blot Turbo system (Bio-Rad). Equivalent uninfected red cell lysate or wild type <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> schizont lysates were analysed alongside lysates containing tagged proteins of interest. Membranes were blocked overnight, and tagged proteins were detected with mouse anti-GFP (Sigma, 1:5,000), rat anti-HA (Sigma 3F10 clone, 1:5,000), or rabbit anti-mCherry (Abcam, 1:5,000). Primary antibodies were detected using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad, 1:5,000) and ECL (ThermoFisher Pierce). Chemiluminescence was captured using the Azure c600 system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunofluorescence assays and live cell imaging</title><p>Immunofluorescence assays were performed using blood smears fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min followed by washing in PBS and permeabilisation in 0.1% Triton-X100 for 10 min. Slides of HA-tagged parasite lines were blocked overnight at 4Â°C in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS and then labelled with rabbit anti-HA high affinity (1:250) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Î±-rabbit IgG (1:5,000) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The smears were mounted in ProLong Antifade mountant with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For live cell imaging parasites were stained with Hoechst 33342 (New England Biolabs), transferred to poly-L-lysine-coated Î¼-slides VI (Ibidi, Martinsried, Germany). Both live and fixed preparations were viewed with a Nikon Ti E inverted microscope using a 100x oil immersion objective and imaged with an ORCA Flash 4.0 CMOS camera (Hamamatsu). Images were acquired and processed using the Nikon Elements Advanced Research software package.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Parasite multiplication rate assays</title><p>In this flow cytometry-based assay the fold increase in parasitemia following one round of asexual growth is measured. Purified schizonts were set up in technical duplicate cultures with human RBCs, at a 2% hematocrit andÂ ~0.5% parasitemia in 24 well plates. Parasitemia was measured with a flow cytometry (FACS)-based assay before and after incubation at 37Â°C in a gassed chamber for 24 hr. Samples were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) and 0.2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) in PBS for 1 hr at 4Â°C, washed, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, and then washed again before 1 hr RNase (MP Biomedicals) treatment, staining with SYBR Green I (Life Technologies), and FACS analysis. The samples were analyzed on a Becton Dickenson LSR-II. Data were acquired using FACSDiva 6.1.3 software and analyzed using FlowJo_V10.</p><p>Data was normalised to a 1% starting parasitemia to enable comparison of fold multiplication between lines. For comparison of growth in human and macaque blood, three biological independent experiments were carried out in <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic> blood and eight biological independent experiments were carried out in human blood. Biological independent experiments include set up of experiments on different days with different parasite preparations and blood samples. Each biological replicate includes two technical replicates. For statistical analysis one-way ANOVA with Tukeyâs with multiple comparisons test of unpaired data was used. For investigation of the association between Duffy phenotype and growth rates, blood samples were collected from 21 volunteers, washed and then set up in technical dublicate cultures at a 2% haematrocrit and withÂ ~0.5% parasitemia in 96 well plates. Parasites were maintained in 96-well microtiter plates for 24 hr and the parasitaemia monitored by FACS. Data of three independent schizont preparations were analysed for each blood sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Blood typing</title><p>Venous blood (â¼10 mL) collected into EDTA Vacutainer (SLS) was anonymized, and then RBCs washed with RPMI 1640 and stored at 4Â°C.

Immunisation of rabbits against PvDBP_RII (SalI) has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Cassan et al., 2015</xref>). Purified IgG was buffer-exchanged into RPMI 1640 medium, concentrated using ultra centrifugal devices (Millipore) and filter sterilized through a 0.22 Î¼m filter (Millipore) prior to being aliquoted and frozen at â20Â°C until use.</p><p><italic>P. knowlesi</italic> parasites were synchronized by magnetic separation (MACS LS columns, Miltenyi Biotech). Synchronized trophozoites were adjusted to 1.5% parasitemia, and 20 Î¼L aliquots were pipetted into 96-well flat/half area tissue culture cluster plates (Appleton Woods). 20 Î¼L purified IgG were added to triplicate test wells at eight final concentrations (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.312, 0.15 and 0.075 mg/mL) and incubated for one cycle (26â30 hr). Parasitemia was measured using the lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) activity assay following standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kennedy et al., 2002</xref>). An anti-DARC Fy6 VHH nanobody, a kind gift from Dr Olivier Bertrand (INSERM, France), was included in the test plate as a positive control in every assay (final concentration 1.5 or 3 Âµg/mL) and purified control IgG from the pre-immunisation sera of matched rabbits were used as the negative control. Anti-PkMSP119 rabbit sera, a kind gift from Ellen Knuepfer (Crick Institute, UK), was also tested in a similar manner. GIA of the purified IgG was expressed as percent inhibition calculated as follows: 100 â [(OD650 of infected erythrocytes with test IgG â OD650 of normal erythrocytes only) / (OD650 of infected erythrocytes without any IgG â OD650 of normal erythrocytes only) x 100%].</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Whole genome sequencing</title><p>Genomic DNA was prepared for the PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ using the DNeasyÂ Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen).

Whole genome sequencing was performed using Illumina MiSeq technology with 150-base paired end fragment sizes.

the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Rapid and iterative genome editing in the zoonotic malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium knowlesi:</italic> New tools for <italic>P. vivax</italic> research&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Tobias Spielmann (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Mohring et al., present a system to edit the genome of P. knowlesi, the source of zoonotic malaria and model for the difficult to study <italic>P. vivax</italic>. They use CRISPR/CAS to tag or knock out genes in a manner that the parasites obtained are marker free, permitting multiple serial modifications. This is achieved using positive and negative selection cassettes on the plasmid carrying the CRISPR/Cas9 components to generate the genomic break together with a marker free PCR product (or plasmid) for repair. This study is major advance of <italic>Plasmodium knowlesi</italic> as a laboratory model.</p><p>The versatility of this system is validated by a relatively thorough functional analysis of the DBP orthologs of <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> and the DBP-like erythrocyte binding proteins (Î², Î³). This exemplary dissection of host cell specificity of the parasite ligands provides both important confirmations and corrections of their previously-defined functions. Finally, the study uses a <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> line completely dependent on PvDBP to evaluate efficacy of anti-PvDBP IgG. Demonstrating the utility of the PvDBP-transgenic <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> for this purpose is an important breakthrough for <italic>vivax</italic> malaria research to develop asexual blood-stage vaccines and other targeted therapeutics against <italic>P. vivax</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) DBPs/EBPs have clearly defined roles as invasion ligands. Consequently, it is not optimal to use multiplication rate as the functional assay to assess differences in invasion. The Results section and Discussion section further erroneously conflate growth with invasion as well as with tropism. At a minimum the terminology should be appropriate with the analytical methods. Multivariate statistical analyses would be appropriate to analyze these data. Supplemental tables with the growth/invasion and GIA data in numerical format are needed.</p><p>2) The description of the 44 kb deletion including PkDBP-Î² is a bit confusing. Please revise the sentences in subsection âTransgenic <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> orthologue replacement lines provide surrogates for <italic>P. vivax</italic> vaccine</p><p>development and DBP tropism studiesâ. It appears as the parental line is a mixture of parasites with and without the deletion. Clones containing PkDBP-Î² (i.e., without the deletion) were not further analyzed. Thus, in Figure 4B all transgenic lines are deficient for PkDBP-Î², and the WT line is a mixture of parasites with or without this gene. This precludes conclusions about the role of PkDBP-Î². Suggestion: (i) determine the proportion of parasites in the WT population that have PkDBP-Î², e.g. by Southern blot; (ii) include clones positive for PkDBP-Î² in the analysis presented in Figure 4B; (iii) otherwise, review the statements about the role of this gene throughout the paper.</p><p>3) In addition to the difference described by the authors, which focuses on the PvDBPa-OR-Î´-Î²-Î³ line, there appears to be an increase of a similar magnitude in mRBCs invasion by PkDBP-OR lines compared to the WT line. This increase is not mentioned but it may have a biological meaning: deletion of DBP Î² and Î³ may result in use of different, more efficient invasion pathways. The increase observed should be discussed. The statistical analysis should preferably be presented in the figure, rather than in the legend, and all significant differences indicated.</p><p>4) The final paragraph of the Discussion section does not accurately reflect publications in this area of study. Whilst the <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> OR lines do represent an important breakthrough, much of what is stated to be achievable with the transgenic <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> has been learned already using various in vitro DBP functional assays expressing the DBP ligand domain. Indeed, these recombinant proteins assays are a vital attribute to the field and have been used to map epitopes, characterize antigenically-distinct DBP allelic variants, and define functional motifs of DBP. These findings have been supported by structural studies and the primary structural model cited indicates the protective effect of immune inhibitory antibodies is to prevent dimerization of PvDBP instead of directly block receptor engagement.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45829.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) DBPs/EBPs have clearly defined roles as invasion ligands.

The multiplication rate assays use purified synchronised schizonts added to test cells and allowed to invade and grow for 24 hours followed by direct measurement of parasite numbers by FACs. We know from previous work (WHO, 2018; Singh and Daneshvar, 2013), that unless there is an additional phenotype during intracellular growth the parasitaemia after 3-6 hours post invasion is the same as that seen at 24 hours. Given the clearly defined role of DBPs in invasion, we therefore opted to use this approach, which enabled us to carry out many more independent repeats than a more targeted invasion assay would have allowed. Whilst we are working on more specific invasion assays, shorter invasion windows can be very challenging given the propensity of <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> merozoites to remain invasive over relatively long periods (Hanboonkunupakarn and White, 2016), as well as difficulties achieving extremely tight synchrony in 5 different lines simultaneously. Whilst we looked into carrying out additional targeted invasion assays in response, we were unfortunately unable to secure sufficient donations of macaque blood within the allotted timeframe to do so. We completely agree with the reviewers, that conflation of growth and invasion is erroneous and so have further refined the language used to describe the assays and findings. We therefore included the definition in the methods sections and changed the terminology from invasion rate to multiplication rate in the manuscript where appropriate.</p><p>Summary of text changes:</p><p>Subsection âTransgenic <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> orthologue replacement lines provide surrogates for <italic>P. vivax</italic> vaccine development and DBP tropism studiesâ: âIt also demonstrated, that not only are PkDBPÎ² and Î³ proteins dispensable for multiplication in humans RBCs (4), but as their loss leads to increased multiplication rate, they may actually impede invasion in human RBCs.

We have changed the layout of the figure by grouping the data for human or macaque blood to make it easier to highlight all statistical comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The description of the 44 kb deletion including PkDBP-Î² is a bit confusing. Please revise the sentences in subsection âTransgenic P. knowlesi orthologue replacement lines provide surrogates for P. vivax vaccine development and DBP tropism studiesâ. It appears as the parental line is a mixture of parasites with and without the deletion. Clones containing PkDBP-Î² (i.e., without the deletion) were not further analyzed. Thus, in Figure 4B all transgenic lines are deficient for PkDBP-Î², and the WT line is a mixture of parasites with or without this gene. This precludes conclusions about the role of PkDBP-Î². Suggestion: (i) determine the proportion of parasites in the WT population that have PkDBP-Î², e.g. by Southern blot; (ii) include clones positive for PkDBP-Î² in the analysis presented in Figure 4B; (iii) otherwise, review the statements about the role of this gene throughout the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a slightly confusing situation and we agree that we could improve our explanation. Whilst originally clonal, the A1-H.1 line used for transfections to replace PkDBPÎ± with PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/PvDBP<sup>OR</sup> had been grown for several months prior to transfection during which time a 44kb truncation in Chromosome 14 must have occurred. We didnât realise this until sometime after transfection and stocks of this particular Wild Type were not retained, but clones from other transfections with the same line confirmed that the chromosome 14 truncation (now termed Î14) must have been the dominant clone. Whole genome sequencing then confirmed the deletion. The <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> lines are very recently adapted to culture and as such probably less âstableâ than lines such as Pf3D7. It seems likely that the truncation offered the parasites a small growth advantage and thus outgrew the original parasite population without truncation. Unfortunately, we donât have stocks of this wtÎ14 population anymore to undertake further investigation, but all multiplication assays used a true WT line that retained an intact chromosome 14. The nature of the change would also make it difficult to give a proportion of parasites with DBPÎ² loss within a wild type population by PCR. We repeated this again using a different wild type stock without truncation to generate an independent second PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup> clonal line to generate a CRISPR based DBPÎ² knockout. We continued using the Î14 lines for subsequent work as we reasoned that there would be a danger that it may end up happening again anyway.</p><p>We have rewritten this paragraph to make it clearer for the reader. We are renaming the WT line with truncation to WtÎ14, and PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/ÎÎ² into PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14. We include diagnostic PCRs of the CRISPR-generated a PkDBPÎ² knockout line PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/ÎÎ². The CRISPR scheme for DBPÎ² k.o. and alignment of the PkDBPÎ² guide has been included. The scheme of generated transgenic lines has been changed accordingly.</p><p>We include a further experiment comparing the following lines in multiplication rate assays; Wild type, PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup> (without truncation), and PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/ÎÎ². Here, we show that neither PkDBPÎ± recodonisation nor PkDBPÎ² knockout affects multiplication rates in human RBCs.</p><p>Changes in the manuscript subsection âTransgenic <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> orthologue replacement lines provide surrogates for <italic>P. vivax</italic> vaccine development and DBP tropism studiesâ:</p><p>âWhole genome sequencing and mapping against the A1-H.1 reference genome revealed that the PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup> and PvDBP<sup>OR</sup> line have a ~44 kb truncation at one end of chromosome 14 (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2), which also harbours DBPÎ², therefore we renamed the lines PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14 and PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14.â</p><p>âTo confirm this, another PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup> clonal line was generated in an independent transfection using the A1-H.1 parental parasite line with intact DBPÎ² locus.â</p><p>âReasoning that as the Î14 truncation may have provided a selective advantage to the parasites and thus may well reoccur, we took advantage of the spontaneous DBPÎ² loss (PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14 or PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14) and then used pCas9/sg plasmid recycling to additionally delete the DBPÎ³ locus (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B), generating PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ and PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³. An overview of all generated DBP lines is depicted in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1E).â</p><p>âUsing the PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup> clonal line with the start of chromosome 14 intact, we were able to generate a Cas9 mediated DBPÎ² knockout (PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/ÎÎ²) (Figure 4B and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C). FACS-based multiplication assays showed no growth effects of PkDBPÎ² knockout in human blood (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1F).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In addition to the difference described by the authors, which focuses on the PvDBPa-OR-Î´-Î²-Î³ line, there appears to be an increase of a similar magnitude in mRBCs invasion by PkDBP-OR lines compared to the WT line. This increase is not mentioned but it may have a biological meaning: deletion of DBP Î² and Î³ may result in use of different, more efficient invasion pathways. The increase observed should be discussed. The statistical analysis should preferably be presented in the figure, rather than in the legend, and all significant differences indicated.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this and comment 1 we have altered our statistical analysis and now use a one-way ANOVA with Tukeyâs test for multiple comparisons and compare all tested lines with each other. Both this and the previous t-tests are adjusted for multiple comparisons and this decreases the statistical power. As such, despite fairly large differences in the multiplication rates the only significant comparisons are the WT/ PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ line in human blood and the PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ and PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ lines in macaque blood. In human blood we carried out 8 biological independent experiments (different blood, different parasite prep for each) with two technical replicates per experiment. Due to limited available macaque blood, we could only carry out three biological independent experiments with two technical replicates per experiments. With analysis of more biological replicates we might have been able to see additional significant changes in growth rates due to the deletion of the paralogues. However, we agree that the trends in the available data indicate that PkDBPÎ± is the preferred pathway for invasion in both human and macaque cells and will highlight this in the discussion (with relevant caveats).</p><p>The Discussion section was changed to:</p><p>âDeletion of these genes led to a significant increase in growth rates in human RBCs, and interestingly also a similar, but non-significant, increase in growth rates in macaque RBCs. This suggests that PkDBPÎ± alone is sufficient to retain the multiplication capacity and that the PkDBP paralogues are not responsible for the macaque cell preference retained in the A1-H.1 human adapted line. Whilst likely non-functional for invasion of human RBCs, both PkDBPÎ³ and DBPÎ² would still compete for surface space and potentially some of the same interacting proteins as DBPÎ±, which may account for the increased growth rate when they are deleted. The increased growth rate in macaque cells, would suggest that even here, where DBPÎ³ and DBPÎ² are functional, PkDBPÎ± is the preferred and more efficient pathway for invasion in macaque cells. In vivo, this advantage would be countered by the significant benefits provided by redundancy both to combat host blood cell polymorphisms and antibody responses. Importantly, this data suggests that loss of DBPÎ³ and DBPÎ² could provide an adaptation route to increased growth/virulence within human infections. However, to do so the parasites would need to sacrifice redundancy within its primary macaque hosts â a situation only likely to occur with prolonged human to human transmission. Further work to analyse the effect of these mutations through long-term parasite competition assays will enable us to determine the precise extent of this advantage and determine how quickly such mutations could move to fixation within a parasite population.â</p><p>We have included another experiment comparing growth rates of the three lines wt, PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ and PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ in Duffy positive RBCs from 21 individuals. The increased number of bloods increased statistical power and we could further confirm that the growth rates of PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ line are significantly enhanced. This also demonstrates that the PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³.</p><p>We included the following sentences to the Results section:</p><p>âAnalysis of the wild type line, and the four transgenic lines (PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14, PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14, PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ and PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³) revealed no difference in growth rate in human RBCs for all lines except the PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ which demonstrated significantly increased growth rate compared to wild type (Figure 4C and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1F). This confirmed that the <italic>P. vivax</italic> protein was able to complement the role of its <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> orthologue. It also demonstrated, that not only are PkDBPÎ² and Î³ proteins dispensable for multiplication in humans RBCs (4), but as their loss leads to increased multiplication rate, they may actually impede invasion in human RBCs. A further experiment comparing multiplication rates in 21 Duffy positive blood donations revealed significant higher growth rates of the PkDBPÎ±<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ line (8.9 fold) compared to the 6.9 fold multiplication of the wild type line and PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ line (p&lt; 0.001) (Figure 4D and Figure 4âfigure supplement 4C and D), confirming that knockout of the two paralogues increases multiplication rate in human RBCs but also revealing a minor growth reduction in the PvDBP<sup>OR</sup>/Î14ÎÎ³ line compared to its control line.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The final paragraph of the Discussion section does not accurately reflect publications in this area of study. Whilst the P. knowlesi OR lines do represent an important breakthrough, much of what is stated to be achievable with the transgenic P. knowlesi has been learned already using various in vitro DBP functional assays expressing the DBP ligand domain. Indeed, these recombinant proteins assays are a vital attribute to the field and have been used to map epitopes, characterize antigenically-distinct DBP allelic variants, and define functional motifs of DBP. These findings have been supported by structural studies and the primary structural model cited indicates the protective effect of immune inhibitory antibodies is to prevent dimerization of PvDBP instead of directly block receptor engagement.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this section is unnecessarily brief and did not do justice to the many studies that underpin our current understanding of DBP/DARC interactions. Our intention was not to undermine the value of this work in any way. However, we do think that binding assays and structural studies using recombinant protein alone are not sufficient to fully understand the functional role of DBP or mechanisms of inhibition and feel our lines offer the opportunity for a range of new insights. This view is supported by the fact that many of the labs involved in these prior studies have already been in touch to request access to our lines (which we will of course provide). We already highlight that the transgenic lines offer the potential to enable functional analysis of full-length PvDBP, rather than just recombinant fragments of region II, as well as offering the chance to study DBP function in its endogenous context at the interface between the RBC and parasite surface â where, for example, epitopes may be concealed by other proteins. We explore some of these differences in more detail in a follow-on paper which was submitted to the editorial team as an associated paper to this work. This has recently been accepted in Nature Microbiology (Rawlinson et al., 2019).</p><p>In view of this we have added some additional background to highlight the valuable role that recombinant work has served to date, as well as highlighting the benefits of an integrative approach combining a variety of methods.</p><p>The following was added to the Discussion section:</p><p>âUsing a combination of binding assays, mutagenesis and structural studies with recombinant PvDBP-RII, previous work has identified residues involved in DBP-DARC interactions (5-7), as well as a DBP dimerization domain thought to drive the stepwise engagement with DARC (8, 9). Efforts to develop a <italic>P. vivax</italic> vaccine to elicit antibodies against the lead candidate PvDBP have predominantly relied on using ELISA-based assays, which assess the ability of antibodies to block recombinant PvDBP-RII binding to DARC (10). This has successfully identified a range of binding inhibitory antibodies mapped to residues involved in DARC binding, dimerization as well as subdomain 3, which is distant from the DARC binding site, demonstrating that multiple mechanisms of inhibition may be important (11, 12). However, validation of these findings in a parasitological assay is critical. Some epitopes identified in recombinant protein assays may be inaccessible in the context of invasion and it is also possible that not all inhibitory antibodies block receptor binding.â</p><p>âWhilst the relationship between in vitro GIA and in vivo protection against malaria challenge has not always been clear, previous studies have shown that there is a strong correlative link between activity in the in vitro assay of GIA and in vivo protection from challenge of two different species of human malaria (<italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>) in two different non-human primate models (Aotus monkeys and rhesus macaques) targeting three different merozoite proteins (PfAMA1, PfRH5, PfMSP1) (13-15). Importantly, Douglas <italic>et al.</italic> in 2015 determined a threshold value for in vitro GIA assay which must be reached before protection from malaria challenge is afforded (13). Thus, the ability to readily assess <italic>P. vivax</italic> candidates in an in vitro GIA offers an important mechanism to determine whether candidates are appropriate for moving on to challenge studies.â</p><p>âHere we use the PvDBP sequence from the SalI reference strain, but multiple lines expressing distinct PvDBP variants could be generated in future, as has already been used for recombinant ELISA based assays (16), to systematically examine inhibition in heterologous strains.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
