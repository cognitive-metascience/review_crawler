Although asymmetric localization of PCP proteins is central to their function, we understand little about PCP protein localization during convergent extension. Here, we use quantitative live imaging to simultaneously monitor cell intercalation behaviors and PCP protein dynamics in the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> neural plate epithelium. We observed asymmetric enrichment of PCP proteins, but more interestingly, we observed tight correlation of PCP protein enrichment with actomyosin-driven contractile behavior of cell-cell junctions. Moreover, we found that the turnover rates of junctional PCP proteins also correlated with the contractile behavior of individual junctions. All these dynamic relationships were disrupted when PCP signaling was manipulated. Together, these results provide a dynamic and quantitative view of PCP protein localization during convergent extension and suggest a complex and intimate link between the dynamic localization of core PCP proteins, actomyosin assembly, and polarized junction shrinking during cell intercalation in the closing vertebrate neural tube.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>planar cell polarity</kwd><kwd>convergent extension</kwd><kwd>neural tube closure</kwd><kwd>cell intercalation</kwd><kwd>vangl2</kwd><kwd>prickle2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM104853</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wallingford</surname><given-names>John B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21HD084072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wallingford</surname><given-names>John B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Planar cell polarity proteins display dynamic spatial and temporal patterns of enrichment that tightly correlate with myosin-dependent cell behaviors during neural tube closure.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Convergent extension (CE) is the evolutionarily conserved morphogenetic engine that drives elongation of the body axis in animals ranging from insects to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tada and Heisenberg, 2012</xref>). Multiple cell behaviors can contribute to CE, but by far the most well-understood process is cell intercalation, by which cells rearrange in a polarized manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Walck-Shannon and Hardin, 2014</xref>). Cell intercalation, in turn, is thought to be driven by multiple subcellular behaviors, including extension of mediolaterally directed cellular protrusions (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keller and Hardin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shih and Keller, 1992</xref>]) and active shrinkage of mediolaterally oriented cell-cell junctions (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>]). More recent data suggest that these two subcellular behaviors likely work in concert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing protrusive activity and junction shrinking during cell intercalation will be essential to understanding convergent extension.</p><p>The junction shrinking mechanism for cell intercalation was initially described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>) and was subsequently identified in both epithelial and mesenchymal cells in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lienkamp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shindo and Wallingford, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Trichas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). In all tissues examined by live imaging, junction shrinkage is accompanied by pulsed actomyosin contractions that are restricted to or enriched at mediolaterally oriented cell-cell junctions and absent from or less common at the junctions perpendicular to the anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shindo and Wallingford, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). A major unresolved question concerns the molecular mechanism by which actomyosin activity is restricted to specific cell-cell junctions during intercalation.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, pair-rule genes and Toll receptors are crucial regulators of polarized actomyosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paré et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zallen and Wieschaus, 2004</xref>), but homologous genes do not appear to be involved in vertebrates. Instead, the most well-characterized regulator of mediolateral cell intercalation in vertebrates is the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Butler and Wallingford, 2017</xref>). Indeed, PCP signaling controls cell intercalation during gastrulation and neural tube closure in frogs, fish, and mice, and mutations in PCP genes are now a well-defined genetic risk factor for human neural tube birth defects (NTDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Marco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Juriloff and Harris, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wallingford et al., 2013</xref>). Understanding PCP signaling is therefore a critical challenge in developmental cell biology.</p><p>One fundamental principle of PCP signaling is that cell polarity is imparted by asymmetric enrichment of the core PCP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Butler and Wallingford, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Strutt and Strutt, 2009</xref>). As shown first in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the Prickle (Pk) and Van Gogh (Vangl) proteins act in concert on one side of the cell, and Dishevelled and Frizzled act on the complementary side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axelrod, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastock et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Strutt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tree et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, FRAP studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have shown that these patterns of enrichment are driven by planar polarization of the junctional turnover kinetics of PCP proteins, underscoring the dynamic nature of the PCP signaling system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Strutt et al., 2011</xref>). Similar patterns of enrichment and turnover have been reported in vertebrate epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler and Wallingford, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chien et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2016</xref>), but less is known about PCP protein localization dynamics during cell intercalation.</p><p>For example, complementary, asymmetric domains of PCP protein enrichment have been described during vertebrate CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ciruna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGreevy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ossipova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roszko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yin et al., 2008</xref>), but how PCP protein enrichment is coordinated in space and time with the subcellular behaviors that drive intercalation remains essentially unexplored. This gap in our knowledge is critical, because recent work demonstrates that PCP proteins are required for the junction shrinking behaviors that contribute critically to cell intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lienkamp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shindo and Wallingford, 2014</xref>). Thus, there is a pressing need for a quantitative, dynamic picture of PCP protein localization as it relates both to subcellular behaviors involved in cell intercalation and to the actomyosin machinery that drives them.</p><p>To this end, we established methods for robust quantification of PCP protein localization in a living vertebrate neural plate as well as methods for correlating PCP protein dynamics with the subcellular behaviors that drive epithelial cell intercalation. Strikingly, we find that in addition to expected patterns of spatial asymmetry, PCP protein enrichment is tightly linked to cell-cell junction behavior: Prickle2 (Pk2) and Vangl2 were dynamically enriched specifically at shrinking cell-cell junctions and depleted from elongating junctions during cell intercalation. FRAP analysis revealed that these patterns of enrichment reflected differences in the kinetics of protein turnover at these sites. Moreover, Pk2 enrichment was temporally and spatially correlated with planar polarized oscillations of junctional actomyosin enrichment. Importantly, all these dynamic relationships were disrupted when PCP signaling was manipulated. Thus, our studies reveal an intimate link between the dynamic localization of core PCP proteins, actomyosin assembly, and polarized junction shrinking during cell intercalation of the closing vertebrate neural tube.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We characterized PCP protein dynamics in the neural plate of <italic>Xenopus</italic>, as studies in this animal consistently prefigure similar results in mammalian systems yet provide exceptional views of dynamic cell biological processes. Because Dishevelled and Frizzled function in both PCP and canonical Wnt signaling, their roles are more difficult to interrogate, so we focused instead on Prickle and Vangl, which act solely in PCP signaling and are required for CE and neural tube closure in vertebrates, including <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Darken et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goto and Keller, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kibar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takeuchi et al., 2003</xref>). Previous work suggests that Prickle and Vangl localize to the anterior face of cells in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> neural plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ossipova et al., 2015</xref>), but we sought to establish a more robust quantification of this pattern as a foundation for the time-lapse studies described below.</p><p>We used mRNA injection to express fluorescent protein (FP) fusions to PCP proteins in Xenopus. Because overexpression of PCP proteins has a well-documented effect on PCP signaling, we used titration experiments to empirically determine the lowest possible dose of mRNA that allowed imaging in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> neural plate. Under these conditions, GFP-Vangl2 displayed a strong asymmetric bias to anterior cell faces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), while at slightly higher doses of injected mRNA, low levels of Vangl2 could be observed at the posterior faces as well (not shown), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ossipova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roszko et al., 2015</xref>). Core PCP proteins are encoded by multi-gene families, and despite the reported role of Prickle1 in convergent extension, GFP-Pk1 did not display asymmetric enrichment in our hands (not shown). However, GFP-Prickle2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler and Wallingford, 2015</xref>) was strongly enriched anteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). GFP-Pk2 was also restricted to the apicolateral cell junctional regions, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This uncoupling of junction behavior from orientation was associated with reduced junction shrinkage generally, and a reduction in the number of productive T transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In fact, even the few productive T transitions that were observed were significantly slowed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Finally, these defects in cell intercalation behavior had a profound impact on cell shape. During neural plate shaping stages (12-14), the majority of neural epithelial cells in control embryos exhibited a shift from an anteroposterior orientation to a mediolateral orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, green), while Xdd1 expressing cells maintain their alignment in the anteroposterior axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, blue). In fact, these cells actually increased their length-to-width ratios along the AP axis (not shown), likely as a result of forces generated by other cell behaviors that shape the neural plate at these stages (e.g. apical constriction, elongation of underlying mesoderm, etc.). Notably, genetic mutation of PCP genes in zebrafish also elicits similar spectrum of cell shape and orientation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roszko et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, disruption of Prickle function by expression of the dominant-negative Pk2-ΔPΔL elicited the same spectrum of defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>, pink; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together with our data on PCP protein localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, above), these results establish the <italic>Xenopus</italic> neural plate as an effective platform with which to probe the relationship between epithelial cell intercalation behaviors and core PCP protein dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Prickle2 and Vangl2 are dynamically enriched specifically at shrinking cell-cell junctions</title><p>With these imaging and analysis systems in place, we performed time-lapse imaging with an eye toward understanding the dynamic relationship between PCP protein localization and epithelial cell behaviors. This analysis revealed several novel insights. First, we noted that the accumulation of Pk2 was junction-specific, displaying overt changes in intensity precisely at tricellular junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, we found that GFP-Pk2 was dynamically enriched at shrinking junctions but depleted from elongating junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), suggesting that dynamic enrichment of Pk2 might not simply reflect the junction’s spatial orientation (e.g. to V- vs. T-junctions). This notion was support by the observation that even when adjacent junctions share a similar orientation, the GFP-Pk2 intensity at these junctions frequently differed substantially (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>). For example, the still images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> show three adjacent junctions sharing a roughly similar mediolateral alignment; none deviates by more than 20 degrees from the mediolateral at any point in the movie. Nonetheless, two of the junctions shrink during the movie (red brackets) while the third one grows (yellow brackets). Even among these similarly oriented junctions, shrinking is associated with increasing levels of Pk2-GFP intensity, and elongation with decreasing Pk2-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

These movies allowed us to quantify core PCP protein localization and dynamics as they relate to the cell behaviors associated with convergent extension. We focus here on junction shrinkage, which together with mediolateral protrusions is an essential sub-cellular behavior contributing to cell intercalation. We find that the Prickle2 and Vangl2 display a consistent pattern of localization and turnover in space and time during cell intercalation that is strongly linked to actomyosin assembly at cell-cell junctions. Directed, mechanistic studies will be required to fully understand the relationships reported here, but our data are nonetheless significant for providing a comprehensive and quantitative view of the spatial and temporal patterns of PCP protein localization during vertebrate collective cell movements.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>PCP protein localization in time and space during convergent extension</title><p>The spatial asymmetry of core PCP proteins is fundamental to their function. In a wide array of cell types, planar polarization is defined by Dvl and Frizzled enrichment to one region of the cell and Vangl and Prickle in a reciprocal pattern. Feedback across cell membranes is thought to reinforce initially weak asymmetry, leading to the robust asymmetry at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Butler and Wallingford, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Strutt and Strutt, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, while cell intercalation was the first setting in which vertebrate PCP was defined, the first reports of asymmetric protein localization in vertebrates came instead from studies of cochlear hair cells and later from ciliated cells of the node and airway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rida and Chen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wallingford, 2010</xref>). Indeed, even now we know little about the spatial patterns and almost nothing about the temporal patterns of PCP protein localization in the context of convergent extension.</p><p>Currently, a consensus has emerged that PCP proteins spatially delineate an anterior-to-posterior axis in cells undergoing cell intercalation. This consensus has support from studies of various PCP proteins in diverse tissues, first in zebrafish and later in other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ciruna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGreevy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ossipova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roszko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yin et al., 2008</xref>). This model is consistent with the similar pattern of anteroposterior localization for PCP proteins in the orientation of directional ciliary beating in the embryonic node and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borovina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hashimoto et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, this axis of polarization is consistent with embryological data suggesting that anteroposterior patterning is crucial to convergent extension in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ninomiya et al., 2004</xref>). However, it should be noted that several studies suggest additional regions of localization in the mediolateral ends of cells during cell intercalation (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kinoshita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panousopoulou et al., 2013</xref>]).</p><p>Our data here are consistent with the idea that anteroposterior localization of PCP proteins is critical for cell intercalation, although they do not exclude additional roles in mediolateral protrusions, and disruption of PCP does disrupt the polarity and stability of mediolateral protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wallingford et al., 2000</xref>). Significantly, recent work suggests that both mediolateral protrusions and junction shrinking act together during convergent extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2014</xref>), so it is clear that additional studies will be required.</p><p>In our view, the more important findings here relate to the temporal aspects of PCP protein localization, as previous studies provided only static snapshots of what is a highly dynamic process. Our time-lapse studies not only reveal that Prickle2 and Vangl2 are dynamically enriched at shrinking junctions, but also suggest that the shrinking/growing status of a junction may be as important a determinant of PCP protein enrichment as is its orientation along the mediolateral/anteroposterior axes. In addition, our FRAP data reveal that turnover kinetics also differ with the dynamic behavior of the junctions, with higher stable fractions associated with shrinking junctions. Thus, our study reveals a new complexity to the pattern of PCP protein localization that likely reflects the dynamic nature of the cells involved, as they are constantly exchanging neighbors as they intercalate.</p><p>Finally, our data provide an interesting complement to previous studies linking turnover at cell junctions to planar polarized PCP protein localization. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the enriched regions of PCP protein localization display higher stable fractions than do non-enriched regions, and the loss of asymmetric protein localization after disrupting PCP signaling is accompanied by a loss of this asymmetric turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Strutt et al., 2011</xref>). Similar results have been obtained in cells of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> epidermis and in the mouse oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler and Wallingford, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chien et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). However, cell-cell neighbor exchange is minimal in those contexts, in contrast to CE, where such neighbor exchanges are constant. We therefore find it interesting that we observed a similar trend during cell intercalation, where enriched regions of PCP protein localization also display higher stable fractions of PCP protein even as these junctions shrink dramatically. Interestingly, when we calculated the mean stable fraction for PCP proteins (i.e. averaging all junctions), this value was substantially lower than what we previously observed using similar methods in <italic>Xenopus</italic> multiciliated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler and Wallingford, 2015</xref>); this difference may represent an adaptation to the dynamic nature of the junctions involved. Together with the previous studies, our data demonstrate that planar polarized junction turnover kinetics are a general feature of PCP protein localization, spanning a broad spectrum of organisms and cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PCP protein and myosin interplay during convergent extension</title><p>Another interesting result in this study is the tight spatiotemporal relationship between PCP proteins and myosin at shrinking junctions. PCP proteins have been shown to be required for the phosphorylation of Myosin during cell intercalation in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, chicks, and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lienkamp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGreevy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shindo and Wallingford, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2014</xref>), as well as in the cochlea of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). The mechanism by which PCP proteins act on Myosin remains unclear, but of the PCP proteins, it is Dvl that is most directly implicated. Dvl acts via the formin Daam1, the PDZ-RhoGEF, and RhoA to activate Rho Kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Habas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>), which in turn is essential for cell intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marlow et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ybot-Gonzalez et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, our focus here on Prickle and Vangl (necessitated by the complexity of Dvl/Fzd function) is a limitation, because the mechanisms by which Pk2 and Vangl2 impact myosin activation are unknown.</p><p>Because mechanical feedback contributes to the oscillations of actomyosin at shrinking junctions during PCP-independent cell intercalation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>]), one attractive hypothesis involves Dvl/RhoA-mediated myosin accumulation on one cell face resulting in mechanically induced myosin accumulation on the opposing cell face. In this case, Pk2 and Vangl2 function only to ensure Dvl/Fzd localization on the other side of the junction. Alternatively, Pk2 and Vangl2 may also interact directly with actomyosin machinery by a yet to be described mechanism.</p><p>Regardless of precise mechanism, it is clear that a functional PCP system is required to drive myosin contraction, so it is interesting that two recent studies suggest that, conversely, myosin is required for normal PCP protein localization. Disruption of myosin action disrupts the polarized localization of Vangl2 in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> neural plate and of Pk in the ascidian notochord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newman-Smith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ossipova et al., 2015</xref>). These data may suggest a ‘reciprocal’ relationship between PCP proteins and myosin, an idea supported by our observations here of very tight temporal and spatial correlation between Myosin levels and Pk2 levels at cell-cell junctions. However, because there is evidence that mechanical cues can impact PCP signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosveld et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chien et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luxenburg et al., 2015</xref>), it is important to consider that both the neural plate and the notochord are engaged in large-scale collective cell movement. The broad application of myosin inhibitors would clearly disrupt global patterns of cell movement and even the orientation and magnitude of tension exerted on cell-cell junctions, so myosin inhibition might disrupt PCP protein localization secondarily. Future experiments using acute, spatially resolved myosin inhibition will be required to adequately address this issue.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In sum, the data here provide a quantitative, dynamic view of PCP protein localization as it relates to a subcellular behavior that drives cell intercalation. This work provides new insights into the general problem of how developmental signaling systems such as PCP interface with fundamental cellular machines such as actomyosin.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Spatial and temporal PCP protein dynamics coordinate cell intercalation during neural tube closure&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation is being overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Butler and Wallingford report their studies of the dynamic localization of Vangl2-GFP and Prickle2-GFP core components of the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway during convergent extension movements of neuroectodermal tissue in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. They confirm and extend earlier studies in zebrafish, frog and mouse providing snapshots of PCP protein localization that revealed enrichment of Vangl2 and Pk at the anterior edges of mediolaterally (ML) elongated cells, consistent with asymmetric localization of PCP components shown by pioneering studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The value of this work is in careful temporal assessment of protein localization in relation to cell behavior and in particular to junction shrinking – one of the drivers of the ML intercalation process. A major conclusion of this study is that &quot;the strength of asymmetric Pk2 and Vangl2 enrichment at a particular junction is more strongly tied to the dynamic behavior of that junction than it is to the junction's orientation or to positional information across the tissue.&quot; In addition, they show that Pk and Vangl2 are more stable at shrinking rather than growing junctions, and PCP enrichment correlates with myosin junctional localization.</p><p>This is an important study because it provides direct evidence in a live, dynamic system what the PCP field has generally assumed to be true – that PCP asymmetry accompanies myosin recruitment to promote junction shrinking during epithelial CE. The study adds further insight by showing how PCP enrichment and stability are better correlated with junction behavior than its orientation. These findings in dynamic cellular context are consistent with those of Strutt and Strutt in <italic>Drosophila</italic> planar polarized and more static epithelia that junctions enriched in PCP components exhibit higher stable fractions of PCP proteins. Together, these findings underscore the conservation of the molecular mechanisms of the core PCP pathway signaling between the dynamic vertebrate tissue during gastrulation/neurulation and <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia. Whereas the manuscript is largely correlative, these are very demanding experiments and the observed correlations are significant and should be of interest to the broad scientific readership given the growing list of developmental processes in which PCP pathway is being implicated.</p><p>However, some conclusions require further support and additional experimental details are needed for the reviewers to properly interpret some of the results. Moreover, it will be important to move beyond correlations.</p><p>The full reviews are also included for your reference, as they contain detailed and useful suggestions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While there is good evidence that Pk and Vangl2 enrichment is better correlated with junction shrinkage than orientation, the authors do not address whether it is tied to &quot;positional information across the tissue&quot;, i.e. whether a junction separates AP or ML neighbors. V vs T junctions - Considering the analysis is performed on a dynamic tissue where junction angles are not constant, a method that distinguishes junctions based on whether they separate AP or ML cells would be more appropriate.</p><p>2) The temporal relationship between PCP enrichment and myosin oscillations needs better documentation.</p><p>3) Please include movies for time-lapse images.</p><p>4) The data on the dynamic behavior of Vangl and Prickle fusion proteins is compelling as there are correlations with junction shrinking, actomyosin assembly, however they are just correlations. In the text the authors in general acknowledge the limitation of this analysis as for example in the summary &quot;suggest a complex and intimate link between the dynamic localization of core PCP proteins, actomyosin assembly, and polarized junction shrinking&quot;. However, the title &quot;Spatial and temporal PCP protein dynamics coordinate cell intercalation during neural tube closure&quot;, indicates causal relationships that are not experimentally supported and is an overstatement of the finding in this manuscript. The Title needs to be revised.</p><p>5) Moreover, it would be important to move beyond correlations. To do this, a more mechanistic understanding of relationships between PCP protein localization, myosin localization, and junction shrinking is needed. As the authors mentioned in the discussion, PCP signaling is known to regulate Myosin activity via Daam1 and Rho Kinase. One key question is whether PCP components drive myosin contractility, contractility drives PCP localization, or both. The key experiment that would take this paper beyond correlations is to perform FRAP assays under myosin inhibition. This would test whether myosin/junction shrinkage underlies the increase in Pk and Vang stability at V-junctions, or whether their stability is upstream of myosin (and perhaps due to AP position).</p><p>6) The observed enrichment of PCP components at shrinking V-junctions is a striking observation here. The authors acknowledge that &quot;intensity could reflect increased density due to junction shrinking&quot; as observed for generic membrane markers. But they discard this possibility because &quot;even when normalized against such a membrane label, intensities of Vangl2 and Prickle2 still displayed a significant correlation with junction shrinkage&quot;. So, they put forward &quot;the alternative hypothesis&quot; whereby the observed enrichment could be an active process, the hypothesis they pursue and find experimental support for. However, these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. It would be important to present data for the changes in the density of the PCP and general membrane markers, to more fully understand the relative contributions of these two mechanisms. For example, it would be valuable to see a line for the intensity of the generic membrane marker on the graph in Figure 8B. And although PCP fusion protein localization is normalized to a generic membrane marker in Figure 6—figure supplement 1, the legend of Figure 1 states that fluorescence intensity was normalized to the cytoplasm. Additional figure legends should specify to what fluorescence intensity is normalized.</p><p>7) Figure 4 presents defective CE in neuroectoderm expressing Xdd1. Junction shrinking is analyzed. However, visually abnormal cell alignment of cells is evident and should be quantified. It seems that instead of ML alignment, cell bodies are aligned with the AP embryonic axis, as has been seen in some zebrafish PCP mutants (e.g. Roszko et al., 2015). If this is the case, how V junction should be defined? Simply as ML aligned or should be longer junction (as V junctions in ML-elongated cells are). This should be analyzed and considered.</p><p>8) Reduced number of productive T1 transitions is perceived as the main phenotype. However, it would be important to analyze the total frequency of any transitions and intercalations. Does Xdd1 overexpression lead to loss of polarized transitions and intercalations or does it generally impair junction shrinking and intercalations. This is very important to assess whether Xdd1 overexpression impairs CE in the same way as loss of individual PCP components in mouse or zebrafish mutants.</p><p>9) The paper could be improved by a restructuring of the discussion to present a working model of PCP and myosin regulation during cell intercalation in CE, including how the present study supports or challenges prevailing models.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Butler and Wallingford report their studies of the dynamic localization of Vangl2-GFP and Prickle2-GFP core components of the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway during convergent extension movements of neuroectodermal tissue in <italic>Xenopus</italic>.

The value of this work is in careful temporal assessment of protein localization in relation to cell behavior and in particular to junction shrinking – one of the drivers of the ML intercalation process. The authors propose that Vangl and Prickle are dynamically enriched at shrinking junctions and suggest &quot;the shrinking/growing status of a junction is a better indicator of PCP protein enrichment than its orientation in the ML/AP axis. Another important insight from FRAP experiments reported here is that turnover kinetics also vary with the dynamic junction behavior such that more stable fractions are associated with shrinking junctions and this is correlated with behavior of Myosin at junctions. These findings in dynamic cellular context are consistent with those of Strutt and Strutt in <italic>Drosophila</italic> planar polarized and more static epithelia that junctions enriched in PCP components exhibit higher stable fractions of PCP proteins.

Considering the following points will significantly improve the manuscript.</p><p>- The data on the dynamic behavior of Vangl and Prickle fusion proteins is compelling as there are correlations with junction shrinking, actomyosin assembly, however they are just correlations.

To do this, a more mechanistic understanding of relationships between PCP protein localization, myosin localization, and junction shrinking is needed. As the authors mentioned in the discussion, PCP signaling is known to regulate Myosin activity via Daam1 and Rho Kinase. It would be important to know whether loss of function of either Rho or Daam1 leads to an uncoupling of Myl9 and Pk2 at V junctions. Another important question is whether PCP components drive myosin contractility, contractility drives PCP localization, or both. They show that function of Pk and Dvl is necessary for polarized Myosin localization, but is it sufficient? I.e. Does ectopic expression of PCP components drive asymmetric Myosin accumulation? And would pharmacologically increasing or decreasing myosin contractility lead to increased or decreased Pk2 localization?</p><p>- The observed enrichment of PCP components at shrinking V-junctions is a striking observation here. The authors acknowledge that &quot;intensity could reflect increased density due to junction shrinking&quot; as observed for generic membrane markers.

Additional figure legends should specify to what fluorescence intensity is normalized.</p><p>- Expression of Xdd1 and Pk2-∆P∆L is used to disrupt PCP signaling, and Xdd1 has been used in several previous studies as a model for loss of PCP signaling. However, dominant negative approaches can have additional effects. Indeed, as the authors acknowledge these two reagents appear to act via converse mechanisms on the planar polarization of myosin enrichment. This hints that it is not simply a loss of PCP signaling that disrupts junction polarity and contractility, but rather that each of these constructs influences cell polarity in distinct ways. A closer examination of the interplay between Pk2/Vangl2, Dvl, and Myosin would distinguish between unintended effects on dominant-negative constructs and biologically relevant consequences of PCP signaling.</p><p>- It is important to note possible caveats associated with studying the behavior of misexpressed fusion proteins. This has been a standard in the field, but it is puzzling that in this work Vangl-GFP appears to be absent on posterior membranes, whereas Roszko et al., 2015) using antibodies detected endogenous Vangl2 in zebrafish mesodermal and neuroectodermal cells along the entire cell membrane and using Vangl2-GFP fusion protein along the entire cell membrane but anteriorly enriched. Do longer exposures show lower level of Vangl-GFP at other membranes as well?</p><p>- Similarly, arguable is the conclusion in the Discussion section &quot;More important than the spatial localization of PCP proteins during cell intercalation is the temporal aspect reported here.&quot; First, as the authors note the asymmetric distribution of core PCP components and that junctions enriched in PCP components exhibit higher stable fractions of PCP proteins has been observed in more static epithelia in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The more dynamic aspects reported here for shrinking junctions may represent a phase in the course of PCP signaling. Indeed, this phase likely depends on the earlier phases of PCP signaling where both in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and zebrafish endogenous Vangl accumulates uniformly at cell membrane and then its distribution becomes asymmetric. As disruption of PCP signaling disrupts all asymmetries including the dynamic ones reported here, the &quot;more important&quot; statement is not justified.</p><p>- Figure 4 presents defective CE in neuroectoderm expressing Xdd1. Junction shrinking is analyzed. However, visually abnormal cell alignment of cells is evident and should be quantified. It seems that instead of ML alignment, cell bodies are aligned with the AP embryonic axis, as has been seen in some zebrafish PCP mutants (e.g. Roszko et al., 2015).

This should be analyzed and considered.</p><p>- Reduced number of productive T1 transitions is perceived as the main phenotype.

Does Xdd1 overexpression lead to loss of polarized transitions and intercalations or does it generally impair junction shrinking and intercalations. This is very important to assess whether Xdd1 overexpression impairs CE in the same way as loss of individual PCP components in mouse or zebrafish mutants.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Butler and Wallingford investigate PCP protein localization during convergent extension (CE) movements that accompany neural tube closure in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos. They find that Pk-GFP and Vangl2-GFP are asymmetrically distributed at intercellular junctions and that the proteins are enriched most strongly at actively shrinking junctions. A major conclusion of this study is that &quot;the strength of asymmetric Pk2 and Vangl2 enrichment at a particular junction is more strongly tied to the dynamic behavior of that junction than it is to the junction's orientation or to positional information across the tissue.&quot; In addition, they show that Pk and Vangl2 are more stable at shrinking rather than growing junctions, and PCP enrichment correlates with myosin junctional localization.</p><p>This is an important study because it provides direct evidence in a live, dynamic system what the PCP field has generally assumed to be true – that PCP asymmetry accompanies myosin recruitment to promote junction shrinking during epithelial CE. The study adds further insight by showing how PCP enrichment and stability are better correlated with junction behavior than its orientation.</p><p>However, some conclusions require further support and additional experimental details are needed for the reviewer to properly interpret some of the results. Specifically, while the there is good evidence that Pk and Vangl2 enrichment is better correlated with junction shrinkage than orientation, they do not address whether it is tied to &quot;positional information across the tissue&quot;, i.e. whether a junction separates AP or ML neighbors. Second, the temporal relationship between PCP enrichment and myosin oscillations needs better documentation. Third, the paper does not address whether myosin activity or AP position accounts for the observed increased Pk and Vangl2 stability. Most of these points could be addressed with existing data sets. Finally, I feel that the paper could be improved by a restructuring of the discussion to present a working model of PCP and myosin regulation during cell intercalation in CE, including how the present study supports or challenges prevailing models.</p><p>Revisions needed to strengthen the major conclusions:a) Please include movies for time-lapse images.</p><p>b) All experiments use exogenously expressed GFP constructs. Do Vangl2, Pk2 and MyI9 endogenous proteins show the same degree of polarization?</p><p>c) V vs T junctions- Considering the analysis is performed on a dynamic tissue where junction angles are not constant, a method that distinguishes junctions based on whether they separate AP or ML cells would be more appropriate. For example, in Figure 5A, an expanding junction is shown oriented roughly perpendicular to a neighboring shrinking junction. The junction changes its orientation ~30 degrees as it lengthens. When during this process would the angle of the junction be measured? Since junction angles fluctuate more rapidly than cells exchange neighbors, a more meaningful categorization of V vs T could be whether the junction separates AP or ML neighbors. Since the AP relationship between cells is thought to be the primary determinant of PCP asymmetry in other systems, I feel this is important to consider.</p><p>d) Pk and Vangl stability – The data shown that Pk and Vangl2 stability correlates with shrinking junctions, but does it also correlate with junction angle or AP neighbor relationships? Perhaps stability is dependent on whether Pk and Vangl are incorporated in an intercellular PCP complex, which would be expected to occur between AP neighbors, but less so at ML neighbors (Strutt et al., 2011).</p><p>e) Temporal correlation between Pk and myosin – Figure 8A,B. A major conclusion of the paper is that &quot;recruitment of Prickle2 and Vangl2 to cell-cell junctions was temporally and spatially coordinated with planar polarized oscillations of actomyosin enrichment&quot;, but the temporal correlations and oscillatory behaviors are not clear from the image shown in Figure 8B or intensity plot over the corresponding junction in Figure 8B. Only one example is given, and the behavior is not obviously oscillatory. Accompanying movies and analysis of additional shrinkage events would strengthen the data and potentially provide insights into the order of events, i.e. whether Pk enrichment precedes myosin accumulation.</p><p>Clarifications to the experimental procedures and data analysis:a) Figure 1B. – A more complete description of how GFP intensities were measured is needed. Is the average GFP intensity across the junction plotted? Are junctions between two cells that both express Pk-GFP or Vangl2-GFP included in the analysis? Or are only individual GFP+ cells that are surrounded by GFP- neighbors included?</p><p>b) Figure 5A-B. Pk-GFP intensity is particularly strong at vertices, which raises the question of how the boundaries of a junction are defined. Are the intensities at vertices included or excluded as part of the junction? In both growing and shrinking junctions? These bright points could really skew the data.</p><p>c) Figure 5B. Could the authors provide more information about how the changes in GFP intensity are determined? Are they choosing the same time points used to calculate the change in junction length (Intensity at t=end minus intensity at t=0)? Or is this the net change (max minus min) over the course of junction length changes? How are the max and min junction lengths chosen?</p><p>d) Figure 5B. There are many junctions that display a substantial change in length but no change in Pk intensity. I'm not sure how to think about these data points. Can the authors comment? If Pk2/PCP localization instructs junction shrinkage, then these results are unexpected. Perhaps these data points represent unproductive shrinkage events that never result in complete junction loss and neighbor exchange? If the data were separated into productive shrinkage events that lead to junction loss vs fluctuating junctions would the correlation between Pk intensity and length changes be even stronger?</p><p>e) Figure 6A-E. In the FRAP analysis, were both V and T-junctions analyzed (oriented along the full range of 0-90 degrees)? Does Pk-GFP stability correlate with the junction angle (see point 1d above)?</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>I enjoyed reading this manuscript and believe it will be a valuable addition to the literature. It is essentially 'descriptive', in the positive sense of providing a careful quantitative description of events that will be of great value in underpinning further work in the field. The findings are correlative rather than mechanistic. Looking over my brief notes I made as I read through, I also find they are largely confirmatory:</p><p>- establish/confirm Pk2 and Vangl2 colocalize preferentially on A/P cell boundaries (but asymmetry weak).</p><p>- confirm that convergent extension occurs in epithelium of neural plate via T1 transitions and rosette formation and is dependent on PCP pathway function.</p><p>- GFP-Pk2/GFP-Vangl2 are enriched on shrinking junctions (this of course follows from the known localizations on A/P cell boundaries and that the tissue undergoes convergent extension on the AP axis). Interestingly, Pk2/Vangl2 are preferentially enriched on shrinking junctions: possibly they are actively recruited to shrinking junctions, or actively driving shrinkage? Or maybe turnover is slow, so get concentrated on shrinking junctions by virtue of the shrinkage?</p><p>- find by FRAP that Pk2/Vangl2 show higher stable fraction on shrinking junctions, where their concentrations are higher. This is consistent with <italic>Drosophila</italic> data (e.g. Strutt et al., 2011?) suggesting at higher junctional concentrations, PCP proteins show higher stable fractions?</p><p>- see expected pulsatile actomyosin behavior on shrinking junctions which is PCP pathway dependent. Pk2 seems to pulse with myosin, due to shared membrane enrichment?</p><p>There is an interesting hint that there may be an active relationship between PCP protein behavior and actomyosin dynamics but cause and effect is not investigated.</p><p>This would sit best in a good developmental biology journal?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36456.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: formal revisions were requested, following approval of the authors’ plan of action.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While there is good evidence that Pk and Vangl2 enrichment is better correlated with junction shrinkage than orientation, the authors do not address whether it is tied to &quot;positional information across the tissue&quot;, i.e. whether a junction separates AP or ML neighbors.

We found that the average change in junction angle during the period of analysis for this dataset was only 5 degrees (+/- 4 degrees), with no changes greater than 20 degrees observed. This result is now reported (subsection “Epithelial convergent extension in the closing <italic>Xenopus</italic> neural tube involves PCP-194 dependent polarized junction shrinking”), as it will help the reader to evaluate the dataset. This result argues that our use of junction orientation is an effective proxy for junctions that separate A/P neighbors.</p><p>Second, even with these data, we feel the reviewer's point is valid, so we added a new analysis using more stringent criteria. Because we feel it is essential to continue identifying junctions by their orientation (this is an unambiguous metric and is the standard in the field for many labs), we selected junctions for this analysis that remain within 30 degrees of mediolateral for the entire duration of analysis, and for these junctions, we plotted the average velocity of shrinking or growth against the average Pk2 intensity for every time point in the movie (subsection “Prickle2 and Vangl2 are dynamically enriched specifically at shrinking cell-cell 266 junctions”, new Figure 6—figure supplement 2). Again, we observed a very strong correlation.</p><p>Finally, we softened our language. We no longer claim that behavior is &quot;better&quot; correlated than orientation, but instead suggest that it is &quot;at least as&quot; correlated.</p><p>We hope these changes address the reviewers’ intended question; if not, we apologize and ask for clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The temporal relationship between PCP enrichment and myosin oscillations needs better documentation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and we have made three changes:</p><p>1) We have added better, higher magnification images supporting this claim, as well as intensity plots for the frames shown.

To do this, a more mechanistic understanding of relationships between PCP protein localization, myosin localization, and junction shrinking is needed. As the authors mentioned in the discussion, PCP signaling is known to regulate Myosin activity via Daam1 and Rho Kinase. One key question is whether PCP components drive myosin contractility, contractility drives PCP localization, or both. The key experiment that would take this paper beyond correlations is to perform FRAP assays under myosin inhibition. This would test whether myosin/junction shrinkage underlies the increase in Pk and Vang stability at V-junctions, or whether their stability is upstream of myosin (and perhaps due to AP position).</p></disp-quote><p>In the requested &quot;action plan,&quot; we proposed addressing this concern with a cross-correlation analysis of PCP protein and Myosin dynamics to ask if these pulses are truly coincident or if in fact one pulse precedes the other. We now report a strong cross-correlation between Myl9 and Pk2 intensities - which we feel adds value to the paper (New Figure 9E). However, we find that neither one clearly preceded the other in this analysis. This may reflect true simultaneous enrichment, or it may indicate that the time-resolution of our movies is insufficient to detect a difference.</p><p>We regret, then, that without substantial additional experimentation, we are unable to make more mechanistic conclusions. That being said, we respectfully point out that the data here nonetheless represent both a quantum leap forward in analysis of PCP protein localization during CE and a very thorough body of work.</p><p>We will revise the manuscript to (a) explicitly acknowledge the limitations of our descriptive approach (Discussion section) and (b) provide a careful synthesis of our current understanding of the relationships between PCP proteins and myosin in the Discussion section.</p><p>We very much hope the reviewers find this proposal acceptable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The observed enrichment of PCP components at shrinking V-junctions is a striking observation here. The authors acknowledge that &quot;intensity could reflect increased density due to junction shrinking&quot; as observed for generic membrane markers. But they discard this possibility because &quot;even when normalized against such a membrane label, intensities of Vangl2 and Prickle2 still displayed a significant correlation with junction shrinkage&quot;. So, they put forward &quot;the alternative hypothesis&quot; whereby the observed enrichment could be an active process, the hypothesis they pursue and find experimental support for. However, these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. It would be important to present data for the changes in the density of the PCP and general membrane markers, to more fully understand the relative contributions of these two mechanisms. For example, it would be valuable to see a line for the intensity of the generic membrane marker on the graph in Figure 8B.</p></disp-quote><p>This is another important point, so we have moved our raw correlation data for Pk2 and Vangl2 to a new Figure 6 that also includes the correlation data for the general membrane marker, Caax-GFP. We present these raw data first and then discuss the Pk2/Vangl2 data normalized against Caax-GFP, which is now shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 of the revision. We also reworded how we interpret these data to reflect that reduced turnover could in fact help produce the increased enrichment we see for the PCP proteins over the membrane label rather than use language that suggests they are mutually exclusive</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And although PCP fusion protein localization is normalized to a generic membrane marker in Figure 6—figure supplement 1, the legend of Figure 1 states that fluorescence intensity was normalized to the cytoplasm. Additional figure legends should specify to what fluorescence intensity is normalized.</p></disp-quote><p>All legends now accurately reflect if and how normalization was used for each particular dataset. We also included additional language in the methods to point out the circumstances and details for the two alternative normalization methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 4 presents defective CE in neuroectoderm expressing Xdd1. Junction shrinking is analyzed. However, visually abnormal cell alignment of cells is evident and should be quantified. It seems that instead of ML alignment, cell bodies are aligned with the AP embryonic axis, as has been seen in some zebrafish PCP mutants (e.g. Roszko et al., 2015). If this is the case, how V junction should be defined? Simply as ML aligned or should be longer junction (as V junctions in ML-elongated cells are). This should be analyzed and considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these are important points. We have extracted such data from our movies and now provide them in the new Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 of the revision. This analysis revealed that, as the reviewer intuited, there is a defect in the orientation of the long axes of cells with Xdd1 or dom-neg Pk2 expression. Moreover, we find that the planar polarization of junction shrinkage is entirely randomized by Xdd1 expression, and consistent with the reduction of T1 transitions, junction shrinkage is reduced overall.</p><p>Regarding the question of how V junctions should be defined if cell elongation is changed is an interesting one. We strongly feel that it remains critical for junctions to have unambiguous definitions, so we prefer to continue using orientation to define junctions, as outlined in comment 1, above.</p><p>Importantly, our analysis suggests that junction-shrinking events are not re-oriented but rather are abrogated and randomized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Reduced number of productive T1 transitions is perceived as the main phenotype. However, it would be important to analyze the total frequency of any transitions and intercalations.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret being unclear: The analysis shown in what is now Figure 4C and D is for all junction shrinkage events, regardless of orientation. Those data, combined with the analysis provided in comment 7, should address this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does Xdd1 overexpression lead to loss of polarized transitions and intercalations or does it generally impair junction shrinking and intercalations. This is very important to assess whether Xdd1 overexpression impairs CE in the same way as loss of individual PCP components in mouse or zebrafish mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>If we understand this correctly, the analysis we provide in comments 1 and 7 should address this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The paper could be improved by a restructuring of the discussion to present a working model of PCP and myosin regulation during cell intercalation in CE, including how the present study supports or challenges prevailing models.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added extensively to the Discussion section, but we preferred stop short of presenting a &quot;working model,&quot; which we feel would be premature. As mentioned above, our data do not provide mechanistic insights into this question, though we feel they do add important dynamic information about the relationship between PCP and myosin. Moreover, as one of the reviewers points out in the last minor comment below, this relationship must be handled with great care. We hope the reviewers feel our additional verbiage is sufficient to render the discussion useful.</p></body></sub-article></article>
