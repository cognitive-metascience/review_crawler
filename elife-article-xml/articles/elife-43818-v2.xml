for sensory or secretory neurons, involved in body homeostasis. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for BBB development and maintenance in endothelial cells (ECs) in most CNS vessels. Here we show that in mouse development, as well as in adult mouse and zebrafish, CVO ECs rendered Wnt-reporter negative, suggesting low level pathway activity. Characterization of the subfornical organ (SFO) vasculature revealed heterogenous claudin-5 (Cldn5) and Plvap/Meca32 expression indicative for tight and leaky vessels, respectively. Dominant, EC-specific β-catenin transcription in mice, converted phenotypically leaky into BBB-like vessels, by augmenting Cldn5<sup>+</sup>vessels, stabilizing junctions and by reducing Plvap/Meca32<sup>+</sup> and fenestrated vessels, resulting in decreased tracer permeability. Endothelial tightening augmented neuronal activity in the SFO of water restricted mice. Hence, regulating the SFO vessel barrier may influence neuronal function in the context of water homeostasis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43818.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Infections and diseases in the brain and spine can be very damaging and debilitating. Indeed, the central nervous system also needs a carefully controlled biochemical environment to survive. As such, all animals with a backbone have barriers and defenses to protect and preserve this key system. One of these is the blood-brain barrier, a physical barrier between the brain and the outside world. Where most blood vessels allow relatively free exchange of chemicals between the blood and surrounding cells, the blood-brain barrier controls what can move between the bloodstream and the brain.</p><p>Yet, there are gaps in the blood-brain barrier, specifically within structures in the brain called the circumventricular organs. These leaky vessels allow the brain cells in these regions to monitor the blood and respond to changes, for example, by triggering sensations such as hunger, thirst or nausea. It is not clear what stops the blood-brain barrier from forming in these regions and what effect the presence of a barrier would have on the brains activity, or the health and behavior of the animal.</p><p>Benz et al. have now used mice and zebrafish to examine the development and structure of the blood-brain barrier. The investigation revealed that the signals that induce the blood-brain barrier throughout the brain are absent in the circumventricular organs of both species. Next, by artificially activating a protein involved in cell-cell interactions in mice, Benz et al. created blood-brain barrier-like structures in circumventricular organs by converting the leaky vessels into tight ones. This change meant that the brain cells in these regions did not respond properly to water deprivation, which potentially may have affected the regulation of thirst in these mice.</p><p>Understanding the blood-brain barrier could have a variety of impacts on how we treat diseases in the central nervous system. This includes stroke, brain tumors and Alzheimers disease. These findings could particularly help scientists to better understand conditions that affect basic needs like thirst and hunger.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circumventricular organs</kwd><kwd>subfornical organ</kwd><kwd>beta-catenin</kwd><kwd>blood-brain barrier</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>water homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LI 911/5-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benz</surname><given-names>Fabienne</given-names></name><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>Ralf H</given-names></name><name><surname>Guérit</surname><given-names>Sylvaine</given-names></name><name><surname>Liebner</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BtRAIN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Germano</surname><given-names>Raoul FV</given-names></name><name><surname>Vanhollebeke</surname><given-names>Benoit</given-names></name><name><surname>Liebner</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Goethe University Frankfurt - Line A</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guérit</surname><given-names>Sylvaine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Landes-Offensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlich- ökonomischer Exzellenz (LOEWE), Program of the Center for Personalized Translational Epilepsy Research, CePTER</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TP8</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liebner</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Centre for Heart and Circulation Research (DZHK)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Column B: Shared Expertise</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liebner</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endothelial tightening by augmenting low level Wnt/β-catenin activity in vessels of the mouse subfornical organ, influences neuronal activation in water-deprived mice, linking endothelial barrier properties to neuro-vascular coupling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In vertebrates, the endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB) is crucial for providing a permissive microenvironment for neuronal function. During developmental brain vascularization, blood vessels undergo Wnt/β-catenin signaling, driven by Wnt7a/7b that is required for angiogenesis as well as for BBB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daneman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stenman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liebner et al., 2008</xref>). In the adult, the Wnt pathway remains instrumental to maintain BBB function in endothelial cells (ECs) of the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Herein activation of β-catenin/TCF signaling can be induced by two flavors of the canonical Wnt pathway mediated by the ligands Wnt7a/7b and the non-Wnt-related norrin disease protein (Ndp), binding to the receptor complexes frizzled-4/Lrp5/6/Gpr124/Reck and frizzled-4/Lrp5/6/Tspan12, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Junge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cullen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Posokhova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuhnert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vanhollebeke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eubelen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although a strict control of the exchange between blood and the CNS tissue by the endothelial BBB is realized in most parts of the CNS, some areas of the brain and the ciliary body of the eye are exceptions to this rule, providing a physiologically highly relevant door to the CNS. The circumventricular organs (CVOs) are a number of small midline structures found in all vertebrate brains, located around the third and fourth ventricle. CVOs have a rich capillary plexus, which physiologically lacks BBB properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ganong, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ufnal and Skrzypecki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langlet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benarroch, 2011</xref>). These characteristics are regarded as important sites of communication between brain and blood. Based on their function, CVOs are commonly classified into secretory and sensory organs. The median eminence, the neurohypophysis (posterior pituitary, PP), the pineal gland (PI) and the subcommissural organ (SCO) belong to the secretory group. The vascular organ of the lamina terminalis (<italic>organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis</italic>, OVLT), the subfornical organ (SFO) and the area postrema (AP) are considered as sensory organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ufnal and Skrzypecki, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The leaky vessels of the CVOs evidently have different morphological and structural characteristics from those of typical BBB vessels, lacking a cellular organization as neuro-vascular unit (NVU), without distinctive astrocytic endfeet and ECs with numerous fenestrations and vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morita et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, in previous reports neither the tight junction proteins claudin-5 (Cldn5), occludin (Ocln) and zonula occludens 1 (Tjp1/ZO-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mullier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maolood and Meister, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Norsted et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sisó et al., 2010</xref>), nor the transporter proteins glucose transporter 1 (Glut-1) and transferrin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Norsted et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maolood and Meister, 2009</xref>), showed a BBB-like staining in leaky CVO ECs. In line with these vascular features, Morita et al. showed that 10 kDa dextran accumulates in the perivascular space between the inner and outer basement membranes, whereas smaller tracers up to 3 kDa dextran diffuse into the parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morita et al., 2016</xref>). Not only the endothelium, but also the perivascular space in CVOs has specific properties, being enlarged and filled by collagen fibers, fibroblasts, astrocytic processes and axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morita and Miyata, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Beside the leaky vasculature of the CVOs, free diffusion of substances into the brain parenchyma is prohibited by tanycytes, specialized cells of the ependymal lining. Tanycytes contain long processes, unlike typical ependymal cells, which project to the parenchyma of the CVOs making contact to the fenestrated vascular wall of the CVOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langlet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benarroch, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mullier et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The detailed function of all CVOs has not intensely been explored in the past, but more recently, the SFO together with the OVLT, the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) and the PP were identified as a functional circuit, regulating drinking behavior and water homeostasis of the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zimmerman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Augustine et al., 2018</xref>). The SFO is a tiny organ located underneath the fornix at the foramen of Monro, protruding into the third ventricle at the meeting point with the lateral ventricles. The dense vascular network in the SFO is similarly organized in different vertebrate species. It presents with heterogeneous vessel phenotypes and can therefore be divided into two zones. Whereas the outer shell contains more BBB expressing vessels, the majority within the ventromedial core is fenestrated with a wide perivascular space. In general, the vascular density is four to five times higher than in other brain regions with tortuous vessels, exhibiting a high blood volume and slow perfusion rate, thereby contributing to high permeability rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sisó et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duvernoy and Risold, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bouchaud et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>Although a cell type-specific expression analysis by single cell sequencing, as it has been performed for the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>), has not been conducted yet, neurons and astrocytes of sensory CVOs (SFO, OVLT and AP) were shown to express specific receptors and ion channels. Those permit them to detect several blood–derived molecules such as salts, hormones, lipids and toxins and convey this information to other parts of the brain, involved in controlling autonomic and peripheral functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benarroch, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sisó et al., 2010</xref>). Evidence supports that 25–60% of CVO neurons respond to signals in the circulatory system and a single neuron may respond to multiple signals such as osmolarity and angiotensin II. Most sensory CVOs play a role in the control of blood pressure, fluid and sodium balance, cardiovascular regulation, feeding and energy homeostasis and immunomodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ufnal and Skrzypecki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benarroch, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sisó et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morita and Miyata, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith and Ferguson, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Given the fact that endothelial Wnt/β-catenin signaling is necessary for BBB development and maintenance, the question remains if the pathway is instrumental in the establishment of vascular heterogeneity in the CNS. Hence, we addressed the question if Wnt/β-catenin signaling is operational in CVO vessels during development and if local regulation of β-catenin signaling is involved in establishing a leaky vascular phenotype in CVOs. Finally, we asked if dominant activation of β-catenin in ECs can overwrite the leaky vessel fate thereby affecting CVO function.</p><p>Here we show by investigating CVOs during BAT-gal reporter mouse development that at any embryonic stage analyzed, starting from E13.5, when the first SFO primordium could be identified, to P21, no activation of β-catenin signaling in CVO vessels could be detected. Focusing on the SFO as a crucial CVO in the regulation of water homeostasis, we show that blood vessels in the caudal portion were mainly leaky evidenced by Plvap/Meca32 staining, whereas capillaries in the rostral portion of the organ were tighter. Interestingly, within the vessel continuity, individual ECs might be Plvap/Meca32<sup>+</sup>//Cldn5<sup>-</sup> followed by a Plvap/Meca32<sup>-</sup>//Cldn5<sup>+</sup> EC, suggesting a locally confined regulation of barrier properties. Dominant, genetic activation of β-catenin signaling (gain-of-function, GOF) in ECs resulted in tightening of CVO blood vessels, evidenced by the switch from a Plvap/Meca32<sup>+</sup>//Cldn5<sup>-</sup> to a Plvap/Meca32<sup>-</sup>//Cldn5<sup>+</sup> vascular phenotype. Vessel tightening was accompanied by a significant reduction in endothelial fenestrations, that likely contributed to the reduction of transcellular permeability evidenced by decreased tracer leakage. Interestingly, endothelial tightening did not coincide with the formation of astrocytic endfeet towards a BBB-like NVU. Finally, we observed augmented neuronal activity in the SFO under thirst conditions after sealing CVO vessels, supported by significantly increased neuronal c-fos staining in the SFO of GOF mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Wnt/β-catenin signaling is not detectable in ECs of the developing CVOs</title><p>As previously shown, BAT-gal mice report active Wnt/β-catenin in brain parenchymal vessels during embryonic and early postnatal brain vascularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liebner et al., 2008</xref>). So far, the developmental formation of CVOs and of the SFO in particular has not been investigated in mice.

Specifically, Aqp4 and αDag showed only a weak, unpolarized localization around vessels in GOF and controls, whereas the sodium channel Kir4.1 was mainly expressed by cells morphologically resembling tanycytes in the SFO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1B,C and</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2B,C</xref>). The ECM components Lama2 and ColIV, revealed that in GOF and in control vessels of the SFO a vascular and an astrocytic basal lamina was present with no obvious differences in structure and distribution between conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In order to further characterize the blood vessels in the SFO of β-catenin GOF mice, we employed electron microscopy to visualize their subcellular phenotype. As expected, the vessels in control SFOs showed the typical large and lacuna-like structure with an extensive ECM circumference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>).

Although the vessel morphology did not show major differences regarding vessel perimeter and structure, the vessels of the GOF mice appeared to have a more compact ECM deposition in their circumference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). Endothelial vesicles did not show obvious alterations between GOF and controls (data not shown). Instead, the junctional area of GOF vessels was considerably more elaborate compared to the controls, which exhibited typical blunt-ending connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

Specifically, we addressed the questions, a) if the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is operational in ECs of CVOs during murine development and in the adult mouse and zebrafish, b) if endothelial-specific, dominant activation of β-catenin transcription could convert the leaky vascular phenotype in CVOs and c) if the latter may have an effect on CVO function.</p><p>The principle findings of this study are: 1) Wnt/β-catenin signaling is undetectable in CVO vessels during BAT-gal reporter mouse development; 2) similarly, β-catenin-mediated transcription is strongly reduced in the adult zebrafish OVLT; 3) SFO vessels are heterogenous regarding the expression of Plvap/Meca32 and Cldn5; 4) upon genetic β-catenin GOF in ECs, leaky SFO vessels are partially converted into tight vessels; 5) functional conversion of SFO vessel towards a BBB-like identity affects neuronal activity in the SFO.</p><p>Wnt/β-catenin is crucial for brain vascularization and BBB development, by regulating endothelial sprouting as well as by promoting a BBB expression profile in ECs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vanhollebeke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liebner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daneman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stenman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). CVOs are well known, but poorly investigated, structures in the midline of vertebrate brains, conferring neurosensory and/or neurosecretory function. Because of this physiological function, CVO blood vessels were described for a long time to lack BBB characteristics, a feature that is considered to be important for allowing neurons to ‘sense’ salts, hormones, lipids and toxic compounds in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sisó et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiecker, 2018</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that neurons send axons into the extended perivascular space, which is in line with their sensory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morita and Miyata, 2012</xref>). The peculiar, leaky specialization of the CVO vascular system is well documented, showing tortuous and fenestrated vessels with poorly developed inter-endothelial junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McKinley et al., 2003</xref>). However, how this specialization is induced on a molecular level during development and how it is maintained is currently not well understood. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the best described inducing factor for endothelial fenestrations and is reported to be expressed in sensory CVOs as well as in other tissues that physiologically require endothelial fenestrations, such as the choroid and the ciliary body of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furube et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ford et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kinnunen and Ylä-Herttuala, 2012</xref>).</p><p>As the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is considered a master switch for barriergenesis, we hypothesized that β-catenin transcription is not operational during CVO vascularization. The data provided here support this interpretation, as in BAT-gal reporter mice, from the initial identification of the SFO primordium at E13.5, none of the investigated developmental stages revealed a single β-galactosidase-positive vessel within the CVOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). Although this finding may formally not exclude low level activation of the pathway in ECs, the observation that neighboring, non-endothelial cells in the CVOs, do show Wnt pathway activation, supports the interpretation of low or absent Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CVO ECs. Specifically, we observed that the ependymal cells covering the SFO as well as stromal cells in the core of the organ show Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Quantitative RT-PCR revealed also expression of Wnt3a, Wnt7 as well as Fzd4 in the SFO, suggesting that at least the BBB-inducing machinery is expressed (data not shown). As also in the adult, β-catenin-mediated transcription in ECs is required to maintain BBB function, the absence of reporter activity in mouse (data not shown) or zebrafish models presented in this study, further underlines that Wnt is evidently not operational in CVO vessels. This may support the hypothesis that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is actively suppressed in the SFO and likely also in other CVOs that have fenestrated vessels. So far, no conclusive data are available demonstrating Wnt pathway inhibitors in the CVOs, however, it has been shown that expression of the soluble frizzled receptor protein 1 (Sfrp1) is about 30 times higher in the rat choroid plexus (CP), that also lacks BBB vessels, compared to the striatum and parietal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowyer et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, a detailed analysis of the CVOs regarding cell type-specific expression profiles has not been published yet.</p><p>Still, it has to be noted that vessels in the SFO, OVLT and PP are heterogenous regarding the expression of Plvap/Meca32 and Cldn5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, differentially tight vessels were also shown in other CVOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morita and Miyata, 2012</xref>). This raises the question if in the CVOs, unlike in the brain parenchyma a ‘…gradual phenotypic change (zonation) along the arteriovenous axis…’ is realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>), or if alternating endothelial differentiation might be established by factors yet to be discovered.</p><p>The present findings may suggest that, at least to some degree, vascular phenotypes in the SFO are locally regulated, which would be in line with their role providing local access for neurons to the blood milieu. If vessel differentiation might also be dynamically regulated to control water homeostasis in a circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gizowski et al., 2016</xref>), is currently unknown and subject to ongoing investigation. In this regard it is interesting to note however, that Cldn5 and Ocln mRNA were not significantly upregulated when analyzed in whole mount dissected SFOs from GOF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>). This might be due to several reasons, such as signal masking by other vessels in the whole mount preparations. Alternatively, this finding might support the interpretation that Cldn5 and Ocln are not transcriptionally regulated by β-catenin, but rather regulated on a post-transcriptional level. Interestingly, there is still some controversy about Cldn5 regulation by Wnt/β-catenin, as it has been shown by Taddei et al. that β-catenin cooperates with FOXO1 to suppress Cldn5 at the promotor level under pro-angiogenic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taddei et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, it has been shown that Sox18, a member of the SOX family of high-mobility group box transcription factors, is instrumental in activating Cldn5 transcription, contributing to endothelial barrier formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fontijn et al., 2008</xref>). Given the high redundancy of SoxF genes (Sox7, 17, 18) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), it might be feasible that Sox17, that we report here to be upregulated in SFO vessels of β-catenin GOF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), mediates Cldn5 regulation.</p><p>Although the regulation of Cldn5 on the promotor level and the role of β-catenin herein requires additional investigation, the tightening of SFO vessels by Cldn5 protein upregulation in β-catenin GOF mice is consistent with previous reports in other regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, in the SFO of GOF mice, we also observed a significantly augmented junctional localization of Ocln, which is in line with the endothelial tightening, but, like for Cldn5, at which molecular level the Ocln regulation occurs remains to be clarified. Moreover, the adherens and tight junction-associated protein ZO-1 qualitatively showed a slight increase in junctional continuity in the GOF condition, which fits with the overall formation of more elaborate junctional complexes between ECs. The fact that ZO-1 exhibits also junctional staining in the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), is consistent with its role in VE-cadherin-based adherens junctions, which are also formed by SFO vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tornavaca et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Beside the mere upregulation of Cldn5 and Ocln, endothelial β-catenin GOF resulted in the abolishment of fenestrations and strengthened inter-endothelial junctions. These findings are well in line with a reduction in VEGF signaling in glioma ECs upon Wnt/β-catenin activation via the downregulation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2, flk-1) and upregulation of VEGFR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reis et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that also upon β-catenin GOF in CVO vessels the responsiveness of ECs for VEGF could be reduced, leading to regression of fenestrations. Interestingly, the structural components of the NVU such as astrocytic endfeet and ECM, additional crucial BBB features, were not observed to be changed by the GOF condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>). Also, the vessel coverage by pericytes showed no major changes in the SFO comparing GOF and controls (data not shown). If the perivascular fibroblasts, recently described by Vanlandewijck et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>), are present at SFO vessels and if yes, whether they are affected by β-catenin GOF in ECs has to be determined in future investigations. Hence, to form the NVU structure might require additional cues and/or prolonged time to form, although the latter explanation might not be as likely as the first, given that even after sixty days after TAM injection the control-like phenotype persisted (data not shown). These findings support the conclusion that tightening the ECs in the SFO via β-catenin GOF does not lead to pronounced structural alterations at the NVU. As the leaky vessels of the SFO core are surrounded by a prominent perivascular space, which is considered to be important for the communication of neuronal axons with the blood milieu, it might be therapeutically beneficial that the NVU is not affected by the dominant activation of endothelial β-catenin.</p><p>One of the main questions investigated in the present work is how the vasculature in the sensory CVOs like the SFO functionally cooperates with the neurons and other stromal cells to achieve proper physiological regulation of fundamental body parameters like water homeostasis. So far, the vasculature has drawn little attention in this respect, even though considerable progress has recently been made to unravel the regulation of drinking behavior by the SFO, OVLT and the PP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gizowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsuda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zimmerman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Augustine et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, it was shown for the SFO that two distinct populations of neurons expressing ETV-1 and Vgat mediate thirst-ON and thirst-OFF signals, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oka et al., 2015</xref>). Here we provide evidence for an essential role of endothelial barrier function in neuronal activation in water restricted mice, as neuronal c-fos reactivity was increased in water-deprived GOF animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). How this finding relates to the drinking behavior and to the activity of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signals to and from the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), which was shown to host the behavioral output neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Augustine et al., 2018</xref>), is beyond the scope of this study and is subject to future work. Moreover, it remains to be clarified if the increased c-fos signal in the SFO of GOF mice is directly caused by the tightened vessel phenotype, or indirectly affected by an altered angiocrine profile of the tightened endothelium, potentially leading to altered drinking behavior. Preliminary analysis of primary mouse brain microvascular ECs (MBMECs) treated with Wnt3a revealed no regulation of VEGF that was previously described to be neuroactive (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mackenzie and Ruhrberg, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although own preliminary experiments aiming to pharmacologically tighten CVO vessels with a systemically administered Wnt/β-catenin activator did not result in SFO vessel tightening (data not shown), this might be a potential way to therapeutically modulate water intake. Interestingly, patients that chronically receive LiCl, an FDA-approved drug for bipolar disorders and a potent Wnt/β-catenin activator, frequently develop polyuria that is linked to altered anti-diuretic hormone (ADH; vasopressin) function, which is released by the PP. Moreover, many patients develop polydipsia and urinate more frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malhi, 2015</xref>). Hence in-depth investigation of the pharmacologic modulation of SFO vessel permeability is required. Although the detailed mechanisms underlying the neuro-vascular coupling in the CVOs have to be investigated in more detail, in light of the present work however, the CVO vasculature likely participates actively in controlling water homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species)<break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strainbackground <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Wild-type mice</td><td valign="top">ENVIGO, The Netherlands</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strainbackground <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Cdh5-cre mice</td><td valign="top">Ralf H.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Low Wnt/β-catenin signaling determines leaky vessels in the subfornical organ and affects water homeostasis in mice.&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Elisabetta Dejana as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Dritan Agalliu (Reviewer #2); Christer Betsholtz (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers have found your paper of interest and potentially acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, all the three referees raise important points to be considered before acceptance.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper from Liebner laboratory investigates how CVO vessels, known to lack BBB and be permeable to water, solutes, and hormones, are regulated in relation to Wnt/β-catenin signaling – a central inducer of the BBB. The authors find (1) using Wnt reporter technologies, that Wnt signaling is undetectable in CVOs throughout development in mice and in adult zebrafish. (2) They describe a cellular phenotypic heterogeneity in the CVO vessels regarding Plvap and Cldn5 expression and they suggest that the latter might be regulated in a circadian fashion. (3) Using an inducible genetic β-catenin GOF approach, they show conversion of the CVO vessel phenotype into a BBB-like phenotype. (4) They show results that may indicate that this conversion has consequences for neuronal activity in the CVO.</p><p>This manuscript is an interesting and valuable contribution to the field that deserves publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The manuscript is well-written and well-illustrated in general.</p><p>While going through the comments, please note in particular:</p><p>Additional controls for the role of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the observed control of permeability are asked for. If experimentally feasible, an earlier control of β-catenin signaling in SFO would also be important. Please see if these are speedily do-able and if not pleased adequately discuss these points. It will be useful to have this experimentally addressed, though.</p><p>A more accurate analysis of the permeability properties of SFO vessels and of tight junction organization and more accurate analysis of astrocyte polarization and matrix protein organization are also asked. More specifically, the authors should make better images for their c-fos data and show that it is indeed neurons that express c-fos.</p><p>The authors could remove the circadian Cldn5 data (premature), the Aqp4 and CD13 data (confusing).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The gain-of-function mutation of β-catenin is induced in endothelial cell specifically. It is known that endothelial cells can produce soluble neural mediators. An important question, therefore, is whether the observed neural hyperactivation in vivo, induced by β-catenin gain of function in endothelial cells, is due to reduced vascular permeability or to a change of endothelial cell angiocrine activity. This is a crucial aspect for a correct interpretation of the results. Would the authors be able to see the same c-fos upregulation in neural cells by limiting permeability with different tools? For instance, mice Meca32- PLVAP knock out? Src inhibitors? VEGF inhibitors? other more specific tools? If this these experiments are not speedily addressable, they should be carefully and frontally discussed.</p><p>A point that should be clarified is whether β-catenin does not play any role in the early angiogenesis of the SFO. The authors could not see, using reporter mice, a significant increase in β-catenin activity of the SFO-endothelial cells starting from 13.5E. However, β-catenin may be important in the very first steps of angiogenesis of SFO and then decline, as it occurs in other regions of the brain microcirculation.

While the quantifications in Figure 4E may appear convincing, the immunostainings shown in Figure 4A-D are not convincing. The amount of vasculature captured in each section appears hugely variable and the Podxl staining for endothelium seems highly variable in strength. Podxl should be luminal and Cldn5 junctional (or is it?) and this is not at all apparent at the magnification shown. Also, if true, the circadian variation in Cldn5 immunoreactivity raises a number of important issues that should be addressed, including if it is junctional or non-junctional Cldn5 that varies, if the effect is transcriptional or not if other tight junction proteins such as occludin and ZO-1 are also regulated, and more. If it is true that TJs are regulated in a circadian fashion, it is obviously interesting, but the physiological consequences are unclear, given that Plvap expression is maintained, and therefore (presumably) fenestrations not regulated. Would TJ regulation matter for the permeability if fenestrations are kept? The authors speculate that the (possible) circadian regulation of Cldn5 could influence the circadian regulation of thirst and drinking behavior, but this is pure speculation, as far as I can judge. Again, how can Cldn5 matter on top of (presumably) open fenestrations? Given the many questions and the premature nature of this data, we suggest they be removed from the present manuscript, to allow a better focus on Wnt/β-catenin regulation of the CVO vessel phenotype. If Wnt signaling is involved in the circadian regulation of Cldn5 expression in CVO vessels, it would also make more sense to study short term effects of β-catenin GOF experiments; now the earliest time point studied in adults is 16 days following induction.</p><p>Another area where conclusions are weak relates to the TEM analysis (Figure 6).

The meaning of the homogenous-looking Aqp4 staining in the CVOs is interesting but may have nothing to do with the absence of a BBB. Does the staining reflect lack of end-foot restricted localization in astrocytes, or is it the tanycytes that express Aqp4 in the CVOs? Also, what does the CD13-staining mean? Is this mural cells or perivascular fibroblasts (see Vanlandewijck et al., 2018)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43818.044</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The gain-of-function mutation of β-catenin is induced in endothelial cell specifically.

An important question, therefore, is whether the observed neural hyperactivation in vivo, induced by β-catenin gain of function in endothelial cells, is due to reduced vascular permeability or to a change of endothelial cell angiocrine activity. This is a crucial aspect for a correct interpretation of the results. Would the authors be able to see the same c-fos upregulation in neural cells by limiting permeability with different tools?

However, β-catenin may be important in the very first steps of angiogenesis of SFO and then decline, as it occurs in other regions of the brain microcirculation.

Consequently, due to the fact that E13.5 was the earliest timepoint the SFO is identifiable, we could not go earlier in order to study Wnt/β-catenin activation. Maybe we haven’t made this point as clear as it should be. We have now introduced this explanation in the Results section.

The physiological assessment of barrier tightness is indeed one of the most relevant parameters to address changes in permeability. In order to tackle the reviewer’s comment, we have injected β-catenin GOF and controls with tamoxifen, waited for 26 days and injected the mice intravenously with FITC-BSA (~68 kDa) and 3 kDa TMR-dextran. The detailed procedure is incorporated in the Material and Methods section of the revised manuscript. We now describe that the permeability for FITC-BSA was significantly reduced in the GOF compared to control animals. This result is now shown in Figure 6.

It might be that we were not clear enough in the original submission of our manuscript, but the data that we’ve presented in the original Figure 5 (now Figure 4 in the revised manuscript) were derived from adult double transgenic mice.

Although the lack of transcriptional regulation of the two junctional genes may suggest that they are no direct targets of βcatenin, we might also face problems of signal masking by tight vessels in the total RNA, isolated from whole mount preparations. We now discuss this in the Discussion section and suggest that future RNAseq analysis of FACS-sorted pools and/or single cells may help to answer this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the blood vessels in SFO acquire Occludin protein expression at cell junctions with β-catenin overexpression? The authors need to show some staining with Occludin antibodies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have investigated occludin (Ocln) expression and localization in SFO vessels of β-catenin GOF and control mice. The staining procedure and the antibody is incorporated in the Material and methods section of the revised manuscript. We now show that beside Cldn5, also Ocln localization at cell-cell junctions is significantly increased in GOF mice (Figure 5 of revised manuscript). Additionally, we have analyzed the expression of Ocln on the mRNA level by qRT-PCR and now show that in line with the expression of Cldn5 also the RNA of Ocln was not significantly increased in the SFO of GOF mice. As mentioned above, this might be due to the masking of the specific endothelial RNA by the total RNA isolated from the whole mount preparations, which inevitably include the ependymal epithelium that also expresses Ocln. Analyzing FACS-sorted cells from the SFO unfortunately, was beyond the scope of the present work.</p><p>In addition to Ocln, we have now also stained for the adherens and tight junction associated protein zonula occludens/tight junction protein 1 (ZO-/Tjp1), which we now show in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. As opposed to Cldn5 and Ocln, for ZO-1 we observed only a minor increase in junctional continuity of ZO-1 staining. This finding fits with a comparable distribution of VE-cadherin/Cdh5 in GOF and control vessels in the SFO (Figure suppl. 4), given that ZO-1 was shown to localize to adherens junctions if tight junctions are weak or absent (Tornavaca et al., 2015). This is now discussed in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The TEM data, clearly show that in GFO mice, pericytes and astrocytes are in close contact with endothelial cells. However, astrocytes do not appear to be polarized (AqP4 is expressed all over the parenchyma, rather than restricted to blood vessels). Are other astrocyte polarity markers (e.g. Dystroglycan or Kir 4.1) absent in this region?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this interesting issue. By showing the staining of Aqp4 for astrocytic endfeet and by CD13 for pericytes, our intention was to visualize potential changes to the entire neuro-vascular unit (NVU) in SFO vessels of β-catenin GOF compared to control mice. That the leaky vessels of the mouse SFO do not exhibit an organization as an NVU was previously shown by Pócsai et al., (2015). Indeed, we could not observe Aqp4 polarisation at astrocytic endfeet in the control conditions, but equally not along with barrier tightening in GOF mice. As suggested by the reviewer we now investigated the polarisation markers α-dystroglycan (α-Dag) and Kir4.1 and obtained comparable results now shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript, suggesting that end feet polarization does not follow endothelial tightening. Specifically, dystroglycan shows weak and not strictly polarized staining around SFO vessel, whereas Kir4.1 seems to be mainly expressed by cells morphologically resembling tanycytes in the SFO. The co-localized distribution of dystroglycan and Kir4.1 around BBB vessels nicely confirmed the specific staining of these markers. This was not only true 26 days after TAM injection but also after 60 day, supporting the interpretation that the proper cellular arrangement of the NVU requires additional cues than endothelial Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One potential explanation for the observation that astrocytes do not form proper endfeet in the SFO region could be due to the absence of basement membrane proteins.

We have investigated collagen IV, laminin α2 (Lama2) with specific antibody staining in SFO vessels of β-catenin GOF and control mice. The staining procedure and the antibodies are incorporated in the Material and methods section of the revised manuscript. We now show that collagen IV and Lama2 are indeed expressed around SFO vessels, and their distribution and localization follows the outline of the vessels. At least from these observations we concluded that the lack of proper astrocytic endfoot formation around SFO vessels has no obvious correlation to a lack of the most abundant basement membrane components. These findings are shown in the revised manuscript in Figure 7—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors nicely demonstrate that β-catenin GOF mice have higher c-Fos levels with water restriction than wild-type mice.

In the manuscript by Goldstein et al. the authors strictly compare food versus water restricted animals in their behaviour and conclude that there are little to no dramatic changes in overall behaviour due to water restriction. Specifically, water-deprived mice perform better regarding rewarding behaviour than food-deprived mice.</p><p>In order to tackle the reviewer’s request, we contacted our collaborators Prof. Jochen Roeper and Dr. Natascha Diamantopoulou (Institute of Neurophysiology, Goethe University Frankfurt), with which we have already planned to investigate the impact of SFO vessel tightening on mouse drinking behaviour. It turned out that it was not feasible to establish and conduct a meaningful experiment within the two month revision timeframe, considering 26d of TAM induction, mouse adaptation and taming, as well as water deprivation and analysis. Although testing the behaviour of Ctrl and GOF mice is beyond the scope of the present study, we believe however, that there is good evidence, that the overall rewarding behaviour does not play a major role in our paradigm. This has been shown and discussed in Augustine et al., 2018, who stated that activation of neurons in the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), as part of the terminal lamina “indicate that MnPO<sup>GLP1R</sup> neurons are activated purely by fluid consumption and not by reward-seeking behaviour or licking action per se. Consistent with the connection from MnPO<sup>GLP1R</sup> to SFO<sup>nNOS</sup> neurons, the activity of the SFO<sup>nNOS</sup> population mirrored precisely the calcium dynamics of MnPO<sup>GLP1R</sup> neurons”. The findings of Augustine et al. may therefore support our interpretation that, the increase in c-fos in the SFO of GOF water-deprived mice, relates to altered water homeostasis rather than altered overall behaviour. Moreover, we learned from our collaborators, that water deprivation as a widely used paradigm to augment the motivation of mice and other rodents, is not considered to lead to “abnormal” behaviour, given that water and food deprivation is the „normal “situation in wild mice, whereas water and food ad libitum could be rather considered as abnormal.</p><p>Nevertheless, we would like to emphasis that the question raised by the reviewer is very valid and that it was and is on our future agenda as it requires substantial expertise in behavioural sciences and adequate equipment (both will be provided by the group of Prof. Roeper). We hope the reviewers appreciate the limitations we faced regarding this question and leave the answer to future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The evidence for circadian regulation of Cldn5 expression weak.

However, we clarified in the main text of the revised manuscript (Results section; Discussion section) that the intention to investigate Aqp4, and as suggested by the reviewers in addition α-Dag and Kir4.1, was to understand if the known lack of a BBB-like NVU organisation of astrocytes, pericytes and endothelial cells in the core of the SFO, was altered by β-catenin GOF in ECs. The combined findings from all markers stained suggest that dominant endothelial activation of β-catenin does not lead to a structural formation of an NVU in the core of the SFO. We believe that this is valuable information, opening new aspects of investigating cellular and molecular interactions at the NVU. Regarding the expression of Aqp4 in astrocytes or tanycytes, the novel data on Kir4.1 expression which likely resembles tanycytes and does not overlap with Aqp4, may suggest that Aqp4 is expressed in astrocytes. We agree with the reviewer that the data on pericytes were too preliminary and hence, we have removed these data from the revised manuscript. Just mentioning that we haven’t seen obvious effects on this cell type as “data not shown”, and that we haven’t investigated perivascular fibroblasts identified by Vanlandewick et al., 2018 (Discussion section).</p></body></sub-article></article>
