bind spindle microtubules to ensure faithful delivery of chromosomes during cell division. The configuration and function of the kinetochore–centromere interface is poorly understood. We report that a protein at this interface, CENP-M, is structurally and evolutionarily related to small GTPases but is incapable of GTP-binding and conformational switching. We show that CENP-M is crucially required for the assembly and stability of a tetramer also comprising CENP-I, CENP-H, and CENP-K, the HIKM complex, which we extensively characterize through a combination of structural, biochemical, and cell biological approaches. A point mutant affecting the CENP-M/CENP-I interaction hampers kinetochore assembly and chromosome alignment and prevents kinetochore recruitment of the CENP-T/W complex, questioning a role of CENP-T/W as founder of an independent axis of kinetochore assembly. Our studies identify a single pathway having CENP-C as founder, and CENP-H/I/K/M and CENP-T/W as CENP-C-dependent followers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02978.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02978.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02978.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a human cell divides to make new cells, its 46 chromosomes must be replicated and then separated evenly between the two daughter cells. The process of separation is performed by the spindle—a network of fibres that form inside the cell, attach to the chromosomes and pull the copies to the opposite ends of the cell.</p><p>The spindle fibres attach to a structure called a kinetochore, which forms at a region of the chromosomes called the centromere. The kinetochore has a layered structure with multiple copies of many proteins, and the inner layer is composed of at least 16 centromeric proteins. These proteins interact directly with the centromere and influence the formation of the rest of the kinetochore and the spindle fibres. While some of the interactions between centromeric proteins have been uncovered, the roles of several of them—including one called CENP-M—remain unknown.</p><p>Now, Basilico, Maffini, Weir et al. reveal that CENP-M is essential for assembling and stabilizing the inner layer of the kinetochore. However, while it is structurally and evolutionarily related to enzymes called GTPases, CENP-M is not an enzyme. Instead, the CENP-M protein interacts with three other centromeric proteins to form a complex that becomes part of the inner layer of the kinetochore. Basilico, Maffini, Weir et al. also find that another centromeric protein, CENP-C, appears to start the assembly of the inner layer. This protein then recruits two complexes made of other centromeric proteins to the kinetochore, including the complex that contains CENP-M.</p><p>The next challenge will be to reconstitute larger protein complexes that contain more proteins from the inner layer of the kinetochore, so that these assemblies can be studied in greater detail. It will also be important to investigate how CENP-C acts as a scaffold to organize the interface between the kinetochore and the centromere.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02978.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02978.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>centromere</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KINCON</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Musacchio</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Framework Program VII, MitoSys</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Musacchio</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bavarian Research Centre of Molecular Biosystems</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herzog</surname><given-names>Franz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Centromeric protein M (CENP-M) is required for the stabilization of a quaternary complex that plays a crucial role in kinetochore organization and function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitosis creates two genetically identical daughter cells through the equal segregation of sister chromatids. Meiosis, on the other hand, aims to halve the genetic content of a mother cell. In either case, chromosome segregation is executed by molecular machinery that is largely conserved in the evolution of eukaryotes. Kinetochores are essential elements of such machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Santaguida and Musacchio, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Westermann and Schleiffer, 2013</xref>). They are biochemically complex structures, which contain multiple copies of approximately 30 core subunits, in turn contributing to recruit many additional regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The inner kinetochore is built on centromeres, genetic loci whose hallmark is the presence of CENP-A, a variant of histone H3. CENP-A interacts with histone H2A, H2B and H4 in a nucleosome-like structure whose precise organization is under discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Black and Cleveland, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates, a group of at least 16 inner kinetochore proteins, collectively identified as constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), neighbors the CENP-A nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Obuse et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Izuta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Okada et al., 2006</xref>). The CCAN (whose subunits are indicated as ‘CENP’—for centromeric protein—followed by a letter, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) interacts with the outer kinetochore and contributes to maintain centromere identity by participating in CENP-A loading at every new cell division cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Perpelescu and Fukagawa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Westhorpe and Straight, 2013</xref>). Understanding the physical organization of the CCAN is instrumental to shed light on these vital functions of CCAN.</p><p>Initial characterization of CCAN subunits after enrichment from cell lysates suggested that they engage in a complex network of interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheeseman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Wulf, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Obuse et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Izuta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Okada et al., 2006</xref>). Subsequent work led to biochemical reconstitution of at least three CCAN sub-complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). First, the 4-subunit CENP-O/P/Q/U complex (also known as COMA complex in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) has been implicated in microtubule binding and spindle checkpoint control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Perpelescu and Fukagawa, 2011</xref>), and is believed to interact with CENP-R, a protein of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hori et al., 2008b</xref>). Second, the 2-subunit CENP-N/L complex binds directly to the CATD box, a specific segment of CENP-A that has been implicated in the epigenetic specification of centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carroll et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Black and Cleveland, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hinshaw and Harrison, 2013</xref>). Third, the 4-subunit CENP-T/W/S/X complex contains proteins with histone-fold domains that bind DNA and have been proposed to form a nucleosome-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hori et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nishino et al., 2012</xref>). Together with CENP-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Earnshaw and Rothfield, 1985</xref>), the CENP-T/W sub-complex has been shown to contribute to outer kinetochore assembly.

Co-expression of full-length CENP-I or CENP-I<sup>57–C</sup> (a CENP-I fragment lacking the first 56 residues of CENP-I, predicted to be disordered) with CENP-H and CENP-K led to a partial solubilization of CENP-I, but the resulting soluble material was unstable and could not be purified homogenously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel D). We therefore asked if further co-expression of CENP-M favored solubilization of CENP-I<sup>57–C</sup>. Indeed, co-expression of CENP-M with CENP-I<sup>57–C</sup>, CENP-H and CENP-K resulted in a soluble and stable 4-subunit complex that could be purified to homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, panels C–E). Thus, CENP-M stabilizes a quaternary complex containing CENP-H, CENP-I<sup>57–C</sup>, CENP-K, and CENP-M, to which we refer as ‘HIKM complex’. The theoretical molecular masses of the HIKM complex and of recombinant HI<sup>57–C</sup>KM complex used in our studies are 166 and 159 kDa, respectively. In SEC experiments, the HI<sup>57–C</sup>KM complex eluted close to the 158-kDa protein marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that the recombinant complex contains a single copy of each subunit.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Subunit composition and interactions of the HIKM complex</title><p>To shed light on the organization of the HIKM complex, we subjected it to chemical cross-linking with the bifunctional reagent BS2G (bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]glutarate), which cross-links the primary amines of lysine side chains within a distance compatible with the length of the cross-linker (7.7 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maiolica et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herzog et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis identified numerous cross-links between CENP-H and CENP-K, the majority of which mapped to the central domains of these proteins, which are likely to adopt an α-helical arrangement. The specific co-linear distribution of cross-links in this region suggests that CENP-H and CENP-K interact through an extended interface in a parallel arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; the list of crosslinks is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>In addition to interacting with each other, the central domains of CENP-H and CENP-K displayed an extensive network of cross-links with the N-terminal region of CENP-I<sup>57–C</sup>.

Two cross-links, however, were observed between CENP-M and CENP-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In SEC experiments, CENP-M did not interact with CENP-I<sup>57–281</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel G) or with the CENP-HI<sup>57–281</sup>K complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), collectively suggesting that the incorporation of CENP-M in the CENP-HIKM complex requires CENP-I, and that the interaction of CENP-M with CENP-I requires residues located C-terminally to residue 281. However, co-expression of CENP-M with CENP-I was insufficient to solubilize CENP-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, left part of panel E). In summary, these observations suggest that CENP-I bridges CENP-H/K and CENP-M, and that both CENP-H/K and CENP-M contribute to CENP-I solubility and stabilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Structural analysis reveals a small G-protein fold in CENP-M</title><p>We generated crystals of residues 1–171 of CENP-M (a fragment identified by limited proteolysis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel A) and determined their crystal structure by the SAD (single-wavelength anomalous diffraction) method to a resolution of 1.5 Å using a SeMet derivative (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

They can act as molecular switches by engaging in different interactions with effectors that depend on the bound nucleotide (GTP or GDP). Small GTPases describe a superfamily of proteins, which are generally classified in several families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rojas et al., 2012</xref>). Structural superposition with representative members of different families identified Rab proteins as the closest structural homologs of CENP-M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). A sequence alignment derived from the structural superposition of HsCENP-M with HsRab1A (PDB code 4FMC, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dong et al., 2012</xref>]) shows that CENP-M has lost essential sequence motifs required for GTP binding and hydrolysis by small G-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). For instance, the glycine-rich P-loop (GX<sub>4</sub>GKS/T, where X is any aminoacid), which is involved in GTP binding by GTPases, lacks two essential Gly residues in CENP-M. The so-called switch I and switch II regions of small GTPases, which are sensitive to nucleotide hydrolysis and create a dependency on nucleotide status for the interaction of GTPases with their effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherfils and Zeghouf, 2013</xref>), are also profoundly modified in CENP-M. A deletion of the entire α1-β2 loop and the β2 strand effectively removed the switch I region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), while the sequence corresponding to switch II (DxxG motif) is highly divergent. Thus, HsCENP-M has the fold of a small GTPase, but may be unable to bind (and therefore hydrolyze) GTP. Experiments with MANT nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hiratsuka, 1983</xref>) confirmed this prediction directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel D).</p><p>Despite the divergence of CENP-M from <italic>bona fide</italic> GTPases, several elements indicate that CENP-M evolved from active GTPases. For instance, distant CENP-M family members retain a canonical P-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel E, ‘Discussion’). More importantly, phylogenetic analyses using a CENP-M/Rab1 structure-based sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, see ‘Materials and methods’ for details) replicated the distribution of Ras sub-families previously described using a different template alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rojas et al., 2012</xref>). CENP-M family members cluster at the base of the RAB/RAS sub-families, suggesting that CENP-M might have originated at a similar time. The relative location of the ARF/SRPRB sub-families seems to exclude CENP-M as a basal member of the superfamily. Early divergent eukaryotes (such as amoebas) and early metazoans (molluscs) express both CENP-M and <italic>bona fide</italic> GTPases. CENP-M, however, has been lost from most fungi, where additional protein products of specific lineage expansions or existing Rab proteins may fulfill its role (‘Discussion’). In conclusion, we identify CENP-M as a ‘pseudo G-protein’, in analogy to inactive kinase domains, indicated with the term ‘pseudokinase’.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Structural organization of the HIKM complex</title><p>Because the structure of CENP-I is unknown, we submitted its sequence to the structure prediction servers I-TASSER, Phyre2 and Rosetta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das and Baker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kelley and Sternberg, 2009</xref>).

We therefore asked if CENP-M is required for kinetochore localization of CENP-I.

To overcome this objection, we sought to identify point mutations in CENP-M affecting its interaction with CENP-I. To identify such mutants, we focused on conserved residues exposed at the surface of CENP-M (indicated with an asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; see also the alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel E), reasoning that at least a subset of such conserved surface-exposed residues might be involved in CENP-I binding.

Subsequently, CENP-M was shown to be closely associated with CENP-A, as well as with CENP-H, CENP-K, CENP-I, CENP-L, CENP-N, and CENP-T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Obuse et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Izuta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Okada et al., 2006</xref>). RNAi-based depletion of CENP-M caused mis-localization of other CCAN subunits, thus pointing to an important role of CENP-M in inner kinetochore stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Okada et al., 2006</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms subtending to the function of CENP-M and the physical interactions in which CENP-M engages at the kinetochore had remained unknown.</p><p>Kinetochores, like many other cellular structures, are patchworks of different protein–protein interaction motifs and domains. For instance, at least six kinetochore proteins, including the CCAN subunit CENP-O and CENP-P (respectively orthologs of Mcm21 and Ctf19 of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), contain RWD domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schmitzberger and Harrison, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Petrovic et al., 2014</xref>). More recently, the structure of the Chl4/Iml3 complex of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, respectively orthologs of CENP-N and CENP-L, revealed structural similarity with the bacterial recombination-association protein RdgC and with TATA-binding protein TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hinshaw and Harrison, 2013</xref>). In this study, we have extended the collection of kinetochore folds by demonstrating that CENP-M folds like a small GTPase, as recently postulated based on prediction methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Westermann and Schleiffer, 2013</xref>). CENP-M is devoid of all essential sequence signatures associated with nucleotide binding, hydrolysis and conformational switching of small GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rojas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherfils and Zeghouf, 2013</xref>). An invariant feature of CENP-M is the presence of leucine at position 52 (of HsCENP-M), equivalent to Gln61 (Q61) at the end of the Switch II region of Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Mutation of Gln61 to Leu impairs GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scheidig et al., 1999</xref>) and unleashes the transforming potential of Ras. Thus, the first step leading CENP-M to diverge from genuine GTPases might have been an impairment of GTP hydrolysis, followed by the loss of other features associated with GTP handling. Consistent with this hypothesis, a substantially conserved P-loop is present in distant CENP-M family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel E). Our phylogenetic analysis identified CENP-M as a <italic>bona fide</italic> member of the small GTPase tree and suggests that CENP-M might have evolved from an ancestor shared with Rab-family GTPases.</p><p>Interestingly, CENP-M can only be identified in metazoans but not in fungal genomes. Conversely, the other components of the complex, CENP-H, CENP-I, and CENP-K, are nearly ubiquitously conserved and are clearly identified in fungi, where they appear to interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Measday et al., 2002</xref>). Given the importance of CENP-M in kinetochore assembly and stability, and its interaction with evolutionarily conserved proteins, its absence in several representatives of Opisthokonta is puzzling. We consider it unlikely that the fission yeast protein Mis17 is a CENP-M ortholog, as recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shiroiwa et al., 2011</xref>), because all computational prediction tools we tested failed to identify a domain related to GTPases in Mis17 (data not shown). It is possible, however, that Mis17 acts as a functional analogue of CENP-M. It is also legitimate to speculate that a functional GTPase, possibly a Rab-family GTPase given its evolutionary proximity to CENP-M, might take up the function of CENP-M in those organisms in which CENP-M cannot be identified.</p><p>Modeling of CENP-I suggests that it adopts an α-solenoid fold analogous to that observed in β-importin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cingolani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vetter et al., 1999</xref>). An N-terminal domain of CENP-I (residues 57–281) is sufficient to bind the CENP-H/K sub-complex, while the C-terminal half (residues 282-C) is necessary to bind CENP-M. Contiguity between CENP-H, CENP-I, and CENP-K had been previously hypothesized based on proteomic analysis of precipitates from cellular lysates, from the similarity of phenotypes caused by depletion of individual subunits, and from 2-hybrid interaction data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Measday et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Okada et al., 2006</xref>). However, that the interactions among these subunits were direct, and that CENP-M was also part of the complex, had remained unclear. Thus, our reconstitution of a stable quaternary complex, the HIKM complex, significantly extends these previous analyses and identifies a new stable sub-complex of crucial importance for kinetochore stability.</p><p>The HIKM complex flanks other previously recognized stable kinetochore sub-complexes, including the CENP-O/P/Q/U complex, the Mis12 complex, the Ndc80 complex, the CENP-L/N complex and the CENP-T/W/S/X complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meraldi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hemmerich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Perpelescu and Fukagawa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Westermann and Schleiffer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Westhorpe and Straight, 2013</xref>). In this study, we have identified a direct interaction with the CENP-T/W/S/X complex. Our future studies will address whether HIKM forms direct interactions with other kinetochore sub-complexes or subunits. Also of interest is the role of the HIKM complex in recruiting the chromatin remodeling FACT complex, contributing to CENP-A deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Obuse et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Okada et al., 2009</xref>), as well as in the recruitment of spindle checkpoint components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>CENP-T depletion hampers kinetochore localization of the subunits of the HIKM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hori et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>). However, we now show that the HIKM complex is mutually required for stable association of CENP-T/W with kinetochores. The identification of a direct interaction between the HIKM complex and the CENP-T/W complex may configure a mechanistic basis for this phenomenon. Thus, the sole interaction with centromeric chromatin (‘Introduction’) is not sufficient to recruit or retain CENP-T/W at kinetochores in the absence of the subunits of the HIKM complex. Collectively, our observations, together with (a) recent structural data on DNA-bound CENP-T/W/S/X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Takeuchi et al., 2014</xref>), (b) previous observations that CENP-T and CENP-W undergo relatively rapid turnover times at centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Prendergast et al., 2011</xref>), and (c) previous observations that CENP-S/X occupies a rather peripheral position within kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amano et al., 2009</xref>) suggest that the hypothesis that CENP-T/W/S/X are embedded in a nucleosome-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nishino et al., 2012</xref>) might require further scrutiny.</p><p>Because CENP-C is required for recruitment of the HIKM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Milks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>), and HIKM is in turn required for CENP-T recruitment (this study), we tested and confirmed the prediction that CENP-T recruitment is also dependent on CENP-C. Conversely, disruption of the CENP-M/CENP-I interaction, or depletion of CENP-T, did not have major effects on the kinetochore localization of CENP-C, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goshima et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). These findings unequivocally position CENP-T/W downstream of CENP-C, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll et al., 2010</xref>), and imply that the interaction of CENP-C with CENP-A, possibly together with the interaction of CENP-L/N with CENP-A, represents the apex of the CCAN recruitment pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and 2 reviewers. The Senior editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Senior editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see, the reviews are very positive and we will be pleased to move towards acceptance once the following issue is addressed. The principal issue has to do with the modeling of the CENP-I structure. While it seems reasonable, there is some concern that it is not properly validated and could lead to its acceptance as correct by the less than careful reader. Please read the reviews, which are included in their entirety below, and respond to us by email as to your planned course of action. The editor will discuss your response with the reviewers and will then give you a final set of instructions to submit a revised manuscript, which will be handled without further external review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic>:</p><p>The centromere and kinetochore are required for attaching chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, and thus for faithful chromosome segregation. Despite the importance of the centromere and kinetochore, how the &gt;100 proteins of the complex come together to give rise to its essential functions is unknown. In this manuscript, Basilico and colleagues define the structure, function and interactions of an essential protein complex at centromeres the protein the CENP-HIKM complex. This paper is exceptionally well done and represents an important contribution to our understanding of human centromere structure and formation. It should be published with only minor modifications.</p><p>Basilico et al. first present a careful and thorough analysis of CENP-M, a poorly understood member of the centromere. The authors show that CENP-M and CENP-I interact and mutually depend on each other for centromere localisation. CENP-M is shown to be a member of a four-component complex also consisting of CENP-H/I/K, a previously suggested centromere subcomplex. What follows is an impressive biochemical, structural and bioinformatic characterisation of CENP-HIKM (HIKM). Indeed, the depth of analysis into HIKM separates this study from many previous studies of centromere components that often leave a confusing picture of the centromere.</p><p>In addition, the manuscript characterizes how HIKM 'fits' into the overall assembly of the centromere. While some aspects of this problem have been previously studied, the authors emphasize the observation that CENP-T/W/S/X requires HIKM for its centromere localization, and explain this with novel biochemical analyses that reveal HIKM directly interacts with CENP-T/W. This is an important missing link in our knowledge of centromere formation, and allows the authors to question some recent proposals that have confused the field.</p><p>In summary, the high quality of the data, the depth of the characterization of CENP-M/H/I/K, and the clarity of the presentation made this manuscript a pleasure to read. The literature on centromere formation presents a somewhat confusing and inconsistent picture, often due to a lack high quality biochemical analyses to complement cell biological approaches. This manuscript does not fall into this category. I highly recommend publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, with no significant changes or additions required.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>The authors use point mutations in GFP-tagged CENP-M to suggest that 'CENP-M and CENP-I are mutually required for kinetochore localization', as mutant CENP-M does not localize to kinetochores or rescue CENP-I localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E/F</xref>). This model would be further supported by depleting CENP-I and showing complete loss of CENP-M from kinetochores. For example, if CENP-M had other roles at centromeres that didn't involve CENP-I, but did involve the CENP-M's L94 and L163 residues, I would expect the same results as those presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>I am intrigued whether CENP-M RNAi has an effect on CENP-H &amp; CENP-K? This would be an extension of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">figure 4E/F</xref>, which shows CENP-M RNAi prevents CENP-I localization. If HIKM was exclusively acting as a complex, an effect may be expected. If H/K were insensitive to CENP-M RNAi this would still be an interesting result.</p><p>The authors support a model that CENP-A nucleosomes (and their recognition by CENP-C/N) provides the central platform for centromere assembly (rather than the CENP-T/W/S/X complex). The primary data supporting this argument is the RNAi-mediated depletion of CENP-C resulting in CENP-T centromere delocalisation. This result was previously published and should be better referenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caroll et al. 2010</xref>). However, the importance of this observation in the current manuscript helps to clarify a point of confusion in the field surrounding the interdependence of CENP-C and CENP-T/W/S/X and their roles in centromere assembly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2</italic>:</p><p>Basilico et al present a comprehensive characterisation of the CENP-M protein, a constituent of the inner kinetochore and so-called CCAN network. The principle conclusions are that the fold of the protein is that of a degenerate GTPase and is required for the formation of a larger “HIKM” complex that acts upstream of several other CCAN components, notably the TWSX histone fold complex. These conclusions are supported by a variety of structural, biochemical and cell-based studies. In addition, a model for the HIKM complex based upon bioinformatic, cross-linking and EM studies is proposed. The data are well presented, thorough and of high quality. The notion that that the HIKM complex is upstream of TWSX recruitment and does not necessarily constitute a parallel pathway is also consistent with the evolutionary distribution of CCAN components. Overall, I think the study is eminently suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>My principle concern with the manuscript is the modelling of the CENP-I structure, which is mainly based on secondary structure prediction algorithms. While it may prove to be broadly accurate, a more detailed bioinformatic analysis would strengthen the paper. For example, given that the predicted structure contains multiple HEAT repeats, can these then be identified on the basis of sequence alone, and aligned to each other? Are the predicted structures of Ctf3 and Mis6 similar to that of CENP-I (and do they contain putative repeats)? Presumably if the interaction with CENP-M occurs on the concave inner surface by analogy to the Ran-Importin structure, there should be conserved features present. Can these been identified and mapped to the modelled structure? I'm also not entirely convinced that the cross-linking data supports the N- to C- termini interaction as claimed. While there are indeed intramolecular cross-links found between these regions, there appear to be an almost equal number between the extreme N-terminal of the protein and the region around residue 300, implicated CENP-H/K binding. It is a little difficult to reconcile these observations with the model presented. Furthermore the schematic presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> implies that the coiled-coil of CENP-HK runs parallel to the outside surface of CENP-I (which is convex in the model) and would place the axis of the coiled-coil at right angles to the axis of the HEAT repeat, which seems unlikely (and also would probably not fit into the EM reconstruction as suggested in supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">figure 4</xref>). I appreciate that in the absence of experimental data, these types of modelling study are useful, but there is a danger of them becoming accepted as reality, particularly if determining the high-resolution structure of the complex proves intractable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02978.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p><italic>The authors use point mutations in GFP-tagged CENP-M to suggest that 'CENP-M and CENP-I are mutually required for kinetochore localization', as mutant CENP-M does not localize to kinetochores or rescue CENP-I localization (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5E/F</italic></xref><italic>).

We have therefore tried to perform this experiment by using silencing oligonucleotides designed based on a previous report (Liu et all, NCB 2003). We first tested the protocol described in the paper and that consisted in one round of transfection and a depletion time of 72 hrs. The results were disappointing, as the cells showed a very modest decrease in CENP-I levels. We therefore performed another experiment, using a protocol similar to the one used for CENP-M in our manuscript. Unfortunately, the depletion levels remained low (approximately a 20-30% decrease). It appears therefore that this experiment might require significant more preparation and troubleshooting than we had anticipated, and ultimately opted to submit the revised manuscript without it. We note however that Obuse <italic>et al.</italic> (Nature Cell Biology 2006) reported loss of CENP-M in DT40 chicken cells knockout for CENP-I, in line with the prediction that these proteins may be co-dependent for kinetochore localization.</p><p><italic>I am intrigued whether CENP-M RNAi has an effect on CENP-H &amp; CENP-K?

If H/K were insensitive to CENP-M RNAi this would still be an interesting result</italic>.</p><p>Regretfully we are not in a position to carry out this experiment at this time, due to lack of a suitable antibody for recognition of CENP-H/K at the kinetochore by immunofluorescence. In the absence of such an antibody, which we have started producing to support a follow-up to this story, we would have to proceed by creating new cell lines with labeled versions of CENP-H or CENP-K, which, with all possible technical difficulties associated with the task, would clearly make the revision a rather lengthy process. In view of the fact that the reviewer considered this experiment a minor addition to the story we are presenting, we decided not to include it.</p><p><italic>The authors support a model that CENP-A nucleosomes (and their recognition by CENP-C/N) provides the central platform for centromere assembly (rather than the CENP-T/W/S/X complex).

We have now indicated in two additional instances the agreement of our results with the results of Carroll and colleagues (2010). In particular, we have included: “These results are in agreement with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll et al., 2010</xref>) and highlight the essential role of CENP-C as the basis of the pathway of kinetochore assembly of the HIKM and CENP-T/W complexes.” We then reinforce this as follows: “These findings unequivocally position CENP-T/W downstream of CENP-C, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll et al., 2010</xref>), and imply that the interaction of CENP-C with CENP-A, possibly together with the interaction of CENP-L/N with CENP-A, represents the apex of the CCAN recruitment pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).”</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p><italic>My principle concern with the manuscript is the modelling of the CENP-I structure, which is mainly based on secondary structure prediction algorithms.

Contrarily to program COILS, which we had originally used for our analysis, REPPER did not predict the existence of coiled-coils in CENP-H and CENP-K. We therefore suspect that the latter are merely helical proteins. At a suggestion of our colleague Andrei Lupas (who conceived both programs), with whom we discussed this issue, we opted to rely on the REPPER output and modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> as well as our original discussion on the possible interaction of the coiled-coil regions predicted by COILS. We now refer to these as the “central regions” of CENP-H and CENP-K and present them as possibly helical regions.</p><p>2) We agree with the reviewer that there is a wealth of crosslinks between the N- and C-terminal regions of CENP-I and the middle region of CENP-I. However, our argument was based on the fact that the same residue of CENP-M interacts with both the N- and C-terminal regions of CENP-I, suggesting that they are close in space in the complex. This, together with the extensive number of intra-CENP-I crosslinks linking the N- and C-termini, supports rather convincingly the possibility that the N- and C-termini of CENP-I are close in space.</p><p>When considered altogether, our observations seem in line with the scheme of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, which of course is only meant as a useful “recap” of the observations that we can derive from our biochemical and biophysical analysis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
