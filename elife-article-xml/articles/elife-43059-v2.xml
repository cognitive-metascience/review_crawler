is a cause or consequence of the aging process. In neurodegenerative diseases and other amyloidoses, specific proteins self-assemble into amyloid fibrils and accumulate as pathological aggregates in different tissues. More recently, widespread protein aggregation has been described during normal aging. Until now, an extensive characterization of the nature of age-dependent protein aggregation has been lacking. Here, we show that age-dependent aggregates are rapidly formed by newly synthesized proteins and have an amyloid-like structure resembling that of protein aggregates observed in disease. We then demonstrate that age-dependent protein aggregation accelerates the functional decline of different tissues in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Together, these findings imply that amyloid-like aggregates contribute to the aging process and therefore could be important targets for strategies designed to maintain physiological functions in the

functions and organ integrity and indeed diminished physical capacity and cognitive functions are already apparent before midlife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belsky et al., 2015</xref>). The aging process greatly enhances the risk for chronic diseases leading to long-term disabilities in the elderly population and often premature death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaeberlein, 2013</xref>). A better understanding of what drives aging and in particular functional decline holds the promise of identifying targets to maintain quality of life with old age. It is generally agreed that the ultimate root causes of aging occur at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaeberlein, 2013</xref>). One of the most universal hallmarks of aging is increased protein instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Golubev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gorisse et al., 2016</xref>). In young individuals, an efficient protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network prevents the accumulation of damaged proteins. However, overwhelming evidence points to a collapse in the proteostasis network with age and consequently a decline in the ability to cope with protein physical and chemical instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor and Dillin, 2011</xref>). Still the role of protein instability in aging is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finch and Crimmins, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hekimi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>During aging, an important cause of protein instability is cumulative damage through non-enzymatic posttranslational modifications occurring through reactions with metabolites and reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Golubev et al., 2017</xref>). Destabilizing mutations, transcriptional and translational inefficacy are also a significant source of protein instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nedialkova and Leidel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vermulst et al., 2015</xref>). In a disease context, a specific form of protein instability, namely protein aggregation, is a common feature of amyloidoses and many neurodegenerative diseases. In these diseases, a specific protein converts from its native soluble conformation into an insoluble state by self-assembly into a cross-β sheet filamentous structure termed amyloid fibril. Amyloid fibrils accumulate as pathological deposits in a variety of different tissues. Although most proteins contain amyloid-promoting sequences and form amyloid fibrils in appropriate conditions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldschmidt et al., 2010</xref>), there is little evidence for this disease-related conformational state in metazoa in the absence of disease. Global proteomic characterizations of age-dependent protein insolubility, a hallmark of disease-associated protein aggregation, have been carried out in wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reis-Rodrigues et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Walther et al., 2015</xref>). Several hundred proteins enriched in distinct structural and functional characteristics were identified that lose their native structure in aged animals and become highly insoluble in strong detergents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lechler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reis-Rodrigues et al., 2012</xref>). In vivo data demonstrate that these proteins accumulate in solid/immobile structures in aged animals. However, until now it is not known whether these age-dependent protein aggregates contain amyloid fibrils. Elucidating the structural nature of this novel type of protein instability would help to understand the causes and consequences of protein aggregation during aging and to explain potential interactions with disease-aggregating proteins.</p><p>Since the initial discovery in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, age-dependent protein aggregation has been demonstrated in different organs in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayyadevara et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayyadevara et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Groh et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leeman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanase et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, age-dependent protein aggregation is likely to be relevant in neurodegenerative processes. Indeed, the over-representation of proteins prone to aggregate with age among proteins sequestered in Alzheimer’s disease inclusions of amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles highlights a possible contribution to pathological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciryam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, recent evidence shows that aggregates from wild-type aged mouse brains are a potent heterologous seed for amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Groh et al., 2017a</xref>). However, because of the difficulties to distinguish the effects of protein aggregation from other consequences of aging, it is still not clear whether age-dependent protein aggregation plays a role in accelerating the aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">David, 2012</xref>). A previous study has shown that <italic>C. elegans</italic> treated with RNAi targeting genes encoding aggregation-prone proteins tend to live longer than randomly chosen targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reis-Rodrigues et al., 2012</xref>). However, the interpretation of these results is complicated by the loss-of-function of these proteins. Recently, we found that aged animals with high aggregation levels of an RNA-binding protein (RBP) with a low-complexity prion-like domain were shorter lived, significantly smaller and less motile than animals with low RBP aggregation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lechler et al., 2017</xref>). Still this evidence does not provide a definite answer to whether age-dependent protein aggregation plays a causal role in aging rather than being a simple byproduct. To understand whether protein aggregation is protective or harmful, it is informative to look at how long-lived animals modulate protein solubility. Longevity mechanisms and enhanced proteostasis are tightly coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor and Dillin, 2011</xref>). However, whereas several studies show reduced age-dependent protein aggregation in long-lived animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demontis and Perrimon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lechler et al., 2017</xref>), a recent study suggests that enhancing protein aggregation could be a strategy to promote longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Walther et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we use a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaminski Schierle et al., 2011</xref>), Thioflavin T (ThT) staining and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Young et al., 2016</xref>) to reveal amyloid-like structures in age-dependent protein aggregates in vivo. Unlike protein chemical instability caused by cumulative damage, age-dependent protein aggregates are formed by intrinsically aggregation-prone proteins, even shortly after their synthesis. We demonstrate that age-dependent protein aggregation is toxic and contributes to functional decline in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title id="head_2">Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title id="head_3">Age-dependent aggregating proteins are intrinsically prone to aggregate in certain tissues</title><p>Previously, we performed an extensive characterization of the aggregation of two proteins, casein kinase I isoform alpha (KIN-19) and Ras-like GTP-binding protein rhoA (RHO-1). Both KIN-19 and RHO-1 were identified among the proteins with the highest propensity to become insoluble with age in wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David et al., 2010</xref>). In vivo analysis of animals expressing these proteins fused to fluorescent tags showed the appearance of immobile deposits with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David et al., 2010</xref>). Among the insoluble proteome, the enrichment of certain physico-chemical features such as high aliphatic amino acid content or propensity to form β-sheet-rich structures shows that age-dependent protein aggregation is not random (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lechler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Walther et al., 2015</xref>). To understand whether KIN-19 and RHO-1 have an intrinsic capacity to aggregate similar to disease-associated proteins or whether a progressive accumulation of protein damage caused by non-enzymatic posttranslational modifications is required to induce their aggregation, we evaluated the dynamics of protein aggregation in vivo. Protein labeling with mEOS2, a green-to-red photoconvertible fluorescent protein, has been successfully used to track protein dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKinney et al., 2009</xref>). In the present case, we used the mEOS2 tag to investigate how fast newly synthesized KIN-19 and RHO-1 aggregate. For this purpose, we generated transgenic animals expressing KIN-19::mEOS2 in either the pharynx or in the body-wall muscles and transgenic animals expressing RHO-1::mEOS2 in the pharynx. The mEOS2 tag did not disrupt the aggregation potential of KIN-19, as the absence of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching confirms that both KIN-19::mEOS2 puncta in the pharynx and body-wall muscle are highly immobile structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).</p><p>To follow newly synthesized proteins, we set-up a system to perform irreversible photoconversion of the mEOS2 tag present in live animals from green to red by exposing them to intense blue light. At a defined time-point, we photoconverted the mEOS present in aggregates to red. After the photoconversion, newly synthesized proteins emitted green fluorescence and could thus easily be distinguished from old (photoconverted/red) aggregates. This method allowed us to follow the rate of new aggregate formation and the rate of old aggregate removal in a population of transgenic animals over time. We observed photoconversion of all aggregates, but we also noted that the core region of some larger aggregates continued to emit green fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a doubling in the number of animals with newly-formed green aggregates, 24 hr after the conversion at day 5 of adulthood in both the pharyngeal and body-wall muscles. Conversely, analysis of the red aggregates suggested a slow removal of old aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>).

X-ray diffraction shows that the human orthologues are globular proteins formed by a series of α-helices and β-strands. The ability of KIN-19 and RHO-1 to aggregate shortly after synthesis suggests that their aggregation may be associated with the presence of folding intermediates. Notably, both proteins have several segments with a high amyloid propensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldschmidt et al., 2010</xref>). These features raise the possibility that KIN-19 and RHO-1 gain an amyloid-like conformation during their aggregation with age. We have previously shown that FLIM can be used to determine whether certain proteins are likely to form amyloid-like aggregates as the formation of amyloid fibrils leads to a significant drop in the fluorescence lifetime of the fluorescent-tagged amyloid proteins due to quenching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaminski Schierle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murakami et al., 2015</xref>). In the current study, we applied FLIM to determine whether KIN-19 and RHO-1 form amyloid-like aggregates in live <italic>C. elegans</italic>. For this, we generated transgenic animals expressing translational fusions with the yellow fluorescent protein Venus in the pharynx. We first confirmed that there is an age-dependent increase in aggregate formation by KIN-19::Venus and RHO-1::Venus in the pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lechler et al., 2017</xref>). Using FLIM, we found that pharyngeal KIN-19 and RHO-1::Venus display a significantly decreased fluorescence lifetime compared to Venus only control worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Areas with the strongest drop in fluorescence lifetime co-localize with fluorescent-labeled aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Of note, we also observed a similar drop in the fluorescence lifetime of pharyngeal RHO-1 labeled with tagRFP compared to tagRFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In both models with KIN-19 and RHO-1, we observed a significant drop in the fluorescence lifetime already at day 1, consistent with the appearance of aggregates in young animals due to protein overexpression. In particular, between day 1 and day 7 of adulthood, we measured a dramatic decrease in fluorescence lifetime of RHO-1 aggregates and a more modest decrease in the fluorescence lifetime of KIN-19 aggregates. This result is consistent with the age-dependent increase in aggregate formation by both proteins and the fact that RHO-1 puncta tend to be larger and more solid than KIN-19 puncta. Indeed, all RHO-1 puncta evaluated showed no recovery after photobleaching, whereas 30% of KIN-19 puncta showed some recovery as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C–E</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David et al., 2010</xref>).

We obtained low quantities of RHO-1 fibrils, which we were able to analyze by TEM. Analysis of RHO-1 by TEM revealed fibril-like structures which resemble amyloid fibrils such as formed by huntingtin (Htt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reif et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, RHO-1 fibrils had a morphology more similar to Htt fibrils which are shorter and more branch-like compared to fibrils formed from other amyloids such as alpha-synuclein, which are long and flexible. Additionally, RHO-1 and Htt fibrils display no twisting which can be observed in alpha-synuclein fibrils, suggesting that the packing of the monomeric structure and the interaction between protofibrils may be different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lyubchenko et al., 2012</xref>).

To investigate whether age-dependent protein aggregation accelerates functional decline with age, we measured pharyngeal pumping and swimming in liquid (thrashing) in transgenic animals overexpressing fluorescent-labeled KIN-19 and RHO-1 either in the pharynx or the body-wall muscles. In both models with KIN-19 and in the model with pharyngeal RHO-1, protein aggregation increased with age, as measured by the change from a diffuse distribution to the formation of specific puncta by the fluorescent-tagged proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among the transgenic models generated, the largest age-dependent changes were observed for <italic>C. elegans</italic> expressing KIN-19::tagRFP in the pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David et al., 2010</xref>). Although the majority of these transgenic animals have no aggregation at day 2, this dramatically changes with age and at day 8, the majority display high levels of KIN-19::tagRFP aggregation. Importantly, pumping frequency was strongly reduced in day 7 aged animals with the highest levels of pharyngeal KIN-19::tagRFP aggregation compared to those with the lowest aggregation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The detrimental effect of age-dependent protein aggregation was also apparent in animals with KIN-19::tagRFP aggregation in the body-wall muscles, since we observed an earlier decline in swimming frequency associated with KIN-19::tagRFP aggregation in the body-wall muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This effect was amplified in animals with the highest level of aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Most likely due to the high level of overexpression in the pharyngeal muscles, RHO-1::tagRFP aggregated abundantly already in young animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,E</xref>). We found that these high levels of RHO-1::tagRFP aggregation strongly impaired pharyngeal pumping in young animals (day 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Notably, these young animals displayed pumping rates normally observed only in aged animals. Moreover, RHO-1 aggregation disrupted actin filament structure in the pharyngeal muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). To exclude that RHO-1 overexpression itself is toxic to <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we examined another transgenic model where RHO-1::Venus is expressed under the strong <italic>C. elegans</italic> body-wall muscle promoter <italic>Punc-54</italic>. These animals have similar levels of transgene expression compared to animals with body-wall muscle KIN-19::tagRFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Yet, whereas KIN-19 aggregates abundantly in the body-wall muscle, RHO-1::Venus hardly aggregates in this tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, these transgenics are a suitable control to identify RHO-1 toxicity caused by overexpression. Importantly, we did not observe reduced thrashing in animals with body-wall muscle RHO-1, demonstrating that overexpressed of RHO-1 without concomittant aggregation is not toxic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Similarly, the observation that only animals with the highest levels of pharyngeal KIN-19::tagRFP aggregation have functional impairment shows that KIN-19::tagRFP overexpression alone does not cause pumping defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Together, these positive and negative controls reveal that protein aggregation itself is detrimental in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Collectively, these findings show that animals with accelerated protein aggregation experience an earlier onset of functional decline in the tissues affected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title id="head_6">Discussion</title><p>Widespread protein aggregation in the context of normal aging has been observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reis-Rodrigues et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Walther et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demontis and Perrimon, 2010</xref>), <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peters et al., 2012</xref>) and in mammals, notably in neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leeman et al., 2018</xref>), heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayyadevara et al., 2016b</xref>) and skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayyadevara et al., 2016a</xref>), bone marrow and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanase et al., 2016</xref>). Although these hundreds of proteins are maintained in a functional and soluble state in young animals, they lose their functional structure with age and accumulate into insoluble aggregates. The detergent insoluble properties and solid nature of the aggregates indicate similarities with disease-associated protein aggregation. However, until now it has not been known whether age-dependent protein aggregates display amyloid-like structures, a key characteristic of disease-associated protein aggregation. In this study, we focus on two normally globular proteins, Casein kinase I isoform alpha and Ras-like GTP-binding protein rhoA. We show that aggregates of either proteins display distinct fluorescence quenching properties characteristic of amyloid structures. In neurodegenerative diseases and amyloidosis, protein aggregation is a crucial part of the pathological process. We demonstrate that aggregates formed by proteins prone to aggregation with age contribute to functional decline in the tissues affected. Our results predict that even if only a proportion of the hundreds of proteins becoming insoluble with age form harmful amyloid-like aggregates, this would be a significant cause of tissue aging for a variety of organs.</p><p>The speed of aggregate formation and the presence of amyloid-like structure brings significant insight into the aggregation process occurring during normal aging. We demonstrate that newly synthesized proteins rapidly assemble into large aggregates. The recruitment of newly synthesized proteins into existing aggregates indicates a seeding effect. However, we also observed the rapid formation of new aggregates entirely made up of newly synthesized proteins. This result shows that molecular aging of the protein caused by progressive accumulation of damage is not required for proteins to aggregate with age. Moreover, amyloid-like aggregates forming already in young animals indicate an intrinsic aggregation propensity. Therefore, it is likely that these proteins self-assemble into amyloid structures directly from unfolded or partially folded states occurring during or shortly after translation rather than undergoing unfolding from their natively folded state. This conclusion is consistent with the view that protein folding intermediates are particularly at risk of aggregating as exemplified by a recent study revealing that newly synthesized proteins constitute the majority of the insoluble fraction prompted by thermal stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, artificially increasing ribosome pausing during translation causes widespread protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nedialkova and Leidel, 2015</xref>). Both Casein kinase I isoform alpha and Ras-like GTP-binding protein rhoA contain several hexapeptides with high propensity for fibrillation which are normally buried in the fully folded protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the most prominent amyloid-promoting sequence for both proteins is localized near the N-terminus. Therefore, aberrant interactions may start already during translation. As protein aggregation typically results in loss of function, there is a strong evolutionary pressure to avoid this and molecular chaperones have evolved to recognize specifically sequences of high aggregation propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rousseau et al., 2006</xref>). Our findings predict that age-dependent protein aggregation would result from decreased levels of molecular chaperones linked to protein synthesis rather than molecular chaperones induced by stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albanèse et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pechmann et al., 2013</xref>). Impaired proteasome-mediated removal of unfolded proteins directly after synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schubert et al., 2000</xref>) could also significantly contribute to age-dependent protein aggregation. Interestingly, the relative lack of Ras-like GTP-binding protein rhoA aggregation in the body-wall muscles compared to the pharyngeal muscles shows that this protein only aggregates within a specific cellular environment. Thus, tissue-specific factors could be crucial for the aggregation process. These could be differences in the tissue proteostasis network and reliance on certain proteostasis components with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kern et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sala et al., 2017</xref>) but also age-related changes in the local tissue environment. For example, tissue-specific changes in ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patel et al., 2017</xref>), availability of certain ions such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lautenschläger et al., 2018</xref>), redox state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kirstein et al., 2015</xref>), could explain why certain proteins aggregate in one tissue but not another.</p><p>The resemblance between age-dependent protein aggregation and disease-associated protein aggregation raises the question whether they have similar proteotoxic mechanisms. Our results show that there is a strong correlation between the presence of large aggregates and impaired tissue function. In disease, intracellular aggregate toxicity is caused, at least in part, by sequestration and the resulting loss of function of essential cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hosp et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olzscha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, proteostasis network components are significantly enriched in the age-dependent insoluble proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, loss-of-function of proteins responsible for preventing aggregation could be a key source of toxicity. The correlation between large aggregates and proteotoxicity observed in the present study, does not exclude that intermediate forms on the path to age-dependent protein aggregation are also proteotoxic. Indeed, disease-associated pre-fibrillar species or oligomers can be highly toxic by interacting through their hydrophobic side chains with other cellular components and in particular lipid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fusco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Knowles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walsh et al., 2002</xref>). Further experiments will be needed to characterize which types of intermediate species occur during age-dependent protein aggregation and to evaluate their potential toxicity. Conversely, it remains possible that some forms of age-dependent protein aggregation could be protective or manipulated to form harmless non-amyloid aggregates. Finally, it is possible that age-dependent protein aggregation occurring in one tissue will induce accelerated aging in another tissue. Following the evidence for seeding, self-propagation and cell-to-cell transfer of amyloid aggregating species in a disease context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jucker and Walker, 2013</xref>), it is intriguing to speculate that the same mechanisms may arise with proteins aggregating during normal aging.</p><p>The proteotoxicity and amyloid conformation of age-dependent protein aggregation has important implications for diseases associated with protein aggregation. Accelerated functional decline and the overload of the proteostasis network caused by age-dependent protein aggregation could indirectly enhance disease-associated pathogenesis. There is also evidence for a direct connection between disease and aging-related aggregation. Indeed, a significant proportion of the proteins sequestered in disease pathological deposits are prone to aggregate with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciryam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, Casein kinase I isoform alpha is present in tau aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kannanayakal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuret et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, age-dependent aggregation-prone proteins interact with disease-aggregating proteins in humans. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that minute amounts of insoluble proteins from aged wild-type mouse brains or aged <italic>C. elegans</italic> are sufficient to cross-seed amyloid-β aggregation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Groh et al., 2017a</xref>). One possibility is that the highly hydrophobic nature of the amyloid-like structures in age-dependent protein aggregates provides a destabilizing surface that can promote the conformational conversion of disease-associated aggregating proteins. If the composition of the insoluble proteome is cell-specific, increases in age-dependent protein aggregation, for example through higher expression or somatic aggregation-promoting mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lodato et al., 2018</xref>), could sensitize specific cells to disease-associated pathogenesis.</p><p>In summary, our study demonstrates that aggregation of proteins during normal aging resembles pathological protein aggregation observed in neurodegenerative diseases and amyloidosis. We then show that age-dependent protein aggregation causes early functional decline, a read-out of accelerated aging. These findings emphasize age-dependent amyloid-like aggregation as an important target to restore physical capacity and to promote healthy aging. Already promising results reveal that lysosome activation in the germline and in aged neural stem cells clears protein aggregates and rejuvenates the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>;

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary</p><p>This manuscript builds on a previous observation which established that aggregation of proteins during normal aging is widespread, and it examines how and when aggregation occurs, and whether these aggregates resemble disease-associated amyloids.</p><p>The authors use two previously-identified aggregation prone proteins, Casein kinase I isoform alpha (KIN-19) and Ras-like GTP-binding protein rhoA (RHO-1), to address these questions. Specifically, they use labeling with mEOS2, a green-to-red photo-convertible fluorescent protein tag, to demonstrate that newly synthesized proteins rapidly assemble into large insoluble aggregates. They demonstrate the recruitment of newly-synthesized proteins (green) into existing aggregates, suggesting a seeding effect, but also formation of new aggregates de novo. The authors show that protein aggregation is a continuous process in their <italic>C. elegans</italic> model, with a gradual clearance of some &quot;old&quot; aggregates and a gradual (on the timescale of one day) appearance of new aggregates, plus some addition of new protein to existing aggregates. The photoconversion technique (green to red) used by the authors to distinguish new protein molecules from pre-existing protein molecules is quite clever. It may not be surprising that relatively newly synthesized protein molecules can add to existing aggregates, or that newly-synthesized protein molecules can nucleate new aggregates. Nevertheless, it is important to demonstrate these things concretely, as is done here.</p><p>There are two major conclusions of this paper. One is that protein quality control can potentially be a contributor in proteostasis collapse early in adulthood. Another conclusion is that wild type aggregation-prone proteins can form amyloid in vivo, and the demonstration of such behavior in proteins not associated with disease suggests that this could be key process in aging. These points are of general interest, and make this paper suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>, in principle.</p><p>Please consider the following issues raised by the reviewers in preparing a revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>Critical points to address:</p><p>1) The conclusion that molecular aging of proteins and aggregation is not necessarily caused by progressive accumulation of damage is weakened by the observation that not all tagged proteins photo-convert. This conclusion would be supported by examining the impact on aggregation of blocking translation for a short time. The fact that after the photo-conversion switch there are green fluorescent proteins in aggregates suggests that these are newly-expressed proteins. The fact that there is no viable red core also suggests that these are newly-expressed proteins. There might, however, be small dimeric/oligomeric seeds that are required, and their assembly might take time. Doing a similar experiment on Day 1 rather than Day 5 – or before there are visible aggregates, or by blocking translation – should provide additional support for the key inference.</p><p>2) Many proteins have been shown to form amyloids in vitro. To support the claim that KIN-19 and RHO-1 make amyloid-like aggregates in vivo, it is important to use well-established assays supporting the formation of cross-β structures (such as ThT staining). We are concerned that monitoring fluorescence quenching may not be a strong and direct indication of the specific structural signature of an amyloid.</p><p>Other points to address:</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate that aggregates load (determine by foci numbers of tagRFP KIN-19 or RHO-1) is associated with accelerated functional decline in the tissues affected, suggesting that this could be a significant cause of tissue aging for a variety of organs (Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and 2). Please explain why a third model system, consisting of KIN-19::tagRFP and RHO-1::tagRFP, was used to monitor toxicity, and not one of the models presented in Figures 1 and 2.</p><p>2) The authors claim that the aggregates load &quot;leads to&quot; functional decline. This claim too strong based on the data presented, and we suggest using the word &quot;associated&quot; rather than &quot;leads to&quot;.</p><p>3) In Figure 2C, we suggest that the authors show fluorescence lifetime histograms and representative decays, so that the reader can see the length of the time window employed, the background level, the number of counts in the peak and the quality of the decay and also perhaps the fits and residuals.</p><p>4) Figures 1A and 1B show the percentage of animals that exhibit detectable green or red protein aggregates, rather than some measure of the average quantity (volume?) of green and red aggregates per animal. Please explain why this was done, or switch the analysis as suggested.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43059.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Critical points to address:</p><p>1) The conclusion that molecular aging of proteins and aggregation is not necessarily caused by progressive accumulation of damage is weakened by the observation that not all tagged proteins photo-convert.

These data show that newly synthesized KIN-19 can aggregate in young animals (albeit in only a small proportion of the worm population compared to day 5). We have also blocked translation and we observed a strong reduction in the formation of new aggregates both starting the conversion at day 2 or at day 5 (Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1E).</p><p><italic>2) Many proteins have been shown to form amyloids</italic> in vitro<italic>.

In Figure 2—figure supplement 3, we show that in vivo RHO-1::tagRFP aggregates bind to the Congo red derivative X34. In addition in Figure 2—figure supplement 5, we show that in vivo-formed fibrils which have been extracted from transgenic animals expressing RHO-1::HisAvi (at day 7) and RHO-1::tagRFP (at day 2) are ThT positive using structured illumination microscopy. SIM has a resolution of 100 nm and the images shown are similar to polyglutamine and Abeta fibrils imaged by SIM and published previously by the group (Live-cell super-resolution microscopy reveals a primary role for diffusion in polyglutamine-driven aggresome assembly M Lu, L Banetta, LJ Young, EJ Smith, GP Bates, A Zaccone, GSK Schierle, et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry 294 (1), 257-268 and Structural progression of amyloid-β Arctic mutant aggregation in cells revealed by multiparametric imaging M Lu, N Williamson, A Mishra, CH Michel, CF Kaminski, A Tunnacliffe, et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry 294 (5), 1478-1487). Note, since RHO-1 is more aggregation prone in vivo than in vitro we have not been able to run a conventional ThT aggregation assay in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points to address:</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate that aggregates load (determine by foci numbers of tagRFP KIN-19 or RHO-1) is associated with accelerated functional decline in the tissues affected, suggesting that this could be a significant cause of tissue aging for a variety of organs (Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and 2).

We evaluated toxicity using these initial models which have been integrated and backcrossed since our publication (except for CF3166). The mEOS tagged models were created afterwards to evaluate aggregation dynamics. The Venus tagged models were specifically created for the purpose of FLIM. We had decided to design these separate Venus-tagged models for two reasons: a) Venus models on amyloid aggregation had been designed and analyzed previously in GSKS’ lab and thus we had an internal control to which we could compare measured fluorescence lifetime changes for RHO-1 and KIN-19 and b) the fluorescence lifetime of Venus is in the 3 ns range compared to RFP (2ns) and thus offers a better dynamic range to study fluorescence lifetime dependent protein aggregation. For this revision though, we have now examined fluorescence lifetime in the RHO-1::tagRFP model used for toxicity and similar to the RHO-1::Venus model, we observed a significant drop compared to tagRFP (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors claim that the aggregates load &quot;leads to&quot; functional decline. This claim too strong based on the data presented, and we suggest using the word &quot;associated&quot; rather than &quot;leads to&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the corresponding sentence “We demonstrate that aggregates formed by proteins prone to aggregation with age lead to accelerated functional decline in the tissues affected” to “We demonstrate that aggregates formed by proteins prone to aggregation with age contribute to functional decline in the tissues affected.”</p><p>To support our findings, we have added an evaluation of the actin filament structure in the body-wall muscles and pharyngeal muscles in the presence of aggregates (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). We observed a significant correlation between disrupted muscle structure and aggregate load underlining the toxicity of protein aggregates also at a cellular level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 2C, we suggest that the authors show fluorescence lifetime histograms and representative decays, so that the reader can see the length of the time window employed, the background level, the number of counts in the peak and the quality of the decay and also perhaps the fits and residuals.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been added, see new Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figures 1A and 1B show the percentage of animals that exhibit detectable green or red protein aggregates, rather than some measure of the average quantity (volume?) of green and red aggregates per animal.

This is done in live animals under a low magnification fluorescent microscope. In these settings, the best method for aggregate quantification is to categorize each animal into a predefined group: less than 10 aggregates, between 10 and 100 and a group with over 100 aggregates. In order to measure the exact quantity of aggregates as suggested, we would need high magnification images. Unfortunately, this requires immobilization of the animals on microscope slides and these animals are highly difficult to recover for another imaging session.</p></body></sub-article></article>
