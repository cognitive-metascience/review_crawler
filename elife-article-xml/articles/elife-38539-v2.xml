Disruption of barrier function typifies mucosal disease. Here we elucidate a bifunctional role in coordinating this cross-talk for the inflammatory bowel disease risk-gene <italic>INAVA</italic>. Both activities require INAVA’s DUF3338 domain (renamed CUPID). CUPID stably binds the cytohesin ARF-GEF ARNO to effect lateral membrane F-actin assembly underlying cell-cell junctions and barrier function. Unexpectedly, when bound to CUPID, ARNO affects F-actin dynamics in the absence of its canonical activity as a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor. Upon exposure to IL-1β, INAVA relocates to form cytosolic puncta, where CUPID amplifies TRAF6-dependent polyubiquitination and inflammatory signaling. In this case, ARNO binding to CUPID negatively-regulates polyubiquitination and the inflammatory response. INAVA and ARNO act similarly in primary human macrophages responding to IL-1β and to NOD2 agonists. Thus, INAVA-CUPID exhibits dual functions, coordinated directly by ARNO, that bridge epithelial barrier function with extracellular signals and inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ARNO</kwd><kwd>IL-1b</kwd><kwd>TRAF6</kwd><kwd>epithelial barrier</kwd><kwd>actin assembly</kwd><kwd>inflammatory bowel disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HD007466</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luong</surname><given-names>Phi H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001063</institution-id><institution>Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Development Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luong</surname><given-names>Phi H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006823</institution-id><institution>Boston Children's Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rubin-Wolpow Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luong</surname><given-names>Phi H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK099097</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abraham</surname><given-names>Clara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK048106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lencer</surname><given-names>Wayne I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK084424</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lencer</surname><given-names>Wayne I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 DK034854</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lencer</surname><given-names>Wayne I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inflammatory bowel disease risk-gene, INAVA and the ARF-GEF ARNO, regulates non-canonical cortical actin assembly and IL-1b signaling to maintain epithelial homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>C1ORF106, recently named INAVA (Innate Immune Activator), was identified as a risk factor for the chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) by genome-wide association studies and targeted exome sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rivas et al., 2011</xref>). Mice lacking the protein altogether show defects in intestinal barrier integrity at steady state and greater susceptibility to mucosal infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mohanan et al., 2018</xref>). Human macrophages carrying the IBD rs7554511 risk allele have decreased INAVA expression and show multiple defects in myeloid function, including in innate immune NOD2 signaling and cytokine secretion, and in microbial clearance in association with reduced autophagy and ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yan et al., 2017</xref>). Each process is well known to affect gut function in health and disease, but the molecular mechanisms for how they are regulated or interconnected by INAVA are not fully understood.</p><p>We previously determined that INAVA is strongly enriched in simple epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nelms et al., 2016</xref>) - the cell type that forms mucosal barriers. By domain analysis, the molecule has a single distinguishing feature, the Domain of Unknown Function DUF3338 (which we rename CUPID for Cytohesin Ubiquitin Protein Inducing Domain). Three other human proteins contain CUPID: FRMD4a, FRMD4B, and CCDC120, and two are implicated in human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cappola et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lambert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Velcheti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yoon et al., 2012</xref>).

All cytohesins contain a N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) protein-protein interaction region, an enzymatic SEC7 guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) domain, and a C-terminal PIP-binding PH domain. In their inactive conformation, the cytohesins localize to the cytosol. Full-blown GEF activation, typified by cytohesin 2 (also known as ARNO), requires membrane recruitment via ARNO binding to PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate), and then (activated) ARF-GTP, a product of the ARNO-GEF reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chardin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Malaby et al., 2013</xref>). This enables an enzymatically-driven positive feedback-loop for rapidly amplifying a localized pool of activated cytohesins and ARF-GTP needed to drive the massive ARF-dependent changes in actin and membrane dynamics that underlie cell spreading and epithelial breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Santy and Casanova, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stalder et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we address the mechanism of INAVA action in polarized intestinal epithelial cells and primary human macrophages. We discover dual and mutually-exclusive functions for INAVA and the physical and functional interaction of the INAVA CUPID domain (INAVA-CUPID) with cytohesin 2 ARNO. In epithelial cells, INAVA-CUPID recruits ARNO to lateral membranes where the complex promotes actin assembly that underlies barrier function. This occurs via a novel GEF activity-independent mechanism. In response to the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, INAVA relocates to cytosolic puncta that function as signalosomes. Here, CUPID acts with the E3-ubiquitin-ligase TRAF6 to enhance inflammatory signaling, and in this case, ARNO binding inhibits CUPID activity. In human macrophages containing the INAVA rs7554511 IBD-risk allele (low-INAVA expressing carriers), wild type INAVA expression enhances, and ARNO expression suppresses IL-1β and NOD2 signaling. Reconstitution with purified proteins in vitro shows biochemically that INAVA-CUPID functions as an enhancer of TRAF6 dependent polyubiquitination, and that this is blocked by ARNO. These results provide a direct mechanistic link between mucosal barrier function and inflammation implicated in human disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>INAVA affects the epithelial barrier</title><p>To investigate the function of INAVA, we first generated INAVA shRNA knockdown and CRISPR knockout Caco2BBe human intestinal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Caco2BBe cells lacking INAVA show enhanced cell spreading, while cells stably expressing INAVA-GFP are similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). When grown on permeable supports as polarized monolayers, INAVA-deficient cells display increased permeability to 4 kDa FITC dextran and reduced transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>), implicating defects in paracellular permeability and intercellular junctions. Conversely, Caco2BBe monolayers that overexpress INAVA exhibit evidence of increased integrity of intercellular junctions as measured by higher TEER and greater tolerance to depletion of intercellular adherens junctions caused by exposure to low Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). These phenotypes are consistent with a recent study using INAVA knock-out mice that supports a role for INAVA in maintenance of intercellular epithelial junctions responsible for mucosal barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mohanan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To understand how INAVA acts on epithelial junctions, we first examined the localization of INAVA constructs fused to GFP that were stably expressed in Caco2BBe cells. Humans express two isoforms of INAVA. The short-isoform (INAVA-S) lacks a 99-amino-acid segment N-terminal to CUPID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Both long INAVA-GFP and short INAVA-S-GFP isoforms localized to cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Notably, leading edges of migratory cells were uniformly devoid of INAVA. In well-differentiated polarized Caco2BBe monolayers, INAVA localized to tight and adherens junctions, as evidenced by co-localization with E-cadherin and ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I,J</xref>). When expressed on its own, the C-terminal region flanking the INAVA-CUPID domain (aa 261–677) also localized to lateral membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, bottom panels). The CUPID domain on its own localized to the cytosol, and the CUPID domain together with the N-terminal flanking region (aa 1–260) localized to cytosolic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, the C-terminal region of INAVA is necessary and sufficient for lateral membrane targeting. Lateral membrane localization did not depend upon association with the E-cadherin complex. This was evidenced in cells treated with 6 mM EGTA to disassemble adherens junctions and induce E-cadherin endocytosis. While E-cadherin localized to endocytic vesicles upon EGTA treatment, INAVA remained at lateral membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Staining for the tight junction protein ZO-1 as a control also remained unchanged. Thus, INAVA localizes to lateral membranes independently of E-cadherin. Overall, these results support a critical role for INAVA in maintaining or regulating epithelial barrier integrity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38539.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>INAVA localizes to cell-cell junctions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain architecture of the long and short INAVA isoforms.(<bold>B</bold>) Brightfield images of Caco2BBe WT, INAVA-GFP over-expressing, and INAVA CRISPR knockout cells grown 2 days on coverslips.

To test how INAVA may affect cytohesin function, we generated Caco2BBe intestinal cells stably expressing myc-tagged ARNO or GRP1. These cells, however, rapidly suppressed ARNO and GRP1 expression, as evidenced by the lack of protein detected upon transduction. PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate), which strongly activates the CMV promotors used in these transductions, rescued ARNO and GRP1 protein expression, presumably by overcoming the endogenous mechanism(s) of epigenetic gene silencing operating in these cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 3; and lanes 5 and 7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Löser et al., 1998</xref>). Strikingly, when co-expressed in the same cells, INAVA rescued ARNO expression in the absence of PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2), implicating a stabilizing interaction between the two proteins. The effect was specific to ARNO as INAVA did not rescue the cytohesin GRP1 against gene-suppression (compare lanes 5 and 6). Over-expression of INAVA-GFP increased endogenous ARNO protein levels with no apparent changes in TEER or paracellular flux when compared to wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Two independently created INAVA KO Caco2BBe cell lines showed no evidence for increased ARNO levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), unlike the results recently reported for INAVA’s effect on cytohesin 1, a closely related ARF-GEF member of the cytohesin family. In accord with these results, we found durable expression of ARNO in primary human macrophages over-expressing INAVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Thus, INAVA interacts with and appears to stabilize ARNO expression in intact cells, consistent with our biochemical data, but in contrast to a recent report that INAVA induces the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the cytohesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mohanan et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>INAVA-ARNO promotes non-canonical GEF-independent lateral membrane actin assembly</title><p>To circumvent the problem of gene silencing in cells stably expressing ARNO and enable further mechanistic studies on INAVA-ARNO interactions, we generated stable doxycycline (dox) inducible myc-tagged ARNO expressing Caco2BBe cells. Upon induction with dox, ARNO localized to the cytosol, consistent with the molecule folding in an auto-inhibited inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> top panels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen et al., 2007</xref>). Co-expression of INAVA-GFP recruited ARNO to lateral membranes, consistent with our findings that ARNO and INAVA form stable protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> bottom panels). Unexpectedly, given ARNO’s canonical actions in regulating F-actin assembly and membrane dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Turner and Brown, 2001</xref>), the INAVA-ARNO complex did not cause epithelial cell spreading or disassembly of intercellular contacts. Intercellular junctions remained fully intact as assessed by TEER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We did, however, find enhancement of lateral membrane F-actin assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>), consistent with the anticipated effects of ARF activation on cortical F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Myers and Casanova, 2008</xref>). In these studies, to properly compare the densities of cortical F-actin, we co-cultured cells stably expressing INAVA, or ARNO, or both proteins, along-side non-transduced wild type (WT) Caco2BBe cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Relative densities of lateral membrane F-actin stained with TRITC-phalloidin was measured by imaging both cell types on the same cover slip under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> right panels, peak intensities plotted in left panels). Cells expressing INAVA alone showed modest amplified F-actin density at lateral membranes. Expression of ARNO alone had no detectable effect. In contrast, expression of both INAVA and ARNO together strongly amplified lateral membrane cortical F-actin (&gt;2 fold). Remarkably, the effects of INAVA-ARNO on F-actin assembly did not require ARF-GTP binding to ARNO or ARNO’s enzymatic GEF activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), as we observed the same enhanced densities of lateral membrane F-actin in Caco2BBe cells expressing the ARNO GEF mutant (E156K) or the ARF-GTP binding mutant (K366A). In contrast, ARNO mutants lacking the ability to bind PIP<sub>2</sub> (K268A) failed to enhance F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, right). Thus, in intact cells, when complexed with INAVA, only PIP binding by ARNO is required for effecting F-actin assembly.</p><p>To identify the INAVA region required for ARNO-mediated F-actin effects, we examined cortical F-actin assemblies in Caco2BBe cells expressing ARNO together with just the INAVA-CUPID domain. In this case, because CUPID alone cannot target ARNO to lateral membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), we found evidence for increased F-actin on intracellular vesicles, where both CUPID and ARNO co-localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). This phenotype was amplified and more easily observed in human mammary epithelial MCF7 cells. In MCF7 cells, both INAVA and ARNO colocalized on intracellular vesicles, and both proteins were required for the induction of F-actin rich vesicles. Expression of each protein alone did not induce the vesicle phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I,J</xref>). The ARNO-GEF (E156K) and ARF-GTP binding (K336A) mutants also promoted formation of F-actin coated vesicles, consistent with our earlier results. In contrast, as in the Caco2BBe model, INAVA and the ARNO PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding mutant did not promote actin assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Thus, the GEF and ARF-binding activities of ARNO are dispensable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K</xref>), again implicating a unique and non-canonical mechanism of action for the cytohesins in regulating F-actin dynamics when bound to INAVA. In other words, instead of the substantial ARNO GEF-dependent hyperactivation of ARFs leading to massive F-actin rearrangement, cell spreading, and epithelial breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stalder and Antonny, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">White et al., 2010</xref>), CUPID binding to ARNO displaces the positive-feedback hyperactivation of ARFs to enable instead a smaller (modulated) effect on cortical F-actin assembly, which we propose is required for barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Canonically, activated ARNO localizes to the leading edge to drive cell motility, but here we show INAVA localizes ARNO to lateral membranes, where regulation of cell-cell contacts and mucosal barrier function occurs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>INAVA-ARNO regulates IL-1β signaling</title><p>ARNO has been implicated in IL-1β signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>), and given the association of INAVA with inflammatory bowel disease, we examined the effect of IL-1β on INAVA-ARNO function. We found that IL-1β rapidly within 30 min induced the relocalization of INAVA-GFP from lateral membranes to cytosolic puncta in Caco2BBe cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). IL-1β-induced cytosolic puncta were also found in human colon HCT8 cells where we found a stronger phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In this case, puncta were assembled from cytosolic pools of INAVA-GFP as HCT8 cells do not form intercellular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vermeulen et al., 1997</xref>) where INAVA-GFP normally localizes. INAVA puncta appeared to be associated with IL-1β signaling as IL-1β-induced INAVA-puncta were not efficiently formed in HCT8 cells lacking TRAF6 (CRISPR-Cas9 KO), the ubiquitin E3 ligase required for IL-1β signal transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lomaga et al., 1999</xref>).

To test this, we examined protein polyubiquitination in HEK293T cells expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin. Cells expressing both TRAF6 and INAVA exhibited much higher levels of protein ubiquitination as assessed by anti-HA immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, compare lane 4 with lanes 1–3). Cells expressing the short INAVA-S isoform lacked this response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lane 4), consistent with the evidence that INAVA-S cannot form cytosolic puncta or mediate IL-1β inflammatory responses. We also found that overexpression of ARNO strongly inhibited INAVA-TRAF6 induced ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, compare lane 8 with lane 6), consistent with our discovery that ARNO can act as a negative regulator in this pathway. Thus, INAVA appears to act as an enhancer of the ubiquitin-cascades induced by TRAF6, and this is blocked by ARNO.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38539.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>INAVA enhances TRAF6 dependent polyubiquitination in cells and in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-Ubiquitin and with or without myc-TRAF6.

For these studies, we produced recombinant HA-tagged ubiquitin lacking the terminal two glycines (UbiquitinΔ2G-HA), which we used as pseudosubstrate to ensure specificity for the ubiquitination-reactions. Because the di-glycine motif at the C-terminus of ubiquitin is required for covalent attachment to target lysines, the UbiquitinΔ2G-HA pseudosubstrate cannot be attached to other molecules added in the in vitro reactions, and the only detectable product can be ubiquitination of the pseudosubstrate. Control studies showed that the reactions reconstituted with wild type ubiquitin, UBE1 (E1), heterodimer UBC13/UEV1a (E2), and the E3 ligase TRAF6-RING (aa 50–211) produced polyubiquitinated UbiquitinΔ2G-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, compare lane 14 with all others). Reactions lacking either E1, heterodimer E2, E3, or ubiquitin yielded no product. When the same reactions were reconstituted with the addition of INAVA-CUPID, the polyubiquitination of UbiquitinΔ2G-HA was amplified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, compare lane 4 with lane 2). Reactions performed with just UBC13 as the E2 ligase were not as processive, but the amplification by INAVA-CUPID was still clearly apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, compare lanes 4 and 2). Thus, the INAVA-CUPID domain has activity as an enhancer of TRAF6 ubiquitination. This we propose explains the ability of full-length INAVA to promote inflammatory signaling by IL-1β and MDP-induced NOD2 activation in intact cells. Notably, the INAVA-dependent amplification of ubiquitination in vitro was fully inhibited by the addition of recombinant ARNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, compare lane 8 with lane 4), explaining how ARNO can act by binding INAVA to negatively regulate the inflammatory response in this pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>INAVA-CUPID binds ARNO, targets the molecule to lateral membranes of epithelial monolayers, and enables ARNO to affect F-actin assembly without the need for GEF activity or positive ARF-GTP feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This is a non-canonical mechanism for ARNO action, and one, we propose, explains how the INAVA-ARNO complex acts as a tunable factor for control of epithelial cell-cell contacts at mucosal surfaces. The impaired barrier integrity observed in INAVA knockout mice and cells can plausibly be explained by loss of INAVA-ARNO cortical actin promoting complexes at lateral membranes. This mechanism of action differs from the model proposed for INAVA mediated degradation of cytohesin 1 delineated in a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mohanan et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that INAVA acts in different signaling complexes and operates in both ways depending on cell context. In our case, however, using both human epithelial cell lines and primary human macrophages, we find that cytohesins and INAVA cooperate to regulate downstream outcomes.</p><p>We also find that INAVA acts an enhancer in the ubiquitin cascades required for IL-1β signaling, and that CUPID is sufficient to reconstitute this activity in vitro. Thus, CUPID can functionally and directly act with the UBC13/UEV1 E2- and TRAF6 E3-ligases in polyubiquitination. The recent proteomic study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mohanan et al., 2018</xref> of proteins co-isolated by INAVA immunoprecipitation implicated such an interaction between INAVA and another E3-ligase FBXW11 (SCF complex). But whether INAVA acted in protein ubiquitination of cytohesin 1 through FBXW11 was not conclusively tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mohanan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In intact cells, the N-terminal region (aa 1–99) of INAVA is required for puncta formation and CUPID mediated enhancement of the ubiquitin ligases, as only the long INAVA isoform acts in the IL-1β inflammatory responses. INAVA-S is inactive. And it does not form cytosolic puncta, which we suggest represent protein complexes required for signal transduction (signalosomes). In macrophages, the C-terminal region of INAVA is also implicated in inflammatory signaling by mediating scaffolding for NOD2 interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We also note the signaling puncta formed in response to IL-1β require the relocalization of INAVA from lateral membranes to the cytosol. An analogous relocalization of INAVA, from cytosol to nucleus, was also observed in NOD2 activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yan et al., 2017</xref>), though the functional consequences for INAVA in the nucleus have yet to be defined. Thus, CUPID action is likely site-specific, dictated by the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein flanking the CUPID domain.</p><p>Strikingly, in the case of inflammatory signaling, INAVA-CUPID is inhibited in the ubiquitination reactions by ARNO, thus, elucidating a previously unappreciated function for ARNO as a negative-regulator of inflammatory responses. The result also shows how ARNO can coordinate CUPID function as it bridges between barrier function and inflammation. Given INAVA’s dual activities in IL-1β and MDP signaling cascades, and in F-actin assembly at lateral membranes, we can imagine INAVA (together with ARNO) innately reacting to environmental factors in the gut mucosa as a form of guard receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dangl and Jones, 2001</xref>) for the management of intestinal homeostasis.</p><p>IL-1 signaling is negatively regulated by anti-inflammatory IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), a naturally occurring inhibitor of IL-1 signaling. IL-1Ra inhibits inflammation by binding and competing with IL-1β for the same surface IL-1 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aksentijevich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashwood et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sanchez-Munoz et al., 2008</xref>). Elevated levels and imbalance between IL-1 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) have been observed in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, and the imbalance of anti-inflammatory (IL-1Ra) and proinflammatory regulators (IL-1) are proposed to contribute to the chronic inflammation observed in IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ludwiczek et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McAlindon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Reinecker et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our results delineate the molecular activities of CUPID and uncover unexpected and opposing roles of INAVA-ARNO complexes in the maintenance of epithelial barrier function at mucosal surfaces, and in inflammatory signaling for epithelial cells and macrophages.

Guides were cloned into plentiCRISPRv2 and lentivirus was generated in HEK293T cells by cotransfection with psPAX2 and pVSVG by polyethyleneimine (PEI) transfection. For each INAVA knockout line, two unique pair of guides were designed to target the introns that flank exon 2 of INAVA which knockout both isoforms. Lentivirus that target the 5-prime and 3-prime ends were pooled and co-transduced into Caco2BBe cells. Cells were selected with puromycin 5 μg/ml and single cell cloned into 96-well plates by manual pipetting. Caco2BBe INAVA knockout lines were screen by genomic PCR, clones were genotyped by TA cloning with pGEM-T (Promega) and individual bacterial colonies were sequenced. TRAF6 knockout line in HEK293T cells were generated with two unique pair of guides targeting exon two with lentiviral transduction. Knockout clones were screened by genomic PCR and functionally by NF-κB luciferase reporter. HCT8 TRAF6 knockout line were generated with same guides are above. HCT8 cells tend not to have exon removal upon introduction of 2 pair of guides and so knockout clones were screened using downstream NF-κB phospho-p65 immunoblot upon IL-1β treatment at 10 ng/ml for 15 min.</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">INAVA shRNA-1 Fwd</td><td valign="bottom"><break/>tttgctatgcttctgctctgagaattcaagagat <break/>tctcagagcagaagcatagcttttta</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">INAVA shRNA-1 Rev</td><td valign="bottom">agcttaaaaagctatgcttctgctctgaga <break/>atctcttgaattctcagagcagaagcatag</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">INAVA shRNA-2 Fwd</td><td valign="bottom">tttgtgcaagtctttgtacctgaattcaaga <break/>gattcaggtacaaagacttgcacttttta</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">INAVA shRNA-2 Rev</td><td valign="bottom">agcttaaaaagtgcaagtctttgtacctga <break/>atctcttgaattcaggtacaaagacttgca</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Control shRNA-Fwd</td><td valign="bottom">tttgagtacttcgaaatgtccgttttcaaga <break/>gaaacggacatttcgaagtactcttttta</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Control shRNA-Rev</td><td valign="bottom">agcttaaaaagagtacttcgaaatgtccg <break/>tttctcttgaaaacggacatttcgaagtact</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">INAVA qPCR Fwd</td><td valign="bottom">caccttgccagcggagtatc</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">INAVA qPCR Rev</td><td valign="bottom">cctgcctgctgaggttctc</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">INAVA KO guide-1 Fwd1</td><td valign="bottom">caccgggggcaggagattctggcac</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">INAVA KO guide-1 Rev1</td><td valign="bottom">aaacgtgccagaatctcctgccccc</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">INAVA KO guide-1 Fwd2</td><td valign="bottom">caccgggaccagggactagggacta</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">INAVA KO guide-1 Rev2</td><td valign="bottom">aaactagtccctagtccctggtccc</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">INAVA KO guide-2 Fwd1</td><td valign="bottom">caccgaagctagatatgaaccatct</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">INAVA KO guide-2 Rev1</td><td valign="bottom">aaacagatggttcatatctagcttc</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">INAVA KO guide-2 Fwd2</td><td valign="bottom">caccggagccctcaggcactagggc</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">INAVA KO guide-2 Rev2</td><td valign="bottom">aaacgccctagtgcctgagggctcc</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">INAVA KO genotyping Fwd</td><td valign="bottom">tataggtgtgacaacacagaggc</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">INAVA KO genotyping Rev</td><td valign="bottom">gatggacacagcaaagtccctat</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">TRAF6 KO guide Fwd1</td><td valign="bottom">caccgtttgtttctgttagggatgc</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">TRAF6 KO guide Rev1</td><td valign="bottom">aaacgcatccctaacagaaacaaac</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">TRAF6 KO guide Fwd2</td><td valign="bottom">caccgacgtgagattctttctctga</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">TRAF6 KO guide Rev2</td><td valign="bottom">aaactcagagaaagaatctcacgtc</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">TRAF6 KO genotyping Fwd</td><td valign="bottom">tataggtgtgacaacacagaggc</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">TRAF6 KO genotyping Rev</td><td valign="bottom">gatggacacagcaaagtccctat</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Calcium chelation</title><p>Caco2BBe WT and stable cells were grown on 0.4 μM polycarbonate filters for 10–14 days. 6 mM EGTA final concentration was added to basolateral chamber for 3 min.

First, the authors generated INAVA KO Caco2BBe cells, and showed the role of INAVA in the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity. Then, the authors analyzed the mechanisms by which INAVA regulates barrier function. As previously reported, INAVA interacted with cytohesins, such as ARNO. CUPID domain of INAVA associated with coiled-coil domain of ARNO. They further showed that INAVA stabilizes ARNO expression by associating with it. The association of INAVA and ARNO mediated recruitment of ARNO to the lateral membrane of epithelia in a GEF-independent manner.</p><p>Because ARNO has been shown to be involved in the IL-1β signaling, the authors next analyzed the effect of INAVA/ARNO in the IL-1β signaling, and found that ARNO negatively regulates the INAVA-dependent IL-1β signaling.</p><p>In the next experiment, the authors analyzed primary human macrophages isolated from individuals carrying the INAVA-IBD risk allele. They found that INAVA promotes the IL-1β-induced inflammatory responses in macrophages. As the mechanism for the INAVA-dependent enhancement of the IL-1β signaling, they showed that INAVA enhanced ubiquitination of TRAF6, which was inhibited by ARNO.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript is well written, interesting, and will help resolve the debate in the field. We have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) What is most concerning is that the authors performed experiments with overexpression system alone.

Then, the authors analyzed the mechanisms by which INAVA regulates barrier function. As previously reported, INAVA interacted with cytohesins, such as ARNO.

The previous study showed INAVA induced degradation of cytohesin using gene-targeted KO mice. However, this study just used INAVA over-expressing cells to show that INAVA stabilizes cytohesin expression.</p><p>1) In Figure 2B, the authors showed that INAVA stabilized ARNO expression. However, these are shown in an overexpression system alone. The authors should show expression of endogenous ARNO in wild-type and INAVA KO Caco2BBe cells.</p><p>2) The authors showed that INAVA mediates ARNO localization to lateral membranes. However, they did not show the mechanisms by which ARNO regulates cell-cell contact and barrier functions.</p><p>3) In Figure 3, again, the authors used only INAVA-overexpressing cells for the analysis of IL-1β responses. The authors should analyze IL-1β responses in INAVA KO Caco2BBe cells.</p><p>4) In Figure 4, the reviewer wonders why the authors did not compare the IL-1β responses of wild-type MDM and IBD-allele MDM. Again, the authors used INAVA-overexpressing cells alone.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, Luong et al. describe a bifunctional role for the IBD-risk gene, IVANA, in the crosstalk between the environment and barrier function. Both activities require CUPID, which binds to the cytohesin, ARF-GEF ARNO, to affect lateral membrane F-actin assembly underlying cell-cell junctions and barrier function. Unexpectedly, when bound to CUPID, ARNO affects F-actin dynamics in the absence of its canonical activity as a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor. Upon exposure to IL-1β, INAVA relocates to form cytosolic puncta, where CUPID amplifies TRAF6-dependent polyubiquitination and inflammatory signaling. In this case, ARNO binding to CUPID negatively-regulates polyubiquitination and the inflammatory response. INAVA and ARNO act similarly in primary human macrophages responding to IL-1β and NOD2 agonists. The authors conclude that, INAVA-CUPID exhibits dual functions, coordinated directly by ARNO, that bridge epithelial barrier function with extracellular signals and inflammation.</p><p>This is a well executed piece of work investigating the mechanism of action of a relevant IBD risk gene, namely INAVA. The experiments are technically well done, and the five figures show data of high quality, reporting mechanistic results. I have, however, three concerns:</p><p>1) The authors use Caco2BEE cells as a model of epithelial cells. It is well known that the cells are cancer cells with questionable relevance to normal epithelials cells, especially in relationship to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p><p>2) The authors use macrophages derived from peripheral blood cells of patients carrying the homozygous mutation of INAVA. It is well known that peripheral blood cells are very different from tissue macrophages. There is no attempt to use in this study, for example, lamina propria mononuclear cells, from these patients.</p><p>3) The authors investigate the effects of IL-1β as a prototypic proinflammatory cytokine to establish a link between inflammation and barrier function. The role of IL-1β in IBD remains controversial, and some evidence actually suggests that IL-1β has an anti-inflammatory effect on the epithelium. It is somehow disappointing that no effect(s) were observed with TNFα, which is an established proinflammatory cytokine in IBD.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38539.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) What is most concerning is that the authors performed experiments with overexpression system alone.

The role of IL-1β in IBD remains controversial, and some evidence actually suggests that IL-1β has an anti-inflammatory effect on the epithelium. It is somehow disappointing that no effect(s) were observed with TNFα, which is an established proinflammatory cytokine in IBD.”</p><p>This was a helpful suggestion. IL-1β is one of the most potent inflammatory cytokines. The text has been revised to briefly discuss the evidence for IL-1β in the pathogenesis of IBD. But we do emphasize that our work does not address, or make the claim, that IL-1β underlies the basis of disease.</p><p>With respect to TNFα, we do find this cytokine induces the same phenotype, but in our HCT8 intestinal cell model (where the punctae phenotype is stronger compared to Caco2BBe) the effect of inducing INAVA punctae by TNFα is smaller (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B).</p><p>The text has been revised in the Discussion section:</p><p>“IL-1 signaling is negatively regulated by anti-inflammatory IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), a naturally occurring inhibitor of IL-1 signaling. IL-1Ra inhibits inflammation by binding and competing with IL-1β for the same surface IL-1 receptor (Aksentijevich et al., 2009; Ashwood et al., 2004; Sanchez-Muñoz et al., 2008). Elevated levels and imbalance between IL-1 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) have been observed in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, and the imbalance of anti-inflammatory (IL-1Ra) and proinflammatory regulators (IL-1) are proposed to contribute to the chronic inflammation observed in IBD (Li et al., 2004; Ludwiczek et al., 2004; McAlindon et al., 1998; Reinecker et al., 1993).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
