Several components of the cardiac injury microenvironment have been identified, yet no factor on its own is known to stimulate overt myocardial hyperplasia in a mature, uninjured animal. In this study, we find evidence that Neuregulin1 (Nrg1), previously shown to have mitogenic effects on mammalian cardiomyocytes, is sharply induced in perivascular cells after injury to the adult zebrafish heart. Inhibition of Erbb2, an Nrg1 co-receptor, disrupts cardiomyocyte proliferation in response to injury, whereas myocardial Nrg1 overexpression enhances this proliferation. In uninjured zebrafish, the reactivation of Nrg1 expression induces cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation, overt muscle hyperplasia, epicardial activation, increased vascularization, and causes cardiomegaly through persistent addition of wall myocardium. Our findings identify Nrg1 as a potent, induced mitogen for the endogenous adult heart regeneration program.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05871.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05871.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05871.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Heart attacks—which are a major cause of death in humans—occur when a blocked blood vessel stops blood from flowing to the heart.

When Nrg1 is deliberately activated in uninjured adult zebrafish hearts, it causes the muscle cells to divide, leading to many new layers of heart muscle forming over the course of several weeks.

To develop its therapeutic potential, future work will also need to identify how the gene that encodes Nrg1 is switched on by injury and identify the other molecules that interact with Nrg1.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05871.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05871.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>heart regeneration</kwd><kwd>cardiomyocyte</kwd><kwd>Neuregulin1</kwd><kwd>cardiac hyperplasia</kwd><kwd>epicardium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL081674</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poss</surname><given-names>Kenneth D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association (AHA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gemberling</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08-HL116485</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karra</surname><given-names>Ravi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neuregulin1 is induced upon cardiac injury in adult zebrafish, and is sufficient to drive massive proliferative growth of the heart.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myocardial infarction (MI) is a common injury that causes permanent loss of hundreds of millions of cardiac muscle cells, increasing susceptibility to heart failure and sudden death. Major goals of regenerative medicine are methodologies to enhance cardiomyocyte recovery after MI and to restore cardiac function to patients with heart failure. Although there has been much investment in candidate cardiac stem cell populations over the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laflamme and Murry, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behfar et al., 2014</xref>), many promising alternative strategies for heart regeneration have emerged, including activation of cardiomyocyte division, reprogramming of non-muscle cells into cardiomyocyte-like cells, and delivery of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bersell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shiba et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chong et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Heart regeneration occurs naturally after extreme tissue damage in non-mammalian vertebrates like zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Poss et al., 2002</xref>). New myocardium is created through division of spared cardiomyocytes, and lineage-tracing experiments have not yielded evidence for a stem cell contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jopling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kikuchi et al., 2010</xref>). Zebrafish regenerate after injuries that deplete 60% or more of their cardiomyocytes, suggesting broad potential of most or all cardiomyocytes to participate in regeneration in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). By contrast, cardiomyocyte division is robust through early postnatal life in mice and can enable regeneration, but by the adult stage is profoundly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Factors that on their own can stimulate spontaneous creation of patterned, vascularized adult cardiac muscle would hold great potential for addressing human cardiovascular disease. The adult heart is famously resistant to forced hyperplasia, and tumors of myocardial origin are exceedingly rare. Adult mammalian cardiomyocyte proliferation has been reported to be stimulated to a minor extent after ischemic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Senyo et al., 2013</xref>). Genetic manipulations in cardiomyocytes of cell cycle genes like cyclin D, Rb, and/or p130 can increase cardiomyocyte cell cycle entry or division but do not cause significant muscularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pasumarthi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sdek et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, manipulations of Hippo signaling or miRNA function can increase cardiomyocyte proliferation after injury in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eulalio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heallen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xin et al., 2013</xref>), but no compelling evidence for an impact on adult cardiogenesis has been reported. In adult zebrafish, several manipulations have boosted cardiomyocyte proliferation after trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jopling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2013</xref>), yet no genetic or pharmacologic method has stimulated cardiomyocyte proliferation or obvious cardiogenic growth in the absence of injury.</p><p>The extracellular factor Neuregulin1 (Nrg1) has multiple roles in cardiovascular biology and has been implicated as a cardiomyocyte mitogen. In developing zebrafish or mouse embryos, Nrg1 signaling is critical for cardiac myofiber trabeculation. Mice mutant in Nrg1, or in its receptors ErbB2 or ErbB4, die at mid-gestation, or later with cardiac-restricted mutations, from thin ventricular walls and aberrant trabeculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gassmann et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meyer and Birchmeier, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, different forms of Nrg1 peptides have been delivered to adult animals, with various effects on the cardiovascular system. Nrg1 delivery to embryonic mouse cardiac explants or embryonic rat cardiomyocytes increased their proliferation in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhao et al., 1998</xref>), and Nrg1 treatment of cultured adult mouse cardiomyocytes or systemic injection into adult mice induced cardiomyocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bersell et al., 2009</xref>). Although the proliferative increases in this latter study were relatively small, the authors also found evidence that Nrg1 injection improves cardiac repair after MI. Nrg1 has reported effects on cell survival, metabolism, angiogenesis, and myofiber structure in addition to cardiomyocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parodi and Kuhn, 2014</xref>), influences that are possibly reflected by functional improvement after Nrg1 infusion in congestive heart failure patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jabbour et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>It is unclear from these recombinant protein delivery experiments whether and how Nrg1 is part of an endogenous regeneration program. Moreover, corroborating evidence generated by other research groups for Nrg1 as a pro-regenerative cardiomyocyte mitogen is lacking. Indeed, a recent study argued that Nrg1 delivery to adult mice has no effects on cardiomyocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reuter et al., 2014</xref>). To address this, we examined the role Nrg1 might play in the strong, endogenous regenerative response of the adult zebrafish heart. We find that zebrafish <italic>nrg1</italic> is upregulated in perivascular cells following cardiac injury, and that blockade of Nrg1 signaling inhibits injury-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation. Most strikingly, transgenic reactivation of Nrg1 expression in the absence of cardiac injury stimulated many hallmarks of cardiac regeneration and markedly enhanced ventricular size. These findings implicate Nrg1 as a key mitogenic node between injury and the endogenous heart regeneration program.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>nrg1</italic> expression is induced by cardiac injury</title><p>Using quantitative PCR, we found that <italic>nrg1</italic> levels increase after genetic ablation of ∼50% of cardiomyocytes in the adult zebrafish ventricle. <italic>nrg1</italic> levels rise above baseline at 3 days post-injury and peak at ∼11-fold above uninjured levels by 7 days, an injury timepoint at which cardiomyocyte proliferation also peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>nrg1</italic> levels lower to ∼fourfold above uninjured levels by 14 days post injury.

Whereas the cardiomyocyte proliferation index in the trabecular compartment increased modestly from ∼0.2% to ∼1% after 7 days of <italic>nrg1</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), the proliferation index of cortical muscle increased sharply from ∼1.6% to ∼28% (n = 8, 9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Continued <italic>nrg1</italic> overexpression over an additional 7 days had similar effects, maintaining trabecular proliferation indices at ∼1.6% and cortical muscle proliferation at ∼32% (n = 10, 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). This increased cardiomyocyte proliferation manifested through marked changes in cardiac anatomy. The ventricular wall thickened by ∼76% at 7 dpt compared to controls, by ∼265% at 14 dpt, and by ∼459% after 30 days of overexpression (n = 8–11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–E</xref>). To test the extent to which cellular hypertrophy contributes to this wall thickening, we assessed the size and numbers of cardiomyocytes, which are predominantly mononuclear in adult zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wills et al., 2008</xref>). We found large increases in the number of cardiomyocyte nuclei within the ventricular wall after 14 days of <italic>nrg1</italic> expression, and no evidence for increased cardiomyocyte size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). Thus, most or all of the effects of <italic>nrg1</italic> reactivation are hyperplastic.

First, to reveal the spatiotemporal growth patterns of cardiogenesis, we coupled iCH with multicolor clonal analysis. The cortical muscle in the ventricular wall typically forms from a small number of large cardiomyocyte clones. These clones expand laterally on the ventricular surface and largely retain discernable boundaries through adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta and Poss, 2012</xref>). By contrast, regeneration of resected muscle occurs through roughly uniform proliferation by many cardiomyocytes near the injury site, generating a mixed conglomeration of small clones in the restored ventricular wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>). We induced <italic>nrg1</italic> expression simultaneously with permanent multicolor labeling in 5 weeks post-fertilization (wpf) juvenile animals, around the time of the initial emergence of cortical muscle. iCH caused ectopic wall thickening by 10 wpf, with obvious clone mixing and clone growth in the Z-plane away from the lumen (14/14 iCH, 0/11 controls; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–F</xref>).

After partial ventricular resection, cardiomyocytes near the injury activate regulatory sequences of the embryonic cardiogenic transcription factor <italic>gata4</italic>, before dividing to create new muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kikuchi et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, Gata4 activity is essential for regeneration of this muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>). Using a transgenic reporter strain, we found that 7 days of iCH in mature adults induced <italic>gata4:EGFP</italic> expression in the outermost layer of cortical muscle (9/10 iCH, 1/11 controls; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G,H</xref>). Additionally, by coupling iCH with a transgenic reporter visualizing cardiomyocyte Actinin3 localization, we found that cortical muscle displayed reduced <italic>cmlc2</italic> expression and poorly organized sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M–P</xref>). These observations together suggest a reduction in the contractile program that is indicative of dedifferentiation. iCH also activated myocardial expression of <italic>tgfβ3</italic>, which was implicated previously in regeneration (4/5 iCH, 0/5 controls; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,J</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chablais and Jazwinska, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2013</xref>). We examined other cardiac cells types for their response to iCH. Retinoic acid synthesis in endocardial and epicardial cells is induced by myocardial injury, where RA signaling is essential, but not sufficient, for cardiomyocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kikuchi et al., 2011b</xref>). Fibronectin (Fn) synthesis is also activated in the epicardium by injury and is an essential extracellular matrix (ECM) component of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Both <italic>raldh2</italic> and <italic>fn1</italic> were induced in the epicardium by 7 days of iCH (7 of 9 iCH, 0 of 10 controls for each marker) consistent with the presence of a regenerative program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K,L,Q,R</xref>). Along with epicardial marker induction, 7–14 days of iCH induced expansion of the epicardial layer that is reminiscent of that observed during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lepilina et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8S,T</xref>). Finally, we assessed myocardial vascularization, which occurs concomitantly with injury-induced regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lepilina et al., 2006</xref>). The adult zebrafish ventricle typically has a thin muscular wall penetrated with vessels, but 30 days of iCH stimulated formation of major vascular network throughout the expanded ventricular wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8U,V</xref>). After 6 months of iCH, many large coronary vessels were evident in the ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Together, this analysis indicates that expression of a single molecule, Nrg1, is sufficient to induce and maintain critical aspects of the heart regeneration program that encompass several cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here, we identify the extracellular factor Nrg1 as a potent activator of the heart regeneration program in zebrafish. Nrg1 is induced by cardiac injury and pharmacological blockade of its receptor decreases injury-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation—each indicating involvement in the endogenous process. Moreover, whereas several experimental manipulations have been reported to increase cardiomyocyte proliferation in an injured adult heart, the Nrg1 protocol we describe here is potently cardiogenic in the absence of trauma.</p><p>Nrg1 was reported to have mitogenic effects on cultured adult cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bersell et al., 2009</xref>), and its most remarkable property in our experiments was the ability to induce and maintain adult cardiomyocyte proliferation in the absence of injury. Thus, the primary cellular target of Nrg1 is likely to be cardiomyocytes. Nrg1 effects additionally involve organizing a tissue microenvironment that includes expression of additional mitogenic factors, ECM regulation, and vascular perfusion. This recruitment of various non-myocyte cell types is likely to be an endogenous role of Nrg1, given that it is also known to stimulate vascularization after ischemic injury in the hindlimb and is capable of inducing expression of ECM components in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hedhli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). The next generation of genome editing-inspired tools for zebrafish researchers should enable tests of cell-restricted, inducible genetic deletion of key Nrg1 components in multiple cell types. These experiments promise to dissect and define Nrg1 signaling requirements for regenerative responses within the complex cardiac milieu.</p><p>Factors that on their own can stimulate the creation of full myocardial units have unique potential to avoid complications from immunosuppression and arrhythmia compared to cell-based approaches and can have straightforward pharmacologic entrypoints. Here, we have described effects of endogenous myocardial Nrg1 delivery, whereas previous studies have injected purified Nrg1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parodi and Kuhn, 2014</xref>). These distinct experimental delivery methods could result in markedly different Nrg1 doses, target cells, and target receptor responses. It will be critical to define the mechanisms by which Nrg1 is induced by injury in zebrafish and restricted in the absence of trauma, as well as downstream Nrg1 targets in the regeneration program. Such investigation of the endogenous regulation of Nrg1 after cardiac injury can help guide methodology to optimize its delivery and impact on heart regeneration in mammals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Generation of <italic>β-act2:BSNrg1</italic> zebrafish</title><p><italic>nrg1</italic> cDNA was amplified with the following primers and (Forward 5′-ACCGGTGCACCATGGCTGAGGTGAAAGCAGG-3′, Reverse 5′-GcGGCCGCTCACACAGCTATAGGATCCT-3′) and then subcloned into the AgeI/NotI site of the <italic>β-act:loxP-TagBFP-STOP-lox-P</italic> vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>).

Tissue was washed with PBS for 5 min to remove OCT, followed by boiling in Pretreat 2 for 20 min. After Pretreat 2, slides were briefly washed with water and incubated for 10 min at 40°C with Pretreat 4. Following Pretreat 4, the manufacturer's protocol for RNAscope 2.0 HD detection Kit—Red was followed.

Mef2/PCNA staining on sections from 7 dpa ventricles was performed and imaged as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kikuchi et al., 2011b</xref>). A Zeiss 700 confocal microscope was used to image Mef2/PCNA-stained sections from whole uninjured ventricles, using the tilescan function to acquire entire longitudinal sections from each ventricle. Images were taken of the three largest sections from each ventricle. Mef2<sup>+</sup> and Mef2<sup>+</sup>/PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells were counted manually. Three sections from each heart were averaged to compute a proliferative index for each animal. Cross-sectional areas of ventricles at 6-month post-tamoxifen or -vehicle treatment were calculated (ImageJ) using images of the three largest sections from each heart stained for TroponinT. <italic>priZm</italic> samples were imaged and processed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta and Poss, 2012</xref>).

Swimming speed was increased every two minutes after a 20 min acclimation period. Water velocities were measured up to 102 cm/s and values above were extrapolated using the other measures. Exhausted animals were removed from the chamber without disturbing the remaining fish, while others continued to swim. After all fish swam to exhaustion, they were allowed to recover and then placed back in recirculating water. To determine significance, 2-way ANOVA was performed looking at the effect of Nrg1 overexpression, time, and the interaction of Nrg1 overexpression and time. The number of total animals analyzed per time point: pre-recombination (24), 1 month (24), 2 months (24), 3 months (23), 5 months (21), 6 months (19), 8 months (17), and 9 months (17).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Cardiomyocyte size measurements</title><p>Hearts were removed and washed in PBS wt/heparin and dissociated using a previously described protocol with minor changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sander et al., 2013</xref>).

Fish were sedated in phenoxyethanol and immobilized on a sponge immersed in fish water. Imaging was performed in the short axis (perpendicular to the fish) and long axis (parallel to the fish) using B-mode and PW imaging. Doppler parameters were measured using the Vevo2100 Cardiac Package by taking the average measurement of three consecutive contractions. Velocity time integral (VTI) and VTI*HR were used as measures of cardiac performance and output. Cardiac output could not be formally calculated, as outflow tract (OFT) diameter could not be directly measured by echocardiography. However, OFT diameter was not significantly different between experimental groups when measured in tissue sections (data not shown). Ventricular filling was measured by PW Doppler across the atrioventricular valve during diastole.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank J Burris, N Lee, A Dunlap, and S Davies for zebrafish care, and Poss lab members for discussions and comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marianne Bronner (Reviewing editor) and Benoit Bruneau (reviewer). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this paper, Gemberling and colleagues examine the role of neuregulin signalling in regenerative cardiomyocyte proliferation in zebrafish. They show that neuregulin is upregulated after injury and that and pharmacological blockage reduces cardiomyocyte proliferation after heart resection whereas transgenically induced overexpression results in a higher proliferative index. Interestingly, overexpression of Nrg1 under normal conditions demonstrates its “sufficiency” to initiate expansion of the cardiomyocyte population in the absence of injury. This results in induction of cell behaviors and gene expression reminiscent of regenerative cardiomyocytes and a continuous expansion of the cortical heart muscle layer.</p><p>This is a nicely done study that convincingly shows a strong effect of reactivation of Nrg on cardiomyocyte proliferation in the normal heart. The results extend previous work suggesting that Nrg can promote some heart regeneration in mammals, albeit the results in rodents are relatively mild compared with present results in zebrafish. Additional characterization of the endogenous role of neuregulin and the effects of cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression would greatly strengthen the manuscript. With these additions, the manuscript would make a strong contribution.</p><p>1) Most of the work presented is based on over expression in cardiomyocytes. The sole loss of function analysis uses pharmacological blockade of the receptor, which is suggestive but not definitive. A genetic deletion approach to dissect the cell types in which Nrg1 is important for cardiac regeneration would be more appropriate.</p><p>2) It would greatly strengthen the manuscript to test whether specific activation of the neuregulin pathway in cardiomyocytes is sufficient for this dramatic effect. Only in this way would it be possible to distinguish whether the effect is cell-autonomous to cardiomyocytes or depends upon interactions with other cell types.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> examines expression of Nrg7 days after injury and shows that it is upregulated at that timepoint.

A genetic deletion approach to dissect the cell types in which Nrg1 is important for cardiac regeneration would be more appropriate</italic>.</p><p>While we agree a genetic loss-of-function for Nrg1 during regeneration would strengthen the manuscript, there are major obstacles that must be overcome. First, Nrg1 is required for embryonic development, which makes global Nrg1 null mutants unavailable for adult regeneration experiments. Thus a genetic loss-of-function experiment requires the creation of a conditional allele. As of now there are no reports in zebrafish of the successful generation of a conditional loss-of-function allele. It is important to introduce inducible gene deletion technology to highly regenerative systems like zebrafish, axolotl, and planarians, and we are actively working with others in the field on this. However, as this would take at least one year to complete and test, we are unable to provide the analysis here.</p><p><italic>2) It would greatly strengthen the manuscript to test whether specific activation of the neuregulin pathway in cardiomyocytes is sufficient for this dramatic effect. Only in this way would it be possible to distinguish whether the effect is cell-autonomous to cardiomyocytes or depends upon interactions with other cell types</italic>.</p><p>We agree that cell type-specific activation or genetic loss of receptors would add to the understanding of the mechanism of Nrg1 function. Experiments to address cell-type specificity are actively being pursued in the laboratory and are an important next step, but are at least a year from completion due to the generation of numerous new transgenic lines to address these questions. Published reports show that Nrg1 can induce proliferation in cultured cardiomyocytes, suggesting that the effect is direct on cardiomyocytes. Current technology would allow us to express an activated form of the Erbb4 receptor specifically in cardiomyocytes, yet any downstream effect could be due to activation of Nrg1- or non-Nrg1-mediated pathways. Questions of cell type- specific activation or necessity in Nrg1-mediated enhancement of cardiomyocyte proliferation are important; yet as indicated above, attempts to acquire these secondary supportive data by the creation of novel tools would substantially delay our reporting the striking effects of Nrg1. This is current controversy over whether Nrg1 has mitogenic effects in the adult heart, amplified even more by a recent paper challenging this view published in December during the review of our manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reuter et al., 2014</xref>, PLoS One, 9(12): e115871). Therefore, we feel it is critical to report our primary findings as soon as possible without these new tools and supportive data.</p><p>To address points 1 and 2, we have added the following sentences in the revised manuscript, in the Conclusions:</p><p><italic>“</italic>The next generation of genome editing-inspired tools for zebrafish researchers should enable tests of cell-restricted, inducible genetic deletion of key Nrg1 components in multiple cell types. These experiments promise to dissect and define Nrg1 signaling requirements for regenerative responses within the complex cardiac milieu.”</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>examines expression of Nrg7 days after injury and shows that it is upregulated at that timepoint. The authors should perform a more detailed time course, at least by qPCR, to look at the Nrg levels as a function of time</italic>.</p><p>We agree that a time course would provide a more detailed understanding of Nrg1 mRNA dynamics following cardiac injury. To address this question, we have performed qPCR for Nrg1 mRNA levels at 3, 7, and 14 days following genetic ablation of cardiomyocytes. We find that Nrg1 mRNA levels are dynamic over time, with levels peaking at 7 days and then beginning to lower toward uninjured levels at 14 days post injury. Thus, peak Nrg1 levels correspond to the peak proliferative time point following genetic ablation, furthering support the finding that Nrg1 is an injury induced cardiac mitogen.
