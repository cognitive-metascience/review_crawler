In this study, we report a connection between the cytoplasmic domain of TANGO1 and SLY1, a protein that is required for membrane fusion. Knockdown of SLY1 by siRNA arrested Procollagen VII in the ER without affecting the recruitment of COPII components, general protein secretion, and retrograde transport of the KDEL-containing protein BIP, and ERGIC53. SLY1 is known to interact with the ER-specific SNARE proteins Syntaxin 17 and 18, however only Syntaxin 18 was required for Procollagen VII export. Neither SLY1 nor Syntaxin 18 was required for the export of the equally bulky Procollagen I from the ER. Altogether, these findings reveal the sorting of bulky collagen family members by TANGO1 at the ER and highlight the existence of different export pathways for secretory cargoes one of which is mediated by the specific SNARE complex containing SLY1 and Syntaxin 18.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02784.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02784.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02784.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Collagens are long proteins that join individual cells together to build tissues and organs. They also provide strength and elasticity to bones, tendons, and blood vessels. Like many other proteins, collagens are produced inside cells: they are folded in a compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum, and then packaged and transported to another compartment called the Golgi. Collagens are then directed from the Golgi to their final destination, which is typically the outside of the cell.</p><p>Small proteins travel from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi inside packages called vesicles. However it is not clear how large proteins like collagens are transported between these two compartments. It is known that a protein called TANGO1 is needed to direct a collagen called Procollagen VII to the outside of the cells. TANGO1 binds to Procollagen VII, and it is thought that TANGO1 delays the release of Procollagen VII from the endoplasmic reticulum, so that the vesicle can grow to a size that is able to accommodate such a bulky cargo.</p><p>Nogueira, Erlmann et al. have now discovered that TANGO1 binds to another protein called SLY1, and that this protein must also be present if Procollagen VII is to be exported from the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, the transport of a different type of collagen—Collagen I—does not require TANGO1 or SLY1.</p><p>SLY1 helps to fuse the membranes that enclose the structures involved in protein trafficking—such as the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi, and the vesicles—and this allows the cargoes of vesicles to pass from one compartment to another. Nogueira, Erlmann et al. also found that a second protein (called Syntaxin 18) is also required for the export of Procollagen VII.</p><p>Nogueira, Erlmann et al. propose that collagen VII export involves TANGO1 delaying the release of collagen from the endoplasmic reticulum so that SLY1 and Syntaxin 18 can fuse other cellular membranes to the growing transport vesicle. Following this work, the next challenge is to uncover how different types of collagens are separated from each other, and identify which specific vesicles are involved in their export.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02784.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02784.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Collagen</kwd><kwd>TANGO1</kwd><kwd>SLY1</kwd><kwd>Syntaxin 18</kwd><kwd>export</kwd><kwd>ER</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG fellowship ER 681/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erlmann</surname><given-names>Patrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003741</institution-id><institution>Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malhotra</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Plan Nacional</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2008-00414</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malhotra</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Consolider</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSD2009-00016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malhotra</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003741</institution-id><institution>Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SGR2009-1488</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malhotra</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>268692</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malhotra</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cross-linking screen finds proteins that interact with TANGO1 to export Procollagen VII, and suggests a new model for the secretion of these bulky cargoes that are involved in skin and bone formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Collagens are the most abundant secretory proteins, comprising 25–30% of the human body dry weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pataridis et al., 2008</xref>). They are required for cell attachment, tissue organization and remodeling, and for the differentiation of chondrocytes to produce mineralized bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gelse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). There are at least 28 different kinds of collagens, composed of homo or hetero trimers of polypeptide chains coiled around each other to form a triple helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shoulders and Raines, 2009</xref>). These unbendable triple helices, which can be up to 450 nm long, as in the case of Collagen VII, are too big to fit into the conventional transport carriers of the secretory pathway that have been identified thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malhotra and Erlmann, 2011</xref>). How are these bulky proteins exported from the ER?</p><p>While the debate on the trafficking of collagen-like molecules across the Golgi stack goes unabated, new data are beginning to unravel the mechanism by which collagens are exported from the ER. A protein called TANGO1 has been identified for its requirement in the export of Procollagen VII (PC VII) from the ER in tissue culture cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2009</xref>). The knockout of TANGO1 in mice results in the production of a pup that dies at birth due to defective bone mineralization. The cause is a block in the secretion of multiple collagens needed for the differentiation of chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). TANGO1 is also required for collagen secretion in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lerner et al., 2013</xref>). TANGO1 binds PC VII via its SH3 domain in the lumen of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2009</xref>). On the cytoplasmic side, TANGO1 binds cTAGE5 and both these proteins contain a proline rich domain that interacts with the COPII components SEC23/24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2011</xref>). We have proposed that binding of PC VII to TANGO1 in the lumen promotes the binding of TANGO1's proline rich domain to SEC23/24. This retards the recruitment of SEC13/31 to SEC23/24 and thus delays the events leading to the biogenesis of the COPII vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malhotra and Erlmann, 2011</xref>). Upon growth to a size that is large enough to encapsulate PC VII, TANGO1 dissociates from both PC VII and SEC23/24. The binding of SEC13/31 to SEC23/24 completes the assembly of COPII components on a patch of the ER. These events then lead to the export of PC VII, presumably in a mega carrier from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2011</xref>). Ubiquitination of SEC31 by the CUL3-KLHL12 ligase complex has been reported to control the exit of Procollagen I (PC I) from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malhotra, 2012</xref>). Sedlin is reported to help in the export of PC I and II from the ER by regulating the cycling of SAR1 activation state that is essential for COPII assembly at the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Venditti et al., 2012</xref>). TANGO1 is not required for PC I export from the ER, and it is not known whether PC II export is TANGO1 dependent. Together these data indicate that COPII components are required for the export of procollagens from the ER, however, they also suggest the possibility that not all procollagens exit the ER by the same mechanism.</p><p>We now show the involvement of SLY1 (or SCFD1) in specific ER export events. SLY1 is a member of the STXBP/unc-18/SEC1 family of proteins that regulate the assembly or the activity of SNAREs in membrane fusion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carr and Rizo, 2010</xref>). The yeast ortholog <italic>SLY1</italic>, an essential gene, has been described as a single copy suppressor of the <italic>YPT1</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dascher et al., 1991</xref>) and implicated in forward and retrograde trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ossig et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast with its essential roles in yeast, a temperature sensitive mutant of Sly1 in zebra fish is not lethal on the cellular level but rather creates developmental defects in embryonic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nechiporuk et al., 2003</xref>). In mammals, SLY1 has been reported to function in conjunction with Syntaxin 5 (STX5) in the ER to Golgi transport and might also function in the assembly of pre-Golgi intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rowe et al., 1998</xref>) together with Syntaxin 18 (STX18) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamaguchi et al., 2002</xref>) and Syntaxin 17 (STX17) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Steegmaier et al., 2000</xref>). SLY1 has been shown to interact with the COG4 complex and suggested to play a role in intra Golgi and retrograde transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Laufman et al., 2009</xref>). It is important to note that in mammalian cells, these proposed roles of SLY1 in traffic between ER and Golgi membranes are based entirely on the use of artificial temperature sensitive mutant protein Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV)-Glycoprotein (G) protein and the artificial cargo signal sequence (ss)-Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The role of SLY1 in the trafficking of endogenous cargoes and its potential mechanism of action is therefore a matter of debate.</p><p>We describe in this study, our data that reveal the existence of different export routes for secretory cargoes from the ER: of specific interest is the finding that SLY1 and the ER specific t-SNARE STX18 are necessary for the export of PC VII but not of the equally bulky PC I from the ER.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SLY1 is cross-linked to the ER exit sites specific TANGO1 and localizes to ER exit sites</title><p>To search for proteins that interact with cytoplasmically oriented portions of TANGO1, we expressed a Myc-His tagged version of a truncated form of TANGO1 (TANGO1ct) that lacks the luminal domain in HeLa cells. After crosslinking with membrane permeable DSP and lysis, proteins were recovered on a Nickel agarose column and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Of interest was the finding of SLY1 in the pool of proteins cross-linked to TANGO1.</p><p>To further ascertain the mass spectrometry data, we immunoprecipitated Myc-His-tagged TANGO1ct from transfected and crosslinked HeLa cells as described above and western blotted the bound material with anti-Myc and SLY1 antibodies, respectively. Our data show the presence of SLY1 in the TANGO1 immunoprecipitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). SLY1 is a cytoplasmic protein but our findings suggest that it interacts with the ER exit sites anchored TANGO1, so is there a pool of SLY1 associated with ER exit sites where TANGO1 resides? We have previously documented the use of a human cell line called RDEB/FB/C7 that stably expresses and secretes Collagen VII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2009</xref>). We used lentivirus to express SLY1-GFP in RDEB/FB/C7 cells. In fixed cells, the GFP signal is localized throughout the cytoplasm with a slight accumulation in the perinuclear region. After prepermeabilization of the cells with saponin and extensive washes to remove the cytoplasmic pool of proteins before fixation, a pool of SLY1-GFP was found to colocalize with the ER exit sites specific COPII component SEC31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Arrowheads mark single exit sites that label for SEC31 and SLY1. In addition, a perinuclear SLY1-containing and SEC31-lacking pool was observed. This perinuclear pool of SLY1 partially overlaps with GM130, a marker of the early Golgi cisternae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Our data show that although most of SLY1 was Golgi localized, we detected a small pool that co-localized with Sec31. At present, we do not know whether recruitment of SLY1 to the ER exit site is by direct binding to TANGO1 or indirectly through other proteins on the cytoplasmic side.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02784.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SLY1 immunoprecipitates with TANGO1 and localizes to ER exit sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lysates from Myc-His-TANGO1 (cytoplasmic tail) transfected or control HeLa cell lysates were incubated with Nickel beads, bound proteins (75%) and total lysates (10%) were separated by SDS-PAGE, endogenous SLY1 and Myc-His-TANGO1 (cytoplasmic tail) was detected by Western Blot using SLY1 and Myc antibodies.

In addition to the RDEB/FB/C7 cell line in which Collagen VII was exogenously introduced, we tested the immortalized human esophageal cell line Het1a to monitor the involvement of SLY1 in the export of endogenous PC VII. RDEB/FB/C7 and Het1a cells were transfected with siRNA oligos specific for SLY1, TANGO1, or a scrambled oligo as a control. RDEB/FB/C7 cells were transfected twice to increase knockdown efficiency. The levels of SLY1 and TANGO1 after knockdown were monitored by western blotting and revealed an approximately 90% reduction compared with control cells. Knockdown of TANGO1 did not significantly alter SLY1 protein levels and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). 48 hr after the last siRNA transfection, the cells were washed and then incubated with fresh medium containing ascorbic acid (2 µg/ml) for 20 hr. The medium and the cell lysates were western blotted with an anti-Collagen VII antibody. Knockdown of SLY1 inhibited PC VII secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

To further quantitate the involvement of SLY1 in transport between the Golgi apparatus and the ER, we used a procedure to trap cycling proteins in the ER as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pecot and Malhotra, 2006</xref>). HeLa cells treated with control siRNA or cells depleted of TANGO1 or SLY1 were transfected with the following constructs: one encoding ERGIC53, a protein that cycles between the early Golgi/ERGIC compartment and the ER, fused to FKPB and GFP, and another encoding the invariant chain of the major histocompatibility complex class II receptor (Ii) fused to FRAP-HA. In HeLa cells, the Ii chain lacking its MHC counterpart is retained in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lotteau et al., 1990</xref>). Rapamycin is known to bind FRAP and this dimer tightly binds FKBP. This procedure can therefore be used to test if FRAP- and FKBP-containing proteins reside in close proximity and thus are accessible to each other. We observed the cells by fluorescence microscopy at steady state and 15, 30, and 60 min after the addition of Rapamycin or in control cells without the addition of Rapamycin. Colocalization of the two constructs was assessed by calculating the Pearson's colocalization coefficient. Knockdown of TANGO1 or SLY1 did not affect the kinetics of ERGIC53 redistribution to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We therefore conclude that under our experimental conditions, knockdown of SLY1 or TANGO1 does not affect retrograde trafficking.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02784.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>SLY1 knockdown does not affect retrograde trafficking.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RDEB/FB/C7 cells depleted of SLY1 or control cells were visualized using an anti-GRP78/BIP, an anti-GM130 antibody and DAPI by fluorescence microscopy (scale bars: 20 µm).

This is similar to the known effects of TANGO1 knockdown on the selective export of secretory cargo from the ER. Interestingly, TANGO1 knockdown by siRNA does not affect the secretion of the bulky PC I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2011</xref>). Is SLY1 required for the trafficking of PC I? RDEB/FB/C7 cells were transfected with siRNA oligos specific for SLY1, TANGO1 or scrambled siRNA as a control and treated with ascorbic acid, as described above. 20 hr after the last change of medium, the cell lysates and the medium were western blotted with anti-Collagen I antibody. Our results reveal that the secretion of collagen I is not blocked by knockdown of SLY1 or TANGO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To further ascertain that SLY1 has no role in PC I export, we transfected Saos 2 cells with siRNA oligos specific for SLY1, TANGO1 or a scrambled siRNA and after 48 hr Saos 2 cells were washed, and then incubated with fresh medium containing ascorbic acid for 20 hr. The knockdown efficiency was determined by western blotting the cell lysates and revealed a reduction greater than 75% in the levels of SLY1 and TANGO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The intracellular and secreted PC I was measured by western blotting the cell lysate and the medium, respectively. As in RDEB/FB/C7 cells, knockdown of SLY1 or TANGO1 in Saos 2 cells did not affect the secretion of PC I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In fact, in both cells lines, we detected a marginal increase in the secretion of Collagen I that is accompanied by an increase in the internal levels of Collagen I in the knocked down cells. This suggests a potential effect on the transcriptional regulation of Collagen I expression rather than a defect in its trafficking.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>SAR1 activity is necessary for procollagen VII export</title><p>The assembly of the COPII coat is initiated by the activation of the small GTPase SAR1 by the ER-resident protein SEC12.

The assembly of the outer coat proteins SEC13/31 completes the biogenesis of COPII vesicles by inactivation of SAR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zanetti et al., 2012</xref>). TANGO1 links PC VII to the inner COPII coat by interacting with the SEC23/24 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2009</xref>). To further ascertain the involvement of COPII coat assembly at the ER for PC VII export, we depleted either of the SAR1 isoforms A and B or both in RDEB/FB/C7 cells using an siRNA mixture described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cutrona et al., 2013</xref>). Probing of cell lysates with anti SAR1 antibody revealed a doublet of bands at the predicted size of SAR1. As one can observe in the single knockdowns these bands correspond to the two SAR1 isoforms, the upper, weaker band being SAR1 B and the lower, stronger SAR1 A. Single knockdowns result in an almost complete depletion of the individual isoforms, with double knockdown the efficiency is approximately 75% for SAR1 A while SAR1 B is still fully depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The same procedure of SAR1 knockdown was repeated and 48 hr after transfection with the specific siRNA oligos, the cells were washed, and then incubated with fresh medium containing ascorbic acid for 20 hr. The medium and the cell lysates were western blotted with an anti-Collagen VII antibody. Knockdown of SAR1 A alone had marginal effect on the secretion of PC VII, whereas the knockdown of SAR1 B was largely ineffective. However, knockdown of both SAR1 A and B led to an almost total block in PC VII secretion, which accumulated in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). To visualize the intracellular site of PC VII accumulation, we transfected RDEB/FB/C7 cells to deplete both SAR1 A and B as described above, and 24 hr later ascorbic acid was added to the culture medium. 48 hr later, the cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against Collagen VII and SEC31, respectively. In cells depleted of SAR1 A and B, PC VII accumulated in large structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) similar to the patches of PC VII seen in RDEB/FB/C7 cells depleted of TANGO1 or SLY1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Is SLY1 activity required before or after the COPII recruitment to the ER exit sites? TANGO1, as shown previously, connects PC VII to the COPII subunits through interaction with SEC23/24. The question we asked was whether the location of COPII components and PC VII in cells that are depleted of SLY1 is different compared with control cells that are exporting Collagen VII. Since PC VII is rapidly exported from the ER after its synthesis, our positive control, to test this hypothesis, was cells transfected with scrambled siRNA oligos for 72 hr and then kept for 3 hr at 15°C to accumulate secretory cargo in the ER and then shifted to 37°C for 30 min to restart cargo export from the ER. These cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy to monitor the location of PC VII and either the COPII component SEC31 or TANGO1. In the control cells, PC VII accumulated in the ER in large patches similar to that observed in SLY1 or TANGO1 knockdown cells.

How are the secretory collagens connected with the cytoplasmic COPII machinery? Are all the bulky collagens exported by a common secretory pathway? Our new data show that knockdown of SAR1 A and B inhibits the export of PC VII from the ER. This, combined with the data on the involvement of SEC31 ubiquitination for the export of PC I from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jin et al., 2012</xref>) and Sedlin, a component of the TRAPP II complex that affects the GTPase activity of SAR1 and promotes PC I and II export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Venditti et al., 2012</xref>), strongly indicates that SAR1 dependent recruitment of COPII components is required for general collagen export from the ER.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Secretory cargo sorting in the ER</title><p>A large number of secretory cargoes bind receptors of the ERGIC53, ERV, and p24 families; the receptors in turn bind the inner COPII coat components and are then packed into a standard COPII vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zanetti et al., 2012</xref>).

The function of TANGO1 is facilitated by cTAGE5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saito et al., 2011</xref>). cTAGE5 and TANGO1 interact through their second (proximal to the proline rich domain) coiled–coiled domains at the ER exit sites. cTAGE5 does not have a luminal domain and cannot therefore bind PC VII directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saito et al., 2011</xref>). The TANGO1–cTAGE5 complex is proposed to stall the COPII vesicles at the ER exit sites as they are being packed with PC VII and this procedure is proposed to result in the production of a transport intermediate for the export of PC VII from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malhotra and Erlmann, 2011</xref>).

This strongly indicates the existence of different export pathways from the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). These findings also highlight that the sorting of cargoes into different export routes is not driven solely by the size of the secretory cargoes.

Moreover, TANGO1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is required for the export of Collagen IV, which is secreted into the basal face of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lerner et al., 2013</xref>). It is therefore tempting to propose that secretory cargoes are sorted in the lumen of the ER based on their final destination.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02784.013</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A working model for procollagen export from the ER.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Multiple exit routes from the ER.

There is no evidence that TANGO1 binds HRP in the lumen of the ER and yet both knockdown of TANGO1 and SLY1, as shown here, affect ss-HRP secretion in mammalian cells. We suggest that the exogenously expressed ss-HRP or ss-GFP exits the ER by any route available and blocking any one, for example by TANGO1 or SLY1 knockdown, affects its export because of a block in one of the possible exit routes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The requirement of an ER attached t-SNARE in cargo export from the ER</title><p>Our surprising finding is that SLY1, which is known to interact with STX18, a t-SNARE for membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hatsuzawa et al., 2000</xref>), is required for the export of PC VII from the ER. The function of SLY1, which is a member of the STXBP/unc-18/SEC1 protein family, remains unclear. For example, it is not known whether SLY1 regulates the activity of the SNARE complex, or helps with the fusion or the disassembly of the SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carr and Rizo, 2010</xref>). SLY1 at the ER -Golgi interface has been shown to interact with a large number of SNAREs and could thus regulate a number of different SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dascher and Balch, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Steegmaier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamaguchi et al., 2002</xref>). The t- and v-SNAREs of the ER Golgi anterograde and retrograde trafficking routes are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. So far the SNARE complexes reported for the forward trafficking from ER to Golgi are complexes of Golgi t-SNAREs and a specific v-SNARE. However, there is no evidence that the ER attached t-SNAREs such as STX17, STX18, Sec20 and USE1/P31 are required for the forward transport to the Golgi complex. It could be argued that SLY1 and STX18 function to recycle a specific component, a v-SNARE; for example, from ERGIC/early Golgi cisternae and without which, the cells terminate the export of PC VII out of the ER. However, cycling of KDEL containing protein BIP and ERGIC53 as well as the export of other secretory cargoes including the bulky PC I is unaffected under these experimental conditions. Additionally, we do not see any obvious accumulation of PC VII containing large vesicles in between the ER and the Golgi. We therefore favor the possibility that SLY1 and STX18 are required for the fusion of membranes to the ER to generate an export carrier for PC VII. The working hypothesis for the export of PC VII from the ER follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>A SAR1 dependent reaction initiates the assembly of COPII subunits SEC23/24 at the ER exit sites.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recruitment of TANGO1-cTAGE5 complex into this reaction with its binding of PC VII in the lumen and SEC23/24 on the cytoplasmic site.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The binding of TANGO1-cTAGE5 to SEC23/24 retards the recruitment of SEC13/31 and prevents premature pinching of membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malhotra and Erlmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saito et al., 2011</xref>).

This membrane bound compartment in principle is the first post ER compartment that matures to move PC VII in the anterograde direction for secretion.</p><p>Interestingly, Luini et al. have reported that export of PC I from the ER requires its concentration at a domain close to the ER exit sites, which they suggest protrudes and then separates from the ER to generate a PC I enriched carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mironov et al., 2003</xref>). Their model is reminiscent of our scheme in which we place molecular components such as TANGO1 for the concentration of PC VII followed by the fusion of membranes to grow the PC VII enriched ER domain. However, the TANGO1 mediated concentration of PC VII requires the involvement of COPII components, SEC23/24. Additionally, the protrusion visualized by the microscopy based analysis might correspond to growth of ER patch by SLY1 and STX18 dependent fusion of the recycling (ERGIC) membranes. The challenge is to find proteins that connect PC I with the COPII machinery, the SNAREs required for the trafficking of PC I, and the visualization of membranes that we propose are added to grow the patch of PC VII containing ER membrane into a vectorial carrier en route to the cell surface for secretion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>cDNA cloning and constructs</title><p>TANGO1 constructs were as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Full-length <italic>SLY1</italic> was amplified by RT-PCR from the total mRNA of HeLa cells. <italic>SLY1</italic> was cloned into the retroviral vector pLJM1-GFP (Addgene, Cambridge MA) using Gibson cloning strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>).

Like loss of TANGO1, cells depleted of Sly1 are normal for secretion of general proteins and for collagen I. Loss of Sly1 does not interfere with TANGO1 interaction with cargo on membranes, suggesting (but not proving) that it acts after TANGO1. Syntaxin 5, but not 18, is required for collagen 1 secretion.</p><p>Is this suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>? Less is known than one would expect about the molecular basis of ER export in mammalian cells, and this work again highlights the interesting fact that multiple export pathways do indeed exist. If the paper were to teach us what Sly1 does in this process, there would be no hesitation. Nevertheless, the fundamental importance of the process and the molecular clarification of ER export sorting lean in favor of publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Issues that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The data are convincing regarding the phenotypes, but the possibility remains that this could be an indirect effect, despite the authors attempt to demonstrate otherwise. Certain cargos, like endogenous PC VII, and overexpressed cargos like ssHRP, do clearly have requirements for additional factors to aid in their incorporation into COPII vesicles. Indeed, TANGO1 is one of these factors. But given the established roles of SLY1, STX18, and other related proteins in mediating vesicle fusion, it has not yet been shown that SLY1 is directly involved in this process. An alternative explanation is that PCVII is an especially sensitive cargo, and its incorporation into COPII vesicles is hindered by general trafficking perturbations that do not affect most other cargos. Furthermore, how do the authors know that membranes are the limiting component for PCVII vesicle formation upon SLY1 knockdown? Might the recycling ERGIC membranes contain specific protein factors that might be important for this process? These are very tricky issues to address, but we offer a suggestion for how the authors might make their case stronger:</p><p>Although the authors identify SLY1 as an interactor of TANGO1, this interaction is not explored functionally. Can the authors show that the interaction is important for PCVII to exit the ER? (i.e., identify a mutant in either TANGO1 or SLY1 that disrupts the interaction, and test whether this mutant is functional for PCVII ER export).</p><p>2) The authors conclude with a speculative model suggesting that Sly1 helps fuse ERGIC derived membranes to build collagen VII carriers. Equally possible is a model in which the SNAREs drive fusion of the carriers with the target membranes and cannot form without packaging of the SNAREs. This should be discussed as well. Moreover, the authors should summarize what is known about all ER localized SNARE proteins, perhaps in a table, to highlight gaps in our understanding. The authors find that the SM protein SLY1 interacts with TANGO1, and find that SLY1 and STX18 are important for ER export of the large cargo PC VII. The key experimental results in this paper are that SLY1 knockdown dramatically affects the ER exit of PCVII and overexpressed ssHRP, but not ER exit of other cargos like PCI.</p><p>3) If SLY1 is directly involved in PCVII ER export, one might expect that levels of SLY1 would be highest in those tissues or cells responsible for secreting PCVII. Is there any evidence in the literature (transcriptomics, proteomics) that SLY1 is particularly abundant in such tissues?</p><p>4) One reviewer took issue with the authors' claim that SLY1 and STX18 act at a “post-COPII assembly step”. The evidence for this claim is based on the fact that SEC31 still forms punctae on the same ER compartments where PCVII is accumulating in SLY1-knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, there is no reason to think that these SEC31 punctae represent stalled PCVII vesicle buds. These SEC31 punctae might be unaffected ERES through which other cargos are continuing to exit normally (because the authors show that other cargos are not affected by SLY1-knockdown). SLY1-knockdown may have no affect at all on the observed SEC31 punctae, and may have actually prevented the formation of PCVII-nucleated SEC31 punctae (which would remain unseen). If SLY1 acts downstream of COPII assembly, one would expect to see a proliferation of SEC31 punctae in the SLY1-knockdown cells, corresponding to stalled PCVII buds.

The reviewers have requested that we show more on the interaction between TANGO1 and SLY1. Unfortunately, at present, this is beyond the scope of the paper. TANGO1 coprecipitates with SLY1 only in cells that are chemically crosslinked and we believe they are in a complex of a large number of other proteins. It is, therefore, unclear whether these two proteins bind directly. We were fortunate that we could identify this interaction but defining the mechanism of their binding is not possible at present. We have rewritten the paper extensively to address the reviewers’ concerns and better describe the data rather than a potential model based on our findings. Our data highlights the existing of separate pathways for the export of Procollagen VII and Procollagen I from the ER. In other words, size alone is not the reason for the separate pathways of procollagen export from the ER. Our revised manuscript highlights this new message. In addition, we have added a table that summarizes our current understanding of the SNARE proteins localized at the ER-Golgi interface. This will help the readers to understand the complexity of this process and appreciate our findings.</p><p><italic>1) The data are convincing regarding the phenotypes, but the possibility remains that this could be an indirect effect, despite the authors attempt to demonstrate otherwise. […] An alternative explanation is that PCVII is an especially sensitive cargo, and its incorporation into COPII vesicles is hindered by general trafficking perturbations that do not affect most other cargos. Furthermore, how do the authors know that membranes are the limiting component for PCVII vesicle formation upon SLY1 knockdown? Might the recycling ERGIC membranes contain specific protein factors that might be important for this process? These are very tricky issues to address</italic>, <italic>but we offer a suggestion for how the authors might make their case stronger:</italic></p><p><italic>Although the authors identify SLY1 as an interactor of TANGO1, this interaction is not explored functionally. Can the authors show that the interaction is important for PCVII to exit the ER? (i.e. identify a mutant in either TANGO1 or SLY1 that disrupts the interaction, and test whether this mutant is functional for PCVII ER export)</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer lists a number of different issues in this point that we address separately.</p><p>A) As stated in the response above, it is impossible for us to map the binding interaction between TANGO1 and SLY1. We have changed the Title, Abstract, Introduction, and the Discussion extensively to state more clearly the facts.</p><p>B) Effect on specific cargo: a V-SNARE for example. We address this in the discussion.</p><p>C) Is PC VII somehow more susceptible to our experimental perturbations? It cannot be because of our data that the export of PC I, which is roughly the same size is not affected by either the loss of TANGO1, SLY1 or STX18. This is now stated more clearly in the text.</p><p><italic>2) The authors conclude with a speculative model suggesting that Sly1 helps fuse ERGIC derived membranes to build collagen VII carriers. Equally possible is a model in which the SNAREs drive fusion of the carriers with the target membranes and cannot form without packaging of the SNAREs. This should be discussed as well. Moreover, the authors should summarize what is known about all ER localized SNARE proteins, perhaps in a table, to highlight gaps in our understanding. The authors find that the SM protein SLY1 interacts with TANGO1, and find that SLY1 and STX18 are important for ER export of the large cargo PC VII. The key experimental results in this paper are that SLY1 knockdown dramatically affects the ER exit of PCVII and overexpressed ssHRP, but not ER exit of other cargos like PCI</italic>.</p><p>We state this in the text but also highlight that we favor an alternative model. A table with the known v-and t-SNAREs at the ER-Golgi interface is now included in the paper.</p><p><italic>3) If SLY1 is directly involved in PCVII ER export, one might expect that levels of SLY1 would be highest in those tissues or cells responsible for secreting PCVII. Is there any evidence in the literature (transcriptomics</italic>, <italic>proteomics) that SLY1 is particularly abundant in such tissues?</italic></p><p>No, there is no evidence in the literature that SLY1 or TANGO1 levels are particularly higher in tissues that export PC VII.</p><p><italic>4) One reviewer took issue with the authors' claim that SLY1 and STX18 act at a “post-COPII assembly step”. The evidence for this claim is based on the fact that SEC31 still forms punctae on the same ER compartments where PCVII is accumulating in SLY1-knockdown cells (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref><italic>). However, there is no reason to think that these SEC31 punctae represent stalled PCVII vesicle buds. These SEC31 punctae might be unaffected ERES through which other cargos are continuing to exit normally (because the authors show that other cargos are not affected by SLY1-knockdown). SLY1-knockdown may have no affect at all on the observed SEC31 punctae, and may have actually prevented the formation of PCVII-nucleated SEC31 punctae (which would remain unseen). If SLY1 acts downstream of COPII assembly, one would expect to see a proliferation of SEC31 punctae in the SLY1-knockdown cells, corresponding to stalled PCVII buds. Please modify the text accordingly</italic>.</p><p>We have changed the subheading to “SLY1 knockdown does not affect Sec13/Sec31 localization to the ER exit sites“. It is also important to note that we do not state that these are stalled PC VII buds. All we say is that SLY1 depletion does not affect the connection made by TANGO1 between PC VII and the COPII coats of the exit site. We have deleted our statement that SLY1 acts post COPII coat assembly from the discussion to alleviate the issue raised by the reviewer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
