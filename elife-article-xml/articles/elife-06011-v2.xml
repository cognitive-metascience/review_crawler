(T2D). Using gene disruption in the mouse, we discovered a function for a RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor PDZ-RhoGEF (<italic>Arhgef11</italic>) in white adipose tissue biology. While PDZ-RhoGEF was dispensable for a number of RhoA signaling-mediated processes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, including stress fiber formation and cell migration, it's deletion led to a reduction in their proliferative potential. On a whole organism level, PDZ-RhoGEF deletion resulted in an acute increase in energy expenditure, selectively impaired early adipose tissue development and decreased adiposity in adults. PDZ-RhoGEF-deficient mice were protected from diet-induced obesity and T2D. Mechanistically, PDZ-RhoGEF enhanced insulin/IGF-1 signaling in adipose tissue by controlling ROCK-dependent phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Our results demonstrate that PDZ-RhoGEF acts as a key determinant of mammalian metabolism and obesity-associated pathologies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06011.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06011.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06011.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Obesity is a growing public health concern around the world, and can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Both genetics and environmental factors such as diet contribute to obesity. Fat cells are essential to good health, but the excess accumulation of fat cells in obese people involves a complex process that is regulated by interactions between numerous genes, cellular messengers and mechanical forces. Learning more about these factors could help prevent or treat obesity.</p><p>One mutation in the gene encoding a protein called PDZ-RhoGEF has been linked to both obesity and type 2 diabetes. People with mutations in this gene are not responsive enough to insulin, a hormone important for sugar metabolism. This can interfere with the body’s ability to burn energy in food or lead to a dangerous build up of sugar in the blood as seen in type 2 diabetes. But exactly what PDZ-RhoGEF normally does to prevent this is unclear.</p><p>Chang et al. now show that PDZ-RhoGEF controls fat cell production and the body’s ability to release the energy contained in food. First, mice that had been genetically engineered to lack PDZ-RhoGEF were compared to typical mice. The mice without PDZ-RhoGEF had fewer fat cells than the typical mice, and they burned more energy. The mutant mice walked around about as much as the typical mice but they were more likely to have repetitive movements, the mouse equivalent of human nervous ticks.</p><p>Insulin normally stimulates the production of fat cells. But the mutant mice were less able to produce fat cells as they developed into adults. When fed a high fat food diet, the normal mice became fatter and insensitive to insulin and developed other health problems linked to excess fat in the body. The mutant mice on the same diet, however, stayed thin and avoided these health issues. The experiments show that PDZ-RhoGEF helps relay insulin’s message within the body, and as such it plays a critical role in regulating metabolism, sugar levels and fat accumulation. Future work should ask how PDZ-RhoGEF affects other complications linked to obesity, and explore the possibility of developing treatments for obesity based on the biology of this molecule.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06011.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06011.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>insulin</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>adipose tissue</kwd><kwd>Rho signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000147</institution-id><institution>Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Operating grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stambolic</surname><given-names>Vuk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000015</institution-id><institution>Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2011700891</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stambolic</surname><given-names>Vuk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PDZ-RhoGEF controls adipose tissue abundance and whole body metabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity is a global health challenge. While it is generally recognized that obesity arises as a result of a complex interplay of genetic factors that govern predisposition for white adipose tissue expansion, as well as environmental factors, such as diet, the molecular mechanisms underlying this condition are not fully understood. Adipose tissue growth results from an increase in both adipocyte size and number and occurs as part of normal development, as well as during the onset of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faust et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prins and O'Rahilly, 1997</xref>). Recent evidence shows that the number of adipocytes is set during childhood and adolescence and determines the adult fat mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spalding et al., 2008</xref>). Adipogenesis, a differentiation program that gives rise to adipocytes, is regulated by a coordinated activation of a transcription factor network responding to the adipogenic and anti-adipogenic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cristancho and Lazar, 2011</xref>). Insulin/IGF-1 signaling also has marked effects on adipogenesis. For instance, genetic disruption of the insulin receptor (IR), the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) genes, as well as PKBα/Akt1 and PKBβ/Akt2, respectively, the major mediators of insulin signaling, lead to impaired adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tseng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yun et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Beyond soluble factors, changes in cell shape have also been implicated in influencing adipogenesis through activation of a small GTPase RhoA and its downstream effector Rho-kinase (ROCK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kilian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McBeath et al., 2004</xref>). RhoA-ROCK signaling is activated in mature adipocytes via mechanical stretch generated by obesity-related adipocyte hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hara et al., 2011</xref>). Together with Rac and Cdc42, RhoA constitutes a Rho branch of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, which act in a variety of signaling pathways and regulate many cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ridley, 2001a</xref>). Initially identified as key regulators of actin cytoskeleton remodeling, Rho family members control many other cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking, cell cycle progression, cytokinesis, migration, apoptosis, gene transcription, and cell fate determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman and Olson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heasman and Ridley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McBeath et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sordella et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Rho GTPases are activated through a GTP-for-GDP nucleotide exchange reaction, catalyzed by the Rho GTPase-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ridley, 2001a</xref>). The Dbl family of RhoGEFs, with its 70 members in mammals, represents the largest class of Rho activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rossman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmidt and Hall, 2002</xref>). Dbl family members contain at least one highly conserved Dbl homology (DH) catalytic domain, which facilitates the GDP/GTP exchange, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain N-terminal to the DH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng, 2001</xref>). PDZ-RhoGEF (ARHGEF11), encodes a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, with two transcript variants ARHGEF11 variant 1 and variant 2 in the human (GeneBank accession # NM_014784 and NM_198236) and a single Arhgef11 transcript in the mouse (Genebank accession NM_001003912). Together with two other Dbl family members, the leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) and p115RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF constitutes a newly identified subfamily, the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain-containing RhoGEFs (RGS-RhoGEFs).</p><p>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the genes encoding RGS-RhoGEFs have also been informative in revealing their potential physiological functions. For instance, a non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP) mapping to the C-terminal region of LARG and leading to Y1306C (Tyr1306Cys) substitution has been implicated in increasing insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic Pima Indians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holzapfel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kovacs et al., 2006</xref>). Another nsSNP coding for the R1467H (Arg1467His), a C-terminal variant of PDZ-RhoGEF was found in association with insulin resistance and type II diabetes in several populations, including Pima Indians, Old Order Amish, Caucasian, Korean and Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bottcher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2007</xref>). These findings suggest that LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF may impact insulin sensitivity and whole body metabolism.</p><p>To elucidate the physiological function of PDZ-RhoGEF in vivo, we disrupted its gene in the mouse. While our data show that PDZ-RhoGEF is dispensable for many cellular processes that it had previously been linked to, we discovered its direct involvement in controlling adipose tissue homeostasis through regulation of adipocyte numbers and energy expenditure. Mechanistically, PDZ-RhoGEF was found to induce RhoA/ROCK-dependent phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and promote signaling via this adaptor protein in response to insulin/IGF-1, controlling proliferation of adipogenic precursors and MEFs and whole body energy expenditure. Moreover, PDZ-RhoGEF-knockout (KO) mice were resistant to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in vivo. Our work firmly implicates PDZ-RhoGEF in the physiological control of adipose tissue development, obesity and insulin resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reduced body weight and fat mass in mice lacking PDZ-RhoGEF</title><p>To evaluate the physiological function(s) of PDZ-RhoGEF, we generated a genetically modified mouse line bearing a conditionally targeted PDZ-RhoGEF allele, <italic>Arhgef11</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Re-expression of PDZ-RhoGEF in the PDZ-RhoGEF-deficient MEFs rescued the IGF-1-induced PKB/Akt phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, activation-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor was comparable between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), indicating that diminution of PKB/Akt phosphorylation in PDZ-RhoGEF KO MEFs stems from an impaired PDZ-RhoGEF-dependent step downstream of the receptor. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) acts immediately downstream of the insulin/IGF-1 receptors to propagate their signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taniguchi et al., 2006</xref>).

In IGF-1-stimulated PDZ-RhoGEF KO MEFs, both tyrosine and IRS1 serine 632/635 (S632/635) phosphorylation were greatly reduced compared to wild type MEFs, as was its direct association with the p85α and p110α subunits of PI3K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In contrast, phosphorylation of IRS-1 at S612, another putative Rho kinase (ROCKI/II) targeted residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sordella et al., 2003</xref>), was not affected by PDZ-RhoGEF loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), indicating that phosphorylation of this residue in MEFs can be uncoupled from that of S632/635.

Further, both tyrosine and S632/635 phosphorylation of IRS-1 in PDZ-RhoGEF KO EWAT were decreased in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), as was the direct association of IRS-1 with the p85α and p110α subunits of PI3K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicative of impeded insulin signaling throughput via IRS-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furukawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2009</xref>).

The uncoupling of IRS-1 S632/635 and S612 phosphorylation in MEFs and EWAT upon disruption of PDZ-RhoGEF may represent an additional means of achieving specificity in RhoA signaling. Intriguingly, PDZ-RhoGEF appears capable of directing ROCK activity towards IRS-1 S632/635 in fibroblasts and adipose tissue, whereas other GEFs may participate in modulating its activity towards S612 in other tissues. Alternatively, the distinct RhoGEFs may differentially activate ROCK family members (ROCK1/β and ROCKII/α), which in turn may harbor subtle, but important differences in specificity towards IRS-1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PDZ-RhoGEF as a modifier of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in control of energy expenditure and adipose tissue homeostasis</title><p>The lack of difference in the BAT mass, food consumption, UCP-1 expression, in BAT and IWAT, as well as the core body temperature in PDZ-RhoGEF KO mice, indicate that the adaptive thermogenesis is not dependent on PDZ-RhoGEF. Nevertheless, PDZ-RhoGEF deletion increased total oxygen consumption and total activity, largely due to an increase in the stereotype activity, but not the ambulatory activity. RER analysis indicates that while both wild type and PDZ-RhoGEF KO mice utilize carbohydrates and fat as fuel (0.8&lt;RER&lt;1.0), higher RER values in PDZ-RhoGEF KO mice suggest preferential use of carbohydrates as a fuel source in their skeletal muscles. Indeed, an increase in physical activity found in PDZ-RhoGEF KO mice may impact exercise- and contractility-mediated glucose transport in the skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Richter and Hargreaves, 2013</xref>) and in turn increase the use of carbohydrates as energy source. Remarkably, despite its reduced PI3K pathway activation in response to insulin, PDZ-RhoGEF KO EWAT displayed an increase in ECAR, revealing of the preferential use of glucose as an energy source in this tissue. This may in part be due to the compensatory, PI3K-independent mechanisms for glucose utilization in EWAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2007</xref>) and contribute to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis in PDZ-RhoGEF KO animals and their lean and metabolically healthy phenotype.</p><p>The phenotype of PDZ-RhoGEF-deficient mice partially resembles that of mice lacking other insulin signaling pathway components. For instance, IRS-1- or PKBα/Akt1-deficiency leads to decreased body fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wan et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, adipose tissue-specific disruption of the insulin receptor (FIRKO) displayed reduced adiposity. Unlike the proliferative defect found in PDZ-RhoGEF KO adipose tissue development, the reduced adipose tissue size in FIRKO mice results from decreases in adipocyte size in the mutant adult fat pads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bluher et al., 2002</xref>). Further confounding the comparison between the phenotypes arising from IR and PDZ-RhoGEF deletion is the contribution of PDZ-RhoGEF to signaling via the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R). IGF-1R is the dominant IR/IGF-1R family member expressed in the stromal-vascular cells of the developing adipose tissue, including progenitor cells and pre-adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Entingh-Pearsall and Kahn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nougues et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wright and Hausman, 1995</xref>). Thus, in vivo, PDZ-RhoGEF impact on the proliferative capacity of adipogenic precursors likely relates to its function in signaling via the related IGF-1R, whereas in mature adipose tissue it may also affect IR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Notably, dual deletion of IGF-1 and insulin receptors in adipose tissues (FIGIRKO) results in reduced adiposity due to a decrease in adipocyte abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boucher et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, the correlation between full body deletion of PDZ-RhoGEF and deletion of IR/IGF-1R in adipose tissue further reinforces that modification of IR/IGF-1R signaling in adipose tissue plays a central role in controlling adipose tissue homeostasis. A mechanistic insight into the contribution of PDZ-RhoGEF-mediated control of energy expenditure and adipocyte numbers to reduced adiposity may require tissue-specific deletion of PDZ-RhoGEF in various mouse tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>PDZ-RhoGEF, an obesity/T2D predisposition gene?</title><p>Deletion of PDZ-RhoGEF had no effect on food consumption when fed with either normal or high-fat diet. Under a normal dietary setting, PDZ-RhoGEF, via RhoA/ROCK activation, sensitized IRS1/PI3K signaling to insulin/IGF-1, thereby maintaining the proliferative potential of adipogenic progenitors and supporting adipose tissue expansion during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–I</xref>). Of note, PDZ-RhoGEF may also act on mature adipocytes or other cell types to influence adipose tissue development and homeostasis. Adipocyte number is a key determinant of fat mass in humans, whereby individuals with higher number of adipocytes are prone to obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spalding et al., 2008</xref>). Likewise, wild type mice, which displayed greater total adipocyte numbers, became obese and developed T2D when on prolonged HFD. Reduced adipose tissue expansion in PDZ-RhoGEF KO animals prevented these pathological consequences of the HFD. Of interest, under conditions of energy overload, PDZ-RhoGEF levels were elevated in the peripheral insulin-target tissues and accompanied by increased downstream signaling to p70S6K1 and enhanced negative feedback loop input into the insulin/insulin receptor signaling cascade(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–II</xref>).</p><p>Our data firmly support the involvement of PDZ-RhoGEF in the genetics of fat mass regulation and predisposition to obesity and T2D, previously suggested by the association of the PDZ-RhoGEF SNP R1467H with the epidemiology of T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bottcher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2007</xref>).

We believe this issue can be addressed in a reasonable time frame through the provision of additional data to clarify which tissues contribute to energy expenditure phenotype and by which mechanism this phenotype occurs. Please see specific suggestions below:</p><p>1) Please include additional signaling analysis in different tissues and specific cell types (particularly in adipocyte precursor cells, though analysis in liver would also be helpful) to solidify the link between your in vitro and in vivo studies. The current use of extremely heterogeneous populations of MEFs or ADSCs to study adipogenesis in vitro (rather than analysis of adipocyte precursor cells as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) makes it difficult to connect the mechanisms suggested by the in vitro studies to the in vivo loss of adipose tissue.</p><p>2) Similarly, the authors should analyze BrdU incorporation, IGF signaling and PDZ-RhoGEF expression in specific cell subsets that are relevant to the in vivo physiology of the PDZ-RhoGEF KO mice (i.e. adipocyte precursor cells), rather than in MEFs or adipose tissue generally, to provide greater mechanistic insights.</p><p>3) Please include additional data on energy expenditure: The implications of the higher RER is not demonstrated or discussed. The KO mice appear to be using significantly more glucose, although glucose uptake by skeletal muscle is similar. Are the white fat depots utilizing more glucose in these mice? What is the oxygen consumption rate in the fat pads? What about glucose use in the liver? It is also not convincing that the mice have any difference in energy expenditure, as the mice have little increase in oxygen consumption (only one time point is statistically significant) and no significant change in locomotor activity (despite some small trends with high p-values).</p><p>4) Similarly, with HFD, there are changes in EDL glucose uptake and lipid accumulation in the liver, making it unclear what contribution the changes in metabolism in these tissues have to phenotype of the mice. More metabolic analyses should be performed in these tissues, as the reduced adiposity may not be the major factor accounting for improved insulin sensitivity. Although fat accumulation in the liver may be a consequence of the changes in the fat, this may not necessarily be the case. It is hard to make any conclusions because there is not much studied in the livers regarding their metabolism. It is also unclear how glucose uptake is being altered in the EDL since PDZ-RhoGEF is not detected in this tissue (unless the levels are increased after HFD?) – this suggests there may be crosstalk occurring, which should be acknowledged in the manuscript.</p><p>5) Several conclusions appear to be drawn based on data that is not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>) or that lacks sufficient sample size (sample size of only 1 or 2 is insufficient). Please add additional data or amend conclusions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor PDZ-RhoGEF Governs Susceptibility to Diet-induced Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been substantially improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have added new experiments to address the role of adipocyte progenitor cell proliferation in the phenotype of the PDZ-RhoGEF KO mice; however, the most specific assays (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) are limited to effects in culture, and it remains possible that the in vivo phenotype could relate to effects in mature cells as well. Please edit the text to tone down the conclusion regarding the role of adipocyte precursor cell proliferation, and add to the Discussion explicit consideration that PDZ-RhoGEF may act on multiple cell types including precursor cells, mature adipocytes or other cell types to influence adipose tissue development and homeostasis. No new experiments are requested – this is merely a text edit to provide clarity for readers that a more detailed study of adipose precursor cells in this context is warranted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06011.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>While all reviewers recognized the importance of these findings with regard to the role of PDZ-RhoGEF in white adipose biology and diet-induced obesity, specific concerns were raised, with which all reviewers agreed, that the manuscript in its current form does not sufficiently explain the energy expenditure and insulin signaling phenotypes in the PDZ-RhoGEF KO mice.

Our new data indicate that insulin/IGF-1 signaling is impaired in PDZ-RhoGEF-deficient cultured FACS- isolated cell population (Lin<sup>–</sup>/CD29<sup>+</sup>/CD34<sup>+</sup>/Sca1<sup>+</sup>), which represents the pool of adipogenic progenitor cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We have also evaluated the impact of PDZ-RhoGEF on insulin/IGF-1 signaling in the liver and the skeletal muscle and found that its’ deletion produced no effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref> moved forward from the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). These results further support the assertion that PDZ-RhoGEF impacts insulin/IGF-1 signaling specifically in white adipose tissue.

Similar to MEFs and ADSCs, deletion of PDZ- RhoGEF led to reduced proliferative capacity of adipogenic progenitor cells (CD34<sup>+</sup>CD29<sup>+</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>), as demonstrated by measuring BrdU incorporation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

It is also not convincing that the mice have any difference in energy expenditure, as the mice have little increase in oxygen consumption (only one time point is statistically significant) and no significant change in locomotor activity (despite some small trends with high p-values).</italic> </p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have considerably extended the analysis of energy expenditure. Compared to wild type, the oxygen consumption and the respiratory exchange rates (RER) in PDZ-RhoGEF<sup>-/-</sup> mice were increased at time points towards the end of the light cycle (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Consistently, the isolated EWATs from both genotypes displayed similar basal OCR, however, PDZ-RhoGEF-deficient EWATs reached a higher maximal OCR than the wild types upon the injection of carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP), indicating greater maximal respiratory capacity (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Further, PDZ-RhoGEF<sup>-/-</sup> EWATs displayed a higher extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), suggesting their preference for using glucose as a primary energy source (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>In the liver, glucose transport is glucose level-dependent. As a surrogate measure of glucose transport capacity in the liver, we examined the glucose-dependent gene expression of glucose transporter 2 (Glut2) and carbohydrate response binding protein (ChREBP), two molecules involved in glucose transport and glucose-dependent induction of glycolytic and lipogenic enzyme gene</p><p>expression, respectively. Neither ChREBP nor Glut2 gene expression were affected in the PDZ-RhoGEF<sup>-/-</sup> livers (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that PDZ-RhoGEF had no effect on glucose utilization in liver.</p><p>In the muscle, we have previously shown that the deletion of PDZ-RhoGEF had no effect on insulin-dependent glucose transport in the skeletal muscle under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Skeletal muscles regulate glucose transport through both insulin-dependent and insulin-independent mechanisms (exercise/skeletal muscle contractility) (Richter and Hargreaves, 2013). An increase in physical activity found in PDZ-RhoGEF<sup>-/-</sup> mice (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>) may impact contractility-mediated glucose transport and in turn increase the use of carbohydrates as energy source.</p><p>Taken together, this new data further support the notion that increased RER is a consequence of preferential use of glucose as an energy source in PDZ- RhoGEF<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The revised text was amended to reflect the new data.</p><p><italic>4) Similarly, with HFD, there are changes in EDL glucose uptake and lipid accumulation in the liver, making it unclear what contribution the changes in metabolism in these tissues have to phenotype of the mice. More metabolic analyses should be performed in these tissues, as the reduced adiposity may not be the major factor accounting for improved insulin sensitivity. Although fat accumulation in the liver may be a consequence of the changes in the fat, this may not necessarily be the case. It is hard to make any conclusions because there is not much studied in the livers regarding their metabolism. It is also unclear how glucose uptake is being altered in the EDL since PDZ-RhoGEF is not detected in this tissue (unless the levels are increased after HFD?) – this suggests there may be crosstalk occurring, which should be acknowledged in the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We performed further glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver analyses on our mice on HFD. In wild type livers on HFD, but not those from PDZ-RhoGEF<sup>-/-</sup> mice on the same diet, mRNA levels of diglyceride acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), an enzyme that participates in triglyceride synthesis were increased (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) as were the mRNA levels of glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase), a key enzyme involved in the final step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), suggesting that increased glucose level and lipid accumulation in wild type mice on HFD may be partly due to elevated hepatic glucose production (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the EDL, we expanded our analysis of PDZ-RhoGEF in wild type mice on HFD. Under normal conditions, compared to EWAT and liver, the levels of PDZ-RhoGEF are considerably lower in white skeletal muscle, such as the EDL. Nevertheless, similar to EWAT, PDZ-RhoGEF protein levels in wild type animals were elevated in the liver and the EDL after prolonged HFD, accompanied by increased T389 phosphorylation of p70S6K (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>The revised text was amended to reflect the new data.</p><p><italic>5) Several conclusions appear to be drawn based on data that is not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3–figure supplement 4B</xref>) or that lacks sufficient sample size (sample size of only 1 or 2 is insufficient). Please add additional data or amend conclusions.</italic> </p><p>The original analysis displayed absolute numbers from a representative experiment. We have now recalculated the data using relative measures of proliferation upon PDZ-RhoGEF expression (necessitated by variable thymidine uptake from experiment to experiment) from three independent experiments (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Moreover, we have also explored 3T3L1 proliferation when PDZ-RhoGEF is knocked down. Judging by total cell counts and BrdU incorporation, decrease in PDZ-RhoGEF protein levels impaired both full media and insulin-stimulated proliferative capacity of 3T3-L1 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>, corroborating our previous results.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The authors have added new experiments to address the role of adipocyte progenitor cell proliferation in the phenotype of the PDZ-RhoGEF KO mice; however, the most specific assays (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) are limited to effects in culture, and it remains possible that the in vivo phenotype could relate to effects in mature cells as well. Please edit the text to tone down the conclusion regarding the role of adipocyte precursor cell proliferation, and add to the Discussion explicit consideration that PDZ-RhoGEF may act on multiple cell types including precursor cells, mature adipocytes or other cell types to influence adipose tissue development and homeostasis. No new experiments are requested – this is merely a text edit to provide clarity for readers that a more detailed study of adipose precursor cells in this context is warranted.</italic></p><p>In response to the request to tone down the assertions regarding the impact of PDZRhoGEF on adipocyte progenitors only, we have deleted the second half of the sentence in the subsection “Reduction of adipocyte and adipocyte progenitor abundance in PDZ- RhoGEF KO EWATs” – “PDZ-RhoGEF KO EWAT displayed fewer BrdUretaining cells than the wild type EWAT, indicative of impaired proliferation during early adipose tissue development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>)” – to read “PDZ-RhoGEF KO EWAT displayed fewer BrdU-retaining cells than the wild type EWAT, indicative of impaired proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>)”. The text of the Discussion was also amended to include this sentence: “Of note, PDZ-RhoGEF may also act on mature adipocytes or other cell types to influence adipose tissue development and homeostasis”. As there are no other sections in which we relate PDZRhoGEF to the adipose precursors, we trust that this satisfies the request by the reviewers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
