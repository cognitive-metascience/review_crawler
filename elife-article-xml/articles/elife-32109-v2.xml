with this function contributes to tissue-specific autoimmunity. Gain of HDAC7 function in thymocytes blocks both negative selection and NKT development, and diverts Vα14/Jα18 TCR transgenic thymocytes into a Tconv-like lineage. Conversely, HDAC7 deletion promotes thymocyte apoptosis and causes expansion of innate-effector cells. Investigating the mechanisms involved, we found that HDAC7 binds PLZF and modulates PLZF-dependent transcription. Moreover, HDAC7 and many of its transcriptional targets are human risk loci for IBD and PSC, autoimmune diseases that strikingly resemble the disease we observe in HDAC7 gain-of-function in mice. Importantly, reconstitution of iNKT cells in these mice mitigated their disease, suggesting that the combined defects in negative selection and iNKT cells due to altered HDAC7 function can cause tissue-restricted autoimmunity, a finding that may explain the association between HDAC7 and hepatobiliary autoimmunity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32109.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To protect us, our immune system must walk a narrow line: while it eliminates all external threats, it also has to refrain from attacking the healthy tissues of our body.

For thymocytes destined to become conventional naïve CD4 or CD8 T cells (Tconv), this requires passing two key checkpoints: positive selection, in which cortical CD4/CD8 double-positive (DP) thymocytes must receive a minimum level of TCR stimulation from self peptide-MHC complexes in order to adopt the appropriate lineage and continue maturation, and negative selection, in which thymocytes with self-reactivity above a critical threshold are deleted from the repertoire by activation-induced apoptosis. While the elucidation of these mechanisms decades ago established a basic conceptual framework for the creation of a competent and self-tolerant T cell repertoire, the years since have brought to light an ever-increasing variety of alternate developmental programs that produce specialized populations of mature T cells functionally distinct from Tconv. These populations, critical for both effective host defense and self-tolerance, are elicited from the diverse pool of T cell precursors by specialized selection mechanisms, mostly involving strong recognition of noncanonical ligands, as in the case of NKT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kronenberg, 2014</xref>), or recognition of peptide-MHC ligands at high TCR avidities near the threshold of negative selection, as in the case of nTreg or CD8αα IEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moran et al., 2011</xref>). The TCR signals involved in their development are generally stronger than those that mediate positive selection to the Tconv lineage, and the process is thus termed agonist selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stritesky et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>One feature that distinguishes many of these specialized cell types from Tconv is the thymic acquisition of constitutive effector function, a phenotype shared with innate immune cells and thus giving rise to the term ‘innate-like’ or ‘innate effector’ T cells. Whereas Tconv exit the thymus with a naive phenotype, circulate broadly, and require a several days long, orchestrated process of priming and clonal expansion to become fully functional effector/memory cells, innate-like T cells are often constitutively tissue-resident and make mature effector responses to their cognate stimuli immediately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kang and Malhotra, 2015</xref>). Innate-like T cells exit the thymus larger than Tconv, with an antigen-experienced phenotype and an expanded secretory apparatus, allowing them to rapidly elaborate robust cytokine responses after brief TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kang and Malhotra, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chandra and Kronenberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brennan et al., 2013</xref>). These differences arise due an alternative thymic maturation process that parallels the priming of naïve T-cells in the periphery. For NKT cells, this includes a ~ 100 fold intra-thymic proliferative expansion to generate pre-established clonal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benlagha et al., 2002</xref>). Maintenance of the innate effector phenotype in NKT cells can at least partially be attributed to stable expression of their signature transcription factor Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein (PLZF, ZBTB16) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kovalovsky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Savage et al., 2008</xref>). PLZF expression is established during thymic development of NKT cells, via a cellular mechanism that involves strong recognition of glycolipid ligands on the non-canonical CD1D MHC molecule by a clonally restricted (in mice, Vα14/Jα18 with one of several possible β chains) TCR, together with homotypic co-stimulation through the SAP family of co-receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bendelac et al., 2007</xref>). However, what downstream factors link these surface signals to stable PLZF expression and what other pathways may be involved are still open questions.</p><p>We have previously described how Tconv development is regulated by the class IIA histone deacetylase Histone Deacetylase 7 (HDAC7), a TCR signal-regulated corepressor abundantly expressed in thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dequiedt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kasler and Verdin, 2007</xref>). The activity of HDAC7 is controlled by nuclear exclusion in response to phosphorylation of conserved serine residues in their N-terminal adapter domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Verdin et al., 2003</xref>). In thymocytes, TCR stimulation results in HDAC7 phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion via Protein Kinase D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parra et al., 2005</xref>). CD4/CD8 double-positive (DP) thymocytes lacking HDAC7 are much more likely than WT thymocytes to die before becoming positively selected, significantly impeding their development into mature Tconv (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasler et al., 2011</xref>). Conversely, if a transgene encoding a phosphorylation-deficient, constitutively nuclear version of human HDAC7 (HDAC7-ΔP) is transiently expressed in the thymus at sub-endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kasler et al., 2012</xref>), deletion of autoreactive thymocytes by negative selection is strongly blocked and the hosts develop lethal autoimmunity. Consistent with broad blockade of negative selection, we observed autoantibodies to a comprehensive array of tissue antigens in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kasler et al., 2012</xref>). However, for reasons that were not clear to us at the time actual tissue destruction occurred almost exclusively in a gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary compartment that is anatomically tied together by the contiguous epithelial surfaces of the GI lumen and the pancreatic and biliary ductal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kasler et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The potential significance of this peculiar pattern of HDAC7-mediated autoimmunity for human disease has recently been brought into sharp focus by two separate studies identifying polymorphisms at the loci of HDAC7 as well as several of its upstream regulatory kinases as independent risk factors in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and also in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a destructive autoimmune syndrome of the hepatobiliary system, which is additionally associated with increased IBD risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jostins et al., 2012</xref>). The striking parallel between these human syndromes and the autoimmunity observed in HDAC7-ΔP transgenic mice suggested to us a connection between HDAC7 and these types of autoimmunity that goes beyond simply blocking thymic negative selection. This led us to undertake a more thorough phenotypic characterization of mice with altered HDAC7 function during T cell development, revealing that HDAC7 has a key role in the regulation of the innate effector programming of iNKT cells, at least in part via direct modulation of the transcriptional activity of PLZF. Both gain and loss of HDAC7 function in thymocytes resulted in aberrant effector programming of T cells in both the Tconv and innate-like lineages, leading to multiple abnormalities in peripheral populations. These studies shed new light on the molecular pathways that regulate the effector programming of innate-like T cells, reveal a new key molecular target of HDAC7 in T cell development, and set forth a novel cellular model of tissue-specific autoimmunity, in which one genetic lesion mediates multiple defects in thymic selection, which then converge in the periphery to produce a unique, tissue-restricted pattern of disease. Given the established genetic association between <italic>HDAC7</italic> variants and very similar human syndromes, our findings are likely to be of considerable significance in the understanding of these diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Alteration of HDAC7 function dysregulates thymic innate effector programming and interferes with iNKT development</title><p>We previously showed that if a constitutively nuclear mutant of human HDAC7 (HDAC7-ΔP) is transiently expressed at normal levels during thymic T cell development but not in mature T cells, autoreactive cells that would normally die by negative selection instead exit the thymus as naïve Tconv (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kasler et al., 2012</xref>). However in our previous study we did not assess the fates of most cells destined to become innate effectors. Analyzing these populations, we noted a modest suppression of Treg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kasler et al., 2012</xref>) and CD8αα IEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but the most striking observation we made was the near total absence of invariant Natural Killer T cells (iNKT), an oligoclonal population that is reactive to α-galactosyl ceramide (αGalCer) presented by the CD1D non-canonical MHC molecule (CD1D/αGalCer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kronenberg, 2014</xref>). Cells positive for staining with CD1D/αGalCer tetramers represent approximately 3% of TCRβ-positive cells in wild type C57BL/6 (B6) thymus and 30% in liver, however they are nearly undetectable in either of these tissues or in the spleens or livers of HDAC7-ΔP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, for full gating see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting a profound deficiency in iNKT development.

Examining these stages after ~20 fold enrichment of iNKT cells using tetramer and magnetic beads, we noted the same pattern, with all populations other than CD24 <sup>hi</sup> /CD44<sup>lo</sup>/NK1.1<sup>-</sup> cells being highly underrepresented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). These results are consistent with either a developmental block before Stage one or a severe defect in the survival or normal proliferation of iNKT cells from Stage one onwards. We also evaluated the prevalence of CD44/NK1.1-expressing T cells that were not tetramer-reactive, and noted a marked reduction in their numbers in liver and spleen as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>), suggesting a broad defect in the development of the NKT lineage.</p><p>To rule out cell-extrinsic mechanisms for this phenotype, we generated mixed hematopoietic chimeras reconstituted with a 1:1 mixture of wild-type (WT) and HDAC7-ΔP bone marrow. As we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kasler et al., 2012</xref>), the HDAC7-ΔP transgenic population contributed robustly to the pool of CD4 and CD8 SP thymocytes, although there was a transient reduction in prevalence at the immature single positive (ISP) stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). At early time points post-reconstitution (6-8wk), the distributions of naïve and memory T-cells in peripheral CD4 +and CD8+Tconv subsets were equivalent as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). However, while the wild type-derived population reconstituted hepatic iNKT cells efficiently, HDAC7-ΔP bone marrow made almost no contribution to this compartment in the liver, where iNKT cells are most abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This was also true in the thymus and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), demonstrating that the abnormalities observed in the intact transgenic mice were due to a cell-autonomous mechanism.</p><p>We next examined the effects of loss of HDAC7 in the thymus on these phenotypes, using our previously characterized strain that deletes loxp-flanked <italic>Hdac7</italic> under the control of the <italic>Lck</italic> proximal promoter (<italic>Hdac7<sup>flox:/:-</sup>::lck<sup>cre</sup></italic>, henceforth <italic>Hdac7-KO</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasler et al., 2011</xref>). We previously reported that loss of HDAC7 during T cell development increased apoptosis of DP thymocytes leading to inefficient positive selection. This shortened thymocyte lifespan resulted in a truncation of the TCR Jα repertoire, with distal rearrangements underrepresented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasler et al., 2011</xref>). It was thus not surprising to find that <italic>Hdac7-KO</italic> mice with an endogenous TCR repertoire had fewer iNKT cells than WT controls; for example, <italic>Hdac7-KO</italic> thymus had a 2–5 fold lower abundance of iNKT cells than WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This reduction, consistent with the degree of underrepresentation of the relatively distal Jα18 TCR segment we previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasler et al., 2011</xref>), was similarly observed in the spleen and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

We observed a much more modest degree of abnormality in the CD4 compartment, comprising a 20–30% increase in the frequency of memory and IL4-secreting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>), which we hypothesize is due to the greater similarity that CD8 thymic selection bears to NKT selection, in terms of both the similarity of CD1D to Class I MHC and the availability of selecting ligands on all thymocytes rather than just on specialized thymic APC. Loss of HDAC7 may thus allow some DP thymocytes to aberrantly adopt this lineage through some partial analogue of NKT selection. Collectively, our findings with both the <italic>Hdac7-KO</italic> and HDAC7-ΔP transgenic strains suggest that HDAC7 may function as a gatekeeper of innate effector programming, blocking the functional maturation of iNKT cells when constitutively expressed in the nucleus, and conversely allowing the aberrant acquisition of innate effector characteristics in Conventional T cells when it is conditionally deleted.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>HDAC7 regulates the effector programming of NKT cells in a manner that mirrors the function of PLZF</title><p>To generate a larger population of iNKT precursors for more in-depth evaluation the role of HDAC7, we employed the Vα14-Jα18 TCRα transgene (henceforth ‘Vα14’), encoding the invariant TCRα chain that when paired with the appropriate endogenous β chains allows iNKT cells to bind glycolipids with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griewank et al., 2007</xref>). Expressing this TCR transgene greatly increases the frequency of CD1D/αGalCer-reactive thymocytes, which arise naturally only at only around 1 in 10<sup>4</sup> cells. As expected, mice expressing only the Vα14 transgene had many more iNKT cells in thymus and spleen than WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Also consistent with our expectations, when we crossed the Vα14 TCRα transgene into the <italic>Hdac7-KO</italic> strain, we observed a complete rescue of iNKT cell abundance in the thymus and periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), resulting in identical numbers between Vα14 and Vα14 <italic>Hdac7-KO</italic> mice. These cells were phenotypically similar to Vα14 iNKT cells in terms of CD44/NK1.1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, bottom), suggesting that shortened thymocyte lifespan was indeed the main cause of the reduced iNKT abundance in <italic>Hdac7-KO</italic> mice.</p><p>In contrast to this finding, when the Vα14 transgene was co-expressed with HDAC7-ΔP, the rescue in the numbers of CD1D/αGalCer-reactive cells was incomplete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and the cells were phenotypically abnormal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–F</xref>). This result suggests that rather than blocking the maturation of CD1D/αGalCer-reactive cells categorically, HDAC7-ΔP blocked one or more steps normally associated with post-positive selection iNKT differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benlagha et al., 2002</xref>), directing the cells instead to mature as if they were positively selected Tconv. Consistent with this idea, other characteristics of CD1D/αGalCer-reactive Vα14 x HDAC7-ΔP T cells were similar to those of naïve Tconv. Flow analysis revealed that like the residual tetramer-reactive cells present in the HDAC7-ΔP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) the rescued iNKT cells in Vα14 x HDAC7-ΔP mice failed to upregulate the memory marker CD44 or the NKT marker NK1.1 in the thymus like their Vα14-only counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, top row), although they did downregulate CD24 nearly as efficiently as Vα14 iNKT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that they were able to mature to stage 1. This phenotype persisted in the spleen, after the HDAC7-ΔP transgene was turned off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, bottom row), suggesting that the cells had failed to complete effector programming in the thymus.</p><p>We next examined their cytokine responses to brief ex-vivo stimulation. When stimulated for 4 hr with PMA/ionomycin, CD1D/αGalCer-reactive WT and Vα14 transgenic iNKT cells exhibited a robust cytokine response, secreting both IFNγ and IL-4. In contrast, Vα14 x HDAC7-ΔP iNKT were far less likely to make IFNγ or IL-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), as would be expected for naïve Tconv. Additionally, iNKT cells typically express high levels of the integrin LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), allowing them to remain localized in tissue-specific vascular beds such as hepatic sinusoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thomas et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, Vα14 x HDAC7-ΔP iNKT cells exhibited far lower expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>), comparable to those seen in circulating non-CD1D/αGalCer-reactive CD4+ (mainly naïve) T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, right). Moreover, while Vα14 x HDAC7-ΔP iNKT cells were found at comparable frequency in spleen to WT iNKT cells, they failed to concentrate in peripheral tissues such as the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>), a behavior more characteristic of naïve Tconv rather than iNKT cells. These data are most consistent with a model in which HDAC7-ΔP prevents iNKT precursors from initiating innate effector development: Since Vα14 x HDAC7-ΔP iNKT cells have low CD44 expression, produce few cytokines after brief stimulation, and freely recirculate, they appear to become diverted into functionally naïve-like T-cells.</p><p>When considering how both gain and loss of thymic HDAC7 function alter innate effector development, we were struck by how closely our results mirrored findings reported in similar studies of the transcription factor PLZF. Specifically, the severe depletion of iNKT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and loss of effector memory phenotype in peripheral iNKT cells observed in gain-of-function HDAC7-ΔP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) strongly resembles the iNKT defect observed in PLZF knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kovalovsky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Savage et al., 2008</xref>).

Indeed, we observed a pronounced reduction in PLZF expression in TCRβ+T cells from HDAC7-ΔP mice in all organs examined, including thymus, spleen and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). However, PLZF was still detected in CD4 +SP thymocytes from Vα14 x HDAC7-ΔP mice; although expression was restricted compared to Vα14-only thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), Interestingly, PLZF expression was maintained in roughly half of splenic Vα14 x HDAC7-ΔP iNKT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, right panel). Thus, transcriptional repression of PLZF expression by HDAC7 is probably insufficient to fully explain the iNKT phenotype, as even PLZF +Vα14 x HDAC7-ΔP iNKT cells exhibit naïve-like characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>HDAC7 and PLZF inversely regulate a shared innate effector gene network that is highly relevant to autoimmune disease</title><p>The remarkable inverse relationship between the phenotypes mediated by alterations of HDAC7 and PLZF function in iNKT cell development prompted us to take an unbiased, genome-wide approach to understanding how these two factors might coordinately regulate the transcriptional landscape of this process. To this end, we generated gene expression profiles by RNA-seq of PBS-57 tetramer-reactive Vα14 Tg and Vα14 X HDAC7-ΔP Tg thymocytes and splenocytes, as well as polyclonal naïve (i.e. CD44<sup>-</sup>) conventional CD4 SP thymocytes and splenocytes. Differential gene expression profiles were constructed for Vα14 Tg vs. naïve Tconv, Vα14 X HDAC7-ΔP Tg vs naïve Tconv, and Vα14 X HDAC7-ΔP vs. Vα14 Tg, by comparing the normalized scalar expression values for three biological replicates of each condition, based on roughly 40 million mapped reads per sample (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Materials and methods). When we plotted significant expression changes for tetramer-reactive Vα14 Tg cell vs. Tconv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, left and right panels, horizontal axes) against the corresponding changes for Vα14 X HDAC7-ΔP vs Tconv (vertical axes), it was evident in both thymus and spleen that HDAC7-ΔP makes the overall gene expression pattern of tetramer-reactive cells more similar to that of Tconv, as shown by the clockwise shift of the plot trend line from the diagonal in both tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, solid plot diagonal vs. dotted trend line). Reflecting this effect, iNKT development-associated gene expression changes (both up and down) that were suppressed by HDAC7-ΔP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, green plot points and numbers) greatly outnumbered those enhanced by HDAC7-ΔP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, red plot points and numbers) in both spleen and thymus.

Blocking HDAC7 nuclear export in the thymus thus apparently programs a more naïve-like state of differentiation into tetramer-reactive cells that persists even after HDAC7-mediated repression is removed. Although some of the changes in gene expression that we observe, especially in the spleen, may be due to the different population distributions with respect to conventional iNKT staging that were sampled between the Vα14 Tg and Vα14 X HDAC7-ΔP tetramer-reactive cells, for many of the genes we identified (e.g. Hobit, T-bet, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), the magnitude of the suppression, i.e. lower than in the WT cells, is still greater than could be accounted for by this explanation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32109.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>HDAC7 Regulates a Cassette of Genes in Glycolipid-Reactive Cells That is Highly Relevant to Innate Effector Function, Inflammation, Autoimmunity, and Autoimmune Liver Disease.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scatter charts showing gene expression changes in Cd1d/αGalCer-reactive Vα14 Tg (X axis) and Vα14 X HDAC7-ΔP Tg (Y axis) thymocytes (left) or CD4 splenocytes (right) vs naïve CD4SP thymocytes or splenocytes, respectively.

Genes that were found to associate directly with PLZF by chIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mao et al., 2016</xref>), cluster strongly around the HDAC7-PLZF diagonals, and are highly concentrated among the most negatively correlated genes in terms of the effects of HDAC7 vs. PLZF function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>, labeled genes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, red asterisks). Out of the 31 genes reported by Mao, et al. to be both bound by PLZF and differentially expressed in iNKT cells due to alteration of PLZF function, 17 were found on the PLZF-HDAC7 inverse diagonals and only four on the positive diagonals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>, labeled genes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, red asterisks). An additional four genes were negatively correlated with HDAC7 function but not differentially expressed during iNKT development (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), while one was positively correlated. Additionally, Mao, et al. identified BACH2 as a crucial interaction partner of PLZF, and our own data show BACH2 as not differentially expressed but nonetheless as one of the strongest putative upstream regulators of the HDAC7-regulated gene set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that HDAC7 may modulate its targets via a ternary interaction with PLZF. This remarkable degree of overlap strongly supports the idea that HDAC7 is a negative regulator of iNKT cell development that functions at least in part by negatively regulating PLZF-dependent transcription.</p><p>Ontologic analysis of HDAC7-regulated genes using IPA provided strong evidence for their association with both innate-like effector function and inflammatory disease. Canonical pathways associated with the HDAC7-regulated gene set included multiple pathways associated with innate immune signaling and T cell effector function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>, green-shaded pathways, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for a complete list of pathways and associated genes), as well as with inflammation and inflammatory disease states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, blue-shaded pathways), particularly hepatic inflammation. This connection was brought into even sharper relief by two recent GWAS studies of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which both identified HDAC7 among the disease-associated loci, and also individually its immediate upstream kinases PKD and SIK2, as well as two isoforms of PKC that are upstream of PKD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jostins et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, a remarkably high proportion of the other hits from these studies are downstream of HDAC7, i.e. their expression in iNKT cells is altered by HDAC7-ΔP. Of the 176 GWAS risk loci mapping to genes that were expressed in our RNA-seq data, 81 (46%) were regulated by HDAC7 in NKT cells, a much higher degree of overlap than would be expected by chance (p=3.49×10<sup>−16</sup>, binomial distribution) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Remarkably, all but 13 of these genes could be mapped to one of five interconnected signaling networks, comprising Th1 and Th2 cytokine signaling, chemokine signaling, TCR signaling with its associated costimulatory pathways, and signaling through cell membrane-associated TNF superfamily members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, dark-colored symbols with white label, gray-shaded areas).</p><p>These signaling networks are also heavily populated with HDAC7 targets that were not identified in the GWAS studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, light-colored symbols), an observation that is confirmed by IPA analysis of canonical signaling pathways and upstream regulators among HDAC7 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). In nearly all cases, HDAC7 regulates these targets in a manner opposite to their regulation during iNKT cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, symbol border vs. fill colors). This regulation by HDAC7 by clearly suppresses downstream signaling in all cases except for TNF superfamily costimulatory signaling, which is mostly potentiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, color of arrows per legend). Consistent with our phenotypic findings, nearly half of these genes have positive roles in NK/NKT development/function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), showing that HDAC7 broadly suppresses several key signaling pathways that are highly important in both NKT cells and in human autoimmune diseases that are similar to the pathology observed in HDAC7-ΔP transgenic mice. This remarkable concordance strongly supports the idea that the role of HDAC7 in these cells is involved in the pathogenesis of PSC and IBD, and identifies a few key signaling pathways as candidates for further interrogation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>HDAC7 physically binds to PLZF and modulates its transcriptional activity</title><p>HDAC7 is a class IIA histone deacetylase that lacks intrinsic DNA binding capacity and requires binding to target transcription factors to modulate transcription at specific loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang and Seto, 2008</xref>).

Analysis of the PLZF deletions identified a region from residues 320–450, encompassing a proline-rich tract and the first two zinc finger domains, as critical for interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>Although the precise mode of transcriptional regulation by PLZF remains unclear, with different domains exhibiting activating and repressive activity in varying contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sadler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Puszyk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Melnick et al., 2002</xref>), we next wanted to examine if HDAC7 physical binding to PLZF could modulate its transcriptional activity. We transfected 293 T cells with fusions of the GAL4 DNA binding domain (residues 1–142) to full-length PLZF, an HDAC7-interacting mutant of PLZF (1-460), or a non-interacting mutant (1-318), together with a SV40 minimal promoter-Gal4(5)-firefly luciferase reporter and an EF-1α promoter-driven <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 71</xref> for a diagram). To these constructs were added empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, light blue bars), a vector encoding full-length HDAC7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, dark blue bars), or one encoding a fusion of the HDAC7 1–497 interacting domain with the VP16 transcriptional activation domain (HDAC7-VP16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, medium blue bars). Measurement of luciferase activity in lysates from these cells showed that co-transfection of FL HDAC7 with FL PLZF or the 1–460 truncation reduced transcription from the Gal4-luc construct, while it did not affect transcription when co-transfected with the non-interacting 1–318 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Conversely, HDAC7-VP16 increased transcription from the interacting PLZF constructs but not the non-interacting one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). These experiments, together with our characterization of the HDAC7-PLZF interaction and transcriptional targets above, provide strong evidence that in thymocytes HDAC7 regulates PLZF in the same manner as MEF2 and other transcription factors, functioning as a TCR signal-dependent co-repressor that helps to silence PLZF-associated promoters in the absence of appropriate signals. This mechanism is likely to account for at least part of the effect of HDAC7 on iNKT cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Restoring iNKT cells ameliorates Tissue-Specific autoimmunity</title><p>We earlier reported that HDAC7-ΔP mice develop spontaneous tissue-specific autoimmunity, with about 80% developing obliterative exocrine pancreatitis and concomitant T-cell infiltration in stomach, liver and small intestine within eight months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kasler et al., 2012</xref>). Although this had been previously attributed solely to a defect in negative selection of conventional thymocytes, the striking absence of iNKT cells in HDAC7-ΔP mice spurred us to consider whether disrupted innate effector development might also contribute to this autoimmune syndrome. Indeed, the very tissues vulnerable to T-cell infiltration in HDAC7-ΔP mice, notably the small intestine, liver and hepatobiliary mucosa, are typically populated by PLZF-dependent innate effectors such as iNKT and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan and Rudensky, 2016</xref>). We thus set out to determine if restoring iNKT cells could alter the course of HDAC7-ΔP–induced autoimmunity.</p><p>In our earlier studies, we found that that HDAC7-ΔP-mediated autoimmunity is dominantly transferable in mixed BM chimeras if a 5-fold excess of HDAC7-ΔP-derived bone marrow is used.

We demonstrate here that the epigenetic regulator HDAC7 serves as a gatekeeper of this developmental fate decision in the thymus. When HDAC7 is prevented from releasing its genomic targets in response to TCR stimulation, PLZF-dependent innate effector development appears to be blocked, and iNKT cells appear to become diverted to a naïve-like fate, characterized by lack of expression of memory or NK markers and a failure to produce effector cytokines. Conversely when HDAC7 function is lost, naïve development is reduced, more thymocytes develop as EOMES-expressing CD8 innate effectors, and the fraction of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing memory markers and primed for cytokine production increases. Thus, appropriately regulated nuclear export of HDAC7 appears to be a licensing step that permits both negative selection and the acquisition of alternative cell fates, such as PLZF-dependent agonist selection to the iNKT lineage.</p><p>In this study, we focused on iNKT cells due to their relatively high abundance and easy identification using CD1D tetramers, but we suspect that HDAC7-ΔP similarly abrogates development of other PLZF-dependent innate effector subtypes, including rare MR1-restricted MAIT cells and γδ NKT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chandra and Kronenberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan and Rudensky, 2016</xref>). In contrast, another well-described innate effector type, CD8αα + IELs localized in small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mayans et al., 2014</xref>), are only slightly reduced in HDAC7-ΔP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), consistent with their PLZF-independent derivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheroutre et al., 2011</xref>). The identification of a committed precursor to innate lymphoid cells that transiently expresses high amounts of PLZF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Constantinides et al., 2014</xref>) also raises the intriguing possibility that development of these cell types may be regulated by class IIA HDACs as well. Furthermore, the main mechanism of action we investigate here, HDAC7 antagonism of PLZF via direct interaction, may be generalizable to other members of the BTB-POZ-ZF family. For example, the signature transcription factor of Tfh cells, Bcl6, is known to associate with HDAC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lemercier et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crotty, 2014</xref>). A class IIA HDAC/BTB-ZF axis may thus regulate T cell or ILC development at additional branch points. Additionally, in recent years a number of transcriptional regulators and epigenetic modifiers – including JARID2, NKAP, HDAC3, and EZH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thapa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dobenecker et al., 2015</xref>) – have been identified that regulate iNKT ontogeny. At least one member, HDAC3, physically associates with class IIA HDACs as part of a larger co-repressive complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fischle et al., 2002</xref>). Devising systems to investigate these relationships as well as HDAC7 association with PLZF via ChiP-Seq and other genomic-scale approaches is a current priority in our laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>HDAC7 control of iNKT cell development modulates the susceptibility of liver to autoimmune attack</title><p>By restoring the missing iNKT population with the use of Vα14 donor bone marrow, we significantly attenuated the severity and time course of HDAC7-ΔP-mediated autoimmune liver disease, resulting in improved liver function, better body weight maintenance, and reduced overall mortality. Although specific rescue of iNKT cells did not provide protection in all tissues – almost all Vα14: HDAC7-ΔP chimeras eventually developed the same ultimately lethal exocrine pancreatitis as WT: HDAC7-ΔP chimeras – our studies nonetheless reveal an important new role for impaired iNKT development as an exacerbating factor in liver autoimmunity. Since both HDAC7 and PLZF influence the development of several non-iNKT innate effector subtypes that would not have been restored with Vα14 bone marrow, it is tempting to speculate that restoring these other subsets might ameliorate tissue destruction and T-cell infiltration due to HDAC7-ΔP in other organs.</p><p>Innate effector T-cells are often considered frontline first-responders to infection that amplify and orchestrate the early immune response to invading pathogens. Thus, it was somewhat surprising to uncover a protective or anti-inflammatory role for iNKT cells in attenuating tissue destruction. Additional studies will be required to uncover the mechanisms through which iNKT cells provide protection, but for now we favor a model in which innate effectors occupy tissue niches at their sites of residence, limiting access of other immune cells into those sites. Alternatively, the loss of iNKT cells in these tissues may compromise normal mucosal barrier function in a manner that promotes inflammation and the subsequent recruitment of autoreactive Tconv. In HDAC7-ΔP mice, escape of autoreactive Tconv due to impaired negative selection may thus produce a potentially but not necessarily pathogenic population, which requires the additional loss of PLZF-dependent innate effectors from their target tissues to create an opening for infiltration. This ‘two-hit’ model may explain multiple types of tissue-specific autoimmunity, in which genetic lesions that generate excess self-reactive lymphocytes are coupled with separate or related defects in tissue-resident innate effector populations at specific sites, rendering these tissues particularly vulnerable to attack.</p><p>Our findings likely hold considerable relevance to understanding the etiology and mechanisms contributing to some types of human autoimmunity. Indeed, common variant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HDAC7 gene are significantly associated with human autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases, namely primary sclerosing cholangitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>) and inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jostins et al., 2012</xref>). Additional common variant SNPs in kinases known to export Class IIA HDACs via phosphorylation, including SIK2 and PRKD2, are also associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting aberrant regulation of HDAC7 nuclear export as a causative mechanism. Moreover, the genes that we identified as regulated by HDAC7 in iNKT development show a striking overlap with other risk loci from these GWAS studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that the broad HDAC7 regulatory network may be a crucial nexus that underlies susceptibility to several autoimmune diseases of considerable clinical importance. Indeed, mapping the overlapping GWAS loci to their associated signaling networks revealed a remarkable clustering around a few important signaling pathways in iNKT and effector development, including IL12, IL21, IL18, IFNG, and IL4, as well as Ig- and TNF-superfamily costimulatory pathways. Deciphering the complex relationship between HDAC7, PLZF and other HDAC7 interaction partners, the observed modulation of these pathways, and the resulting cellular and pathologic phenotypes will be a major task for us going forward. We hope that this effort will illuminate the way forward in translating our finding that reestablishing missing iNKT cells can ameliorate HDAC7-mediated hepatic autoimmunity into potential therapeutic modalities for the analogous human diseases, based on the restoration of innate effector function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Histone Deacetylase 7 (HDAC7)</td><td>NA</td><td>HDAC7</td><td>Coding sequence used for HDAC7 expression constructs and the HDAC7-ΔP transgene.</td></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens)</italic></td><td>Promyelocytic Leukemia, Zinc Finger (PLZF)</td><td>NA</td><td>ZBTB16</td><td>Coding sequence used for PLZF expression constructs.</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57/BL6</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>Stock Number: 000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Boyj (B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ)</td><td>Jackson Laboratories;

The idea that HDAC7 might do this at least in part via interaction with PLZF arose from the review of older literature on these molecules showing they interact. The notion that the role of HDAC7 in iNKT cells has a bearing on the tissue distribution of autoimmunity due to altered HDAC7 function arose from the concordance between NKT-populated tissues and those showing disease in HDAC7-ΔP transgenic mice. This idea was highlighted in importance by the publication of GWAS studies after the initiation of our work that statistically associated HDAC7 and its regulatory network with human diseases affecting the same tissues. We investigated these questions using a combination of cell culture and transgenic mouse models in which the function of HDAC7 and/or PLZF was altered in thymocytes. Parameters measured include cellular abundance in different tissues, T cell effector function after ex-vivo stimulation, luciferase expression, protein-protein interactions, global transcript abundance, and various clinical measures associated with autoimmune disease, as detailed in the following sections.</p><p>With the exception of our RNA-seq study, which was done in one experiment using three biological replicates for each condition, all results depicted in this work are based on at least two completely independent trials, comprising at least three biological replicates, that is data from three separate animals of each genotype or from three separate transfections of reporter/expression constructs. Larger sample sizes than this were used as feasible, based on the availability of experimental genotypes of interest, prospective estimates of the statistical power required to show significance for effects of the magnitudes initially observed, and the constraints of time and resources required for analysis. No data that were collected were excluded from the study unless there was clear evidence of a technical failure in data collection, or in the case of the animal studies, morbidity/mortality that was clearly unrelated to the pathologic conditions under study.

Magnetic enrichment of iNKT cells from ~2×107 thymocytes was performed using APC-conjugated PBS-57 tetramers with the Easy-Sep (StemCell Technologies, Cambridge, MA) APC Positive Selection Kit, according to the package directions. Lymphocytes were prepared from liver by mincing of the tissue, straining through a 40 μm nylon mesh, and discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation. Intestinal intra-epithelial lymphocytes were prepared by extensive flushing of whole small intestines with cold PBS, excision of Peyer’s patches under magnification using a Trypan Blue-filled pipet as contrast medium, cutting into ~5 mm longitudinally opened segments, and incubation at 37<sup>◦</sup>C with rocking in PBS with 2 mM DTT and 5 mM EDTA for 30 min. IEL were then further purified from the dissociated epithelium by Percoll gradient centrifugation. For analysis of cytokine expression, cells were cultured for 4 hr post-isolation with 50 ng/ml PMA (MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO) plus 0.5 μM ionomycin (MIlliporeSigma) and for 1 hr with 0.5 μg/ml Brefeldin A (MilliporeSigma) prior to staining. Viability staining was performed for 15 min in the dark at room temperature using eFluor 520 or eFluor 780 fixable viability dyes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 1:1000 in PBS. Surface staining with CD1D tetramers and fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies was performed for 30 min on ice in PBS with 2% FCS, followed by either fixation in PBS/1% PFA or fixation/permeabilization with the eBioscience FOXP3 intracellular staining kit (Thermo Fisher). Intracellular staining for cytokines or transcription factors was performed for 1 hr on ice in eBioscience FOXP3 Perm/wash buffer. Analytical flow cytometry was performed using a BD (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) LSRII Cytek (Cytek Bioscinces, Fremont, CA) FACS Calibur DxP8 instrument.

They demonstrate a direct binding between HDAC7 and PLZF that affects PLZF transcriptional activity. Finally, through gene network analysis, they provide some tenuous link between target genes that have been linked in the autoimmunity that develops upon alteration of HDAC7 expression and genes that are affected by HDAC7 expression in iNKT cell development. They further test this idea by showing that restoring iNKT cells moderately ameliorates the tissue-specific autoimmunity that develop in HDAC7ΔP mice.</p><p>This is an interesting paper that clearly demonstrates an important role for HDAC7 in NKT cell development and function. My comments (below) are mostly technical and while they should be addressed and might slightly change the narrative of the manuscript, they will not change the overall message.</p><p>In Figure 1 (as well as several other figures in the manuscript), the various gates used for the analysis by flow cytometry seem to be placed freely. For example, the gate used to define the CD1d tetramer+ cells often incorporates cells that are TCR negative (Figure 1, Figure 3B, Figure 4). It would have been useful to stain with the control CD1d tetramer to ensure that the gated events are real NKT cells. While this reviewer agrees that it does not change the overall results (that NKT cells are affected by HDAC7), it can change the interpretation of certain results. For example, very few events corresponding to NKT cells are left in the HDAC7ΔP mice. By gating these events, it is concluded that the cells are very immature (CD44-, CD24+, NK1.1-) and blocked in their development. It would be worthwhile to verify that these very few events are real NKT cells.</p><p>Stage 0 NKT cells represent 300-1000 cells per thymus and are usually only visualized after magnetic bead enrichment of tetramer+ cells. These experiments were not carried out in that fashion here and the CD24+ cells would benefit from the examination of other markers to make sure that they represent the cells that the authors think they examine. To this end, stage 0 NKT cells are also CD69+ and Egr2+. Similarly, it is unclear to this reviewer why only 9% of the NKT cells in wildtype mice express NK1.1 (Figure 1C), while in B6 mice, the vast majority of these cells are in fact NK1.1+ (as seen in Figure 3C for example). Were all experiments performed with mice of the same age? Is it a parameter that matters?</p><p>In Figure 2, it is unclear why Figure 2B shows staining in the spleen while the other panels of the figures pertain to the thymus. Similarly to the previous comment, it is unclear why only 30% of the cells would be expressing NK1.1 in that tissue.</p><p>The development of &quot;innate&quot; CD8 T cells that are CD44+, CD122+, Eomes+ was reported to be dependent upon IL-4 signaling in the thymus. The source of IL-4 in the thymus is thought to be NKT2 and PLZF+ gd T cells. The presented experiments clearly demonstrate that the increased proportion of CD8<sup>+</sup> CD44+ Eomes+ in HDAC7ΔP mice is decoupled from an increased proportion of NKT2 cells. Did the author examine whether this was compensated by an increase proportion of gd PLZF+ T cells? (Figure 4 would argue that it is not although it was not formally tested). The author should also modify the text of the manuscript in that the &quot;innate&quot; programs that might be regulated by HDAC7 are not the same in CD8 and NKT cells. NKT cells do not express Eomes and CD8 T cells do not express PLZF so the statement that &quot;loss of HDAC7 results in the aberrant adoption of NKT-like innate effector programming&quot; is not correct.</p><p>NKT cell can adopt different fate in the thymus (NKT1, NKT2 and NKT17) that can be visualized by the expression of the various master transcription factors associated with the phenotype. It would have been interesting to stain NKT cells for Tbet, Rorgt in addition to PLZF. The expression of PLZF protein is essentially gone in HDAC7ΔP mice (Figure 4A), yet analysis of mRNA expression (Figure 5A) reveals a very modest loss of Zbtb16 mRNA expression. How do the authors reconcile these findings? Does HDAC7 binding to PLZF (Figure 7) leads to its degradation in vivo?</p><p>It is also unclear why gene expression in total NKT cells was examined in Figure 5, while it is clear from Figure 1 that the cells did not reach the same stage of development between WT and HDAC7ΔP mice. Thereby, finding differences in gene expression for genes that are acquired late in the development of NKT cells (NK1.1, Ly49, Tbet) is perhaps not surprising, but might be unrelated to HDAC7 direct activity. It would have been more interesting, perhaps, to test differential gene expression in CD44neg NK1.1- NKT cells between the two strains.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Kasler et al. analyzed the effects of Hdac7 gain of function or deletion on the immune system in mice. They tell an interesting story and weave their data with complementary studies of human autoimmunity arising from polymorphism of Hdac7 and its regulatory kinases. This makes for compelling reading and integration of current knowledge across several fields.</p><p>The paper begins with analysis of the effects of Hdac7 gain-of-function (GOF) or thymic deletion and basically shows that GOF leads to failure of iNKT development, whereas thymic deletion leads to certain thymic CD8 T cells developing features of innate effector (CD44hiEomes+) cells. The authors then bridge to consideration of Hdac7 as a negative regulator of the transcription factor, PLZF, typically stably expressed by iNKT cells.</p><p>The work has considerable rigor and interest, and is a sound and well performed study integrating aspects of molecular and cellular immunology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The main conclusion is that HDAC7 is critical for controlling whether T cells act like conventional naïve T cells or quickly reactive innate-type lymphocytes. However, there are several concerns and potential alternative interpretations.</p><p>Data is not shown regarding the conventional CD4 compartment in the periphery. They state &quot;We observe a much more modest degree of abnormality in the CD4 compartment (data not shown)&quot;. This data needs to be added to the Results and is necessary to assess their conclusions. If HDAC7ΔP does not alter the conv T cell compartment into a more innate like phenotype, does this alter the conclusions drawn?</p><p>Previously, the authors demonstrated that use of the HDAC7ΔP transgene inhibited negative selection of autoreactive thymocytes and that these mice developed lethal autoimmunity. Is the enhanced activation of T cells observed due to activation of autoreactive cells that otherwise would have been deleted? If these are autoreactive cells, then are they more innate like or the issue is that they are being activated and are thus not naïve? If the T cells with enhanced function are ones that would have been negatively selected, then is the primary cause the block in negative selection?</p><p>Another difficulty with this manuscript are conclusions 'consistent with the data', or 'suggesting that' without doing the experiments to demonstrate the mechanism. The authors interpret the failure of Va14 tg HDAC7ΔP NKT cells to produce cytokines as 'suggesting that the cells had failed to undergo effector programming in the thymus'. This should be examined by staining for NKT1/NKT2/NKT17 using Tbet/Gata3/RORγt. Total NKT are examined for cytokine production, but if there is a defect in differentiation of the NKT subsets, then each subset should be examined individually to determine whether (for example) there are few NKT1 cells that produce normal IFNγ or many NKT1 that fail to make IFNγ. In addition, the authors state that &quot;HDAC7ΔP blocked the intrathymic proliferation that is normally associated with post-positive selection iNKT differentiation&quot;. No experiments were performed to examine NKT proliferation after positive selection (e.g. BrdU). In addition, the loss of NKT cell at this stage could also be due another reason such as enhanced apoptosis, but this was not examined either.</p><p>&quot;modest suppression of Treg and CD8aa IELs (data not shown)&quot; should be added to the manuscript. CD8aa IELs are innate-like lymphocytes. If HDAC7ΔP expression leads to enhancement of innate functions, then why is this population decreased?</p><p>It is not clear that the HDAC7ΔP transgene is completely off in the periphery. In their prior manuscript originally describing this mouse, there is enhanced HDAC7 expression in peripheral T cells from HDAC7ΔP transgenic mice as compared to WT. Therefore, I would argue that their previous paper demonstrated that this transgene is not completed turned off in the periphery.</p><p>HDAC7ΔP mice have increased mature SP thymocytes – one common cause for an increase in mature SP thymocytes is a defect in thymic egress. Is there a defect in thymic egress in these mice? (KLF2, S1P1/receptor, CD69)</p><p>It is difficult to analyze the RNA-seq data presented, as the cells being examined are completely different: Vα14 (WT) NKT cells that have primarily differentiated into NKT1/NKT2/NKT17 effectors and Vα14 HDAC7ΔP NKTs that may not have differentiated into NKT1/NKT2/NKT17 effectors at all.</p><p>Empty tetramer control needs to be added to several figures, as it is not clear whether the signal observed with Tetramer/TCRβ (e.g. Figure 1) in HDAC7ΔP is above that of an empty tetramer control. If not, then further examination of this population by CD24/CD44/NK1.1 may be misleading, and the population should be examined to determine whether it expresses the canonical Vα14-Jα18 rearranged TCRα chain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32109.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although the manuscript had interesting information, there were a number of concerns that need to be addressed in a revised manuscript. Among the major issues (detailed in the complete reviews attached below) were:</p><p>1) There were concerns about controls and data not shown. The authors should:a) Show control CD1d tetramer staining data for all relevant figures;</p></disp-quote><p>The key concern seems to be that the lack of empty tetramer staining, combined with an overly inclusive gate for iNKT cells (particularly in the old Figure 1), suggests that the small number of gated events analyzed further in the HDAC7-ΔP mice (old Figure 1C) are not really iNKT cells, but rather background TCR-negative cells. We have taken several steps to address this concern. First, since we did not perform parallel empty tetramer staining in all our experiments, including the experiment used as representative data for Figure 1A in the original submission, we have replaced these panels with data from a set of animals in which we did use empty tetramer for thymus, spleen and liver (new Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, Figure 2A). In doing so, we have also drawn tighter gates around the iNKT population and performed more careful spectral compensation to better distinguish and exclude TCR-negative cells.</p><p>Secondly, while the data processed in this fashion do consistently show more cells in the iNKT gate in HDAC7-ΔP thymus with loaded vs. empty tetramer (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) this background is still sufficiently high that it could obscure some of the findings. To try to address this issue more effectively, we performed new experiments in which we used magnetic beads to enrich tetramer-binding cells before analyzing CD44 and NK1.1 expression (as suggested by reviewer #1), and these data now replace the original Figure 1C (new Figure 1C-D). We performed similar experiments, employing empty tetramer and magnetic enrichment, for the analysis of HDAC7 KO thymocytes (new Figure 2A), which is the only other condition in which we are analyzing rare iNKT populations in this manner. Our improved analysis and these new data have caused us to modify our conclusion that there is a Stage 1 block in HDAC7-ΔP mice, as we can now detect cells at both stages 2 and 3 in the HDAC7- ΔP mice, both with magnetic enrichment (Figure 1C) and without (Figure 1, S1C, D). We have also found that the remaining cells in Stage 0-1 are in fact mostly CD24<sup>hi</sup>. Our original analysis was compromised by weak reagents and poor choices of color to detect CD24 and NK1.1, which made appropriate spectral compensation of our complex panel and the distinction of CD24<sup>hi</sup> vs. CD24<sup>lo</sup> cells difficult. While Vα14 x HDAC7-ΔP TG iNKT cells do appear to mature fairly efficiently to Stage 1 but not beyond it (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1D), our new data suggest that even this step is impaired in mice expressing only HDAC7-ΔP (New Figure 1C, D, Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-D). Additionally, since the use of contour plots to represent the distribution of the small numbers of events in these analyses was potentially misleading, we have switched to more clearly interpretable dot plots in all such cases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) For rare populations, it is critical to show the entire gating strategy (and confirm whether they performed doublet exclusion). This should be shown in the supplemental data;</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided panels illustrating the full gating strategy for our representative tetramer staining of tissues from WT/HDAC7-ΔP mice in Figure 1—figure supplement 3. Identification of lymphocytes, doublet exclusion, and identification of live cells was performed as shown in these panels for all of our flow data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Data not shown should be included in the supplemental data.</p></disp-quote><p>The data in question included data on the effect of HDAC-ΔP in Treg development and on the development of CD8αα IELs, which in both cases we characterized as minor in contrast to the categorical effects we observed on iNKT development in the present work and previously on negative selection (Kasler et al., 2012). With regard to the effects on Treg development, we did publish supplementary data supporting this finding in our previous paper (Kasler et al., 2012, specifically in Figures S1E and S2A). These data show an approximately 2-fold reduction in the prevalence of Treg in the HDAC7-ΔP transgenics, both in the intact mice and in mixed chimeras. When isolated, these cells showed normal activity in <italic>ex-vivo</italic> suppression assays. The data we obtained on CD8 αα IEL, showing a reduction in prevalence of ~2-fold in the small intestinal epithelium, have not been published previously, so we have included representative panels showing our analysis in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A. We have also now included the data for memory markers and cytokine expression in the CD4 compartment in our mixed hematopoietic chimeras (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). While the phenotypes we saw were of much lower magnitude (~30% vs. a 3-fold increase) and more variable than what we saw for the CD8 compartment, they were nonetheless statistically significant at n=6 for IL4 secretion and n=8 for memory marker expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reviewers were concerned about the low level of NK1.1 expression in control animals that seemed unusual.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the profiles of CD44/NK1.1 expression for WT mice in those panels don’t make sense, and we should have caught this inconsistency before sending the manuscript out. We have since re-done this analysis for these strains with better reagents for CD24 and NK1.1, empty tetramer as a control, magnetic enrichment of iNKT cells, and more careful gating and compensation. In the new data (Figure 1C, D., Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D), we can clearly see that WT thymic iNKT cells are predominantly at Stage 3, and that cells at stages 1-3 are all severely reduced but still detectable in HDAC7-ΔP mice. With respect to NK1.1 expression Figure 2B, those data were mislabeled and were actually from liver rather than spleen, and moreover the signal for NK1.1 was weak and had not been correctly compensated. We have substituted new data from thymus for these panels in Figure 2, with CD44/NK1.1 staging for magnetically enriched iNKT cells now provided as dot plots. The original data from this location were re-analyzed and moved to Figure 3—figure supplement 1A. We still only see about half of the iNKT cells in liver as belonging to Stage 3, however this is consistent with what we have seen in spleen and liver in other instances with the younger (i.e. 4-5 weeks old) animals that we have analyzed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Did g/d T cells compensate for IL4 expression and phenotype of innate CD8 T cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We investigated this possibility by staining thymi from WT and HDAC7 KO mice with antibodies to the αβ and γδ TCRs, in combination with antibodies to either PLZF and the PLZF-associated Vγ6.3 TCR chain. These new analyses have been added as Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and C. We found that the overall proportion of γδ T cells was quite variable in HDAC7 KO mice, ranging from identical to WT to as much as 2.5-fold higher, while the proportion of PLZF and Vγ6.3-expressing cells within this population ranged from normal to ~2-fold reduced. Their overall prevalence thus ranged from normal to as much as 2.2-fold higher in one of six littermate pairs we analyzed. Due to this variability, the overall trend of increased representation of these cell types only reached statistical significance (P = 0.043 for one trial and P = 0.099 for another, see Figure 2—source data 1) for total γδ T cells and not Vγ6.3 or PLZF-expressing cells. We therefore do not believe it could be the cause of the expanded EOMES-expressing population we observe, as this was noted in all of the seven WT, HDAC7-KO littermate pairs we looked at.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Authors need to pull back from statements in the Results section that they do not test experimentally. They do not test why there are fewer iNKT cells, especially at later stages. Is it proliferation? increased cell death? Block in thymic effector differentiation (NKT1/NKT2/NKT17 by examining Tbet/Gata3/RORgt)? If they will speculate without experimentation it should be moved to the Discussion rather than the Results.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that we did not formally test various alternative hypotheses about what causes the defect in the numbers of iNKT cells in the HDAC7-ΔP mice, and have accordingly toned down various potentially overreaching statements in the Results section, e.g. subsection “Alteration of HDAC7 Function Dysregulates Thymic Innate Effector Programming and Interferes With iNKT Development”, first and second paragraphs; subsection “HDAC7 Regulates the Effector Programming of NKT Cells in a Manner That Mirrors the Function of PLZF”, first paragraph etc. While we still believe that HDAC7-ΔP does cause a block in effector differentiation iNKT cells, as is supported by our flow data with the Vα14 transgenics and our RNAseq analysis (note the suppression of multiple effector differentiation-associated genes in Figure 5A, including T-bet and GATA3), the limited time allowed for these revisions and the limited number of mice we had available made definitively ruling out other models with BrdU/apoptosis experiments an endeavor beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Acknowledgement that their gene array doesn't compare the same populations between the WT and KO animals.</p></disp-quote><p>Our RNAseq experiments in this paper did not actually look at HDAC7-KO animals but rather Vα14 x HDAC7-ΔP animals, however the point raised by the reviewer is still germane. We have acknowledged in the text (subsection “HDAC7 and PLZF Inversely Regulate a Shared Innate Effector Gene Network That is Highly Relevant to Autoimmune Disease”, first paragraph) that the different distribution of CD44/NK1.1 between the samples we compared could yield significant population effects based merely on differential representation of developmental subsets. However many of the important suppressive changes we see, e.g. suppression of Hobit, Icos, and ID2 in thymus (Figure 5A), are of a magnitude which exceeds what could be accounted for by this mechanism as they are actually expressed at lower levels than in conventional SP thymocytes. There are moreover many genes affected by HDAC7-ΔP in our analysis that are not normally changed during iNKT development (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1C), and conversely population effects alone cannot account for all the gene expression differences between HDAC7-ΔP X Vα14 thymocytes and CD4SP cells that were the same as those observed in the absence of HDAC7-ΔP (Figure 5A, diagonals). Lastly, many of the genes seen to be suppressed are normally already strongly upregulated at stage 1, which is abundantly represented in Vα14 x HDAC7-ΔP thymocytes (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). Thus, while we acknowledge that this was not a perfect experiment we remain convinced that it does provide important information about the molecular-level effects of HDAC7 on iNKT differentiation.</p><p>Note: In the sections below, we provide new responses only to those reviewer comments not already addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Again, the full text of all reviews are given below.

Similarly to the previous comment, it is unclear why only 30% of the cells would be expressing NK1.1 in that tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe we have responded fully to all of these issues above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The development of &quot;innate&quot; CD8 T cells that are CD44+, CD122+, Eomes+ was reported to be dependent upon IL-4 signaling in the thymus. The source of IL-4 in the thymus is thought to be NKT2 and PLZF+ gd T cells. The presented experiments clearly demonstrate that the increased proportion of CD8<sup>+</sup> CD44+ Eomes+ in HDAC7ΔP mice is decoupled from an increased proportion of NKT2 cells. Did the author examine whether this was compensated by an increase proportion of gd PLZF+ T cells? (Figure 4 would argue that it is not although it was not formally tested).</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed the question of PLZF+ γδ T cells above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The author should also modify the text of the manuscript in that the &quot;innate&quot; programs that might be regulated by HDAC7 are not the same in CD8 and NKT cells. NKT cells do not express Eomes and CD8 T cells do not express PLZF so the statement that &quot;loss of HDAC7 results in the aberrant adoption of NKT-like innate effector programming&quot; is not correct.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that we were comparing apples and oranges with this statement, and have therefore deleted the phrase “iNKT-like” from this sentence. However, since the abnormalities we observed in both CD4 and CD8 T cells from HDAC7-KO mice went beyond just EOMES expression and did at least superficially resemble the effects of transgenic PLZF expression (Figure 4E), we feel that retaining the rest of this statement was still appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>NKT cell can adopt different fate in the thymus (NKT1, NKT2 and NKT17) that can be visualized by the expression of the various master transcription factors associated with the phenotype. It would have been interesting to stain NKT cells for Tbet, Rorgt in addition to PLZF.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this type of analysis would have added significantly to our understanding of the effect of HDAC7-ΔP on iNKT development, although the strong NKT1 bias of B6 mice (Lee, et al., 2013) perhaps does not make this the best strain background in which to ask such questions. We can however point to our gene expression analysis, in which GATA3, RORγ, and T-bet were all found to be downregulated in thymus and/or spleen (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p><italic>The expression of PLZF protein is essentially gone in HDAC7ΔP mice (Figure 4A), yet analysis of mRNA expression (Figure 5A) reveals a very modest loss of Zbtb16 mRNA expression. How do the authors reconcile these findings? Does HDAC7 binding to PLZF (Figure 7) leads to its degradation</italic> in vivo<italic>?</italic> </p><p>The source of this discrepancy is that our gene expression analysis was done in the Vα14/Jα18 transgenic background, in which PLZF expression, albeit reduced, is still detectable by flow cytometry in the presence of HDAC7-ΔP (Figure 4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also unclear why gene expression in total NKT cells was examined in Figure 5, while it is clear from Figure 1 that the cells did not reach the same stage of development between WT and HDAC7ΔP mice. Thereby, finding differences in gene expression for genes that are acquired late in the development of NKT cells (NK1.1, Ly49, Tbet) is perhaps not surprising, but might be unrelated to HDAC7 direct activity. It would have been more interesting, perhaps, to test differential gene expression in CD44neg NK1.1- NKT cells between the two strains.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that it might have been better to do the experiment in this fashion, and that for this reason some of the changes we see cannot be directly attributed to the effect of HDAC7. We have included a statement to this effect in the main text. However, as we detailed above, many of the important changes we did see occur earlier in iNKT development and/or are of a magnitude/direction that cannot be accounted for by population effects alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The main conclusion is that HDAC7 is critical for controlling whether T cells act like conventional naïve T cells or quickly reactive innate-type lymphocytes. However, there are several concerns and potential alternative interpretations.</p><p>Data is not shown regarding the conventional CD4 compartment in the periphery. They state &quot;We observe a much more modest degree of abnormality in the CD4 compartment (data not shown)&quot;. This data needs to be added to the Results and is necessary to assess their conclusions. If HDAC7ΔP does not alter the conv T cell compartment into a more innate like phenotype, does this alter the conclusions drawn?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included these data for HDAC7-KO mice, as detailed above, as it was actually with this genotype and not HDAC7-ΔP that we saw these abnormalities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Previously, the authors demonstrated that use of the HDAC7ΔP transgene inhibited negative selection of autoreactive thymocytes and that these mice developed lethal autoimmunity. Is the enhanced activation of T cells observed due to activation of autoreactive cells that otherwise would have been deleted? If these are autoreactive cells, then are they more innate like or the issue is that they are being activated and are thus not naïve? If the T cells with enhanced function are ones that would have been negatively selected, then is the primary cause the block in negative selection?</p></disp-quote><p>While we did in fact observe enhanced activation of autoreactive peripheral T cells in older HDAC7-ΔP TG mice our earlier work (Kasler, et al., 2012), this is not what we saw in iNKT cells from younger mice in the present work (see Figure 3C-D). The increased effector differentiation was rather observed in HDAC7-KO mice (Figure 2B-H, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another difficulty with this manuscript are conclusions 'consistent with the data', or 'suggesting that' without doing the experiments to demonstrate the mechanism. The authors interpret the failure of Va14 tg HDAC7ΔP NKT cells to produce cytokines as 'suggesting that the cells had failed to undergo effector programming in the thymus'. This should be examined by staining for NKT1/NKT2/NKT17 using Tbet/Gata3/RORγt. Total NKT are examined for cytokine production, but if there is a defect in differentiation of the NKT subsets, then each subset should be examined individually to determine whether (for example) there are few NKT1 cells that produce normal IFNγ or many NKT1 that fail to make IFNγ. In addition, the authors state that &quot;HDAC7ΔP blocked the intrathymic proliferation that is normally associated with post-positive selection iNKT differentiation&quot;. No experiments were performed to examine NKT proliferation after positive selection (e.g. BrdU). In addition, the loss of NKT cell at this stage could also be due another reason such as enhanced apoptosis, but this was not examined either.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these issues in responses made above, and have backed off of several statements, including the one quoted, that could be seen as overreaching.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;modest suppression of Treg and CD8aa IELs (data not shown)&quot; should be added to the manuscript. CD8aa IELs are innate-like lymphocytes. If HDAC7ΔP expression leads to enhancement of innate functions, then why is this population decreased?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added these data to the manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), and must reiterate that we said there was enhanced effector function with loss of HDAC7, not with expression of HDAC7-ΔP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not clear that the HDAC7ΔP transgene is completely off in the periphery. In their prior manuscript originally describing this mouse, there is enhanced HDAC7 expression in peripheral T cells from HDAC7ΔP transgenic mice as compared to WT. Therefore, I would argue that their previous paper demonstrated that this transgene is not completed turned off in the periphery.</p></disp-quote><p>While we acknowledge that the blot shown in that paper does show slightly higher expression of HDAC7 in splenocytes, what we assayed was total HDAC7 and not some epitope tag associated with the transgene. It cannot therefore automatically be concluded that this represents expression of the transgene rather than HDAC7. Even if it does, this could be due to recent thymic emigrants that have not yet fully turned off expression mediated by the lck proximal promoter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>HDAC7ΔP mice have increased mature SP thymocytes – one common cause for an increase in mature SP thymocytes is a defect in thymic egress. Is there a defect in thymic egress in these mice? (KLF2, S1P1/receptor, CD69)</p></disp-quote><p>Since HDAC7-ΔP-derived cells generally seem to contribute well to the peripheral Tconv population (e.g. Figure 1—figure supplement 1B), we did not think that investigating this possibility was critical to our conclusions, since any defect in thymic egress must not be very severe. The profound defect in negative selection we demonstrated previously (Kasler et al., 2012) also provides a pretty good explanation for the excess SP thymocytes we observe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is difficult to analyze the RNA-seq data presented, as the cells being examined are completely different: Vα14 (WT) NKT cells that have primarily differentiated into NKT1/NKT2/NKT17 effectors and Vα14 HDAC7ΔP NKTs that may not have differentiated into NKT1/NKT2/NKT17 effectors at all.</p></disp-quote><p>While we acknowledge that we did not do a perfect experiment here, we believe that showing as we did by gene expression analysis that such differentiation has not occurred is clearly a worthwhile end in itself – indeed while we use NK1.1 and CD44 for the staging of these cells, if we observed a defect in their upregulation in the absence of more comprehensive gene expression data, it might just as validly be argued that HDAC7-ΔP affects only the expression of those genes and not the whole program of innate effector differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Empty tetramer control needs to be added to several figures, as it is not clear whether the signal observed with Tetramer/TCRβ (e.g. Figure 1) in HDAC7ΔP is above that of an empty tetramer control. If not, then further examination of this population by CD24/CD44/NK1.1 may be misleading, and the population should be examined to determine whether it expresses the canonical Vα14-Jα18 rearranged TCRα chain.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we have added empty tetramer to the key experiments, and have shown that we detect significantly more cells with loaded than with empty tetramer in HDAC7-ΔP thymus at all stages except Stage 1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). We have also used magnetic enrichment, as suggested by reviewer 1, to increase confidence in our findings, obtaining a result very similar to what we saw without such enrichment (Figure 1C).</p></body></sub-article></article>
