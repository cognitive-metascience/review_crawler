(CA) and nucleoporins (Nups). Here, we show that HIV-1 CA can bind multiple Nups, and that both natural and manipulated variation in Nup levels impacts HIV-1 infection in a manner that is strikingly dependent on cell-type, cell-cycle, and cyclophilin A (CypA). We also show that Nups mediate the function of the antiviral protein MX2, and that MX2 can variably inhibit non-viral NLS function. Remarkably, both enhancing and inhibiting effects of cyclophilin A and MX2 on various HIV-1 CA mutants could be induced or abolished by manipulating levels of the Nup93 subcomplex, the Nup62 subcomplex, NUP88, NUP214, RANBP2, or NUP153. Our findings suggest that several Nup-dependent ‘pathways’ are variably exploited by HIV-1 to target host DNA in a cell-type, cell-cycle, CypA and CA-sequence dependent manner, and are differentially inhibited by MX2.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>nuclear import</kwd><kwd>integration</kwd><kwd>nucleoporin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bieniasz</surname><given-names>Paul D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R3764003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bieniasz</surname><given-names>Paul D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI100720</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>Masahiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI062520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kvaratskhelia</surname><given-names>Mamuka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32AI116263</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kane</surname><given-names>Melissa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comprehensive investigation reveals the variability and importance of the nuclear pore complex in HIV-1 infection and the activity of the antiretroviral protein, MX2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Access to the chromosomal DNA contained within the nucleus of target cells is critical for retroviral integration and replication. Among retroviruses, the lentiviruses are uniquely efficient in their ability to enter the nucleus of interphase cells, in which the nuclear membrane is intact. The viral capsid (CA) is the key viral determinant of the ability of HIV-1 to infect non-dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yamashita and Emerman, 2004</xref>), and CA mutants can specifically disrupt the ability of HIV-1 to infect non-dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yamashita et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to CA itself, cellular CA-interacting proteins have been suggested to regulate or otherwise influence HIV-1 nuclear import and infection, including the peptidylprolyl isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) and the mRNA processing protein cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 6 (CPSF6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Iaco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Price et al., 2012</xref>). CA can also directly interact with two nucleoporins (Nups) NUP153 and RANBP2(NUP358), that appear to play a major role in HIV-1 nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bichel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Nunzio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Matreyek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schaller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), A number of other Nups or nuclear transport receptors have also been implicated as co-factors for HIV-1 infection in genome-wide RNA interference screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brass et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">König et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Yeung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). CA-dependent interactions with Nups also appear to play a role in determining where HIV-1 proviral DNA is integrated into the host genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Nunzio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ocwieja et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schaller et al., 2011</xref>), perhaps by directing HIV-1 preintegration complexes to specific nuclear import pathways or through effects on chromatin architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lelek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Marini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wong et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Approximately, 30 distinct Nups are present in the nuclear pore complex (NPC) that is organized in repetitively arranged subcomplexes with 8-fold rotational symmetry. The NPC has a tripartite architecture, with a central major architectural scaffold, that includes the transmembrane Nups, the Nup107, Nup93, and Nup62 subcomplexes. The NPC is appended with cytoplasmic filaments, and the nuclear basket (an assembly of 8 intranuclear filaments joined into a basket) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fernandez-Martinez and Rout, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoelz et al., 2011</xref>). Although NPCs are generally depicted as static structures, some components are dynamic. Specifically, the scaffold Nups remain associated with the NPC for hours to days while other components, including the phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat Nups, are associated with the NPC only for minutes at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Morchoisne-Bolhy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rabut et al., 2004a</xref>). Recent structural studies suggest the existence of conformational flexibility in the main architectural elements of the NPC (the Nup107 or Y complex, the Nup62 complex, and the Nup93 complex or linker Nups) (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Knockenhauer and Schwartz, 2016</xref>)). Moreover, a number of reports have also pointed to compositional variability of the NPC both within and between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Angelo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gomez-Cavazos and Hetzer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lowe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lupu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ori et al., 2013</xref>), and altered expression under certain conditions, such as upon IFN stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Enninga et al., 2002</xref>). These reports raise the intriguing possibility that NPCs with different compositions may be poised for the transport of different cargos. Transport of substrates through the NPC is regulated by members of a family of nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) known as karyopherins (and/or importins/transportins). NTRs bind cargoes via the recognition of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) or nuclear export signal (NES) to form a transport complex, which is generally regulated by the GTPase, RAN. The distinction between a ‘stationary’ Nup and a ‘mobile’ NTR has been recently blurred by findings of structural and functional similarities between some Nups and NTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2013</xref>), and evidence that importin-β (KPNB1) can stably associate with the NPC and modulate nuclear pore permeability. Notably, diversity in NLS/NES sequences, intra/intermolecular masking of NLS/NES, variation in NTR expression and NPC composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chatel and Fahrenkrog, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sorokin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Terry et al., 2007</xref>) all have the potential to influence the rate of nuclear transport.</p><p>MX2, an antiviral protein whose expression is strongly upregulated by type 1 interferon, localizes to the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goujon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">King et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Like the better-studied MX1 protein, MX2 is comprised of a GTPase domain connected to a carboxy-terminal stalk domain via a tripartite bundle-signaling element (BSE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haller et al., 2015</xref>). Unlike MX1, MX2 contains an NLS-like sequence in its first 25 amino acids that is required for NPC localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">King et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Melén et al., 1996</xref>). MX1 can inhibit a number of viruses, but not retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haller et al., 2015</xref>), while MX2 was recently shown to inhibit infection by HIV-1 and other primate lentiviruses. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goujon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). The antiretroviral activity and specificity of MX2 is governed by the N-terminal domain that is absent in MX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busnadiego et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goujon et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, GTPase function and higher order oligomerization are generally required for the antiviral activity of MX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haller et al., 2015</xref>) but are dispensable for the antiviral activity of MX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dicks et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fribourgh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goujon et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Matreyek et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the targets and mechanisms underlying inhibition of viral infection by MX1 and MX2 are quite distinct.</p><p>MX2 inhibits HIV-1 infection after the completion of reverse transcription but prior to the chromosomal integration of viral DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goujon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Matreyek et al., 2014</xref>). For this reason, and because MX2 inhibits HIV-1 infection more potently in non-dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yamashita and Emerman, 2009</xref>), current models suggest that MX2 acts by preventing nuclear import of the viral preintegration complex. Additionally, the viral capsid is the major viral determinant of MX2 sensitivity, and several single amino-acid substitutions in CA have been identified that confer partial or complete resistance to MX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busnadiego et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goujon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2015</xref>). MX2 has also been found to directly bind the HIV-1 CA, but the relevance of this binding for viral inhibition is unclear, as MX2-resistant CA proteins are also bound by MX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fribourgh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fricke et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, many of the CA mutations conferring partial or complete MX2 resistance, such as G89V, N57A/S, N74D, and A92E, are also known to affect binding to and/or requirements for cellular proteins implicated in HIV-1 nuclear import including CypA, CPSF6, NUP153, and RANBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hatziioannou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Matreyek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rihn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schaller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sokolskaja et al., 2004</xref>). These mutants alter infection in non-dividing cells, and/or altere integration site selection, suggesting the possibility that they may utilize distinct pathways to access nuclear DNA.</p><p>MX2 antiviral activity is also affected by CypA, a ubiquitous and abundantly expressed member of a family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, whose role in HIV-1 infection is enigmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Luban et al., 1993</xref>). Disruption of the interaction between HIV-1 and CypA, either genetically or by cyclosporine A (CsA) addition, reduces the efficiency of HIV-1 infection (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell and Hope, 2015</xref>)), and some studies have indicated that CypA-CA interactions influence nuclear entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Iaco and Luban, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schaller et al., 2011</xref>). However, defining a precise role for CypA in HIV-1 infection has proved difficult because CsA treatment has diverse enhancing and inhibiting effects on infection that are determined by CA mutations and target cell type (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell and Hope, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yamashita and Engelman, 2017</xref>)).</p><p>Here, we explore the functional interactions between HIV-1 CA, Nups, MX2, and CypA. We find that HIV-1 CA sequence, target cell-type, cell-cycle, CypA, and multiple Nups functionally interact in complex ways to affect the efficiency of viral infection and the antiviral activity of MX2. Indeed, we find that Nup levels (and presumably NPC composition) are quite variable in cell lines used to investigate HIV-1 infection, and also variable among NPCs within an individual cell. We further show, using biochemical assays that HIV-1 CA can bind to multiple Nups. Crucially, we show that diverse effects of CypA and CA mutations on infection, as well as MX2 antiviral activity, can be induced or abolished by altering Nup levels and NPC composition. Overall, our findings are consistent with a model in which several Nup-dependent ‘pathways’ to HIV-1 nuclear entry and integration exist. These pathways are differentially exploited by HIV-1 CA mutants and in different cell lines in a manner that is influenced by CypA. Moreover, these Nup-dependent nuclear entry pathways appear to be differently inhibited by MX2. Heterogeneity in Nup levels and or NPC composition likely, therefore, explains the differential dependence of HIV-1 on CA-binding cofactors and susceptibility to CA-binding antiviral proteins in different cellular contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HIV-1 infectivity and MX2 antiviral potency is influenced in complex ways by cell-type, cell-cycle, CypA, and viral capsid sequence</title><p>For initial experiments to simultaneously assess the role of cell-type, CypA and cell-cycle in HIV-1 infection and its inhibition by MX2, we generated HeLa and HT1080 cell lines that expressed MX2 in a doxycycline-inducible manner and challenged these cells with HIV-1<sub>WT</sub>, derivatives encoding CA mutations (some of which had been selected for MX2-resistance), and other lentiviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>).

Moreover, unlike HIV-1<sub>WT</sub>, the HIV-1<sub>G94D</sub> and HIV-1<sub>A92E</sub> mutants retained residual sensitivity to MX2 in the presence of CsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The HIV-1<sub>T210K</sub> CA mutant was selected by passage in MT4 cells expressing MX2 and exhibits resistance to inhibition by MX2 in that context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busnadiego et al., 2014</xref>), HIV-1<sub>T210K</sub> was similarly MX2-resistant in HeLa cells but, surprisingly, became sensitive to MX2 when HeLa cells were growth arrested. HIV-1<sub>T210K</sub> was CsA-dependent, in that it was rendered more infectious upon CsA addition in HeLa cells, but not in HT1080 or HOS cells. However, unlike HIV-1<sub>WT</sub>, CsA addition conferred increased sensitivity of HIV-1<sub>T210K</sub> to MX2 in both HeLa and HT1080 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, although the HIV-1<sub>T210K</sub> mutant arose under selective pressure from MX2, the acquired resistance is cell-type-, cell-cycle-, and CypA-dependent. Similarly, the G208R mutant, which also arose under selective pressure imposed by MX2 in MT4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busnadiego et al., 2014</xref>) was only partly resistant to MX2 in HeLa or HT1080 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>HIV-1<sub>N74D</sub>, whose CA does not interact with CPSF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), was less sensitive than HIV-1<sub>WT</sub> to MX2 in HeLa and HT1080 cells (as well as in HOS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goujon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kane et al., 2013</xref>)). HIV-1<sub>N74D</sub> was also CsA sensitive in all three cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambrose et al., 2012</xref>), particularly when cells were growth arrested.

Modest enhancement of infection by MX2 was also observed for the HIV-1<sub>G89V</sub> whose capsid does not bind CypA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wiegers et al., 1999</xref>), in both HeLa and HT1080 cells, and irrespective of cell-division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>A particularly striking phenotype was observed with the HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> CA mutant, which is unable to efficiently infect non-dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rihn et al., 2013</xref>) and is MX2 resistant. While HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> infection was unaffected by either CsA or MX2 in HeLa cells, HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> was exquisitely sensitive to CsA (~20 fold inhibition) in HT1080 cells. Remarkably, this dramatic reduction in infectivity was completely reversed by MX2. In other words, MX2 increased infection by the HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> mutant when CypA:CA interaction was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>These experiments demonstrate that MX2 and CypA can either inhibit or enhance HIV-1 infection. Their effects clearly varied in a cell-type, cell-cycle and CA-sequence dependent manner. Thus, both the viral capsid, and some feature of the cellular environment that varies in the aforementioned cell lines, presumably other cellular factor(s), determine whether MX2 and CypA inhibit or enhance HIV-1 infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Variation in Nup expression among cell types</title><p>Both CA sequence and CypA have been reported to affect the requirement for particular Nups during HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Matreyek and Engelman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2013</xref>). Moreover, MX2 localizes to nuclear pores and appears to act at the nuclear entry step of HIV-1 infection. Mutants of MX2 have also been reported to broadly affect nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">King et al., 2004</xref>). For these reasons and because the nuclear envelope fragments during cell division, we next considered whether the varied effects of CA sequence, MX2, CypA, cell-type and cell-cycle on HIV-1 infection might be mediated through Nups or NTRs.</p><p>To begin to examine whether Nups or NTRs might govern the differential effects of the aforementioned factors on HIV-1 infection, we examined the levels of each Nup and a subset of NTRs in a panel of cell lines, including a number of T-cell derived, monocyte derived, and adherent cell lines commonly utilized in HIV-1 research. Certain Nups (SEH1, GLE1, and NUP214) that we were unable to detect by western blotting were excluded from this analysis. We found several striking differences in the levels of individual Nups among this panel of cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, the monocytic THP-1 and U937 cells expressed lower levels of almost all Nups than other cell lines, suggesting that they may have fewer nuclear pores. Additionally, HT1080 cells did not express detectable levels of NUP210. We also found that natural target cells of HIV-1 infection, namely primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and macrophages exhibited differences in nucleoporin expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). For example, dramatically higher levels of NUP37 were found in primary macrophages as compared to MT4, THP-1, and primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, while lower levels of NUP210 were present in macrophages. The appearance of unanticipated anti-Nup antibody reactive species in some cell lines and in primary cells suggested potential differences in the expression of alternative isoforms of several Nups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, this cannot be definitely determined without more extensive investigation, as non-specific binding by the Nup-specific antibodies may underlie this variability. These results are consistent with previous studies reporting cell-type dependent differences in Nup expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Angelo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gomez-Cavazos and Hetzer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lowe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lupu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ori et al., 2013</xref>) and suggest that marked compositional heterogeneity of NPCs occurs between cell types. Alternatively, it is possible that the fraction of each Nup protein that is associated with nuclear pores varies with cell type. In such a scenario the capsids could interact with Nups in the cytoplasm, and both the NPC-associated and cytoplasmic forms of a given Nup could have an effect on viral infection. In any case, variation in Nup levels has the potential to affect HIV-1 infection and its modulation by cell-cycle, CypA, and MX2.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35738.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Nup and NTR expression in immortalized cell lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of expression of Nups (color-coded by subcomplex as indicated in panel B), selected NTRs, and CPSF6 in T cell (MT4, CEM X174, Jurkat, SupT1, H9), adherent cell (HeLa, HOS, HT1080, 293T), or monocytic cell (THP-1, K-562, U937) lines.

In the case of HeLa cells this analysis was done for all Nups for which antibodies were available. In the case of HT1080 and HOS cells, we monitored pleiotropic effects on Nups in the same subcomplex as the siRNA target. For the purposes of this analysis, the Nup93 subcomplex, the Nup62 subcomplex, the transmembrane subcomplexes, as well as the cytoplasmic and nuclear basket Nups were considered separate subcomplexes. We found quite dramatic changes in the levels of Nups other than the targeted Nup that varied depending on cell-type and cell-cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">6</xref>). The widespread pleiotropic effects of Nup or NTR depletion likely reflect the remarkable complexity of nuclear pore structure and formation, and the tight transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational controls of Nup expression levels [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doucet and Hetzer, 2010</xref>). We additionally assessed the impact of Nup or NTR depletion on cellular physiology by DNA content mediated cell-cycle analysis in HOS and HeLa cells (HT1080 cells were not amenable to reproducible measurements of DNA content) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplements 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s8">8</xref>). While a few Nup/NTR depletions affected the cell-cycle profile, decreasing the proportion of cells in G2 (in particular NUP93, NUP205, and KPNB1), and decreased the overall levels of nucleoporins, most knockdowns did not affect the cell cycle, and none caused complete growth arrest, suggesting that at least at the time of infection, cell physiology was not grossly disrupted by Nup/NTR depletion, in most cases.</p><p>We also determined whether the recruitment of several representative Nups to the NPC was altered upon knockdown of each individual Nup. Specifically, the localizations of NUP153, RANBP2, NUP98, NUP62 and NUP214 were assessed following siRNA knockdown of all Nups in HeLa and/or HT1080 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s14">14</xref>). These Nups were chosen for assessment as representatives of the majority of the NPC subcomplexes, and based on the availability of antibodies that worked well in immunofluorescence assays.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35738.022</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Effects of depleting individual Nups on NPC integrity and function, and MX2 localization.</title><p>Deconvolution microscopic images (single optical sections) of HeLa cells expressing MX2-RFP (red, stably transduced with a doxycycline inducible vector), immunoflourescently stained NUP153 (green), RANBP2 (purple), and Hoechst-stained DNA.

Strikingly, NUP153 remained localized at the nuclear envelope following knockdown of each of the other Nups. This finding is likely a reflection of the fact that NUP153 recruitment to the nuclear envelope is an early event during nuclear pore formation, and its incorporation into the nuclear envelope is not therefore expected to be dependent on other Nups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bodoor et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Vollmer et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, several Nup siRNA knockdowns caused mislocalization of RANBP2, NUP214, NUP62, and/or NUP98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s14">14</xref>). Depletion of the Nups known to participate in the early stages of NPC formation (e.g. ELYS and NUP153), or those known to form the structural scaffold of the nuclear pore complex (e.g. NUP107 and NUP133), or those with the clear effects on cell viability (e.g. NUP93 and NUP205), had the most obvious and pervasive effects on the localization of other Nups. Conversely, the knockdown of several Nups (e.g. NUP188, NUP214, and NUP88) had no effect on the apparent localization of the other Nups, despite having clear effects on their protein levels. This finding suggests that some Nups are destabilized in the absence of their NPC binding partners. Importantly, the aforementioned results highlight the pleiotropic effects associated with the depletion of some individual Nups (e.g. NUP153) and indicate that cautious interpretation of targeted Nup knockdown or knockout experiments in general is warranted. In general, the knockdown of an individual Nup often changed the level of other Nups and the composition of NPCs in ways that were not easily predicted.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Effects of depleting individual Nups on NLS function</title><p>To assess nuclear pore function under conditions of Nup knockdown, we generated cell lines expressing GFP-LacZ fusion proteins appended with one of two different NLS sequences. As expected, the unmodified GFP-LacZ fusion was excluded from the nucleus, while a GFP-LacZ appended with a canonical SV40 large T-antigen NLS appeared almost entirely localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s15">Figure 6—figure supplements 15</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s16">16</xref>). When appended to GFP-LacZ, the N-terminal 25 amino acids of MX2 acted as an NLS, and caused MX2(25)NLS-GFP-LacZ to localize to the interior of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s17">Figure 6—figure supplements 17</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s18">18</xref>). Interestingly, the nuclear interior localization of MX2(25)NLS-GFP-LacZ contrasted with the nuclear pore localization of MX2 itself, and with the nuclear pore localization of MX2(25)-Mx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goujon et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that some property of MX2 and MX1 confers nuclear pore entrapment on a signal that would direct transport of an otherwise inert cargo to the nuclear interior.</p><p>Depletion of Nups and NTRs revealed that most perturbations allowed residual nuclear transport to proceed. Indeed, the nuclear accumulation of the SV40 NLS-GFP-LacZ was unaffected or only marginally affected by most Nup or NTR depletions. The exceptions to this were NUP107, NUP133, and ELYS/ACHTF1 whose depletion caused some reduction in nuclear accumulation, while RANBP2 and KPNB1 depletion caused nearly complete nuclear exclusion of SV40 NLS-GFP-LacZ. In the case of MX2(25)NLS-GFP-LacZ, nuclear accumulation was robust, but not as complete as was the case for SV40 NLS-GFP-LacZ. Moreover, a larger number of Nup depletions cause partial or apparently complete inhibition of MX2(25)NLS-GFP-LacZ nuclear accumulation. For example, NUP214, NUP88, or NUP153 depletion caused near complete exclusion of MX2(25)NLS-GFP-LacZ from the nucleus, but did not affect nuclear accumulation of SV40 NLS-GFP-LacZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s15">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s18">8</xref>).</p><p>These experiments indicate that at least some nuclear pores survive and retain transport activity following the knockdown of most individual Nups. Moreover, nuclear transport driven by two different NLS sequences exhibited marked differences in sensitivity to perturbation by siRNA-mediated alterations of Nup or NTR levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Nup composition or conformation controls NPC recruitment of MX2</title><p>Because individual Nup depletions could affect recruitment of other Nups as well as NPC function, we next determined whether the Nup depletions affected recruitment of MX2 to the NPC. To accomplish this, we used a doxycycline-inducible C-terminally tagged MX2-tagRFP expression construct. Additionally, because perturbation of nuclear transport has been shown to cause relocalization of CPSF6 and reveal a mis-localization dependent antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Iaco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fricke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hori et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Price et al., 2012</xref>), we also monitored the localization of CPSF6-RFP in the same way. In control siRNA treated cells, the MX2-RFP fusion was concentrated at the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and the CPSF6-RFP fusion was found only within the nuclear interior in most cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s11">Figure 6—figure supplements 11</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s14">14</xref>). However, cytoplasmic localization of CPSF6 was observed in some (~5%) control siRNA treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s14">Figure 6—figure supplement 14</xref>), indicating that CPSF6 may not be confined to the nucleus at all times. Moreover, MX2 sometimes appeared in small aggregates in the cytoplasm of unmanipulated HT1080 cells, in addition to localizing at the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Several Nup knockdowns (SEH1, NUP85, NUP160, SEC13, NUP98, NUP107, NUP133, NUP43, ELYS, NUP93, NUP205, NUP155, RANBP2, and NUP153), and one NTR knockdown (TNPO1) resulted in a dramatic mislocalization of MX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s10">10</xref>). There were no evident differences between HeLa and HT1080 cells in the Nup requirements for MX2 localization to nuclear pores. Consistent with the finding that Nup knockdowns did not induce a generalized global block to nuclear transport (see above), CPSF6 remained localized within the nucleus following all Nup/NTR depletions, with the exception of TNPO3 [TNPO3 is known to be required for nuclear localization of CPSF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s14">14</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Iaco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fricke et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, MX2 exhibited similar Nup requirements for recruitment to the NPC as did RANBP2 and NUP62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, MX2 required RANBP2 (but not NUP62) for NPC recruitment. However, since we were not able to observe the subcellular localization of all Nups in these experiments, it is also possible that additional Nups have the same requirements for recruitment to the NPC as do RANBP2, NUP62, and MX2.</p><p>Because the recruitment of MX2 to NPCs was clearly dependent on certain Nups, we also examined the localization of MX2 in mitotic cells. In mitotic cells lacking a discernable nuclear envelope, the MX2-RFP fusion appeared as aggregates dispersed throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s19">Figure 6—figure supplements 19</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s20">20</xref>). Observation of cells in the later stages of mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope reforms and NPC assembly occurs, showed that MX2 remained dispersed throughout the cell, and was only visible at the nuclear envelope in cells exhibiting the terminal stages of NPC formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s19">Figure 6—figure supplements 19</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s20">20</xref>). In particular, MX2 remained dispersed in the cytosol when NUP153, NUP133, and NUP98 had been recruited to the nuclear envelope, which occurs during anaphase (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burke and Ellenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Schellhaus et al., 2016</xref>). RANBP2 recruitment to the NPC is a late event and follows the establishment of the structural pore and the central channel (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burke and Ellenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Schellhaus et al., 2016</xref>) and MX2 was only visualized at the nuclear envelope subsequent to the recruitment of RANBP2. These findings suggest that MX2 recruitment is specifically dependent of the presence of a Nup (possibly RANBP2) that is incorporated late in the assembly of the NPC. Alternatively, MX2 might interact with the NPC only as an assembled structure, rather than with a single Nup component.</p><p>Although we were not able to resolve individual nuclear pores via immunofluorescence, we could observe differences in the co-localization of MX2 with a number of Nups in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">3</xref>). In particular, the MX2-RFP fusion was most strongly co-localized with NUP98, NUP133, NUP62, RANBP2, NUP88, NUP214, NUP153, and NUP50, but showed significantly less co-localization with NUP85, ELYS, and NUP35. These differences were also reflected in the co-localization of Nups with one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">3</xref>). For example, NUP98, NUP133, NUP153, NUP214, RANBP2, and NUP62 colocalized well with each other and less well with ELYS, NUP35, and NUP85. These findings could be explained by varied composition of individual nuclear pores, and/or new pores assembling during interphase, in which some, but not all Nups are present within a nascent NPC. The details of interphase NPC assembly are not fully understood, but a number of important features distinguish interphase and mitotic NPC assembly (see discussion). It is therefore conceivable that nuclear pores at various stages of formation could be observed within a single cell, and possible that pores formed during interphase could be compositionally or conformationally distinct from those formed post-mitosis. It is also possible that the apparent heterogeneity in NPC observed in immunofluorescence reflects the occlusion of Nup antibody epitopes in a subset of NPCs. Epitopes could be inaccessible to antibodies as a result of conformational variability (such as during transport or pore formation) and may therefore not actually be reflective of compositional differences. In either case, these results suggest that NPC heterogeneity, in some form, affects the recruitment of MX2.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35738.043</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Localization of MX2 and Nups.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pearson’s coefficient for co-localization of MX2 with indicated Nups and (B) Nups with one another of deconvolution microscopic images of HeLa cells expressing MX2-RFP and immunoflourescently stained with Nups (color coded as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

These observations suggest that MX2(N91)-ARFAPTIN2 occluded access of HIV-1 to nuclear DNA in an at least partly different manner to the authentic MX2 protein.

Surprisingly, some Nup depletions that targeted members of the Nup62 subcomplex (NUP62, NUP54, NUPL1) increased FIV infection in HeLa cells. The majority of Nup depletions had little effect on MX2 resistance of FIV or EIAV, but some depletions marginally sensitized EIAV or FIV to inhibition by MX2 in HeLa cells (NUP205, NUP155, NUP54, NUPL1, KPNB1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5A–B</xref>). FIV infectivity and MX2 resistance were also unaffected by most Nup depletions in HT1080 cells, but a small number of knockdowns (NUP93, NUP205, NUP160) were significantly deleterious to FIV infection in HOS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5C–D</xref>). These results highlight differences among lentiviruses in their Nup requirements for infection of human cells. However, these findings should not necessarily be interpreted as revealing the Nup requirements of FIV and EIAV in their natural hosts.

Nups may therefore be required both for passage across the nuclear envelope, and for access to the host chromatin. Herein, we employed a panel of HIV-1 CA mutants, inhibitors of cell cycle progression and CypA:CA interactions, along with a systematic knock-down of Nups and NTRs to comprehensively investigate the functional interplay between Nups, MX2, CypA, and the viral capsid during HIV-1 infection.</p><p>Findings described herein that are crucial for interpreting the effects of individual Nup/NTR knockdown experiments include: (i) the HIV-1 CA physically binds to multiple Nup proteins, (ii) the levels of individual Nups vary considerably among different cell types and apparently among individual NPCs, (iii) depletion of one Nup often has pleiotropic effects, changing the levels and localization of other NPC components. These findings lead to the conclusion that assigning a direct role of a single Nup in HIV-1 infection or MX2 activity likely cannot be unambiguously achieved using a knockdown/knockout approach. Nevertheless, we could clearly demonstrate circumstances in which manipulating Nup levels (and presumably NPC composition) affected HIV-1 infection and MX2 activity. There was an unexpected and striking lack of consistency in the apparent Nup requirements for infection by HIV-1<sub>WT</sub> and HIV-1 CA mutants among three cell lines. Our data strongly suggest that variable Nup levels and NPC composition very likely underlie the variable effects of CA mutations, as well as CsA and CypA on HIV-1 infection. For example, CsA susceptibility and dependence (that clearly varies according to CA sequence and target cell type) could be induced or abolished by manipulating NPC composition.</p><p>Such findings are best explained by invoking the existence of multiple different, perhaps overlapping, pathways (‘pathways’ defined as the utilization of a particular set of Nups) that direct HIV-1 preintegration complexes through the NPC and to host chromatin. These pathways would be differentially available for use in different cell types (as dictated by Nup levels), and used with different efficiencies according to CA sequence and CA:CypA interaction. Differential CPSF6 binding to CA mutants (and the impact of CypA thereon) likely adds a further layer of complexity. Our finding that the cell cycle-dependent HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> CA mutant retains a requirement for Nups during infection indicates that Nup-dependent pathways could facilitate HIV-1 infection even when the nuclear envelope is dismantled during mitosis. In fact, accumulating evidence suggests that Nups play key roles in the life of cells during mitosis, including maintenance of centrosome association with the nuclear envelope, mitotic spindle formation, chromosome segregation, as well as NPC reassembly at mitotic exit (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wozniak et al., 2010</xref>)). HIV-1 may therefore access host DNA during mitosis by interacting with chromatin-associated Nups prior to reassembly of the nuclear envelope.</p><p>While the cell lines used herein are not the natural targets of HIV-1 infection, our results suggest that the in vivo utilization of Nups by HIV-1 and MX2 could vary among cell types (e.g. T cells vs. macrophages or naïve vs. memory vs. effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells). As well as variability in the composition of NPCs among cell types, there is also likely to be compositional variation within a given cell type, or even within a single cell. Indeed, NPC assembly between anaphase and telophase occurs within a few minutes and appears to be rate-limited by ELYS-mediated recruitment of the Nup107 subcomplex to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dultz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Franz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gillespie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rasala et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, NPCs that are assembled during interphase do so over up to an hour and in an ELYS-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Angelo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doucet and Hetzer, 2010</xref>). Although a definitive appraisal of compositional variability of the NPC does not yet exist, as a modular structure with considerable flexibility in the arrangement of the composite elements, conformational variability almost certainly differentiates individual pores and affects their transport capacity [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Knockenhauer and Schwartz, 2016</xref>)]. Each of these possible sources of variation in NPCs could contribute to inconsistency between Nup requirements for HIV-1 infection and MX2 activity between cell lines and could underlie the increased antiviral activity of MX2 in some non-dividing cells. Finally, it is also possible that sequence variation between Nups and/or NTRs contributes to the dissimilarities among cell lines uncovered herein.</p><p>Given the aforementioned complexities in NPC composition, and our finding the MX2 activity is dependent on Nups, understanding how MX2 inhibits HIV-1 infection is similarly complex. While several studies have generated or uncovered MX2 ‘resistant’ HIV-1 CA mutants, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busnadiego et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goujon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu et al., 2015</xref>) our findings show that MX2 resistance is context dependent, and that none of these ‘MX2-resistant’ mutants are entirely unaffected by MX2. Indeed, we found that CA mutations, cell-type, cell-cycle, and CypA can all modify the effects of MX2 in previously undescribed ways. We found multiple instances in which MX2 acted to increase, rather than inhibit infection of an HIV-1 CA mutant, in a manner which indicates that the outcome of the interaction between MX2 and the viral CA is dependent upon Nups and CypA.</p><p>We also found that MX2 can inhibit the import of a non-viral reporter protein directed to the nucleus by cellular NLS sequences. Crucially, MX2 differentially inhibited import driven by different NLS sequences from non-viral proteins, suggesting that MX2 can inhibit certain nuclear transport pathways more effectively than others. Together, these data suggest that the antiviral activity of MX2 is governed by the propensity of HIV-1 to favor particular nuclear entry pathways (‘pathways’ defined by the utilization of particular Nups) and the propensity of MX2 to preferentially inhibit those pathways. Thus, the overall antiviral activity of MX2 would be determined by (i) the availability of the pathways (defined by cell-type and cell-cycle i.e. Nup and NPC levels), and (ii) the propensity of HIV-1 to use the available pathways (defined by HIV-1 CA sequence and interaction of CA-binding host proteins, e.g. CypA or CPSF6).</p><p>Although MX2 is clearly dependent upon Nups for antiviral activity, our knockdown data suggest that nuclear pore localization is not sufficient (and perhaps not essential) for antiviral activity. Depletion of some Nups accentuated the antiviral activity of MX2 or accentuated the ability of MX2 to increase infectivity. MX2 co-localized with some Nups to a greater degree than others, raising the possibility that MX2 is enriched at NPCs that are preferentially utilized by HIV-1. Knockdown of a given Nup could deplete the preferred, MX2-enriched NPCs, or eliminate alternative, non-MX2-containing NPCs. Alternatively, MX2-inhibited interactions between Nups and the viral CA required for nuclear entry may not be restricted to the nuclear envelope, and may also occur in the cytoplasm; in fact, CPSF6-dependent RANBP2 interactions with the viral capsid have been reported to occur in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dharan et al., 2016</xref>). The dependence of the MX2(N91)-ARFAPTIN2 fusion on Nups for antiviral activity, even though MX2(N91)-ARFAPTIN2 is not concentrated at NPCs, is also suggestive of potential cytoplasmic interactions between the viral capsid and Nups.</p><p>The crystal structure of MX2 reveals that it forms an extended antiparallel dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fribourgh et al., 2014</xref>), and dimerization is critical for viral restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dicks et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fribourgh et al., 2014</xref>). Modeling suggests that the stalk domains provide the appropriate spacing to interact with hexamer interfaces in the HIV-1 CA lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fribourgh et al., 2014</xref>), However, It is also possible that one MX2 subunit in the dimer interacts with the NPC, while another interacts with the viral CA. Such a model would provide an explanatory basis for the observation that MX2 can enhance or rescue HIV-1 infection in some instances. Alternatively, interactions with the NPC may simply concentrate MX2 at a location where it is likely to encounter the incoming capsid cores. In either case, the outcome of MX2-CA interactions is clearly dependent upon CypA and NPC composition.</p><p>A subset of Nup depletions exhibited particularly interesting or complex effects on HIV-1 infection. Their effects on cell-type, cell-cycle, viral CA, and CypA dependent phenotypes in viral infection and MX2 activity suggest that their levels, or their presence in individual NPCs, play key direct or indirect roles in determining the availability of pathways by which HIV-1 accesses the nucleus and/or target cell chromatin.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>NUP155 and the Nup93 complex</title><p>NUP155 is part of the Nup93 subcomplex that contains NUP93, NUP205, NUP155, NUP188, and NUP35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Structural analyses of human and <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> nuclear pores indicate that NUP155 exists both buried within the inner ring of the nuclear pore, and as a link between the inner and outer rings, where it is exposed in the bridge between the two rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kosinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). Multiple structural conformations of the <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> homologue of NUP155 (NUP170) have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lin et al., 2016</xref>), raising the possibility that differences in NUP155 conformation could underlie structural heterogeneity among individual nuclear pores. Interestingly, the relative levels of individual components of the Nup93 complex varied among cell lines. For example, NUP155 protein levels were low in T-cell and myeloid cell lines compared to the adherent cells. These findings suggest that the composition of the Nup93 complex is variable among cell types. NUP155 depletion had little effect on the levels of other Nups, but likely causes changes in nuclear pore composition, as its depletion induced clear mislocalization of NUP62, NUP214, and RANBP2.</p><p>While WT HIV-1 infection of HeLa cells was not impeded by NUP155 depletion, HIV-2 and SIVmac infection was inhibited. NUP155 depletion also caused mislocalization of MX2 in both HeLa and HT1080 cells. Strikingly, while NUP155 depletion marginally reduced MX2 antiviral activity against HIV-1 (~2 fold) in non-dividing HeLa cells, it markedly enhanced (by 17-fold) anti-HIV-1 MX2 activity in non-dividing HT1080 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In this respect, NUP155 depletion rendered HT1080 cells more similar to HeLa cells: specifically, MX2 activity was not increased by growth arrest in unmanipulated HT1080 cells, but was enhanced by growth arrest in HeLa cells and NUP155-depleted HT1080 cells.</p><p>Perturbation of the NUP155 and the Nup93 complex also impacted the effect of CA mutations and CypA on HIV-1 infection. In particular, NUP155 depletion nearly abolished the CsA-dependent phenotype of HIV-1<sub>A92E</sub> in HeLa cells, while depletion of certain other Nup93 complex components (specifically NUP93 itself or NUP205) accentuated the CsA dependence of HIV-1<sub>A92E</sub>. Moreover, NUP205 depletion caused HIV-1<sub>A92E</sub> infection to become CsA-dependent in HT1080 cells. In this respect, NUP205 depletion again made HT1080 cells behave more like HeLa cells. Moreover, the striking ability of CsA to strongly inhibit HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> infection in HT1080 cells (that was not evident in HeLa cells) was nearly completely abolished by NUP155 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1 and C</xref>). Additionally, the ability of MX2 to rescue HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> infection from inhibition by CsA in HT1080 cells was reduced by NUP93 and NUP205 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>). NUP155 did not bind CA tubes in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that its effects on HIV-1 infection are indirect.</p><p>Overall, manipulations of NUP155 and other Nup93 subcomplex components recapitulated, abolished, or otherwise modified several of the key cell-type- and CA-dependent differences in the effects of CypA and MX2 on HIV-1 infection. These results suggest that the Nup93 subcomplex is a key regulator of the functional interaction between the HIV-1 CA and the nuclear pore complex, and that variation in the composition of this complex among cell types or during the cell cycle could underlie several of the discrepant effects of CA mutations, CypA, and MX2 on HIV-1 infection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The Nup62 complex</title><p>The Nup62 subcomplex in the central channel of the pore consists of NUP62, NUP54, and NUP58 (NUPL1).

However, NUP62 depletion did not result in the mislocalization of any of the other Nups tested. NUP62 depletion did not significantly inhibit HIV-1<sub>WT</sub> infection of HeLa or HT1080 cells but caused a four-fold decrease of infection of non-dividing HOS cells. In a few instances, (e.g. HIV-1<sub>WT</sub> infection of HT1080 cells and FIV infection of HeLa cells) depletion of Nup62 complex components modestly increased infection.</p><p>While NUP62 depletion did not cause mislocalization of MX2, its antiviral activity was reduced in dividing NUP62-depleted HeLa cells and, strikingly, nearly abolished in non-dividing NUP62-depleted HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Unlike HIV-1<sub>WT</sub>, HIV-1<sub>G89V</sub> infection was modestly reduced (four-fold) upon NUP62 knockdown in HeLa cells, but HIV-1<sub>G89V</sub> infection was restored by MX2 expression in NUP62 depleted HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Depletion of other NUP62 complex components had different effects on MX2 activity. Specifically, NUP54 and NUP58 depletion enhanced MX2 antiviral activity against HIV-1<sub>WT</sub> in both HeLa and HT1080 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In contrast to the striking effects on MX2 activity, manipulation of the Nup62 complex had only modest effects on CypA/CsA modulation of HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>).</p><p>That manipulation of the Nup62 complex had both positive and negative effects on MX2 activity against HIV-1, without affecting MX2 localization, suggests that it participates in HIV-1 infection.

It is the major component of the filaments on the cytoplasmic face of the NPC and has been implicated in a number of cellular activities other than nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chatel and Fahrenkrog, 2012</xref>). While RANBP2 has previously been reported to enhance HIV-1 infection, the domains required and the mechanism by which RANBP2 facilitates HIV-1 infection remain controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dharan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Di Nunzio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Meehan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schaller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>)(reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Matreyek and Engelman, 2013</xref>).

Moreover, while HIV-1<sub>G89V</sub> infection was slightly increased by MX2 in unmanipulated HT1080 cells, RANBP2 depletion caused HIV-1<sub>G89V</sub> to be inhibited by MX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>).</p><p>RANBP2 depletion changed some, but not all, of the effects of CypA on HIV-1 infection.

RANBP2 depletion also eliminated the modest (three-fold) reduction in HIV-1<sub>WT</sub> infection of CsA-treated HT1080 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Conversely, the enhancing effects of CsA addition on HIV-1<sub>A92E</sub> infectivity in HeLa cells, and the profound inhibitory effect of CsA on HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> infection in HT1080 cells were maintained when RANBP2 was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Thus, the effects of CsA addition in these contexts are not mediated by the cyclophilin homology domain of RANBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schaller et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the deleterious effects of CsA on the antiviral activity of MX2, and the ability of MX2 to rescue HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> from inhibition by CsA in HT1080 cells were maintained in RANBP2 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C–D</xref>).</p><p>A recent report has also implicated RANBP2 in stabilization of the structure of the cytoplasmic ring of the Nup107 (Y) complex, adding an essential scaffolding function to this protein, which thereby affects the local conformation of the scaffold of the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">von Appen et al., 2015</xref>).

However, MX2 activity against HIV-2 or SIVmac was unaffected.

This lack of dependence on other Nups further suggests that NUP153 helps to initiate the formation of nuclear pores. In addition to interactions with the NPC scaffold, NUP153 directly interacts with Ran, as well as with transport receptors, including TNPO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nakielny et al., 1999</xref>). NUP153 may therefore facilitate nuclear import cycles by accelerating the dissociation of cargo-transport receptor complexes. Interestingly, NUP153 interaction with the NPC is dynamic; it shuttles and/or extends between the nuclear and cytoplasmic faces of the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nakielny et al., 1999</xref>) and is only transiently associated with a given NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rabut et al., 2004b</xref>).</p><p>Like RANBP2, NUP153 has been reported to specifically enhance HIV-1 infection. Indeed, the C-terminal FG-rich region of NUP153 binds to HIV-1 CA, and has also been reported to bind integrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Nunzio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Matreyek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Woodward et al., 2009</xref>). NUP153 depletion has also been shown to perturb integration site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Marini et al., 2015</xref>). NUP153 depletion profoundly perturbed the localization of each of the Nups tested and caused reductions in the overall levels of some Nups, presumably due to its key role in initiating nuclear pore formation. It was surprising, therefore, that while NUP153 depletion reduced HIV-1<sub>WT</sub> infection of HeLa and HOS cells, the effect of NUP153 depletion on HIV-1<sub>WT</sub> infection of HT1080 cells was marginal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mutations in HIV-1 CA had variously altered effects of NUP153 depletion on infection; most strikingly, HIV-1<sub>G89V</sub> infection was unaffected by NUP153 depletion. Similarly, EIAV and FIV were unaffected by NUP153 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Although NUP153 depletion caused MX2 mislocalization in both HT1080 and HeLa cells, MX2 antiviral activity was only reduced by NUP153 depletion in HeLa cells. In fact, in common with NUP155 and RANBP2 depletion, NUP153 depletion increased MX2 activity in growth arrested HT1080 cells. Thus knockdown of three different Nups caused HT1080 cells to mimic the phenotype of HeLa, HOS, and K562 cells, in the sense that MX2 activity was enhanced by growth arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kane et al., 2013</xref>)).</p><p>The effects of NUP153 depletion on HIV-1 infection in CsA treated cells were also similar to the effects of RANBP2 depletion, rendering HIV-1<sub>WT</sub> infection CsA dependent (as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Matreyek and Engelman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schaller et al., 2011</xref>)) and exaggerating the CsA dependence of HIV-1<sub>A94E</sub> in HeLa cells. Conversely, NUP153 depletion had only a minor effect on the moderate CsA sensitivity of HIV-1<sub>WT</sub> or the extreme CsA sensitivity exhibited by HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> in HT1080 cells. Moreover, the ability of MX2 to rescue HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> from inhibition by CsA in HT1080 cells was unaffected by NUP153 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>).</p><p>The increased antiviral activity of MX2 upon depletion of some Nups, specifically in non-dividing HT1080 cells, along with the importance of NUP153 in initiating interphase NPC formation suggest the possibility that some depletions preferentially deplete nascent pores. Existing pores, while smaller in number, may retain function but may be more readily occupied by MX2. Likewise, perhaps differences in the fraction of NPCs that are assembled in interphase could underlie the cell-type dependent differences in MX2 activity observed in in non-dividing cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>CPSF6 and TNPO3</title><p>TNPO3 is a nuclear import factor for serine-arginine-rich (SR) proteins involved in RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lai et al., 2001</xref>). TNPO3 was identified as a potential HIV-1 cofactor in genome-wide RNAi screens, and then later reported to directly bind the viral integrase and CA in vitro (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Matreyek and Engelman, 2013</xref>). More recent studies indicate that the effect of TNPO3 depletion on HIV-1 infection is mediated by redistribution of the SR protein CPSF6 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Iaco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fricke et al., 2013</xref>). CPSF6 directly interacts with the viral CA via the same binding pocket as NUP153 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Matreyek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Price et al., 2012</xref>), and when re-localized to the cytoplasm, inhibits HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Although CPSF6 depletion does not significantly affect HIV-1<sub>WT</sub> infection in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), selective pressure appears to maintain CPSF6-CA interactions in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Henning et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Saito et al., 2016</xref>). Several potential explanations for maintenance of CPSF6-CA interactions have been proposed, including promoting interactions with other host factors such as NUP153 and RANBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Henning et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Price et al., 2012</xref>), evasion of cytosolic immune sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rasaiyaah et al., 2013</xref>), and the targeting of integration to transcriptionally active chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rasheedi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sowd et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We observed several CA-dependent, cell cycle-dependent, and cell-type dependent differences in sensitivity to TNPO3 and/or CPSF6 depletion that suggested additional cellular factors may influence their effect on HIV-1 infection. For example, CPSF6 depletion marginally reduced the anti-viral activity of MX2 in HeLa, but not HT1080 cells, irrespective of cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Conversely, while TNPO3 depletion reduced antiviral activity of MX2 in dividing HeLa and HOS cells, TNPO3 depletion enhanced MX2 antiviral activity in non-dividing cells of both types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). The CPSF6 binding interface is also conserved in HIV-2 and SIVmac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Price et al., 2012</xref>), and we found that these viruses were particularly sensitive (more so than HIV-1) to TNPO3 depletion <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">(Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>), further supporting the importance of this interaction for primate lentivirus infection.</p><p>While CPSF6 depletion has little effect on WT HIV-1 infection in these in vitro assays, infection by HIV-1<sub>T210K</sub> and HIV-1<sub>G89V</sub> was increased by CPSF6 depletion, in a cell-type specific manner. Conversely, HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> infection was inhibited by either TNPO3 or CPSF6 knockdown, only in HOS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, CPSF6 depletion modified the effect of CsA in a cell type dependent manner. CPSF6 depletion caused HIV-1<sub>WT</sub> to be marginally more infectious in HT1080 cells and completely resistant to inhibition by CsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Moreover, the CsA-dependence of HIV-1<sub>A92E</sub> in HeLa cells and CsA-sensitivity of HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> in HT1080 cells was markedly reduced by CPSF6 knockdown. Curiously, the effects of CPSF6 depletion were reminiscent of the effects of NUP155 depletion, in that they similarly reduced the respective CsA-induced enhancement or inhibition of HIV-1<sub>WT</sub>, HIV-1<sub>A92E</sub>, and HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>). However, the effects of NUP155 were not the result of changes in CPSF6 localization, which was unaltered by NUP155 knockdown.</p><p>The effects of CPSF6 on HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> mutant were surprising given that studies indicate that N57 is critical for interaction with CPSF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Matreyek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Price et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, since NUP153 binds CA in this pocket, it was expected that HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> would be NUP153-independent, as has been shown for HIV-1<sub>N57A</sub> in HOS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Matreyek et al., 2013</xref>). However, while HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> infection was indeed largely insensitive to NUP153 depletion in HOS and HT1080 cells, HIV-1<sub>WT</sub> and HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> were equivalently sensitive to NUP153 knockdown in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Despite the pleiotropic effects, KPNB1 depletion only moderately inhibited HIV-1 infection in HeLa cells, in a manner that was accentuated by aphidicolin treatment. KPNB1 depletion had a smaller effect on HIV-1<sub>WT</sub> infection in HT1080 cells but caused a large accentuation of MX2 activity. Indeed HIV-1 infection was inhibited by ~200 fold in non-dividing HT1080 cells depleted of KPNB1. Notably, depletion of KPNB1 slightly sensitized EIAV and FIV to MX2. HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> was strikingly inhibited by KPNB1 depletion, and the ability of MX2 to reverse CypA induced inhibition of HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub> infection was abolished by KPNB1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>).

Our data highlight the complexity of the interaction between HIV-1, the NPC, and other cellular proteins that interact with the HIV-1 CA and reveal heterogeneity in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking both within and between cells that influences viral infection and susceptibility to an innate immune effector. These findings should inform future efforts to uncover the precise nature of NPC heterogeneity and the interaction between HIV-1 and cellular proteins involved in viral nuclear entry.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The LKO-derived tetracycline-inducible lentiviral expression vector was modified from the previously described pLKO.dCMV.TetO/R (pLKOΔ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busnadiego et al., 2014</xref>).

HeLa cells were cultivated with or without 500 ng/µl doxycycline for a minimum of 16 hr. The cells were then lysed for pull-down experiments by adding passive lysis buffer (Promega) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). NaCl concentration in lysates was adjusted to 2M and lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 2 min at 4°C. Then the supernatant of the cell lysates were added to the preformed CA tubes and incubated at 4°C for 2 hr. Following centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 2 min at 4°C, the supernatant was saved and the pellet was washed three times with the high-salt buffer. NuPage LDS Sample buffer (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 50 mM DTT was added to all the samples including pulled-down and unbound fractions and subjected to SDS-PAGE.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wenhui Li as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Olivier Schwartz (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper by Bieniasz and colleagues represents a tremendous effort towards understanding the complex interplay between HIV-1, MxB, CypA, and the nuclear pore complex. All three reviewers commented on the exceptionally comprehensive nature of the work (&quot;Herculean in terms of its informational content&quot;), which will likely make it an instant &quot;classic&quot; after publication.</p><p>The work presented will, indeed, help explain many of the inconsistencies in the literature. It importantly attacks the issue of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in HIV infection and Mx2 antiviral activity. It does a great job tying together different aspects of the literature amassed over the prior 10+ years in terms of CA, the NPC, and HIV infection.</p><p>The authors assess antiviral activity of Mx2 with WT HIV and numerous CA mutants as a function of cellular CypA as well as NUP and NTR content using three cell-line models (HeLa, HT1080, and HOS), which were chosen based on their sensitivity to siRNA.</p><p>The results presented indicate that the impact of Mx2 depends on the cell type, with interesting observations of Mx2 increasing HIV-1 infectivity in some conditions. It is further shown that HIV CA interacts with several nucleoporins. The authors also studied the impact of Nups knockdown on nuclear import of non-viral cargos and on HIV-1 infectivity. It is shown that the effects of the knockdown a given Nup are difficult to interpret, since this silencing may also dysregulate many other Nups. The effects of Nups depletion on HIV infectivity depend on the cell type, the cell cycle, or the presence of CsA. Therefore, HIV may use different nuclear pore complexes composed of different sets of Nups to access the nucleus. These different NPCs vary in different cell types and are differently targeted by Mx2. Experiments to assess whether Mx2 inhibits nuclear location of artificial GFP-lacZ constructs engineered to harbor heterologous NLS sequences are also included. Several different lentiviruses and retroviruses are used in the experiments.</p><p>Taken together, this manuscript provides a comprehensive framework that reveals the previously unappreciated importance and variability of nuclear pores on retroviral infection.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers recognize that this is already a very complex study but feel that some additional clarifications would strengthen the overall conclusions. These requests are divided into the following main categories:</p><p>1) Improve the readability of the manuscript:</p><p>- There are numerous western panels, which authors unfortunately present out of context, at many times just slices of immunoblots. This reporting style is unacceptable at many journals. Minimally, positions of migration standards should be shown alongside all panels.</p><p>- Because of the sheer amount of data presented in the figures, the readers will benefit from some schematic guide. The presentation style in Figure 4, specifically the diagram of the nuclear pore, is greatly appreciated. A smaller version of this nuclear pore in each relevant figure would help (like was done with Figure 6—figure supplement 1). More substantial figure legends and perhaps summary tables may also help orient readers and parse all of the information.</p><p>2) Address the following considerations regarding the CA binding/pelleting assay used:</p><p>- This is not a novel assay but rather a standard Capsid binding assay conducted in physiologically irrelevant high salt (2M) concentration. Please re-phrase.</p><p>- The high-salt condition (2M NaCl) may actually have unforeseen consequences on which proteins are seen binding to CA. It could be considered a very stringent assay in terms of electrostatic interactions. In fact, it is somewhat surprising that MxB co-pelleted under this condition, as the interaction likely has a strong electrostatic nature (it is known that the charged RRR at MxB N-terminus is important for binding). This may hint the MxB-capsid interaction is greatly enhanced either by avidity effect (oligomerization) or by very high local concentration when fixed at the NPC.</p><p>- However, very high salt could enhance artifactual hydrophobic protein interactions, especially considering the inherent hydrophobicity of FG repeat containing proteins. Others who previously assessed binding of NUP153, e.g., to CA-based nanotubes performed assays under physiologically relevant salt (e.g., PBS), and the binding results here in 2M salt with different Nups do not always correlate with HIV-1 infection profile. Have authors tested binding in PBS? If so, how do these results compare to binding at high salt?</p><p>- Minimally, the potential for high salt to enhance binding artifacts should be discussed.</p><p>3) Include cell viability controls under different knockdown conditions (optimally, growth rate):</p><p>- One expects that depletion of some (several?) of the targeted factors to grossly effect cell physiology, which could be assessed by cell growth rate, viability, cell cycle status, etc. Although authors do a fair amount of controls, including impressive cross-monitoring of all NUPs upon single NUP depletion, they provide basically no data assessing cell fitness outside of virus infection. In subsection “KPNB1” they state KPNB1 knockdown induced growth arrest, so it sounds like they have some of the relevant data. I realize at 35 (many multi-panel) figures we may already be looking at a record, but I nevertheless think it is critical to document impacts on cell physiology caused by the knockdowns.</p><p>4) Provide additional information regarding Mx2 experiments:</p><p>- Please show Mx2 induction in the different engineered cell lines by western blot.</p><p>- Also clarify the statement regarding MxB &quot;enhancement&quot; of HIV infectivity, since MxB expression is returning infectivity to the wild-type level. It only modestly rescues gross infectivity defects in certain CA mutational backgrounds, which is different from promoting infection.</p><p>5) Provide some evidence for whether or not primary human cells resemble any of the cell types tested in terms of Nups composition:</p><p>- It would have been useful to validate, at least, some of the results in HIV-1-infected primary cells to increase the relevance of the findings. Detailed protein expression profiles of primary human T cells or macrophages from healthy donors would add significance to the detailed NUP profiles reported for the cell lines.</p><p>6) Strengthen the statistic components of the manuscript:</p><p>- The number of experimental replicates across the board must be clarified. Although authors tabulate number of experimental repeats and variance (error bars) for infection experiments, one shortcoming is that they do not analyze samples cross wise to reveal which of the documented changes are significant (generally assessed as P &lt; 0.05). Though generally important and required for publication, statistics really apply here as authors highlight differential effects of certain NUP depletions on virus infection in different cell types. As but one example in the Results, they highlight comparatively marginal role for RANBP2 in HT1080 and HOS cells as compared to HeLa cells.

We have addressed each individual reviewer comment below and revised the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>Among the salient modifications the manuscript is the inclusion of the following new figures/supplements:</p><p>· Statistical analyses for all experiments involving viral infectivity (Supplementary file 1)</p><p>· Western blot analysis showing Mx2 expression (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B)</p><p>· Western blot analysis showing Nup and NTR expression in primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and macrophages (Figure 2—figure supplements 2 and 3)</p><p>· CA binding assay with HIV-1<sub>N74D</sub> (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B)</p><p>· Cell-cycle profiles following Nup/NTR siRNA transfection (Figure 5—figure supplements 7 and 8)</p><p>· Schematic diagram summarizing the effect of Mx2 on NLS-GFP-lacZ nuclear import (Figure 12B)</p><p>· Addition of the nuclear pore diagram to several relevant figures, to improve readability highlighting nucleoporins of interest where necessary (Figure 2B, Figure 3B, Figure 5, Figure 7C, and Figure 8C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers recognize that this is already a very complex study but feel that some additional clarifications would strengthen the overall conclusions. These requests are divided into the following main categories:</p><p>1) Improve the readability of the manuscript:</p><p>- There are numerous western panels, which authors unfortunately present out of context, at many times just slices of immunoblots. This reporting style is unacceptable at many journals. Minimally, positions of migration standards should be shown alongside all panels.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added migration standards to the blots wherever it was feasible to do so without over cluttering the figures. Specifically, migration standards are now shown in Figures 1B, Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 8—figure supplements 2B and C. Since the same antibodies were used for Figures 3 and 5, migration standards were not included for these figures but we have marked the bands shown in smaller gel slices in Figure 3A, Figure 5—figure supplements 3-7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Because of the sheer amount of data presented in the figures, the readers will benefit from some schematic guide. The presentation style in Figure 4, specifically the diagram of the nuclear pore, is greatly appreciated. A smaller version of this nuclear pore in each relevant figure would help (like was done with Figure 6—figure supplement 1). More substantial figure legends and perhaps summary tables may also help orient readers and parse all of the information.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the nuclear pore diagram in several figures (Figure 2B, Figure 3B, Figure 5, Figure 7C, and Figure 8C). In Figures 3 and 7, the diagrams highlight the nucleoporins investigated for CA binding or co-localization, respectively. We have also included a schematic summarizing the effect of Mx2 on nuclear import of NLS-GFP-lacZ fusion proteins (Figure 12B). We have also gone through the figure legends and tried to edit/extend for clarity where possible and appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Address the following considerations regarding the CA binding/pelleting assay used:</p><p>- This is not a novel assay but rather a standard Capsid binding assay conducted in physiologically irrelevant high salt (2M) concentration. Please re-phrase.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the confusion regarding this point. This assay is distinct from those that have previously been reported, as it uses tubes assembled using only the CA protein, rather than CA-NC and ssDNA. The formation of CA-NC tubes has a propensity to pull-down non-specific charge-charge based interactions due to the presence of the highly charged NC and ssDNA in the assay. We have modified the text to clarify this point (subsection “Multiple Nups bind HIV-1 CA tubes in vitro.”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The high-salt condition (2M NaCl) may actually have unforeseen consequences on which proteins are seen binding to CA. It could be considered a very stringent assay in terms of electrostatic interactions. In fact, it is somewhat surprising that MxB co-pelleted under this condition, as the interaction likely has a strong electrostatic nature (it is known that the charged RRR at MxB N-terminus is important for binding). This may hint the MxB-capsid interaction is greatly enhanced either by avidity effect (oligomerization) or by very high local concentration when fixed at the NPC.</p></disp-quote><p>We do agree that 2M NaCl required for in vitro formation of CA tubes is represents a deviation from physiological conditions, but this is the only approach that allows the formation of biologically relevant CA tubes, as evidenced by cryo-EM structure of CA in complex with CypA in the presence of 2.25M NaCl (Liu et al., 2016). Furthermore, our assays have reliably revealed biologically relevant interactions (see below). The multiple washes performed after the pull-down assays allow us to remove unintended contaminants (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>2M NaCl can stabilize specific hydrophobic protein-protein contacts, but to our knowledge, there is no evidence that this NaCl concentration can trigger non-specific protein-protein interactions. Normally, NaCl in excess of 5M is required to observe unintended assemblies of proteins. It is true that 2M NaCl will interfere with protein-nucleic acid or protein-protein interactions that are primarily driven by charge-charge interactions. However, our experimental conditions are suitable for monitoring of protein-protein binding mediated by both ionic and hydrophobic interactions (such as CA interactions with Nups and Mx2). We have also included an additional figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B) which demonstrates CA interactions with CPSF6 are ablated by a single amino acid substitution (N74D, a single charge change).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- However, very high salt could enhance artifactual hydrophobic protein interactions, especially considering the inherent hydrophobicity of FG repeat containing proteins. Others who previously assessed binding of NUP153, e.g., to CA-based nanotubes performed assays under physiologically relevant salt (e.g., PBS), and the binding results here in 2M salt with different Nups do not always correlate with HIV-1 infection profile. Have authors tested binding in PBS? If so, how do these results compare to binding at high salt?</p><p>- Minimally, the potential for high salt to enhance binding artifacts should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, see (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B) regarding the specificity of interactions, and not that the CPSF6-CA interaction involves a FG dipeptide. Additionally, as we noted in the text (subsection “Multiple Nups bind HIV-1 CA tubes <italic>in vitro</italic>.”), due to the multiple complex interactions between Nups, and the dramatic pleiotropic effects of Nup depletion, one would not necessarily expect CA binding to directly correlated with the effect of a specific Nup depletion. Furthermore, Nup88 does not contain FG repeats, indicating that hydrophobic FG-CA interactions are likely insufficient to explain our observations.</p><p>It is well established that CA tubes dissociate when NaCl concentrations are lowered to physiological levels, such as those in PBS. We have made similar observations, and this precluded us from conduction pull-down assays under these conditions.</p><p>The reasons for selecting high salt conditions are discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Include cell viability controls under different knockdown conditions (optimally, growth rate):</p><p>- One expects that depletion of some (several?) of the targeted factors to grossly effect cell physiology, which could be assessed by cell growth rate, viability, cell cycle status, etc. Although authors do a fair amount of controls, including impressive cross-monitoring of all NUPs upon single NUP depletion, they provide basically no data assessing cell fitness outside of virus infection. In subsection “KPNB1” they state KPNB1 knockdown induced growth arrest, so it sounds like they have some of the relevant data. I realize at 35 (many multi-panel) figures we may already be looking at a record, but I nevertheless think it is critical to document impacts on cell physiology caused by the knockdowns.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have included cell-cycle profiles of for HeLa and HOS cells upon Nup depletion (Figure 5—figure supplements 7 and 8), which indicate some effect on cell cycle status, as we had previously indicated. Unfortunately, we were not able produce interpretable data from HT1080 in this assay. Additionally, the western blots showing LaminB1 and tubulin following Nup or NTR depletion serve as a proxy for viability of cells at the time of viral infection. Perhaps the most sensitive assay for perturbation of cell physiology is sensitivity of retroviral infection as we note, in the manuscript, FIV and EIAV infection are not dramatically affected by Nup knockdowns. Since each Nup or NTR had distinctive effects on infectivity depending on the virus or CA sequence, and on the nuclear import of Mx2(N25)-GFP-lacZ or SV40(NLS)-GFP-lacZ, and does not affect CPSF6 localization this indicates that the consequences of individual knockdowns were more specific than an aggregate effect on cell physiology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Provide additional information regarding Mx2 experiments:</p><p>- Please show Mx2 induction in the different engineered cell lines by western blot.</p></disp-quote><p>This data is now included (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Also clarify the statement regarding MxB &quot;enhancement&quot; of HIV infectivity, since MxB expression is returning infectivity to the wild-type level. It only modestly rescues gross infectivity defects in certain CA mutational backgrounds, which is different from promoting infection.</p></disp-quote><p>In certain instances, the effect of Mx2 on the infectivity in some instances is well beyond modest, as in the case of N57S infection in CsA treated HT1080 cells. We do however, take the reviewers point and have changed ‘enhancement’ to ‘increase’ or ‘rescue’ in several instances. At no point do we describe these phenotypes as ‘promoting’ infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Provide some evidence for whether or not primary human cells resemble any of the cell types tested in terms of Nups composition:</p><p>- It would have been useful to validate, at least, some of the results in HIV-1-infected primary cells to increase the relevance of the findings. Detailed protein expression profiles of primary human T cells or macrophages from healthy donors would add significance to the detailed NUP profiles reported for the cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have included expression Western blot analyses of Nup expression in primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and macrophages from two healthy donors in Figure 2—figure supplements 2 and 3. This data reinforces our claim that Nup expression is heterogeneous among various cell types. This data is discussed in subsection “Variation in Nup expression among cell lines”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Strengthen the statistic components of the manuscript:</p><p>- The number of experimental replicates across the board must be clarified. Although authors tabulate number of experimental repeats and variance (error bars) for infection experiments, one shortcoming is that they do not analyze samples cross wise to reveal which of the documented changes are significant (generally assessed as P &lt; 0.05). Though generally important and required for publication, statistics really apply here as authors highlight differential effects of certain NUP depletions on virus infection in different cell types. As but one example in the Results, they highlight comparatively marginal role for RANBP2 in HT1080 and HOS cells as compared to HeLa cells. Are the requirements for RANBP2 in HT1018 and HOS significant or not? This is but one example; paper would be best served if all results are analyzed for significance, and resulting p values reported.</p><p>- p value analyses must be included for the innumerable comparisons that they make in text. Minimally, all text callouts to differences between samples, large or small, should be accompanied with stated p value.</p><p>- The Authors indicate in legends the number of repeats for the infection experiments, though generally fail to note numbers of times results were seen for other experimental approaches. Please also add this info to legends. In the manuscript heatmaps are used to summarize western blot results, which presumably analyzed several independent westerns. In such cases, indicate number of replicates behind the heatmaps, and that (one assumes) the associated blotting panels show a representative replicate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included an additional Supplementary file (Supplementary file 1) which includes the following statistical analyses for all infectivity results:</p><p>1) P-values for the infectivity data shown in Figure 1 (Tab: Figure 1 Statistics)</p><p>– Effect of Mx2 in dividing and non-dividing cells</p><p>– Comparison of dividing and non-dividing cells</p><p>– Effect of CsA in dividing and non-dividing cells</p><p>– Effect of CsA on Mx2 activity in dividing and non-dividing cells</p><p>2) Analysis of significance of effects observed upon Nup/NTR depletion (Tab: Nup NTR Knockdown Statistics 1)</p><p>– Effect of siRNA knockdown on infectivity of HIV-1, other lentiviruses, and HIV-1 CA mutants</p><p>– Effect of siRNA knockdown on Mx2 activity against HIV-1, other lentiviruses, and HIV-1 CA mutants</p><p>– Effect of siRNA knockdown on the effect of CsA on the infection of WT HIV-1, HIV-1<sub>A92E</sub>, and HIV-1<sub>N57S</sub>.</p><p>– Effect of siRNA knockdown on Mx2 activity in the presence of CsA</p><p>– Effect of siRNA knockdown on Mx2(N91)-Arfaptin2 activity against HIV-1</p><p>3) Comparison of effects observed upon Nup/NTR depletion (Tab: Nup NTR Knockdown Statistics 2)</p><p>– Comparison of the effect of siRNA depletion on HIV-1, other lentiviruses, and HIV-1 CA mutants in HeLa, HT1080, and HOS cells</p><p>– Comparison of the effect of siRNA depletion on WT HIV-1 infection versus other lentiviruses, and HIV-1 CA mutants</p><p>– Comparison of the effect of siRNA depletion on Mx2 activity on WT HIV-1 infection versus other lentiviruses, and HIV-1 CA mutants</p><p>– Comparison of the effect of siRNA depletion on CsA activity on WT HIV-1 and HIV-1<sub>A92E</sub> infection</p><p>– Comparison on the effect of siRNA depletion on the antiviral activity of Mx2 vs Mx2(N91)-Arfaptin2</p><p>Since each figure includes error bars and stated replicates, the effect sizes do not always correlate with the determined p-value, and the addition of p-values would substantially decrease the readability of the manuscript, we hope that this comprehensive file of statistics satisfies this criticism. The phenotypes highlighted for discussion in the text were chosen for effect size, novelty and/or interest based on what has already been reported to play a role in HIV-1 infection. Obviously we could not discuss every single data point in this paper, but any interested reader is free to examine the comprehensive data and statistics now provided.</p><p>Regarding the heat maps, they are intended as an alternative visual representation of the numerous blots shown in the accompanying figures, and represent only the blots shown. The figure legends have been modified to clarify this point and indicate how many replicates of blots were conducted for each experiment. We have ensured that each legend for all types of experimentation now indicates how many experiments were conducted and the number of replicates and that the data presented are representative.</p></body></sub-article></article>
