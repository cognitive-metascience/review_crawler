the earliest postzygotic isolating mechanisms to evolve between two recently diverged species. Here we identify causes underlying hybrid infertility of two recently diverged fission yeast species <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>S. kambucha</italic>, which mate to form viable hybrid diploids that efficiently complete meiosis, but generate few viable gametes. We find that chromosomal rearrangements and related recombination defects are major but not sole causes of hybrid infertility. At least three distinct meiotic drive alleles, one on each <italic>S. kambucha</italic> chromosome, independently contribute to hybrid infertility by causing nonrandom spore death. Two of these driving loci are linked by a chromosomal translocation and thus constitute a novel type of paired meiotic drive complex.

New species are created via a process called speciation, and nature employs various ‘barriers’ to keep closely related species distinct from one another. One of these barriers is called hybrid sterility. Horses and donkeys, for example, can mate to produce hybrids called mules, but mules cannot produce offspring of their own because they are infertile.</p><p>Hybrid sterility can occur for a number of reasons. Mules are infertile because they inherit 32 chromosomes from their horse parent, but only 31 chromosomes from their donkey parent—and so have an odd chromosome that they cannot pair-off when they make sperm or egg cells. However, even if a hybrid inherits the same number of chromosomes from each parent, if the chromosomes from the two parents have different structures, the hybrid may still be infertile.</p><p>Zanders et al. have now looked at two species of fission yeast—<italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. kambucha</italic>—that share 99.5% of their DNA sequence. Although hybrids of these two species inherit three chromosomes from each parent, the majority of spores (the yeast equivalent of sperm) that these hybrids produce fail to develop into new yeast cells. Zanders et al. identified two causes of this infertility: one of these was chromosomal rearrangement; the other was due to three different sites in the DNA of <italic>S. kambucha</italic> that interfere with the development of the spores that inherit <italic>S. pombe</italic> chromosomes.</p><p>Since these two yeast species are so closely related, the findings of Zanders et al. reveal how quickly multiple barriers to fertility can arise. In addition, these findings provide further support for models in which conflicts between different genes in genomes can drive the process of speciation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02630.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02630.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>speciation</kwd><kwd>meiotic drive</kwd><kwd>chromosomal rearrangement</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM031693</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Gerald R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Harmit Singh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001229</institution-id><institution>G Harold and Leila Y.

Hybrid sterility is one of the earliest reproductive isolation mechanisms to evolve between two recently diverged species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coyne and Orr, 2004</xref>), yet we are only beginning to understand the types of genetic changes that lead to hybrid infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coyne and Orr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Presgraves, 2010</xref>). Since the evolutionary forces driving genetic changes that cause infertility between species are likely also acting within species, the study of hybrid sterility also promises significant insight into mechanisms underlying infertility within species.</p><p>The (Bateson) Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) model provided a solution to the paradox of how genetic changes that lead to speciation could be tolerated by natural selection despite decreasing the fitness potential of an organism. This model proposes that hybrid sterility results from incompatibilities between genes that evolved in different populations and were therefore never tested together by natural selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coyne and Orr, 2004</xref>). Indeed, incompatible BDM pairs have been identified in diverse organisms that either cause hybrid sterility or reinforce species isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brideau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayes and Malik, 2009</xref>). Although relatively few loci underlying hybrid incompatibilities have been identified, one theme that has emerged is that the loci are often rapidly evolving and implicated as players in ‘molecular evolutionary arms races’. These arms races can occur between host genomes and external forces such as parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bomblies et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, the genetic conflicts can be between different elements <italic>within</italic> a genome, such as between selfish parasitic genes and other host genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Presgraves, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Despite their explanatory power, DM incompatibilities are not exclusive causes of hybrid infertility. For instance, changes in ploidy are a rapid means of speciation in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Otto and Whitton, 2000</xref>). Defects in meiotic recombination contribute to hybrid infertility in both mouse and budding yeast hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hunter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharyya et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mihola et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, genomic rearrangements can also cause or contribute to speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">White, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faria and Navarro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoffmann and Rieseberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Noor et al., 2001</xref>). In the classic chromosomal speciation model, chromosomal rearrangements between populations lead to infertility when heterozygous. Like DM gene incompatibilities, chromosomal rearrangements can contribute to hybrid infertility and serve as a genetic barrier between populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">White, 1978</xref>). For example, the transposition of an essential fertility gene causes male infertility in some <italic>Drosophila</italic> hybrids and chromosomal rearrangements contribute to hybrid infertility in some budding yeast hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masly et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delneri et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>How do chromosomal rearrangements become established in organisms in which they cause infertility when heterozygous? One possibility is that a rearrangement could become fixed in a small population via genetic drift and inbreeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rieseberg, 2001</xref>). White proposed an alternative solution in which novel chromosomal rearrangements could increase in frequency if they were linked to meiotic drive alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">White, 1978</xref>). These selfish genetic elements ‘cheat’ to be transmitted to more than 50% of the functional gametes of a heterozygote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burt and Trivers, 2006</xref>). Due to their transmission advantage, meiotic drive alleles and loci linked to them can spread through a population even if they cause fertility decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crow, 1991</xref>). In this way, even a chromosomal rearrangement that causes decreased fertility when heterozygous could become fixed in a population if it is linked to a strong meiotic drive allele. Because loci linked to drive alleles also benefit from the transmission advantage, linked variants that enhance drive will also be selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crow, 1991</xref>). Chromosome inversions that prevent recombination thereby reinforcing the linkage between drive alleles and their enhancers can also spread through a population due to enhanced drive. In this way, meiotic drive alleles can even <italic>promote the evolution</italic> of chromosomal rearrangements, in spite of their fitness costs. Consistent with this, meiotic drive loci are commonly found within inversions and have been proposed to underlie other types of dramatic karyotype evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larracuente and Presgraves, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pardo-Manuel de Villena and Sapienza, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hammer et al., 1989</xref>). However, there is currently little experimental or theoretical support for White's model; genetic conflicts and chromosomal rearrangements are still considered distinct causes of hybrid sterility and speciation.</p><p>Here, we show that a combination of selfish meiotic drive loci and chromosomal rearrangements leads to near complete hybrid sterility between two recently diverged fission yeast species. This study provides support for models in which selfish genetic elements and chromosomal rearrangements are drivers of hybrid dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Presgraves, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">White, 1978</xref>). Our observations in fission yeast are consistent with White's chromosomal speciation model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids have low spore viability</title><p><italic>S. pombe</italic> (<italic>Sp</italic>) and <italic>S. kambucha</italic> (<italic>Sk</italic>) generally exist as single-celled haploids, but cells of opposite mating types readily mate to form single-celled diploids. Fission yeasts are homothallic; they can switch mating types during mitotic growth and self-mate effectively. Although there is evidence of genetic outcrossing in yeasts closely related to <italic>Sp</italic>, the relative frequencies of outcrossing vs selfing are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Sp</italic> are 99.5% identical at the DNA sequence level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rhind et al., 2011</xref>). Despite their genetic similarity, <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrid diploids are mostly infertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Singh and Klar, 2002</xref>). To investigate the causes of the hybrid infertility, we generated a suite of genetic markers (‘Materials and methods’) that transformed <italic>Sk</italic> from a non-model yeast into a distinct genetically tractable model system. In addition to their use in this study of fertility, these tools will also facilitate molecular dissection of the functional consequences of evolution between fission yeast species.</p><p><italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrid diploids displayed no obvious mitotic defects, indicating there are no dominant lethal incompatibilities between the two species that act during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). To assay hybrid fertility, we measured the viable spore yield of <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids, <italic>Sk/Sk</italic>, and <italic>Sp/Sp</italic> diploids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith, 2009</xref>). This assay measures the number of viable spores (gametes) produced per viable diploid placed on the starvation medium that induces cells to undergo meiosis. Spores are considered viable if they are able to grow into a visible colony. Because cells can undergo a few mitotic divisions prior to meiosis and not all spores can be recovered from the starvation medium, the assay is a relative, rather than an absolute, measure. <italic>Sk/Sk</italic> diploids had a slightly lower viable spore yield than <italic>Sp/Sp</italic> diploids, 3.6 vs 8.4 (unpaired <italic>t</italic> test p=0.053; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, when assayed via micromanipulation of individual spores, spores derived from <italic>Sp/Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk/Sk</italic> diploids were equally viable. We therefore conclude that the difference between <italic>Sp/Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk/Sk</italic> diploids in the viable spore yield assay is due to an extra mitosis of <italic>Sp/Sp</italic> diploids before meiotic induction, not higher viability of gametes. In sharp contrast, <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids had a viable spore yield at least 24-fold less than that of either of the pure species diploids (<italic>t</italic> test p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02630.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids are healthy but exhibit low fertility.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrid diploids are morphologically similar to pure species diploids.

To test this possibility, we monitored meiotic progression through a time course. Using DAPI staining of cells, we found that <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids initiated and completed both meiotic nuclear divisions with similar timing and efficiency compared to <italic>Sp/Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk/Sk</italic> diploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggest that spore inviability in products of hybrid meiosis is not due to an inability to enter meiosis or due to checkpoint activation preventing the completion of the meiotic divisions. However, we did find that the spores produced by <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids were more irregular and less refractile than those produced by pure species diploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the viable spores produced by <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids grew into colonies that were grossly different from those of pure species controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). There were a few large colonies from the hybrid spores, but most were small and many had irregularly shaped edges, rather than large colonies with smooth circular perimeters like those produced by pure species spores. When the small hybrid spore colonies were streaked for single colonies on fresh Petri plates, some cells within the colony lost the slow growth phenotype and generated colonies similar in size to those of <italic>Sp</italic> or <italic>Sk</italic> haploids.</p><p>These phenotypes are consistent with the small colonies being chromosome 3 aneuploids (disomes); aneuploidy for chromosome 1 or 2 is lethal in <italic>Sp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Niwa et al., 2006</xref>). To formally test this idea, we measured the frequency of heterozygous aneuploids amongst viable spores using co-dominant heterozygous markers at allelic loci (one on the <italic>Sk</italic> chromosome and one on the <italic>Sp</italic> chromosome). Spores that inherited both markers on chromosome 2 were heterozygous diploids. Spores that inherited both markers on chromosome 3, but only one marker from chromosome 2, were heterozygous aneuploids. Homozygous diploids and aneuploids were not detectable with the markers used here and were counted as haploids. From <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids, 33% of the viable spores were heterozygous aneuploids and 44% were heterozygous diploid, significantly more than the 2.2 and 3.5%, respectively, observed in <italic>Sk</italic> control diploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; p&lt;0.01 for both; G-test).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Meiotic double-strand DNA break formation and repair appears normal in <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids</title><p>One possible explanation for the low fertility and the high frequency of aneuploids and diploids we observed in <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids, is that these hybrids may have defects in meiotic recombination. In many eukaryotes, meiotic recombination is essential for the production of viable gametes. This is because recombination can form crossovers, which help ensure proper disjunction of homologous chromosome pairs during the first meiotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kerr et al., 2012</xref>). When a pair of homologous chromosomes fails to form a crossover in meiosis, chromosomes segregate less faithfully and can produce aneuploid gametes. In both budding yeast and mouse hybrids, defects in meiotic recombination are major causes of hybrid infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hunter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharyya et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mihola et al., 2009</xref>). These observations, combined with rapid evolution of genes that function in meiotic recombination, have led to the hypothesis that recombination defects serve as a general barrier to genetic exchange between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rhind et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sawyer and Malik, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myers et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore tested whether meiotic recombination is aberrant in <italic>Sp/Sk</italic> hybrids.</p><p>Meiotic recombination is initiated by double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) induced by a complex of proteins including the conserved Spo11 protein (Rec12 in fission yeast). In many organisms, including <italic>Sp</italic>, meiotic DSBs are not randomly distributed; rather they are concentrated in regions called hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cromie et al., 2007</xref>). DSB hotspots are thought to evolve rapidly because they can be lost due to biased gene conversion during break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boulton et al., 1997</xref>). Perhaps related to this, rapid divergence of a DSB hotspot-determining protein contributes to infertility of certain mouse hybrids and some human males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mihola et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Segurel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baudat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Irie et al., 2009</xref>). To test if DSB hotspot divergence contributes to <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrid infertility, we mapped the locations of <italic>Sk</italic> DSB hotspots. Rec12 remains covalently linked to the DNA it cuts, so DSB sites can be mapped by identifying the DNA linked to Rec12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>). To do this in <italic>Sk</italic>, we first generated a strain containing a FLAG-tagged <italic>rec12</italic> gene and the <italic>rad50S</italic> mutation in which DSBs form normally but are not repaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alani et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hyppa et al., 2008</xref>). We then used chromatin immunoprecipitation on meiotic extracts to pull down Rec12-FLAG and the covalently attached DNA. We identified the bound DNA by amplification and hybridization to a microarray. Qualitatively, we found that the overall genome-wide pattern of DSB hotspots in <italic>Sk</italic> was similar to the published <italic>Sp</italic> hotspot map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cromie et al., 2007</xref>).

To observe DSB formation, we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of whole chromosomes in <italic>rad50S</italic> hybrid and control diploids. We found that like those of pure species, the <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> chromosomes were effectively broken in meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For a more precise view of DSB formation in hybrids, we assayed break formation in <italic>rad50S</italic> diploids at known meiotic DSB hotspots contained on the <italic>Not</italic>I restriction fragments designated ‘J’ (0.5 Mb) and ‘D’ (1.1 Mb) of the <italic>Sp</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cromie et al., 2007</xref>). We found that both <italic>Sk</italic> and hybrid diploids exhibited similar amounts of breakage at the same sites, in accord with the microarray results above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). To assay DSB repair, we visualized meiotic chromosomes via PFGE in <italic>rad50</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> (DSB repair proficient) diploids. As in pure species, chromosomes of <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> diploids were largely intact throughout meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This shows that the breaks that form (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) are efficiently repaired. Together, these results suggest that DSB formation is grossly normal in <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids and that the breaks are repaired efficiently.</p><p>Meiotic recombination promotes fertility but is not essential for producing viable spores in <italic>Sp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis and Smith, 2003</xref>). This is largely because random segregation of three chromosome pairs at the first meiotic division would frequently (∼25% of the time) result in a viable chromosome complement: haploid, diploid, or chromosome 3 disome. In addition, <italic>Sp</italic>, like some other species, has a recombination-independent chromosome segregation system that is partially effective in promoting proper chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis and Smith, 2003</xref>). As expected, when we eliminated nearly all meiotic recombination by deleting <italic>rec12</italic> (<italic>rec12Δ</italic>), both <italic>Sp/Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk/Sk rec12Δ</italic> mutant diploids had viable spore yields fourfold to fivefold lower than the corresponding <italic>rec12</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> diploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Surprisingly, a similar decrease in fertility was not observed in <italic>rec12Δ Sk/Sp</italic> hybrid diploids: their viable spore yield was indistinguishable from that of <italic>rec12</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> hybrid diploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This result demonstrates that recombination does not promote <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrid fertility, unlike in pure species. This could be because <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids fail to form crossovers and/or because the recombination events that occur in hybrids hurt fertility just as much as they promote it.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02630.016</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Recombination does not alter <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrid fertility.</title><p>The average <italic>rec12</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> viable spore yield of each diploid was divided by that of the corresponding r<italic>ec12Δ</italic> mutant.

To address this latter possibility, we resequenced the <italic>Sk</italic> genome (‘Materials and methods’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rhind et al., 2011</xref>), which revealed that a large region of chromosome 1 (between base pairs 2,683,632 and 4,911,515) is inverted in the <italic>Sp</italic> genome, relative to <italic>Sk</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). This inversion has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Teresa Avelar et al., 2013</xref>) and it occurred in the <italic>Sp</italic> lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2011</xref>). Odd numbers of crossovers within this inversion would cause lethal chromosomal rearrangements (duplications of one arm and deletion of the other). This would cause spore inviability and likely explains why <italic>rec12</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids do not have higher fertility than <italic>rec12Δ</italic> hybrids, since odd numbers of crossovers within the inversion would likely impair viable spore recovery as much as an absence of recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The recombination pattern of markers across chromosome 1 is consistent with this interpretation. The <italic>lys1-lys7</italic> interval, in which we observed the greatest reduction in recombinants, is located within the inversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2 fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 2, 3</xref>). The next highest reduction in recombinant frequencies was between markers flanking the inversion boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2 fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 2, 3</xref>). In contrast, recombination frequencies outside the inversion were only ∼twofold to eightfold decreased in hybrids compared <italic>Sp/Sp</italic> diploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2 fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 2, 3</xref>). These non-inversion associated differences are not a hybrid-specific defect and may be due to different recombination frequencies in <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Sp</italic>, perhaps caused by different DSB frequencies or different DSB repair outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Our analyses of recombination also revealed a surprising genetic linkage between <italic>leu1</italic> and <italic>ade6</italic> in <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids, despite the fact that these genes are located on chromosomes 2 and 3, respectively, in both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We speculated that there was a reciprocal translocation between <italic>Sk</italic> chromosomes 2 and 3, relative to <italic>Sp</italic>. If such a translocation included essential genes, it would render gametes with non-parental chromosome combinations of the affected arms inviable; this inviability would also create the semblance of genetic linkage between the two chromosomes. Consistent with this possibility, we found using Southern blot analyses that essential genes (<italic>alr2</italic> and <italic>SPCP1E11.08</italic>) had swapped chromosome locations between <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Sp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). We partially assembled the <italic>Sk</italic> genome to map the translocation junctions to position 676,281 on <italic>Sp</italic> chromosome 2 and 1,932,034 on <italic>Sp</italic> chromosome 3. We verified the translocation junctions via PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Analyses of synteny in two outgroup species (<italic>S. octosporus</italic> and <italic>S. cryophilus</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rhind et al., 2011</xref>) showed that the translocation occurred in the <italic>Sk</italic> lineage. The translocation appears to have resulted from a crossover between a Tf transposon found in <italic>Sk</italic> on chromosome 2 (corresponding to a single Tf transposon LTR in <italic>Sp</italic>) and a Tf transposon unique to <italic>Sk</italic> on chromosome 3.</p><p>Thus, we find that chromosomal rearrangements are likely a significant contributor to <italic>Sp/Sk</italic> hybrid infertility. However, our findings suggested that recombination defects due to chromosome rearrangements are not sufficient to explain the near complete hybrid sterility we see in <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids for several reasons. First, <italic>rec12Δ Sk/Sp</italic> hybrid diploids still have greater than six-fold lower viable spore yield than <italic>rec12Δ Sk/Sk or Sp/Sp</italic> (pure species) diploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The chromosome 2-chromosome 3 reciprocal translocation predicts only a two-fold lower viable spore yield because only half of the gametes would inherit an incompatible chromosome combination. Second, if defects in recombination cause errors in chromosome segregation leading to the production of aneuploid and diploid gametes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis and Smith, 2003</xref>), we would expect that the frequency of aneuploid and diploid spores produced by <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids in the absence of meiotic recombination (<italic>rec12Δ</italic>) should be similar to the frequencies observed in <italic>rec12Δ</italic> pure species controls. In contrast to this expectation, we find that the level of heterozygous aneuploids and diploids in <italic>rec12Δ</italic> hybrids is still significantly (at least twofold) higher than that observed in both <italic>rec12Δ Sk/Sk</italic> and <italic>rec12Δ Sp/Sp</italic> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>; p&lt;0.01 for both; G-test). This result indicates that something other than recombination defects contributes to the high fraction of diploids and aneuploids, as well as the low viable spore yield.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02630.023</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Increased aneuploidy amongst viable <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> gametes is recombination-independent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We calculated both viable spore yield (viable spores/cell) as well as the fraction of viable spores that are aneuploid or diploid (‘Materials and methods’). In the absence of Rec12, the relative frequencies of aneuploids and diploids are elevated in all cases. However, there is significantly more aneuploidy and diploidy of viable spores produced by <italic>rec12Δ Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids than by <italic>rec12Δ</italic> pure species controls. This shows the phenotype is not caused solely by recombination defects. In addition, <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> diploids do not generate more aneuploids or diploids relative to the number of cells induced to undergo meiosis compared to pure-species controls.

First is the possibility that aneuploidy or diploid spores arise more frequently in hybrid meiosis. In contrast, the second possibility is that aneuploids arise at the same frequency in hybrid meiosis but are more likely than haploids to survive hybrid meiosis; haploid gametes produced by <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids may die more frequently than aneuploids. To distinguish between these possibilities, we calculated the frequency of aneuploids and diploids produced <italic>per meiosis</italic> in hybrids and pure species controls by multiplying the viable spore yield (viable spores produced per cell induced to undergo meiosis) by the fraction of viable spores that were aneuploid or diploid (i.e., aneuploids or diploids per viable spore). Our analyses revealed very small differences in the proportion of aneuploids that were generated in hybrids vs pure species meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We therefore conclude that the higher recovery of aneuploid and diploid spores from <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids is a result of lower viability of haploid spores.</p><p>The lower viability of haploid spores could be partially explained by the incompatibility between <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic> chromosomes 2 and 3 due to the reciprocal translocation in <italic>Sk</italic>. Aneuploids with <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Sp</italic> chromosome 3 (chromosome 3 disomes) will contain all essential genes, whereas haploids must inherit chromosomes 2 and 3 from the same species to be viable. This scenario, however, predicts only a twofold advantage of aneuploidy, yet <italic>rec12Δ Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids produce at least threefold more aneuploids than pure species <italic>rec12Δ</italic> controls. Furthermore, eliminating the chr2-chr3 incompatibility (see below) did not mitigate the phenotype. We therefore hypothesize that the viability benefit conferred by aneuploidy is due to disomy or heterozygosity for an allele(s) on chromosome 3. This could, for example, be due to a protective effect exerted by the <italic>Sk</italic> chromosome 3 within gametes containing <italic>Sp</italic> chromosome 3 and <italic>vice versa</italic> (‘Discussion’).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Non-Mendelian transmission of alleles through hybrid meiosis</title><p>One explanation for a chromosome rearrangement-independent mechanism of hybrid infertility emerged from our studies following the transmission of alleles from each species' chromosome through meiosis in <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids. To focus on cells with only one copy of a given allele, we omitted heterozygous diploids from analyses of all alleles and omitted heterozygous aneuploids when analyzing transmission of alleles on chromosome 3. Surprisingly, we found that in all cases, the <italic>Sk</italic> allele was transmitted to more viable spores than the <italic>Sp</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This nonrandom death of gametes is therefore an additional cause of <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrid infertility. For ease of reference, we refer to this phenotype as ‘drive’ of <italic>Sk</italic> alleles although this is not meiotic drive as originally envisioned to occur in asymmetric (female) meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sandler and Novitski, 1957</xref>).

This scenario predicts that we still should expect to recover haploid spores with all three <italic>Sk</italic> chromosomes at the same frequency as haploids with all three <italic>Sp</italic> chromosomes, since pure species chromosome combinations are compatible. However, <italic>rec12Δ Sk/Sp</italic> meiosis yielded the pure <italic>Sk</italic> haploid genotype approximately five times more frequently (6.5% of viable spores) than the pure <italic>Sp</italic> haploid genotype (1.4%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, we found that all haploid combinations of <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Sp</italic> chromosomes (except those with non-parental combinations of chromosomes 2 and 3) are viable and have similar growth rates, suggesting that they do not suffer from a mitotic fitness loss.

To get around this, we took advantage of the fact that rare Rec12-independent recombination can occur during mitosis or meiosis, for example at the mating type locus on chromosome 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis and Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angehrn and Gutz, 1968</xref>). Because of this rare Rec12-independent recombination, we recovered some viable spores (&lt;1%) from <italic>rec12Δ Sk/Sp</italic> hybrid meioses that appeared to have non-parental combinations of chromosomes 2 and 3, based on the phenotypic markers we used. Upon further examination via PCR or whole genome sequencing, these all proved to be rare recombinants that contain the left end of chromosome 2 and the right end of chromosome 3 from the same parent. We fully sequenced two of these recombinant strains to map their recombination breakpoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). These two strains both contained recombinant chromosomes that have the <italic>Sk</italic> karyotype, but showed the <italic>Sp</italic> phenotype in crosses to <italic>Sk</italic> (i.e., they were underrepresented in the viable gametes). We denote these as ‘R’ (for ‘recombinant’) chromosomes. By crossing strains containing these ‘R’ chromosomes to naïve <italic>Sk,</italic> we found that K2 and K3 chromosomes are also able to drive autonomously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Specifically, in the K1 R2 K3/K1 K2 K3 diploid, only K2 showed meiotic drive. Similarly, only K3 exhibited drive in the K1 K2 R3/K1 K2 K3 diploid.</p><p>Our experiments showed that both K2 and K3 have the ability to drive autonomously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Intruigingly, these diploids also revealed that K2 meiotic drive was less intense in the absence of linked K3 drive (61% instead of 93%; p&lt;0.01). In contrast, K3 drives more strongly in the absence of a linked driving K2 (91% vs 86%; p=0.02). These changes in drive intensity could be affected by genetic interactions between chromosomes revealed by the specific genotypes of these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, they could also be due to removing the reciprocal translocation. In pure <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> diploids, gametes that inherit <italic>Sk</italic> chromosome 3 would also have to inherit <italic>Sk</italic> chromosome 2 to survive. In this way, the driving ability of a weaker meiotic drive allele (e.g., on K2) could be augmented via pseudo-linkage to a stronger drive allele (on K3).</p><p>If the drive of <italic>Sk</italic> alleles we observe in <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids is caused by nonrandom death of spores that inherit <italic>Sp</italic> alleles, then the magnitude of drive we observe should correlate with level of infertility we observe. To test this, we calculated viable spore yields for a series of diploids with varying amounts of meiotic drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed that the fertility of diploids was correlated with the magnitude of drive. For example, the P1 K2 K3/K1 K2 K3 and the K1 R2 K3/K1 K2 K3 diploids had the lowest amount of drive and the highest viable spore yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, the K1 K2 R3/K1 K2 K3 diploid had the most drive and the lowest viable spore yield. These results are consistent with nonrandom death of gametes being directly associated with the over-representation of <italic>Sk</italic> alleles.</p><p>These diploids containing one heterozygous chromosome also fortuitously allowed us to home in on the cause of the high frequency of aneuploids we observed amongst the viable spores of <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids. We predicted the phenotype was due to heterozygosity for <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Sp</italic> alleles on one or more chromosomes, because the phenotype is specific to <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids. Amongst the viable spores produced by both the P1 K2 K3/K1 K2 K3 and K1 R2 K3/K1 K2 K3 diploids, the frequency of aneuploid spores was similar to that of the pure species <italic>rec12Δ Sk/Sk</italic> control (≤30%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This result further supports that the drive phenotype of <italic>Sk</italic> chromosomes 1 and 2 is independent of the aneuploidy phenotype of <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids, but it also shows that heterozygosity of these chromosomes does not cause the aneuploidy phenotype. Conversely, a much higher fraction (68%) of the viable spores produced by the K1 K2 R3/K1 K2 K3 diploid, which is heterozygous for most of chromosome 3, were aneuploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). The percentage of the viable spores from this diploid that were aneuploid was only marginally less than the value we observed in the spores produced by the completely heterozygous <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrid <italic>rec12Δ</italic> diploids (78%; p=0.038; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results show that the high frequency of aneuploids we observe amongst the viable spores of <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids is largely due to heterozygosity for a locus (or loci) on chromosome 3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Chromosomal rearrangements are frequent and significantly contribute to hybrid infertility in fission yeast</title><p>Our study reveals that the largest contributors to <italic>Sk</italic>/<italic>Sp</italic> hybrid infertility are two chromosomal rearrangements involving all three chromosomes. First, <italic>Sp</italic> chromosome 1 contains a large (∼2.2 Mb, or &gt;350 cM in <italic>Sp</italic>; about half of the chromosome) inversion relative to <italic>Sk,</italic> which retains the ancestral state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

This inversion contributes to hybrid infertility by limiting the possibility for interhomolog crossovers. Odd numbers of crossovers within this region would generate incomplete genomes and hence inviable gametes. There may be additional, smaller inversions present between these two species, which will be elucidated only by complete assembly of the <italic>Sk</italic> genome.</p><p>Second, we discovered a reciprocal translocation that occurred in the <italic>Sk</italic> lineage in which DNA that is found on the left end of P2 is found on K3, and DNA that is found on the right end of P3 is found on K2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This translocation contributes to <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrid infertility because each translocated sequence includes essential genes, rendering K2 P3 and P2 K3 chromosome combinations inviable.

The first are 'true drive' alleles in which the drive occurs due to nonrandom segregation of alleles during the meiotic divisions in asymmetric (female) meiosis. For example, 'knobs' on maize chromosomes can drive by preferentially segregating into the nucleus that will become the oocyte, rather than into nuclei that become polar bodies and are lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dawe and Cande, 1996</xref>). Similarly, centromeres in Mimulus species can drive in female meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fishman and Saunders, 2008</xref>). Alternatively, transmission distortion can be achieved not by nonrandom segregation but instead by ‘gamete killing’ in symmetric (male) meiosis. Gamete killer alleles segregate into gametes randomly, but the trans-acting killer alleles cause the death or malfunction of the gametes that do not inherit them. Although the mechanisms vary, this type of drive occurs in widely diverged eukaryotes. For example, male mice heterozygous for the t-haplotype produce mostly (&gt;95%) functional sperm containing the t-haplotype. The sperm that do not inherit the t-haplotype are nonfunctional due to immobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schimenti, 2000</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, sperm with chromosomes carrying large amounts of the <italic>Responder</italic> DNA satellite suffer chromosome condensation delays in the presence of the <italic>Segregation Distorter</italic> haplotype and do not contribute equally to functional sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larracuente and Presgraves, 2012</xref>). In <italic>Neurospora</italic>, a spore killer allele kills gametes that do not inherit it by interfering with spore development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hammond et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We discovered meiotic drive loci on each of the three <italic>Sk</italic> chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig8">Figures 6, 8</xref>). We do not yet know the mechanism by which <italic>Sk</italic> alleles gain their transmission advantage or at what point in gametogenesis it occurs. Drive likely occurs, however, via trans-acting gamete killing, as observed in all other cases of drive in symmetric meiosis, not via nonrandom chromosome segregation. We hypothesize that a ‘poison’ produced by each driving allele during hybrid sporulation renders spores that inherit the <italic>Sp</italic> allele at that locus less viable. For instance, such a ‘poison’ may prevent hybrid spores that inherit the <italic>Sp</italic> allele from expressing an essential gene for completing sporulation or germination. Precise mapping of the driving alleles will help reveal their mechanisms of action. Genetically separating the action of each driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) allows us to conclude that they would each meet the criteria for meiotic drive. However, simultaneous action of all three drivers exposed in the <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> cross, together with the chromosomal rearrangements, leads to a dramatic loss of viable spore yield and would curb the fixation of the driver alleles. This is why we hypothesize that each of the three drivers that favor the transmission of <italic>Sk</italic> alleles likely arose independently or sequentially along the <italic>Sk</italic> lineage.</p><p>Natural selection works best when heterozygous alleles are transmitted at Mendelian (1:1) frequencies through heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crow, 1991</xref>). In this way, the alleles compete on an equal playing field and spread through a population by promoting fitness. By subverting Mendelian transmission, meiotic drive alleles and linked loci can spread and even drive more fit alleles to extinction. The meiotic drive we observed could therefore also be detrimental to fitness indirectly by biasing allele transmission. In this scenario, natural selection would therefore favor the evolution of drive suppressors that are unlinked to the driving loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crow, 1991</xref>). Meiotic drive loci that could evade such suppression and re-establish their transmission advantage would then be favored. This genetic conflict between meiotic drive loci and their suppressors would set up an evolutionary arms race where both sides must innovate to try to gain an advantage. We predict that such an arms race is occurring within fission yeasts and we are able to observe drive only in the hybrids because the drive suppressors in <italic>Sp</italic> are incompatible with the driving alleles in <italic>Sk</italic>. Under this scenario, it is completely possible that in a cross between <italic>Sp</italic> and another <italic>Sp</italic>-like isolate, the <italic>Sp</italic> drive alleles may emerge victorious.</p><p>Our study of <italic>Sk</italic>/<italic>Sp</italic> hybrids also revealed a previously unanticipated feature of a meiotic drive system. The reciprocal translocation between <italic>Sk</italic> chromosomes 2 and 3 genetically links the two chromosomes. For example, <italic>leu1</italic> and <italic>ade6</italic> are genetically linked in <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids despite being on chromosomes 2 and 3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). <italic>leu1</italic> and <italic>ade6</italic> are also both closely linked to the drive alleles on their chromosomes; thus, the translocation also links the drive alleles on separate chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We demonstrated that each of the drive alleles can act in the absence of drive of the other two chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In an exciting twist for a meiotic drive system, however, the drive of the weaker allele may be bolstered by the drive of the stronger allele. Such a two-chromosome, two-locus drive system could be a formidable selfish evolutionary force. Like an inversion, the translocation expands the region effectively linked to the driving loci, resulting in a larger proportion of the genome favoring drive enhancers and a smaller proportion favoring suppressors. In addition, if a suppressor of one of the drive alleles does arise in the population, the drive of the other allele can compensate and minimal suppression will actually occur. In other words, both drive alleles must be suppressed simultaneously to restore Mendelian allele transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Meiotic drive and aneuploidy</title><p>Finding independent drivers on all three <italic>Sk</italic> chromosomes still does not explain our findings of increased frequencies of aneuploid (and diploid) gametes amongst the viable spores of <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids compared to the frequencies observed in pure species diploids, even in the absence of recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>) indicate that the aneuploidy phenotype is caused by <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> heterozygosity of an allele or alleles on chromosome 3. The aneuploidy phenotype seems paradoxical given that aneuploidy is generally deleterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Niwa et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, even the aneuploids produced by <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids show a slower growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). One hypothesis that would explain this higher recovery of aneuploid and diploid spores is that the disjunction of chromosomes (especially the <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Sp</italic> third chromosomes) is compromised during hybrid meiosis. Contrary to this, we calculate that hybrid meioses do not generate aneuploid or diploid gametes more frequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Rather, we hypothesize that aneuploid and diploid spores produced by <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids are more likely than haploid spores to survive to produce a colony.</p><p>Fitness advantages for aneuploids have been observed under some conditions and certain genetic backgrounds have increased aneuploidy tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yona et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Torres et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tange et al., 2012</xref>). For example, aneuploidy could be beneficial to fitness by increasing the dosage of certain genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Torres et al., 2007</xref>). However, we observed more than sevenfold more K1 K2 K3/P3 aneuploids (289) than K1 K2 K3 (38) haploids amongst the viable spores produced by <italic>rec12Δ Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids. K1 K2 K3 haploids represent the pure species genotype (and <italic>Sk/Sk</italic> diploids have high fertility), so it is hard to envision how adding P3 will provide a more than a sevenfold fitness boost, especially given the growth defects of aneuploids.</p><p>We favor an alternative model in which the aneuploidy and meiotic drive phenotypes are interconnected. We propose that <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> aneuploids are more resistant to poisons produced by meiotic drive alleles acting in hybrids. Our model posits that the <italic>Sp</italic> third chromosome encodes a weaker driver (poison) that acts against <italic>Sk</italic> chromosome 3, whereas the stronger <italic>Sk</italic> driver (poison) acts against <italic>Sp</italic> chromosome 3. In this model, only cells containing both <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Sp</italic> chromosome 3 are fully resistant to the effects of both drivers. Because aneuploids are genetically unstable and frequently become haploid upon mitotic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Niwa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kohli et al., 1977</xref>), the enhanced viability of aneuploid (and likely diploid) spores must be manifest during spore formation, spore germination, or the first few mitotic divisions after germination. Testing this model and other alternatives will require identification of the loci responsible for drive. Regardless of their mechanism(s) of action, the meiotic drive alleles we identified contribute significantly to hybrid spore death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). <italic>Sk</italic> alleles are preferentially found in the viable spores, whereas <italic>Sp</italic> alleles are presumably enriched amongst the dead spores.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Multiple step model for speciation in fission yeasts</title><p>Why are rearrangements so common in fission yeasts? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al. (2011)</xref>, who first discovered the karyotype diversity in different <italic>S. pombe</italic> isolates, suggested that these organisms might live in small populations and rarely outcross.

In both these scenarios, a chromosomal rearrangement could spread to fixation within a population without ever undergoing meiosis in a heterozygous state. These rearrangements would then be similar to Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities in that the derived karyotypes evolved in separate populations and were never tested by selection. Subsequent meioses of heterozygotes comprised of different derived karyotypes would be impaired and lead to reproductive isolation, impeding gene flow between the two populations. In theory, having a sufficiently large number of chromosomal rearrangements should suffice to ensure complete sterility.</p><p>We find that chromosomal rearrangements alone are insufficient to explain near complete hybrid sterility in a case of incipient speciation in fission yeast. In addition we show that at least three drive loci exist in <italic>Sk</italic>. We suspect that meiotic drive alleles are common in fission yeasts. Meiotic drive alleles have been proposed to promote karyotype evolution in diverse eukaryotes, and it is possible that drive also played a role in the evolution of the reciprocal translocation we identified in <italic>Sk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">White, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pardo-Manuel de Villena and Sapienza, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dyer et al., 2007</xref>). As we have pointed out, it is highly unlikely that the three meiotic drive alleles and the two chromosomal rearrangements we have found in the <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids occurred simultaneously during evolution, especially given the fertility costs. It is more likely they accumulated in stepwise fashion over time. The severe fertility phenotypes we observe in the current-day hybrids therefore do not entirely recreate the exact fitness costs and benefits of each novel mutation (rearrangements, drive) faced during their evolutionary histories, although they serve as effective proxies.</p><p>Our findings in fission yeast are highly reminiscent of emerging themes from studies of reproductive isolation mechanisms in plants, insects and even mammals, in which genetic conflicts underlie hybrid incompatibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Presgraves, 2010</xref>). Here we provide additional support for such models by showing that three genetic conflicts involving selfish meiotic drive alleles directly contribute to hybrid infertility in fission yeasts. Thus, like other sexually reproducing eukaryotes, genetic conflicts could also be fundamental drivers of infertility within fission yeasts. Our study finds important contributions from both chromosomal and genic divergence in mediating hybrid sterility in fission yeast, reminiscent of the chromosomal speciation model first proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">White (1978)</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain construction</title><p>We introduced all DNA transformation cassettes into the genome using a standard lithium acetate transformation protocol.

PRJNA244921). PacBio sequencing reads were used to join the contigs from paired-end reads into larger scaffolds using PacBio's SMRT Analysis software. We used AHA for the scaffolding using default parameters. None of the scaffolds showed evidence of the translocation found via Southern blot, which led us to assume the translocation breakpoints were between two contigs that remained unjoined. We then designed PCR oligos near the ends of contigs that did not join in the regions where we predicted the translocation junction might lie (starting near the chromosome ends). PCR using oligos from unjoined contigs should form a product only if the contigs were in fact connected to each other. This strategy was successful (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern blot analyses</title><p>Agarose DNA plugs were prepared and separated on pulsed-field gels as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hyppa and Smith (2009)</xref>.

Your article has been favorably reviewed by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and 2 additional external reviewers, one of whom, Kirsten Bomblies, has agreed to reveal her identity.</p><p>The three reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision and the Senior editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The mechanisms that lead to speciation remain one of the most fascinating problems in modern biology. Genic incompatibilities, chromosomal rearrangements and genome doubling all provide avenues towards interspecific incompatibility. In this manuscript, a veritable tour de force, Zanders and colleagues dissect the genetic incompatibilities between the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<italic>Sp</italic>) and <italic>S. kambucha</italic> (<italic>Sk</italic>) species, which differ in only 0.5% of their nuclear genome sequence. The authors go to great length, including the experimental analysis of DSB initiation hot spots, to ensure that sequence-based differences in recombination are not major contributors to incompatibility between the species. Instead, they find that despite the close sequence similarity, there are several major chromosome rearrangement that greatly reduce the fraction of viable spores. Similarly, the authors exclude that classic BDM incompatibilities are major contributors to interspecific incompatibility. Instead, they suggest that meiotic drive, with causal loci on each of the three chromosomes, is important. Provided that the latter conclusion holds up (see below), this study will speak to a wide readership, including scientists interested in speciation, unorthodox genetics, and the bizarre world of meiotic drivers.</p><p>It is remarkable that a species-barrier would involve three independent drivers. Since there appears to be one on each chromosome, this makes an extremely potent barrier to gene flow compared to most drive systems, where usually only a single chromosome is affected. Second, the translocation that switches two essential genes functionally spreads the effects of two of the drivers onto a different chromosome. This would likely be the first description among drivers of an effect on viability that necessitates the co-segregation of two distinct chromosomes from the driving genotype.</p><p>However, the reviewers were concerned whether the observations are indeed best explained by meiotic drive resulting in hybrid infertility, or rescue by aneuploidy overcoming already established hybrid infertility. The hallmark of a driver locus is that is increases its allele frequency faster than would be possible under classic Mendelian segregation combined with drift, but not due to selective forces (1:1 ratio in <italic>Sp</italic> x <italic>Sk</italic> crosses). Distorted Mendelian ratios in female meiosis are more easily assessed than in the exclusively male-like meiosis of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces</italic>. It is therefore difficult to discriminate between hybrid infertility/inviability and meiotic drive in male-like meiosis. For one, it is still unclear at what point during <italic>Sp</italic> x <italic>Sk</italic> crossing hybrid incompatibility occurs.</p><p>The increased ratio of aneuploidy (and diploidy) in <italic>Sp/Sk</italic> hybrids could indeed be due to meiotic drive, but there are alternative scenarios that you need to consider. Aneuploid tolerating mutants have been described in yeast (Torres et al 2010; Tange et al 2012). There is also the possibility of incompatibility between essential genes or loss of an essential gene due to the translocation, inversion or mutations (every 200th bp is different between <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic>). Also, it cannot be ignored that dosage compensation could account for aneuploidy in <italic>Sp</italic> x <italic>Sk</italic> crosses. Finally, from both classical (B)DM models and Lenski's LTEE, a role for epistasis has emerged as a potential speciation factor. For example, the observed link between alleles on chromosomes 2 and 3 could be attributed to epistasis.</p><p>All considered, it seems premature to assign meiotic drive as the leading force of the observed distortion of allele ratios without addressing more directly any of the above mentioned established non-meiotic drive mechanisms. Ideally, this would of course be resolved by pinpointing the causal genes, but we would be happy to entertain other arguments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02630.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>The reviewers’ comments highlighted a possibility that we had considered but not elaborated, i.e., imposition and tolerance of aneuploidy may provide one explanation of the post-meiotic dysfunction we see in the <italic>S. kambucha/S. pombe</italic> (<italic>Sk/Sp</italic>) hybrids. We have increased the discussion of this possibility and clarified the distinction between traditional ‘meiotic drive’ and ‘post-meiotic dysfunction’ that is colloquially referred to as meiotic drive. Formally, aneuploidy susceptibility can be a means of imposing meiotic drive, but in additional evidence we present in our revisions, we show that this explanation cannot be the mechanism for the drivers we have uncovered on chromosome 1 and 2. Because chromosome 3 can tolerate aneuploidy, we cannot rule out aneuploidy as a mechanism for chromosome 3 drive. Although these drivers likely arose independently under a more typical scenario for spread of meiotic drivers, their joint action is what leads to the near complete sterility in the <italic>Sp/Sk</italic> hybrids.</p><p>We have used these comments to provide additional evidence and clarified explanations of our conclusion that meiotic drivers exist on all three <italic>S. kambucha</italic> chromosomes and significantly contribute to spore inviability in <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids. We address each of the comments in our point-by-point response to the reviewers. Although we agree that the ultimate identification of the drivers, and suppressors would reveal details about the molecular mechanisms behind this pervasive drive, we have found that the mapping is not straightforward due to chromosomal rearrangements on both <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic> chromosomes, the possibility of epistasis and the lack of a high-throughput assay to assess meiotic success (in contrast to budding yeasts).</p><p><italic>[…] The reviewers were concerned whether the observations are indeed best explained by meiotic drive resulting in hybrid infertility, or rescue by aneuploidy overcoming already established hybrid infertility.

It is therefore difficult to discriminate between hybrid infertility/inviability and meiotic drive in male-like meiosis. For one, it is still unclear at what point during</italic> Sp <italic>x</italic> Sk <italic>crossing hybrid incompatibility occurs</italic>.</p><p>We agree and have previously commented (Malik, TREE 2005) that the formal definition of meiotic drive as first proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sandler and Novitski (1957)</xref> was limited to female meiotic drive. However, in later reviews, Sandler extended the term to include male meiotic drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zimmering et al. 1970</xref>): “Meiotic drive has been defined by Sandler &amp; Novitski as any alteration of the normal process of meiosis with the consequence that a heterozygote for two genetic alternatives produces an effective gametic pool with an excess of one type; such a pattern of behavior will drastically alter the frequency of alleles in a population in such a way that a driven allele may increase in frequency in spite of deleterious physiological effects. This general concept has, however, been taken to include transmissional anomalies that are not strictly meiotic, but with similar populational consequences [see, for example, Lewontin]; this extended meaning seems justified and thus the more general definition will be used in this review.“</p><p>We now have a more extended discussion of examples of transmission distortion in male meiosis, and reference to the Sandler review.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that in the <italic>Sp/Sk</italic> hybrid cross, decoupling the effects of the various chromosomal drivers complicates the interpretation of drive. This is why we believe our experiments in which we have separated the effects of the independent drivers are key (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> in revision). For instance, in the PKK x KKK cross, we observe an over-representation of the K1 chromosome of 65%, and a spore yield of roughly 80% of a conspecific KKK x KKK cross. Thus, K1 drive would fit the criteria required for a driver on chromosome 1 to increase in frequency by virtue of transmission distortion. We have similarly noted the ability for drivers on both chromosome 2 and 3 to independently drive, and meet the traditionally defined mathematical criteria for drive. We propose that each of these drivers arose independently or sequentially but it is their joint action (a circumstance under which drive did not originate) that leads to the near complete hybrid infertility, which would preclude the evolutionary success of either driver. Although we had a truncated discussion of this point, we have expanded this in our revision.</p><p>We agree that it is unclear at what point the spore death occurs in the <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids. We hope to address this question in future work identifying each of the loci required for meiotic drive.</p><p><italic>The increased ratio of aneuploidy (and diploidy) in</italic> Sp/Sk <italic>hybrids could indeed be due to meiotic drive, but there are alternative scenarios that you need to consider. Aneuploid tolerating mutants have been described in yeast (Torres et al 2010; Tange et al 2012). There is also the possibility of incompatibility between essential genes or loss of an essential gene due to the translocation, inversion or mutations (every 200th bp is different between</italic> Sp <italic>and</italic> Sk<italic>). Also, it cannot be ignored that dosage compensation could account for aneuploidy in</italic> Sp <italic>x</italic> Sk <italic>crosses. Finally, from both classical (B)DM models and Lenski's LTEE, a role for epistasis has emerged as a potential speciation factor. For example, the observed link between alleles on chromosomes 2 and 3 could be attributed to epistasis</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the possibility that aneuploidy tolerance may be a means by which <italic>Sk</italic> chromosomes resist (and perhaps cause) drive and ultimately infertility. Indeed, were this to be the case, it would be a novel means of meiotic drive. However, it would also still be completely consistent with post-meiotic dysfunction in products of male meiosis, which have been likened to a toxin-antidote system in which the driver loci produce some toxin (here, aneuploidy-causing conditions) and suppressor loci protect against this toxin (herein, aneuploidy-tolerating mutations). Thus, although mechanistically unique, this would not preclude our conclusions of driver loci.</p><p>In response to reviewer suggestions, we have more formally considered in our revision whether aneuploidy causing and tolerating loci could explain the drive phenotypes we have observed. For this, we re-analyzed the chromosome 1 and 2 allele transmission data from the <italic>rec12</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrid diploids, sorting them into two classes: aneuploid spores, and haploid spores. If the drive phenotypes of these two chromosomes we observed were related to the aneuploidy phenotype, the drive phenotype would be manifest primarily in the aneuploid spores. Instead, we observed strong drive of an allele on each chromosome in both the aneuploid and haploid spores. This experiment has been added to the text and the data are now displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>. In addition, the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in previous version) provide further support that the drive we observe of Sk chromosomes 1 and 2 (and the associated spore death) is independent of the aneuploidy phenotype. In these experiments we show that P1 K2 K3/K1 K2 K3 and K1 R2 K3/K1 K2 K3 diploids exhibit meiotic drive of K1 and K2, respectively. However, the level of aneuploid spores produced in these crosses is not higher than that in the Sk/Sk control. We have added text to the section describing these experiments to add the conclusion that the drive of Sk chromosomes 1 and 2 is not causally related to the aneuploidy phenotype. In contrast to chromosomes 1 and 2, we cannot robustly rule out that the aneuploidy phenotype may be related to drive on chromosome 3, partly because aneuploidy for chromosome 3 is viable in Sp and Sk.</p><p>It is important to note, however, that regardless of the mechanisms of drive or its exact relationship to aneuploidy, <italic>Sk</italic> chromosomes still have a significant transmission advantage over the <italic>Sp</italic> chromosome. And because these organisms undergo symmetric “male” meiosis to produce 4 gametes, the drive can occur only by causing the preferential death of spores that inherit the losing <italic><underline>Sp</underline></italic> alleles.</p><p>As the reviewers suggest, it is possible that some of hybrid genotypes are more tolerant of the stresses of aneuploidy, or that dosage compensation plays a role. We have now mentioned these possibilities in the Discussion. However, we do not feel that dosage per se provides the best explanation of our observed data. For example, we observe more than 7-fold more K1 K2 K3/P3 aneuploids (289) than K1 K2 K3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Irie et al., 2009</xref>) haploids amongst the viable spores produced by <italic>rec12Δ Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids. K1 K2 K3 haploids represent the pure species genotype (and <italic>Sk/Sk</italic> diploids have high fertility), so it is hard to envision how adding P3 will provide a more than a 7-fold fitness boost, especially given the growth defects associated with aneuploidy. Rather, we favor the alternate model suggested by the reviewers that aneuploids are better equipped to survive the ‘toxic’ effects of drivers in hybrid meiosis.</p><p>We more formally address the possibility of classical BDM incompatibilities using two experiments. First, despite the fact that <italic>Sp</italic> chromosomes are intrinsically compatible, we recover the ‘pure’ <italic>Sk</italic> genotype ∼5X more frequently than the ‘pure’ <italic>Sp</italic> genotype from <italic>rec12Δ Sk/Sp</italic> diploids. The most parsimonious explanation for the low recovery of spores with the <italic>Sp</italic> genotype is meiotic drive.</p><p>Secondly, if there were indeed BDM incompatibilities that affected mitotic survival or fitness, we would expect impaired mitotic fitness of different haploid combinations of Sp and Sk chromosomes recovered from the <italic>rec12Δ</italic> hybrid cross, for instance, combinations of Sp chromosome 1 with <italic>Sk</italic> chromosomes 2 and 3. Contrary to this expectation, we find no perceptible growth defects associated with this ‘mis-assortment’ (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Other combinations are also equally viable. This implies that the reduction in recovery of <italic>Sp</italic> containing chromosomes is not due to an intrinsic mitotic defect; following meiosis, haploid combinations appear to be just as fit as conspecific meiotic products. In contrast, aneuploid cells grow slowly until they shed an extra chromosome.</p><p>Our experiments cannot rule out the possibility of BDM incompatibilities in <italic>rec12+</italic> crosses, as those would create a vast number of haploid combinations of <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic> alleles, but the fact that the <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic> chromosomes are largely mitotically compatible with each other and the fact that we still see drive and infertility in <italic>rec12Δ</italic> crosses whose products (except for chr 2-chr3 translocations we pointed out) are largely viable and fit, suggests that classical BDM incompatibilities are not the primary basis of speciation. This is in contrast to what has been found in other systems, including Drosophila, wherein BDM incompatibilities, dosage and epistasis play a key role in speciation.</p><p>However, our previous version failed to mention the important role that epistasis might play in <italic>Sp/Sk</italic> infertility. We have now remedied this problem and mentioned in the text that epistasis could, in addition to the chromosome translocation, be contributing to the genetic linkage we observe between alleles on chromosomes 2 and 3. We have now added the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and an extended discussion of this point in our revisions.</p><p><italic>All considered, it seems premature to assign meiotic drive as the leading force of the observed distortion of allele ratios without addressing more directly any of the above mentioned established non-meiotic drive mechanisms. Ideally, this would of course be resolved by pinpointing the causal genes, but we would be happy to entertain other arguments</italic>.</p><p>We hope that our additional experiments and discussion would convince the reviewers that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coyne and Orr, 2004</xref>) two of the three chromosomal drivers act independent of aneuploidy, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson, 2010</xref>) that meiotic drive can act despite absence of genic incompatibilities, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Presgraves, 2010</xref>) that each of the drivers indeed meets the classical definition of transmission distorters in male meiosis. We do agree with the reviewers that formal testing the mechanisms of drive will require the identification of the causal loci and potential suppressors. Unfortunately, those mapping experiments are beyond the scope of this paper, and are complicated by the chromosomal rearrangements and the possible role of epistasis. To put this mapping challenge in perspective, the three “Spore killer” meiotic drive elements in Neurospora, a fungus with roughly comparable genetic tools to fission yeasts, were identified over 30 years ago, yet their mechanism(s) of action are still unknown and the first critical gene was only recently identified. We hope that the several unique points of drive and speciation we have uncovered, the improvements we have made in our manuscript as well as the intriguing prospects of rampant, rapid speciation among fission yeasts, which is likely to spur further interest in speciation research in this system, would meet the editorial and reviewer expectations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
