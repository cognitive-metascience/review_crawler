pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35014.001</object-id><p>Little is known about venom in young developmental stages of animals. The appearance of toxins and stinging cells during early embryonic stages in the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> suggests that venom is already expressed in eggs and larvae of this species. Here, we harness transcriptomic, biochemical and transgenic tools to study venom production dynamics in <italic>Nematostella</italic>. We find that venom composition and arsenal of toxin-producing cells change dramatically between developmental stages of this species. These findings can be explained by the vastly different interspecific interactions of each life stage, as individuals develop from a miniature non-feeding mobile planula to a larger sessile polyp that predates on other animals and interact differently with predators. Indeed, behavioral assays involving prey, predators and <italic>Nematostella</italic> are consistent with this hypothesis. Further, the results of this work suggest a much wider and dynamic venom landscape than initially appreciated in animals with a complex life cycle.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35014.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Some animals produce a mixture of toxins, commonly known as venom, to protect themselves from predators and catch prey. Cnidarians – a group of animals that includes sea anemones, jellyfish and corals – have stinging cells on their tentacles that inject venom into the animals they touch.</p><p>The sea anemone <italic>Nematostella</italic> goes through a complex life cycle. <italic>Nematostella</italic> start out life in eggs. They then become swimming larvae, barely visible to the naked eye, that do not feed. Adult <italic>Nematostella</italic> are cylindrical, stationary ‘polyps’ that are several inches long. They use tentacles at the end of their tube-like bodies to capture small aquatic animals. Sea anemones therefore change how they interact with predators and prey at different stages of their life. Most research on venomous animals focuses on adults, so until now it was not clear whether the venom changes along their maturation.</p><p>Columbus-Shenkar, Sachkova et al. genetically modified <italic>Nematostella</italic> so that the cells that produce distinct venom components were labeled with different fluorescent markers. The composition of the venom could then be linked to how the anemones interacted with their fish and shrimp predators at each life stage.</p><p>The results of the experiments showed that <italic>Nematostella</italic> mothers pass on a toxin to their eggs that makes them unpalatable to predators. Larvae then produce high levels of other toxins that allow them to incapacitate or kill potential predators. Adults have a different mix of toxins that likely help them capture prey.</p><p>Venom is often studied because the compounds it contains have the potential to be developed into new drugs. The jellyfish and coral relatives of <italic>Nematostella</italic> may also produce different venoms at different life stages. This means that there are likely to be many toxins that we have not yet identified in these animals. As some jellyfish venoms are very active on humans and reef corals have a pivotal role in ocean ecology, further research into the venoms produced at different life stages could help us to understand and preserve marine ecosystems, as well as having medical benefits.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>venom evolution</kwd><kwd>toxin</kwd><kwd>Cnidaria</kwd><kwd>Nematostella vectensis</kwd><kwd>life cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant no. 691/14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moran</surname><given-names>Yehu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship 654294</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sunagar</surname><given-names>Kartik</given-names></name><name><surname>Moran</surname><given-names>Yehu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Award 1536530</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reitzel</surname><given-names>Adam M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006221</institution-id><institution>United States - Israel Binational Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant no. 2013119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reitzel</surname><given-names>Adam M</given-names></name><name><surname>Moran</surname><given-names>Yehu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Different developmental stages of a venomous animal (e.g. <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>) with a complex life cycle produce vastly different venoms that can serve in different antagonistic interactions with other species.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Venoms and the toxins they include are mostly used by animals for antagonistic interactions, such as prey capture and defense from predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casewell et al., 2013</xref>). Pharmacological research has been focused almost exclusively on the venoms of the adult stages despite the fact that many animals display remarkable transformations in body architectures and ecology during their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruppert et al., 2004</xref>). Such vast differences may dictate different interspecific interactions for distinct life stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilbur, 1980</xref>). As venom is hypothesized to be metabolically expensive, and in many cases highly specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nisani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casewell et al., 2013</xref>), it is plausible that its composition might change between different life stages. Indeed, some ontogenetic variation was reported in the venoms of snakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gibbs et al., 2011</xref>), spiders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santana et al., 2017</xref>) and cone snails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Safavi-Hemami et al., 2011</xref>), but until now this phenomenon was not studied thoroughly in an animal with a complex life cycle throughout its development.</p><p>The oldest extant group of venomous animals is the marine phylum Cnidaria, which includes sea anemones, corals, jellyfish and hydroids. Cnidarians are typified by their stinging cell, the nematocyte, that harbors a unique and highly complex organelle, the nematocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kass-Simon and Scappaticci, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">David et al., 2008</xref>). This proteinaceous organelle is utilized as a miniature venom delivery system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thomason, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lotan et al., 1995</xref>). Most cnidarians have a complex life cycle that includes both sessile benthic and mobile pelagic life stages of wide size distribution and ecological interactions. For example, the canonical life cycle of anthozoans (corals and sea anemones) includes a swimming larval stage (planula) that metamorphoses into a sessile polyp stage that matures into the reproductive adult.</p><p>The starlet sea anemone, <italic>Nematostella vectensis,</italic> is becoming a leading cnidarian lab model as unlike many other cnidarian species it can be grown in the lab throughout its life cycle. This makes <italic>Nematostella</italic> a unique system to study the venom of an animal with a complex life cycle. Another advantage is that the high genetic homogeneity of the common <italic>Nematostella</italic> lab strain minimizes individual genetic variation, which is far from trivial in most other venomous animals collected from the wild in limited numbers. Further, <italic>Nematostella</italic> has a sequenced genome and stage-specific transcriptomes and various molecular tools are available for its genetic manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wikramanayake et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Putnam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Renfer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Helm et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Layden et al., 2016</xref>). The <italic>Nematostella</italic> experimental toolbox is unique, not only for cnidarians, but also for venomous animals in general.</p><p>During the <italic>Nematostella</italic> life cycle, females release a gelatinous egg package and males release sperm into the water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hand and Uhlinger, 1992</xref>). After fertilization occurs, the zygote cleavage begins, forming a blastula and less than 24 hr post-fertilization (hpf) gastrulation is completed. A planula larva emerges from the egg package 48–72 hpf and starts swimming in the water. Six to seven days after fertilization, the planula settles in soft substrate and starts to metamorphose into a primary polyp and sexual maturation takes about 4 months under lab conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hand and Uhlinger, 1992</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Whereas the egg and planula are roughly spherical and measure only about 250 µm, the morphologically differentiated elongated adult polyp can reach the length of 4 cm in the wild and up to 20 cm in the lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Williams, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hand and Uhlinger, 1992</xref>). Venom is produced in <italic>Nematostella</italic> by ectodermal gland cells and nematocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moran et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moran et al., 2013</xref>). Although prey capture and production of Nv1, a major sodium channel modulator toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moran et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moran et al., 2012b</xref>), begins at the sessile primary polyp stage, nematocysts appear as early as 48 hpf in the swimming planula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marlow et al., 2009</xref>). These are strong indications that venom is likely present already in early life stages and its composition might dramatically change across the <italic>Nematostella</italic> life cycle. Further complexity in the regulation of venom production may be due to <italic>Nematostella</italic> producing different cell types that are unevenly distributed between various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moran et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35014.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of toxins across <italic>Nematostella</italic> development and tissues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The life cycle of <italic>N. vectensis</italic>.

We assayed the RNA expression levels of the genes encoding the sodium channel modulator neurotoxin Nv1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moran et al., 2008a</xref>), the putative toxins NvePTx1, NEP3, NEP3-like, NEP4, NEP8 and NEP16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orts et al., 2013</xref>), the putative metallopeptidases NEP6 and NEP14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moran et al., 2013</xref>), NvLysin1b, a cytolytic toxin which may also serve for food digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moran et al., 2012a</xref>), and the structural components of the nematocyst capsule Ncol1, Ncol3 and Ncol4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">David et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zenkert et al., 2011</xref>), as well as the putative nematocyst structural component NR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moran et al., 2014</xref>). The RNA measurements were performed on nine developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), adults of each sex and four dissected tissues of an adult female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The nCounter analysis revealed that many of the genes form informative clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). It is noticeable that the expression patterns of NEP3, NEP3-like and NEP4 strongly clustered with those of genes encoding structural nematocyst components in both the developmental and tissue analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>), which is consistent with the finding that these putative toxins are produced in nematocytes and are released from the capsule upon discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moran et al., 2013</xref>). Other toxins such as Nv1, which was shown to be expressed in polyp ectodermal gland cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moran et al., 2012b</xref>), or Nvlysin1b, produced by large gland cells in the pharynx and mesenteries beginning in early developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moran et al., 2012a</xref>), had different expression patterns in the nCounter analysis and did not form large clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). Expression levels of <italic>NEP3</italic>, <italic>Nv1</italic> and <italic>NvePTx1</italic> were strikingly distinct across development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The expression of <italic>Nv1</italic> is relatively low in early developmental stages and then sharply peaks in the juvenile and adult polyps to extraordinary levels that are higher by almost two orders of magnitude compared to the other toxins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These expression levels can be explained by the fact that the <italic>Nematostella</italic> genome contains more than a dozen gene copies encoding Nv1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moran et al., 2008b</xref>) and the peak in transcriptional expression late in development is consistent with earlier observations at the protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moran et al., 2012b</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Nv1</italic>, <italic>NEP3</italic> is expressed at high levels already at gastrulation, peaks in the early planula and remains roughly stable throughout the rest of development into adulthood. Unlike the other toxins, the expression of <italic>NvePTx1</italic> peaks at the unfertilized egg, drops sharply across development and rises again in the adult female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>As significant variations between toxin expression at the transcriptional level and protein level were recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madio et al., 2017</xref>), we complemented the expression of toxin genes in <italic>Nematostella</italic> using shotgun proteomics (tandem mass spectrometry MS/MS).

Upon the addition of the toxin, the fish reacted rapidly, with an increase in swimming speed. After 2 hr of incubation 10 fish larvae had died, with the remaining fish dying over the next 18 hr (at which point the experiment had ended) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The control group (incubated in 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) behaved normally throughout the experiment and all larvae were alive after a 20-hr incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To complement the nCounter experiment, we assayed the spatiotemporal expression pattern of <italic>NvePTx1</italic> by in situ hybridization (ISH). We observed that while <italic>NvePTx1</italic> is expressed uniformly throughout the unfertilized egg and early post-fertilization stages, in the gastrula the expression becomes spatially-localized and seems to be absent from the oral and aboral poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In the planula, the expression is clearly observed in the ectoderm in packed gland cells absent from the two body poles, and upon metamorphosis, the expression diminishes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). The ISH reveals two types of gland cells, one large and elongated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>) and another small and round (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The results of the ISH and nCounter experiments indicated that <italic>NvePTx1</italic> is maternally deposited at the RNA level. Further, we could detect NvePTx1 peptide hits in our MS/MS analyses data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) as well as in supplementary datasets available from previous proteomic studies of <italic>Nematostella</italic> eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lotan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levitan et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting maternal deposition also at the protein level. To directly test this, we have injected into <italic>Nematostella</italic> zygotes a transgenesis construct that carries the gene encoding the fluorescent reporter mOrange2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>) fused to an NvePTx1 signal peptide downstream of a putative <italic>NvePTx1</italic> promoter. Noticeably, several females of the injected first generation (F0) exhibited strong expression of mOrange2 in round structures in their mesenteries, which are most probably the ovaries where the eggs are formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–I</xref>). This observation is congruent with the fact that the mesentery is the only female adult tissue where high <italic>NvePTx1</italic> transcript levels are detected at high levels by the nCounter analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Further, upon induction of spawning, the female polyps with the fluorescent mesenterial tissue released egg packages harboring plenty of fluorescent eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), strongly supporting maternal deposition of NvePTx1. Next, by performing an immunostaining assay on F1 transgenic animals we were able to verify the presence of two distinct types of ectodermal gland cells as identified by the ISH results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–M</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Phylogeny, primary structure and activity of NEP3</title><p>The <italic>NEP3</italic>, <italic>NEP4</italic>, and <italic>NEP8</italic> gene products were previously detected by MS/MS to be released from <italic>Nematostella</italic> nematocysts upon discharge and hence were hypothesized to be putative toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moran et al., 2013</xref>). We detected an additional gene encoding a NEP3 homolog in the <italic>Nematostella</italic> genome and named it <italic>NEP3-like</italic>. The four nucleotide sequences were translated in silico and were suggested to encode precursors of secretory proteins equipped with typical signal peptides (according to SignalP online tool) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>). An additional search in the Pfam database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Finn et al., 2010</xref>) showed that each precursor contains three ShKT sequence motives (PF01549, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) typical for several potent cnidarian toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aneiros et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castañeda and Harvey, 2009</xref>). Based on these common features and their sequence similarity, we designated <italic>NEP3</italic>, <italic>NEP3-like</italic>, <italic>NEP4</italic>, and <italic>NEP8</italic> as the ‘NEP3 family’. We searched publicly available transcriptomic shotgun assembly databases and identified several sequences of homologs from the sea anemones <italic>Edwardsiella lineata</italic>, <italic>Aiptasia pallida</italic> and <italic>Anthopleura elegantissima</italic> as well as the stony corals <italic>Acropora digitifera</italic> and <italic>Stylophora pistillata</italic>, showing significant sequence similarity and identical domain structure to the NEP3 family members in <italic>Nematostella</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). A phylogenetic analysis revealed that each of NEP3, NEP4 and NEP8 from <italic>Nematostella</italic> formed a strongly supported (bootstrap values &gt; 0.5) clade with a highly similar protein from <italic>Edwardsiella</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating orthology. Thus, the new sequences from <italic>Edwardsiella</italic> were named according to their <italic>Nematostella</italic> orthologs.

Other cnidarian species bear more distantly related NEP3 family members, and their exact orthologous or paralogous nature could not be determined due to low bootstrap values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, their presence in stony corals suggests that those proteins already appeared 500 million years ago in the last common ancestor of stony corals and sea anemones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shinzato et al., 2011</xref>), but were lost in multiple hexacorallian lineages.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35014.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>NEP3 is a toxin that is processed from a long precursor protein and is part of a large family.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The primary structure of the NEP3 precursor.

However, it was initially not clear in what native form this protein is found in the animal as we detected a potential Lys-Arg tandem, which is a prominent cleavage signal in nematocyst proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderluh et al., 2000</xref>), between the first and second domains of NEP3. Hence, we decided to first explore the primary structure of the native mature NEP3. For this aim, we discharged lyophilized nematocysts and analyzed the molecular weight of NEP3 making part of the ejected protein mixture by western blot with custom polyclonal antibodies against the first NEP3 ShKT domain. However, the western blot resulted in two major bands (~10 and 12 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). A gradual three-step FPLC procedure of gel filtration, anion exchange and reverse phase chromatography was applied to purify the dominant NEP3 fragment, and at each stage we carried on with the fraction with the strongest western blot signal. This procedure yielded a nearly pure fraction of mature NEP3 fragment with molecular weight ~10 kDa. Comparison of the electrophoretic mobility of the native mature NEP3 and a recombinant peptide corresponding to the first domain showed that the two peptides possess highly similar molecular weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, we conclude that a native peptide composed of only the first domain of NEP3 is found in <italic>Nematostella</italic> and is released from the nematocyst upon discharge. Following this finding we carried out a toxicity test where we incubated zebrafish larvae with 0.5 mg/ml recombinant mature NEP3. While in the control group (incubated for 20 hr in 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) all the 20 fish survived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), all 17 <italic>Danio</italic> fish larvae in the NEP3-treated group died within 5 hr and the larvae exhibited pronounced contraction and tail twitching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) suggesting that the mature NEP3 peptide might be neurotoxic.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Different nematocytes express different NEP3 family members</title><p>To gain improved resolution of the expression of the four NEP3 family members, we employed ISH to localize their expression in five developmental stages.

However, beginning at the late planula stage the expression of <italic>NEP8</italic> shifts to only a handful of nematocytes in the lower pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast to <italic>NEP8</italic>, the three other family members, <italic>NEP3</italic>, <italic>NEP3-like</italic> and <italic>NEP4</italic> are expressed throughout the ectoderm in nematocytes, with high concentration of expressing cells in the oral pole.

This result can be explained by two non-exclusive explanations: the first is that the nematogenesis (production nematocysts) is a highly dynamic process that requires different genes to be expressed at different times along the nematocyst maturation process; the second is that the three family members are mostly expressed in different nematocyte populations and only few nematocytes express all family members.</p><p>To test the latter hypothesis, we injected <italic>Nematostella</italic> zygotes with a construct carrying a chimera of the signal peptide of NEP3 with mOrange2 downstream of the putative promoter of <italic>NEP3</italic>.

As <italic>Nematostella</italic> develops from a non-predatory, swimming larva to an adult sessile predatory polyp that is 150-fold larger than the larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), its interspecific interactions vastly change across development. For example, <italic>Nematostella</italic> egg packages can be consumed by grass shrimp, but it is highly unlikely that adult polyps are part of the grass shrimp diet (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). These observations correlate with the expression dynamics of Nv1 that is highly toxic for shrimps. Unlike the grass shrimp, <italic>Fundulus</italic> larvae do not consume <italic>Nematostella</italic> egg packages and actively expel from their mouths planulae, which were erroneously perceived as food (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). They consumed only individual eggs following cysteine washes, which do not represent native conditions. The reduced occurrence of predation can be explained by the presence of various toxins, such as members of NEP3 family, which may protect <italic>Nematostella</italic> from fish predators even at very early developmental stages. This notion is supported by the toxic effects of NEP3 on zebrafish larvae.</p><p>We hypothesize that these dynamic interactions, coupled with the potentially high metabolic cost of toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nisani et al., 2012</xref>), have driven the evolution of a distinct venom composition in each developmental stage. Moreover, in the case of cnidarians, an additional metabolic cost stems from the fact that nematocysts are single-use venom delivery apparatuses that have to be reproduced in very high numbers after each antagonistic interaction. Hence, there is a clear advantage in using a highly adapted venom in each developmental stage.</p><p>Because venom in planulae is used purely for defense, whereas the venom in polyps is used both for defense and for prey capture, our results also relate to previous results in scorpions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inceoglu et al., 2003</xref>) and cone snails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dutertre et al., 2014</xref>), where venom compositions for defense and prey-capture were shown to differ. Further, some of the toxins we localized can be attributed for specific functions based on their expression patterns. For example, it is very likely that NvePTx1 is a defensive toxin due to its occurrence in the egg and in ectodermal gland cells of the planula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), whereas NEP8 is probably used in the polyp for killing prey after it is swallowed, as it is expressed exclusively in the lower pharynx and mesenteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35014.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary of the current knowledge on spatiotemporal toxin expression in early planula and primary polyp of <italic>Nematostella</italic>.</title><p>This illustration summarizes the current work as well as previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moran et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moran et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moran et al., 2013</xref>).

A study in Hydra discovered that two members of a single pore-forming toxin family are expressed in two morphologically distinct types of nematocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hwang et al., 2007</xref>), but to the best of our knowledge, similar complexity of toxin expression patterns in morphologically similar nematocytes was never reported before. Further, mechanisms of venom biosynthesis at exact cellular level resolution have not been reported in more complex venomous organisms as well. However, at lower resolution, some reports suggest that within one venom gland different secretory units are specialized on production of a limited number of toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dutertre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Undheim et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, specialized venom secretory cells are probably a common trait among venomous animals.</p><p>The distinct expression patterns of the NEP3 family also provides important indications regarding toxin evolution. For example, the expression of <italic>NEP8</italic> in pharyngeal nematocytes, and its absence from the tentacles and outer body wall, where its paralogs <italic>NEP3</italic>, <italic>NEP3-like</italic> and <italic>NEP4</italic> are expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), is an indication for sub- or neo-functionalization. The specialization of the different family members is also supported by their conservation in <italic>Edwardsiella</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Variation in expression patterns of the NEP3 family members and the fact that at least four different types of gland cells at distinct developmental stages and tissues express different toxins (Nv1, Nvlysin1b, NEP6 and NvePTx1) in <italic>Nematostella</italic> suggests a highly complex venom landscape in this species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). At first glance, such a system might seem relatively inefficient. However, we hypothesize that harboring many different toxin-producing cell types, provides modularity and enables evolutionary plasticity of toxin expression. Indeed, our results as well as results of others, suggest that different sea anemones species express similar toxins in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moran et al., 2012b</xref>) and different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Macrander et al., 2016</xref>).

It was sometimes difficult to discern between the fish exhibiting sporadic swimming patterns, which we could not confidently link with them interacting with <italic>Nematostella</italic>.</p><p>For testing the potential effect of <italic>Nematostella</italic> primary polyps on <italic>Fundulus</italic> larvae, newly hatched <italic>Fundulus</italic> larvae (N = 10) were placed in a small glass aquarium (~3 ml) with 15 ‰ ASW. Fish behavior was recorded over 30 min per experiment using the Moticam 580 (Motic, Hong Kong, China), 15 min serving as a control and 15 min with a treatment. Freshly hatched <italic>Artemia</italic> were sacrificed by freezing and used as a positive control (N = 10). Silica beads 0.5 mm in diameter (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) were used as a negative control (N = 10). For each video, the recording was split into the following sections at these time scales: 0–5 min – acclimation, 5–15 min – control, 15–20 min – acclimation to treatment, 20–30 min – recorded behavior. The water container was split into three equal parts (‘bottom’, ‘center’ and ‘top’) based on the fish length. If the fish was in the ‘center’ with no portion of their body crossing either side time was not recorded as this was considered <italic>no preference</italic>. One-way ANOVAs were carried out separately for the upper and lower time points for each treatment. Specific treatments that were statistically significant were identified using the Tukey post hoc analysis. The results were plotted in GraphPad Prism version 7.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Dr David Fredman (Department of Informatics, University of Bergen) for his invaluable help with quantitative and computational methods.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Although this manuscript reports on the interesting finding that toxin composition of the starlet sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> is highly dynamic, there are several major concerns that limit the potential significance of this work. These are amply presented in the reviews below.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript, Columbus-Shenkar et al. report an interesting finding: the toxin composition of the starlet sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> is highly dynamic, with a potential potassium channel blocker, NvePTx1, being exclusively expressed during larval stages and different NEP3 family toxins being expressed in different subpopulations of mature nematocysts. The authors applied experimental approaches including proteomics, transcriptomics, toxicology and gene profiling to support their findings. However, several major concerns limit the potential significance of this work.</p><p>1) As the authors point out, similar studies focusing on venom composition dynamics have already been reported in both invertebrates (cone snail)[1] and vertebrates (rattlesnakes)[2]. And like the majority of phylum Mollusca, cone snails also possess a complex life cycle, with a planktonic veliger stage and a highly predatory adult stage. Similar to previous studies, this manuscript provides another descriptive analysis of venom composition changes during different life stages, but fails to touch on the biological relevance or the molecular mechanism behind this phenomenon.</p><p>2) The toxicology experiments were meant to demonstrate the toxicity of <italic>Nematostella</italic> proteins NvePTx1 and NEP3, which was a main argument made by the authors. However, both experiments were carried out and analyzed in a crude manner and definitely require improvement. Synthesis of biologically active toxic peptides has been proven difficult, as the formation of disulfide bridges between evolutionarily conserved cysteine residues is rather inefficient in <italic>E. coli</italic> culture system (even with Shuffle and BL21 strains, in which the cytosolic disulfide bond formation is enhanced)[3, 4]. More importantly, the existence of multiple cysteine residues leads to potential disulfide bond formation at different positions. The authors purified both toxins directly from bacterial culture without further analysis of peptide structure, and tried to demonstrate the toxicity of each peptide by incubating them at a single concentration with zebrafish larvae. A series of questions need to be answered: i) What proportion or isoform of purified peptides are biologically active? And why do these peptides only function at such a high concentration compared to previous studies [4, 5]?</p><p>ii) Is zebrafish a suitable subject to test toxins from <italic>Nematostella</italic> (whose diet likely consists of invertebrates such as small crustaceans and mollusks)?</p><p>iii) Is it appropriate to conclude on the neurotoxicity of the peptides simply based on abnormal tail contraction phenotype of zebrafish larvae? These experiments lead to more confusion, rather than providing functional evidence to support the argument that both genes truly function as toxins.</p><p>3) The quality of data in general needs to be improved. Images from double in situ hybridization experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) were meant to demonstrate partial co-localization of different toxins and nematocyst marker gene Ncol3. But the poor quality of these images fails to provide enough cellular resolution to support these claims. Also, the FISH pattern of the same gene NEP3 at primary polyp stage varies from panel to panel, and is not comparable to the double in situ pattern shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>. The same problem exists with the Ncol3 pattern, which was used as a reference marker, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, primary polyp stage, row1 versus row 4.</p><p>References:</p><p>1.

While ontogenetic variation has been reported in the venoms of some species of snakes and cone snails, the influence of development and ecology on venom production is poorly understood, particularly in organisms with complex life cycles. This study uses an integrative approach (behavior, transcriptomics, biochemistry, transgenesis) to study venom production across all life stages in the starlet sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis.</italic> Specifically, the authors quantify the spatial and temporal expression of known and novel toxins across the life stages of <italic>Nematostella</italic>.</p><p>Significance</p><p>The findings of this study are important for improving our understanding of developmental processes, the evolution of venom and its role mediating interspecific interactions, and the impact of venom-mediated interactions on biodiversity.</p><p>Isolated toxins from venomous animals (cone snails, scorpions, sea anemones, spiders) have been used for years to study ion channels. Less attention has been paid to the influence of development and ecology on venom production and composition. Most examples are from snake or cone snail species. Few studies integrate development, physiology and ecology of venoms and toxins, mainly because there are few organisms that can be studied both in natural habitats and in the lab, especially organisms with complex life cycles. Distinct patterns of toxin gene expression in <italic>Nematostella</italic> that track developmental stages raise intriguing questions and open new avenues for further exploration of toxins and toxin-producing genes. For example, this study lays the foundation for future work aimed at understanding the selective forces that shape venom production and delivery, the link between functional differences in toxin activity and fitness, and how these processes change during development.</p><p>Moreover, this research has the potential to uncover novel peptides or molecules that could be used in the discovery of novel drugs and drug targets. There are many channels for which selective blockers or modulators have yet to be identified. For example, there are approximately 90 genes that encode K<sup>+</sup> channels. Identification of novel toxins from <italic>Nematostella</italic> suggests this venom may be a rich source of small molecules and peptides that can be used to selectively manipulate K<sup>+</sup> channels for drug discovery.</p><p>Comments/Suggestions</p><p>Overall, this is a really nice study that uses multiple techniques to quantify toxin expression across life stages and different adult tissues. The different assays (gene expression, biological activity of toxins, ISH/dFISH, etc.) are rigorous, and the authors do a good job of considering alternative hypotheses. The authors do not need to do more experiments. However, there are some areas of the manuscript that could be improved.</p><p>Suggestions for the Discussion</p><p>This study provides robust data that show differences in toxin-gene and toxin expression across developmental stages and adult tissues. This suggests that venom composition changes across developmental stages. While differences in the expression of toxins across developmental stages and tissues suggest there may be functional differences in venom that provide optimal activity at a particular life stage, in a particular ecological setting, or in response to different interspecific interactions, the authors should be careful of over interpreting their data to suggest functional differences for which there is little support. It is plausible that differential toxin expression and venom composition are the result of differential selective forces across developmental stages. However, this study did not explicitly show that differences in venom composition cause different functional effects on planula larvae versus adult polyps. Moreover, while venoms that differ in composition may provide optimal activity at different life stages or in different tissues, the authors should be careful to avoid statements that suggest evolution is purposeful and results in adaptations that are structurally and functionally optimal. For example: 1) &quot;[…] each arsenal of toxin might be tailored for different biological needs.&quot;; 2) &quot;Hence, there is a clear advantage in using a highly adapted venom in each developmental stage.&quot;</p><p>Regarding the use of venom for defense versus prey capture – this is an intriguing area of venom physiology and evolution. Localized expression of toxin genes or toxins suggests functional specificity. However, the authors should avoid &quot;attributing&quot; functional specificity to localized expression. It is also not clear from the data shown in this study that NvePTx1 is solely a defensive toxin. NvePTx1 was identified as a homolog of the type 5 K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker BCsTx3 from sea anemone based on sequence similarity. To confirm toxic activity, recombinant NvePTx1 was incubated with zebra fish larvae, which died by the end of the 16 hour incubation period, compared to control larvae incubated with no toxin. The ISH staining showed a developmental pattern consistent with eggs expressing NvePTx1, and expression patterns changing as the eggs developed. But unless I missed this in the data or reference in another publication, has it been shown that eggs expressing incubated with predators actually kills the predators? Regarding the NvLysin1b pore-former toxin, while expression in the pharynx and mesenteries suggests it is for prey capture, perhaps it also functions to help break food down to aid digestion.</p><p>Perhaps the authors could revise their discussion to distinguish between conclusions that can be drawn from the data, and speculation about differential venom function and future directions.</p><p>It would be helpful to include a little more information about the toxins and their biological activity. References are provided, but this requires that the reader search for information that could be provided in a concise manner. For example, the authors could briefly define &quot;pore-forming toxin&quot;. Is this a toxin that lyses cells versus a toxin that blocks ion channel pores or manipulates gating mechanisms? Toxin experts won't be bothered by this but other readers will appreciate brief definitions.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35014.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although this manuscript reports on the interesting finding that toxin composition of the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis is highly dynamic, there are several major concerns that limit the potential significance of this work. These are amply presented in the reviews below.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to address the idea that the different venom compositions produced during distinct developmental stages of <italic>Nematostella</italic> is facilitating different interactions with other species, we conducted lab experiments where two predatory species that come from native <italic>Nematostella</italic> habitat, the killifish <italic>Fundulus heteroclitus</italic> and the grass shrimp <italic>Palaemonetes</italic> sp., were exposed to different developmental stages of <italic>Nematostella</italic>. Those interactions were tested multiple times with nearly perfect reproducibility. All these details, including the exact description of the interactions and number of animals and replicates are now provided in the Results section and Materials and methods. All the interaction results are provided in the new table, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. To provide the reader with visual description of some notable forms of interaction we also provide videos. These videos describe typical interactions that were recorded multiple times (n&gt;3) in independent experiments. The results of the interaction of killifish larvae with primary polyps of <italic>Nematostella</italic>, originally caught on video, are provided in the new Figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and are quantified and statistically significant. The combination of all of these results show that indeed antagonistic interactions of <italic>Nematostella</italic> change with development. We do not claim to fully solve the very complex picture of <italic>Nematostella</italic> ecology in the field, but we believe that these new results provide a strong support to the idea that the vast changes of venom composition enable different interspecific interactions. We would also like to note that this hypothesis is also supported by the great differences we reveal by transcriptomics, proteomics, and multiple cytology assays. It is likely that the appearance and disappearance of whole cell populations that produce different toxins across development documented here at such magnitude for the first time, is not a neutral process and requires significant metabolic resources. We suggest that these noticeable cellular and biochemical transformations were evolutionarily shaped by the different interspecific interactions. Those interactions obviously also depend on the vastly different sizes of the developmental stages and their motility or lack thereof and we do not claim that venom is the only factor shaping them. However, we do suggest that our results support the idea that the costly changes in venom composition are most probably correlated with predation ecology and were selected via interspecific interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) As the authors point out, similar studies focusing on venom composition dynamics have already been reported in both invertebrates (cone snail)[1] and vertebrates (rattlesnakes)[2].

We will do our best to explain in what points our paper is different and novel compared to the previous works where differential developmental expression of toxins was indicated:</p><p>1) First of all, it is important to consider what previous works have established: the work from 2011 of Gibbs et al. [1] reported only subtle changes in venom composition between young and adult rattlesnakes, as the authors themselves state (quote: “Juvenile snakes fed from birth with mice, lizards, or frogs showed little evidence for an ontogenetic shift in venom composition from 5 to 26 months in terms of substantial changes in the relative abundance of major classes of venom toxins. However, there were fine-scale changes in the relative abundance of D49-PLA₂ 15, PI-SVMPs, and PIIISVMP 28, and a decline in the abundance of other PIII-SVMPs.”). The work by Safavi-Hemami on cone snails [2], showed that venom changes between embryos and adults of the species <italic>Conus victoriae</italic>. However, this work showed only two developmental stages, used only two adults as the source of venom and used non-quantitative (normal reverse transcription PCR) at the transcriptomic level.</p><p>2) In contrast to the previous works, the transcriptomic part of our work was done in triplicates on 10 developmental stages and multiple tissues and used thousands of embryos and dozens of adults that normalize any individual variation. This is important as individual variability might have contributed to the differences documented in the previous works (see reviews [3, 4]). Further, our <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> lab population is highly inbred, controlling for genetic variation in a way that the experiments on cone snails and snakes or any other study on field-collected animals could never control. This is an important point as individuals of various venomous species were shown to exhibit much variation in venom expression due to both genetic and environmental conditions. We now mention this point in the Introduction section.</p><p>3) Further, our work is far more quantitative than the two previous works, as Nanostring nCounter technology was shown in multiple studies to be arguably the most accurate technique for transcript level measurements as it is non-enzymatic. We have now also added a semi-quantitative tandem mass-spectrometry analysis to support our transcriptomic findings also at the proteomic level.</p><p>4) Most importantly, our work also shows highly complex tissue and cellular dynamic localization that to our knowledge was never shown before by others.</p><p>5) We do not agree with the reviewer on the point that our findings fail to touch on biological significance, as we show in the manuscript for the first time that sea anemone planulae larvae are capable of rapidly paralyze and kill other animals and that they discharge their nematocysts in this process. Coupled with the highly different venom composition between young and adult stages, we do touch a new biological relevance of venom variation and venom utilization by larva. The cone snail work [2], as elegant as it is, did not do anything parallel to this point.</p><p>6) We now also support the biological relevance of our findings by presenting detailed analysis of interactions between different <italic>Nematostella</italic> developmental stages and two potential predators from the same habitat (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and videos).</p><p>7) Lastly, this might be an obvious point, but our work is performed in a cnidarian, and not on cone snails or snakes that are separated from our model organism by 600 million years. In our opinion, saying that it just repeats previous findings in other systems (which is wrong for all of the above reasons), is analogical to saying that finding a phenomenon in mouse is not exciting because it was already described in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The toxicology experiments were meant to demonstrate the toxicity of Nematostella proteins NvePTx1 and NEP3, which was a main argument made by the authors. However, both experiments were carried out and analyzed in a crude manner and definitely require improvement.

These experiments lead to more confusion, rather than providing functional evidence to support the argument that both genes truly function as toxins.</p></disp-quote><p>As we described in the Materials and methods section, the two toxins were purified by metal ion chromatography, and more importantly by reverse phase chromatography. The fish larvae were incubated only with highly purified toxins. We provide in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1 a</xref> figure showing the reverse phase results of purified toxins and it is easy to see that the vast majority of toxin molecules represent a single isoform as demonstrated by the highly symmetric peak in the chromatogram. From our substantial experience with recombinant cysteine-rich peptides (please see numerous relevant publications by Drs. Moran and Sachkova where this technique was successfully applied), this is a clear evidence for a high degree of homogeneity. The pure peptides were also assayed on electrospray mass spectrometry, yielding masses that fit the formation of disulfide bonds. Solving the 3D structures of these peptides in X-ray or NMR is completely out of the scope of the current manuscript and will be futile unless compared to structures of the native peptides. However, the structure of a Type V sea anemone toxins was never described and they have no homology to other toxin families, whereas NEP3 is only very-far related to the ShK or BgK toxins, making any structural comparisons highly hypothetical. Such an experimental work will take years and is again completely unrelated to the core of the current manuscript and its focus. Further, even in the work by Luo et al. [5] that the reviewer is providing as an example, the three synthetic isoforms of the cone snail toxin all show quite potent activity on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor tested (alpha9alpha10, please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> in that paper).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35014.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Chromatograms of the recombinant sea anemone toxins used in the zebrafish experiments.</title><p>The purified toxins were re-run on a Resource RPC 3 ml reverse phase column (GE Healthcare).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35014-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>The reason for the high concentration that is needed for killing the zebrafish might be that penetration is not very efficient and takes a long time as the fish larvae are incubated with the toxins. Alternatively, some toxins are just not very active alone but are highly synergic with other venom components (see for example [6]). Whatever the reason is, the toxins were able to kill the fish in a few hours whereas the control group, incubated with a non-toxic protein, was alive and well even after overnight incubation. We have now expanded our zebrafish experiments by using more specimens and monitoring more frequently the toxic effects.</p><p>Is zebrafish the right model for our question? Well, are lab mice good model for scorpion, conesnail and spider toxins? That’s a highly debatable topic, with many possible answers. In our paper that focuses on completely different topics, we believe that documenting toxicity is enough for supporting our claim that these are toxins. It is important to remember that this proof is corroborated by the fact that the peptides, show homology to previously characterized sea anemone neurotoxins and were found to be expressed in venom-related nematocytes and gland cells. In our opinion, zebrafish is a suitable model. After all, it represents teleost fish and vertebrates in general because even if it is a freshwater fish from southeastern Asia, it shares the vast majority of ion channel subtypes with other fish species. Please also note that <italic>Nematostella</italic> lives in brackish lagoons that host fish larvae and young-feeding developmental stages of fish. Further, fish can serve as predators and not necessarily as prey, which is anyway much more relevant in the case of NvePTx1 (expressed only in non-feeding stages) and NEP3 (expressed in both feeding and non-feeding stages). We also provide now in our new results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and videos) evidence that killifish larvae from the same habitat try to feed on <italic>Nematostella</italic> eggs and planulae, but fail to consume them and release them unharmed.</p><p>The reviewer is providing the works of Warmke et al. [7] and Luo et al. [5] as examples for high toxin activity. In the first work the authors applied a sea anemone sodium channel modulator (ATX-II) on a fruit fly sodium channel expressed in frog oocytes and in the second work the authors applied a cone snail acetylcholine receptor antagonist on DRG neurons from rat and on mammalian acetylcholine receptors heterologously expressed in frog eggs. Of course one cannot compare apples and oranges, but if the reviewer accepts these highly artificial systems as biologically relevant, our zebrafish experiment is not so bad after all. Further, very high activity of toxins is not a strong proof for ecological relevance, as very strong toxic effects on ecologically irrelevant species (such as sea anemones and flies or cone snails and rats) and off-target effects of toxins, yet with high activity, on pharmacologically irrelevant targets are both well documented in the field of toxinology (see review [3]).</p><p>For all the above reasons, we believe that our toxicity tests on fish are relevant and provide sufficient proof for the activity of NEP3 and NvePTx1 as toxins. However, we agree with the reviewer that the claim for neurotoxic effects based only on tail twitching should be toned down and this is why we use the word “might”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The quality of data in general needs to be improved. Images from double in situ hybridization experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) were meant to demonstrate partial co-localization of different toxins and nematocyst marker gene Ncol3. But the poor quality of these images fails to provide enough cellular resolution to support these claims. Also, the FISH pattern of the same gene NEP3 at primary polyp stage varies from panel to panel, and is not comparable to the double in situ pattern shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>. The same problem exists with the Ncol3 pattern, which was used as a reference marker, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, primary polyp stage, row1 versus row 4.</p></disp-quote><p>Honestly, we are struggling to understand the basis for this remark. We suspect that this has to do with quality of PDF transferred to the reviewer as there is a very significant decrease in quality between our high resolution TIF pictures and the PDF created by the <italic>eLife</italic> system. We provide in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> an example for the reviewer so they can clearly see a cellular-resolution figure demonstrating the partially-overlapping expression patterns of <italic>NEP3</italic> and <italic>NEP3-like</italic>. This figure is part of our original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that we uploaded to the <italic>eLife</italic> system. Additionally, we further solve this problem by adding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> in the manuscript zoomed in panels to better show the co-localization. Further, we also suggest to take the following important point into consideration: In situ hybridization patterns of nematocyte markers or toxins will never be identical between panels as there is considerable animal to animal and even layer to layer variation like with any single cell pattern, i.e., a salt-and-pepper pattern, in <italic>Nematostella</italic>. In most animals (basically almost any animal species which is not a nematode) even under full genetic homogeneity, embryos are not 100% identical to one another in their spatiotemporal expression patterns. For example, if we would use in situ hybridization to localize a gene in a fly brain that is expressed in only a subpopulation of the neurons, every specimen would be slightly different from the other. That’s perfectly normal.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35014.022</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Double Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization experiment demonstrating that the expression patterns of NEP3 and NEP3-like only partially overlap (yellow signal demonstrates overlapping expression of the two genes).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35014-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] This study provides robust data that show differences in toxin-gene and toxin expression across developmental stages and adult tissues.
