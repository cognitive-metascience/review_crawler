in response to internal and external cues. Previously, we analyzed protein turnover rates in cultured brain cells under basal neuronal activity and found that protein turnover is influenced by subcellular localization, protein function, complex association, cell type of origin, and by the cellular environment (Dörrbaum et al., 2018). Here, we advanced our experimental approach to quantify changes in protein synthesis and degradation, as well as the resulting changes in protein turnover or abundance in rat primary hippocampal cultures during homeostatic scaling. Our data demonstrate that a large fraction of the neuronal proteome shows changes in protein synthesis and/or degradation during homeostatic up- and down-scaling.

For example, injections of the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flexner et al., 1963</xref>) or of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lopez-Salon et al., 2001</xref>) into rodent brains during specific time windows after training blocked long-term memory formation. Also, several forms of synaptic plasticity studied in vitro, including homeostatic scaling, require protein synthesis and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehlers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kang and Schuman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rosenberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schanzenbächer et al., 2016</xref>). Homeostatic scaling is a compensatory mechanism that enables neurons to adjust the synaptic strength in response to persistent changes in the network activity. While homeostatic down-scaling reduces synaptic strength, at least in part by AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor (AMPAR) internalization, the opposite is true for homeostatic up-scaling, which increases synaptic strength by increased AMPAR surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Turrigiano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>). In cultured neurons, distinct sets of proteins are differentially regulated during homeostatic scaling that is induced by pharmacological manipulation of neuronal activity. However, homeostatic scaling cannot be evoked in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors or proteasome inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehlers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schanzenbächer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>These findings suggest that information is stored in the specific combination of proteins that are present in neurons, especially at synapses. However, although memories can last for a lifetime, most neuronal proteins are continuously turned over and only a small fraction of neuronal proteins have been reported to be extremely long-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Toyama et al., 2013</xref>). In-vivo studies reported average protein half-lives of 9.0–10.7 days in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fornasiero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Price et al., 2010</xref>), whereas protein half-lives determined in culture are comparably shorter (on average 2.3–5.9 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dörrbaum et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mathieson et al., 2018</xref>) but correlate well with the in vivo data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fornasiero et al., 2018</xref>). Continuous protein turnover is essential to maintain a functional pool of proteins and impaired protein degradation is implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boland et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>What molecular changes underlie homeostatic scaling in neurons and how are these changes accomplished? Previous studies used candidate-based approaches to show the differential expression during synaptic scaling of selected proteins, such as Bdnf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rutherford et al., 1998</xref>) or PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun and Turrigiano, 2011</xref>). Mass spectrometry (MS)–based proteomics allows for the untargeted analysis of all (detectable) proteins without prior candidate selection. Schanzenbächer et al. used BONCAT-MS to analyze the nascent proteome during homeostatic scaling and reported that hundreds of proteins showed regulated synthesis rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schanzenbächer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schanzenbächer et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to the differential expression of new proteins, proteome remodeling can also be accomplished by the selective stabilization or removal of existing proteins. In addition, regulated protein synthesis rates might not change protein abundance levels, but protein turnover rates instead, when accompanied by changes in protein degradation. The contributions of protein synthesis and degradation to changes in protein abundance levels and protein turnover rates during synaptic plasticity have not yet been systematically studied. Here, we used dynamic SILAC (<underline>S</underline>table <underline>I</underline>sotope <underline>L</underline>abeling with <underline>A</underline>mino acids in <underline>C</underline>ell culture) in combination with MS, which enables proteome-wide analysis of protein synthesis and degradation from the same sample and allows one to quantify changes in synthesis and degradation across different experimental conditions. Our data represent the most comprehensive analysis of proteome dynamics associated with homeostatic scaling to date, revealing that large fractions of the neuronal proteome, especially synaptic proteins, are affected by this scaling. Most proteins exhibited a decrease in synthesis or degradation, whereas only a few proteins showed increased synthesis rates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental design used to quantify changes in protein synthesis, degradation, turnover, and abundance</title><p>Dynamic SILAC labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in combination with MS was used to quantify the protein dynamics during homeostatic scaling. Primary hippocampal neurons were grown in a ‘light’ medium that contained all natural amino acids. After 18–19 days in vitro (DIV), the medium was exchanged to a ‘heavy’ medium that contained heavy isotopically labeled arginine and lysine instead of the ‘light’ isotopologues. Upon the medium change, nascent proteins mainly incorporated ‘heavy’ arginine and lysine so that newly synthesized proteins became ‘heavy’ labeled, whereas pre-existing proteins were ‘light’ labeled. Together with the heavy SILAC pulse, drugs were added to elicit homeostatic scaling. Neurons were either treated with the GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor antagonist bicuculline (BIC), to increase global network activity and induce homeostatic down-scaling, or with the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX), to decrease neuronal network activity and induce homeostatic up-scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>) or not treated (Ctrl). The cells were treated and heavy labeled for 1, 3 or 7 days. The heavy and light peptide counterparts were subsequently distinguished and quantified by MS. As demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dörrbaum et al., 2018</xref>), heavy peptides could be robustly detected and quantified even after 1 day of heavy SILAC pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design to quantify protein synthesis and degradation during homeostatic scaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dynamic SILAC experiment.

The turnover rates of all proteins under all experimental conditions are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. The corresponding protein half-lives range from several hours up to &gt;14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Under basal neuronal activity (Ctrl), a median protein half-life of 5.3 days was observed, which is consistent with previous studies from our lab (median half-life of 5.4 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dörrbaum et al., 2018</xref>). Upon TTX-induced homeostatic up-scaling, the protein half-life distribution was significantly shifted towards longer half-lives (median half-life 5.7 days; Mann-Whitney test, p&lt;0.001). An even stronger shift towards longer protein half-lives was observed upon BIC-induced down-scaling (median half-life 6.1 days; Mann-Whitney test, p&lt;0.001), demonstrating that the neuronal proteome dynamics are affected by homeostatic scaling.</p><p>Which are the underlying mechanisms that bring about the observed changes in protein turnover? The most intuitive interpretation of the shift towards longer half-lives is that proteins become stabilized upon homeostatic scaling. However, the calculated protein half-life is influenced not only by changes in protein degradation but also by changes in protein synthesis (denominator in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Hence, altered protein half-lives can be a result of distinct combinations of altered synthesis and degradation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To understand the protein dynamics that drive homeostatic scaling, we quantified independently the protein synthesis and degradation rates as well as the resulting changes in protein abundance and turnover. To enable precise quantification of protein synthesis (heavy channel) and degradation (light channel), we made use of an internal standard (IS), a fully labeled ‘semi-heavy’ neuronal lysate, that was spiked into all samples (‘triple SILAC’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; see 'Materials and methods' section for details). The resulting MS1 spectra then contained three peaks per peptide: the light (L) signal of the pre-existing protein, the heavy (H) signal of the new protein and the semi-heavy (S) signal of the IS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). As the IS was present in all samples in equal amounts, the IS signal was used for normalization purposes to correct for experimental and MS variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This experimental design allowed us to quantify changes in protein synthesis and degradation independently. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> shows all possible combinations of changes in protein synthesis and degradation as well as their effect on protein abundance (up or down) and turnover (faster or slower turnover). The same color code is used throughout the manuscript. ‘Warm’ reddish colors indicate a resulting increase in protein abundance, whereas ‘cold’ blueish colors indicate a decrease in protein abundance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Homeostatic scaling is accomplished by substantial changes in protein synthesis and degradation</title><p>In total, we identified 7150 proteins throughout all experimental conditions. We first analyzed changes in protein synthesis and degradation over the entire duration of the down- and up-scaling experiments (1–7 days; see 'Materials and methods' section). After stringent filtering for dataset completeness, 3596 proteins were quantified for the down-scaling versus control comparison and 3609 proteins were quantified for the up-scaling versus control comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Upon induction of homeostatic down-scaling (BIC treatment), a large fraction of the quantified proteome (43%), showed changes in protein synthesis and/or degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Generally speaking, the regulation was biased toward decreased protein synthesis and/or degradation. Of the regulated proteins, the largest group were proteins that exhibited decreased synthesis rates (703 proteins), followed by those exhibiting decreased degradation rates (496 proteins) and those exhibiting decreased protein turnover rates (less synthesis together with less degradation; 292 proteins). By contrast, only a few proteins showed increased synthesis rates (18 proteins), increased synthesis rates together with decreased degradation rates (nine proteins), increased degradation rates (11 proteins) or increased degradation rates together with reduced synthesis rates (13 proteins; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). These results suggest that reduced protein degradation and reduced protein synthesis are the preferred cellular mechanisms to achieve changes in protein abundance during homeostatic down-scaling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Regulation of protein synthesis and degradation rates during homeostatic scaling.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Regulation during BIC-induced homeostatic down-scaling.

Similar to the results for homeostatic down-scaling, following up-scaling, the largest groups of proteins were regulated by a decrease in synthesis (503 proteins), with the second-largest group being regulated by a decrease in degradation (332 proteins; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). Again, comparably lower numbers of proteins showed increased synthesis rates (93 proteins), increased synthesis rates together with decreased degradation rates (80 proteins), increased degradation rates (42 proteins) or increased degradation rates together with reduced synthesis rates (59 proteins).

Translation initiation is catalyzed by multiple initiation factors and is a major target of translational control. For example, phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor two alpha (eIF2α) at Ser51 inhibits translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dever, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>).

The changes in Ser51 phosphorylation correlate well with the decrease in protein synthesis observed by SILAC-MS and western blot analysis. It is likely, however, that the synthesis of individual proteins, as well as the process of translation, is additionally regulated by other mechanisms during homeostatic scaling.</p><p>Despite a general inhibition of translation initiation, phosphorylation of eIF2α also leads to a paradoxical increase in the translation of mRNAs that contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5′-UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dever, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>).

During down-scaling, we found an over-representation of secretory vesicle and secretory granule proteins, as well as extracellular proteins that were up-regulated by increased synthesis. The strongest increase in synthesis was observed for Secretogranin-2 (Sgc2), a secretory protein that is released into the synaptic cleft in a calcium-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fischer-Colbrie et al., 1995</xref>) and is implicated in several neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agneter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kandlhofer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaufmann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lechner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mahata et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Medhurst et al., 2001</xref>).

On the other hand, the group of proteins that were down-regulated by reduced synthesis showed an over-representation of synaptic proteins, which were associated with the GO terms ‘excitatory synapse’, ‘postsynaptic density’, ‘presynaptic active zone’, ‘chemical synaptic transmission’, ‘regulation of synaptic plasticity’ and others. In addition, there was an over-representation of axonal and dendritic proteins and of proteins that are located in the neuronal cell body. Among the 5% of proteins that showed the strongest reduction in protein synthesis were known regulators of synaptic plasticity, such as Camk2a, PSD-95, Neuronal pentraxin-1 (Nptx1) and the glutamate receptor subunits GluA1, GluA3 and GluN2b. For proteins that were down-regulated by both decreased synthesis and increased degradation, a massive over-representation of synaptic and dendritic proteins was found, especially for the terms ‘excitatory synapse’, ‘postsynaptic density’ and ‘dendritic shaft’.

Within the group of proteins that were down-regulated by increased degradation, there was an over-representation of proteins involved in mRNA translation. Note that for proteins involved in translation, the opposite regulation (decreased degradation) was observed during BIC-induced down-scaling.

Prominent examples in this group of proteins were the AMPAR subunits GluA1 and GluA3, fitting with the observation that AMPAR surface expression is decreased during homeostatic down-scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Turrigiano, 2008</xref>). Interestingly, no significant change in degradation was observed for GluA1 and GluA3. Under basal neuronal activity, the half-lives of GluA1 and GluA3 are 2.8 days and 3.5 days, respectively. These results indicate that long-lasting changes of AMPAR surface expression (in the range of days) during homeostatic down-scaling are probably accomplished by continuous degradation of pre-existing copies at an unchanged degradation rate, together with a decreased supply of newly synthesized copies.</p><p>The same pattern of regulation (decreased synthesis and unchanged degradation) was also observed for the AMPAR auxiliary subunit TARP-γ8, other glutamate receptor subunits (GluK2, GluN2B and mGluR5), scaffold proteins of the postsynaptic density (such as PSD-95, Homer3, SAP-102, DAP-3 and DAP-4), cell adhesion molecules (such as Neuroligins and Neurexins), as well as proteins involved in axon guidance/growth, the synaptic vesicle cycle and other synaptic functions. Only four proteins were down-regulated by an exclusive increase in protein degradation (Syn3, Sept6, rGVAT and Epb41l3), and an additional seven proteins were down-regulated by both decreased synthesis and increased degradation (Akap5, Atp2b2, Cacna1b, Homer1, Rgs12, Sptbn2 and Synpo). Only a few synaptic proteins were up-regulated during homeostatic down-scaling. Three proteins were up-regulated by increased synthesis (Itgb1, Ptprn and Slc6a17), 17 proteins were up-regulated by decreased degradation and two proteins were up-regulated by both increased synthesis and decreased degradation (Bdnf and Pcdh8).</p><p>The majority of the synaptic proteins that were affected by BIC-induced down-scaling were also regulated during TTX-induced up-scaling and vice versa (111 proteins; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast to BIC-induced down-scaling, during TTX-induced up-scaling, the number of synaptic proteins that were up-regulated (66 proteins) was similar to the number that was down-regulated (79 proteins) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the increased AMPAR surface expression observed during homeostatic up-scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Turrigiano, 2008</xref>), increased protein synthesis was observed for GluA1, but not for GluA2 and GluA3. In addition to GluA1, ten additional synaptic proteins were up-regulated by increased synthesis only (Cntn2, Epha4, Frrs1l, NLG-3, Noelin, Prrt2, Rapgef2, Syt7, vGlut2 and Vamp7). Note that seven of these ten proteins were also regulated during homeostatic down-scaling and showed opposite changes (less synthesis). A comparably large group of 44 synaptic proteins was up-regulated by decreased degradation. This group includes mGluR5, Camk2b/g, PKC as well as scaffold proteins of the postsynaptic density (such as PSD-95, DAP1, DAP3 and Shank1) and proteins that are involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle (such as Syn1, Syngr1, and Stx1a). In addition, 11 proteins were up-regulated by both increased synthesis and decreased degradation. These proteins include the AMPAR regulator Camk2a, the postsynaptic density scaffold protein Homer3, Nitric oxide synthase 1 (Nos1) and presynaptic proteins that are involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle, such as Syt5, vGlut1 and SV2b. Down-regulation of synaptic proteins was mainly accomplished by a decrease in protein synthesis. 76 synaptic proteins exhibited decreased synthesis rates, including the AMPAR subunits GluA2/3, postsynaptic density scaffold proteins (such as Homer1, SAP-102 and DAP-4), cell adhesion molecules, and proteins involved in axon guidance/growth or the synaptic vesicle cycle.

However, this comparison also revealed that significantly more proteins showed changes in abundance during both treatments (194 proteins) than expected by chance (Fisher’s exact test), suggesting that partially overlapping sets of regulated proteins were responsible for up- and down-scaling. We analyzed the changes observed for the proteins that were affected by both treatments in more detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), and found that similar numbers of proteins showed the same regulation or opposite regulation. Proteins that show the same regulation upon both treatments might be ‘general plasticity proteins’ that are involved in sensing an offset from basal activity levels, regardless of the sign of that offset. 35 proteins (e.g. Scg2) were up-regulated during up-scaling and down-scaling, and 66 proteins (e.g. Synpo) were down-regulated during both treatments. By contrast, proteins that show opposite regulation upon the opposite treatments might be ‘polarity proteins’ that sense the polarity of the offset or determine the polarity of the compensatory scaling. 53 proteins were up-regulated upon TTX-induced up-scaling and down-regulated upon BIC-induced down-scaling (e.g. Nptx1, Homer1 and Scg1) and 40 proteins were up-regulated during BIC-induced down-scaling and down-regulated during TTX-induced up-scaling (e.g. Pcdh8, Pcdh17, Vgf and several ribosomal proteins).</p><p>We analyzed the underlying types of regulation in more detail and found that several combinations of regulation upon BIC and TTX treatment were significantly over-represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among these patterns, we found an over-representation of proteins that showed decreased synthesis upon both treatments as well as proteins that showed decreased synthesis upon BIC treatment and decreased synthesis together with increased degradation upon TTX treatment. Proteins of these groups might be affected by molecular pathways that are involved in both homeostatic up- and down-scaling, such as the global decrease in translation caused by eIF2α phosphorylation. Only one protein showed an increase in synthesis upon both treatments. By contrast, many proteins that showed increased synthesis upon one treatment, showed the opposite regulation (decreased synthesis) upon the other treatment. Proteins of these groups might be part of the molecular pathways that underlie homeostatic up- and down-scaling, and changes in their synthesis rates (increased or decreased synthesis) might define the polarity of the scaling. The fact that most over-represented combinations involve a change in protein synthesis for both treatments suggests that changes in the nascent proteome mainly drive homeostatic scaling and determine the polarity of the scaling, consistent with the fact that protein synthesis is required for homeostatic scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schanzenbächer et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Temporal regulation of protein synthesis and degradation during homeostatic scaling</title><p>The analysis of the data obtained over the entire time course of the experiment (1, 3 and 7 days treatment) enables the sensitive detection of the long-scale regulation of protein synthesis or degradation, but does not consider shorter-term temporal changes in the strength or direction of the regulation. To inspect the temporal dynamics of protein synthesis and degradation, we analyzed the individual time points separately and found that many proteins exhibited temporal changes in the strength and direction of regulation during homeostatic scaling. After 1 day of BIC treatment, more than 600 proteins exhibited a change in synthesis and, on average, protein synthesis rates were reduced by approximately 20% compared to untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This is in good agreement with the decrease in protein synthesis detected by AHA labeling and western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). While the average fold-change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and the average regulation strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) of protein synthesis decreased over time, the opposite trend was observed for protein degradation. During TTX-induced up-scaling, the numbers of proteins with significantly regulated synthesis rates increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These protein sub-populations showed, on average, a decrease in protein synthesis with the strongest average decrease observed after 3 days of treatment. The average regulation strength was similar for all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The sub-populations of proteins with significantly altered degradation rates showed, on average, a decrease in degradation for all time points.

The sub-population of proteins with significant changes in synthesis showed, on average, a decrease in synthesis.

To identify groups of proteins that have similar behavior during homeostatic scaling, all quantified proteins were clustered using their temporal profiles of pre-existing and newly synthesized proteins (kmeans clustering), and the resulting clusters were manually assigned to upper-level groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig8sdata1">Figure 8—source data 1</xref>). During down-scaling, there were several clusters of proteins (containing 967 proteins) that were mainly regulated by changes in protein synthesis, either over the entire time course (‘persistent’) or at distinct time points (early, intermediate or late). 192 proteins belong to clusters that showed a persistent decrease in protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). These clusters contain many synaptic proteins, such as the postsynaptic scaffold protein PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). 184 proteins belong to clusters that showed a transient decrease in protein synthesis after 1 day of BIC treatment (‘early peak’), such as the candidate plasticity gene 2 (Cpg2), which is involved in activity-dependent AMPAR internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Loebrich et al., 2013</xref>). The largest number of proteins was assigned to clusters that showed a transient change in protein synthesis after 3 days of BIC treatment (337 proteins; ‘intermediate peak’), such as the postsynaptic density protein Disks large-associated protein 2 (DAP-2). Comparably smaller numbers of proteins were assigned to clusters with transient changes in protein synthesis after 3 and 7 days (209 proteins; ‘intermediate and late peak’) or after 7 days of BIC treatment (89 proteins; ‘late peak’). In addition, 105 proteins were assigned to clusters that showed a decreasing regulation strength over time. A representative protein of this group is Bdnf, which showed the strongest increase in synthesis after 1 day of BIC treatment and decreasing regulation strength after 3 and 7 days of treatment.

During up-scaling, no clusters with persistent changes in synthesis over the entire time course or with transient changes in synthesis after 1 day of treatment were observed. Instead, more proteins were assigned to clusters that showed transient changes in synthesis after 3 days (231 proteins; ‘intermediate peak’), 3 days and 7 days (287 proteins; ‘intermediate and late peak’) or 7 days (294 proteins; ‘late peak’) of treatment. In contrast to BIC-induced down-scaling, 135 proteins showed an increasing regulation strength over time, whereas only 20 proteins showed a decreasing regulation strength. For both down-scaling and up-scaling, there were several clusters of proteins that were mainly regulated by changes in degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). For both treatments, most proteins were assigned to clusters with transient changes in degradation after 3 days of treatment (150 proteins for BIC and 269 proteins for TTX). Comparably lower numbers of proteins were assigned to clusters with transient changes in degradation after 7 days of treatment (125 proteins for BIC and 179 proteins for TTX). In addition, several clusters showed increasing regulation strength over time (98 proteins for BIC and 84 proteins for TTX), whereas there were no clusters with decreasing regulation strength for both treatments.</p><p>Proteins that were regulated by both synthesis and degradation were also clustered and assigned to upper-level groups using the timing and the polarity (up- or down-regulation of the nascent and pre-existing proteins) of the observed regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). For BIC-induced down-scaling, only a few proteins were assigned to clusters that showed changes in synthesis and degradation leading to the same effect (15 proteins; nascent and pre-existing proteins both up-regulated or both down-regulated), whereas a larger number of proteins were assigned to clusters with changes in synthesis and degradation leading to the opposite effect (72 proteins). A representative example of this group is Prkce, which showed a down-regulation of nascent proteins (less synthesis) and an up-regulation of pre-existing proteins (less degradation). The opposite trend was observed for TTX-induced up-scaling. 242 proteins were assigned to clusters with changes in synthesis and degradation leading to the same effect. A representative example for this group is the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit Cacnb1, which showed up-regulation of both nascent proteins (more synthesis) and pre-existing proteins (less degradation). Only 40 proteins were assigned to clusters that showed changes in synthesis and degradation leading to the opposite effect.</p><p>Simultaneous regulation of protein synthesis and degradation that lead to the same protein abundance outcome, which is predominantly seen for TTX-induced up-scaling, can elicit a stronger change in relative protein abundance, whereas regulation of protein synthesis and degradation that lead to the opposite abundance outcomes, as predominantly seen for BIC-induced down-scaling, mainly influence protein turnover. In addition to the direction of the regulation, we also observed differences in the timing of the regulation of proteins synthesis and degradation during BIC and TTX treatments. For BIC-induced down-scaling, several clusters (containing 197 proteins) showed first a change in synthesis followed by a delayed change in degradation. A representative example for this group is the synaptic protein Teneurin-2, which showed decreased synthesis after 1 and 3 days of treatment followed by decreased degradation after 3 and 7 days of treatment. No protein cluster with this predominant behavior was observed for TTX-induced up-scaling. By contrast, the opposite trend was observed for TTX. Two clusters (containing 67 proteins) showed first a change in degradation followed by a delayed change in synthesis, as shown for the representative protein Cacnb3. On the other hand, there was no protein cluster with this behavior under BIC treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we used dynamic SILAC labeling and MS to quantify changes in protein synthesis, degradation, abundance and turnover during homeostatic scaling in cultured neurons. We found that the neuronal proteome was massively remodeled during both down-scaling and up-scaling. Synaptic proteins were especially affected by the scaling. More than half of the quantified synaptic proteins were regulated. Most proteins were regulated by a decrease in synthesis or degradation. A small and mostly treatment-specific fraction of proteins showed increased synthesis rates.</p><p>In general, a cell has different options to adjust the abundance of its proteins. For protein up-regulation, the cell can produce more protein (more synthesis) or stabilize existing copies (less degradation) or do both. For protein down-regulation, a cell can reduce the synthesis or enhance the degradation or both. Our data demonstrate that decreased protein degradation and decreased protein synthesis are the preferred cellular mechanisms to achieve increased or decreased protein abundance, respectively, during homeostatic scaling. This preference was observed for both homeostatic up- and down-scaling, suggesting that decreasing protein synthesis or degradation might be a generally preferred mechanism to accomplish long-term changes in the neuronal proteome. Reduced protein synthesis or degradation rates might be preferred over increased degradation or synthesis rates, respectively, because it is the more energy-saving way to achieve proteomic changes. The signal processing power, and hence the cognitive capability, of the brain is limited by the availability of energy. Most of the brain’s energy budget is required for signaling-related processes, and reduced ‘housekeeping costs’ (including costs associated with protein synthesis and degradation), provide a cognitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Engl and Attwell, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Mechanistically spoken, the decrease in protein synthesis observed during homeostatic scaling can be explained, at least in part, by eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which inhibits translation initiation but also increases the translation of mRNAs that contain uORFs in their 5’′UTRs. Phosphorylation of eIF2α was previously identified as an underlying mechanism of long-term depression induced by metabotropic glutamate receptor activation (mGluR-LTD), another protein synthesis-dependent form of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Prisco et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The proteomic response to up- and down-scaling exhibited both common and unique features. Many proteins were exclusively affected by TTX treatment (735 proteins) or BIC treatment (197 proteins, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In addition, a significantly over-represented fraction of proteins (194 proteins) showed a change in abundance upon both treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Within the group of proteins that exhibited changes for both up- and down-scaling, some proteins showed the same type of regulation (increased or decreased abundance) upon both treatments (101 proteins), whereas an equal number of proteins exhibited opposite regulation upon BIC or TTX treatment (93 proteins; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). How can the same underlying mechanism (e.g. eIF2α phosphorylation) result in different phenotypes? Although there is an over-representation of proteins that showed decreased synthesis upon both treatments, the proteins that showed increased synthesis were mostly exclusive to either BIC-induced down-scaling or TTX-induced up-scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), leading to distinct proteomic changes during up- and down-scaling. This specificity might be achieved by transcriptional regulation.</p><p>The nascent proteome is regulated by the mRNAs that are available for translation, especially those that contain uORFs and are preferentially translated upon eIF2α phosphorylation. Consistently, bidirectional transcriptional regulation has been observed in previous studies after 6 hr of BIC or TTX treatment in primary cortical cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schaukowitch et al., 2017</xref>). Several of the proteins that showed increased synthesis during BIC-induced down-scaling in our data were previously reported to be up-regulated at the transcriptional level. For example, 27 proteins showed increased synthesis during homeostatic down-scaling in our data. Transcripts for 11 of these proteins were previously quantified during homeostatic down-scaling induced by 2 days of picrotoxin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rajman et al., 2017</xref>) or 6 hr of BIC treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schaukowitch et al., 2017</xref>), of which 10/11 were significantly up-regulated. Also, transcriptional up-regulation was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schaukowitch et al., 2017</xref>) for 7 out of 8 proteins that showed increased synthesis during TTX-induced up-scaling.</p><p>Further specificity might be obtained by local changes in eIF2α phosphorylation. Upon BIC or TTX treatment, eIF2α might be phosphorylated in distinct neuronal cell types and/or at distinct sub-cellular localizations to repress general translation locally and to enhance the translation of locally enriched uORF-containing transcripts. In addition, the synthesis rates of individual proteins as well as translation in general might be regulated by other mechanisms. Previous studies demonstrated that post-transcriptional regulation by micro-RNAs, which regulate the pool of ‘translatable’ mRNAs, are critically involved in homeostatic up-scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fiore et al., 2014</xref>) as well as in down-scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Letellier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rajman et al., 2017</xref>). Besides transcriptional and translational regulation, proteomic changes are also accomplished by changes in protein degradation. Despite the general decrease in protein degradation observed in our data, no change in proteasome activity or ongoing autophagy was observed, suggesting that protein degradation is regulated at the level of ubiquitin ligation by specific E3 ligases. During homeostatic up- and down-scaling, distinct sets of proteins showed altered degradation rates and there was no over-representation of proteins that were similarly affected by both treatments.</p><p>Synaptic proteins were especially affected by homeostatic up- and down-scaling. Of note, we observed extensive changes in both postsynaptic and presynaptic proteins, suggesting that both sides of the synapse are modified during homeostatic scaling. It is generally agreed that homeostatic scaling at mammalian synapses uses postsynaptic mechanisms that evoke changes in AMPAR surface expression. Consistent with this notion, we observed a decreased synthesis of the AMPAR subunits GluA1 and GluA3 and of the auxiliary subunit TARP-γ8 during homeostatic down-scaling, as well as increased synthesis of GluA1 during homeostatic up-scaling. Presynaptic mechanisms are less explored, but also contribute to homeostatic scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis and Müller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murthy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vitureira et al., 2012</xref>). For instance, previous studies have described enhanced glutamate transporter (vGluT) expression in pre-synaptic terminals upon activity blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Gois et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erickson et al., 2006</xref>), which might enable the neurons to package more neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles to enhance quantal signals. Consistent with this, we observed an up-regulation of vGluT1 (by increased synthesis and decreased degradation) and vGluT2 (by increased synthesis) during TTX-induced up-scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). During BIC-induced down-scaling, on the other hand, we found a decrease in the synthesis of vGluT1 (Figure 4), which could, in principle, lower vesicular neurotransmitter levels, leading to decreased mEPSC amplitudes. Besides the glutamate transporters, many other presynaptic proteins were regulated upon BIC or TTX treatment, suggesting that additional presynaptic mechanisms contribute to homeostatic scaling. Overall, most synaptic proteins exhibited a decrease in synthesis during homeostatic down-scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Correspondingly, we found a significant over-representation of synaptic GO terms in the group of proteins that showed decreased synthesis or decreased synthesis together with increased degradation during homeostatic down-scaling (including synapse, excitatory synapse, glutamatergic synapse, postsynapse, presynapse, and synaptic vesicle; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This finding is consistent with the concept of synaptic down-scaling decreasing neuronal network activity. Only a few synaptic proteins were up-regulated during BIC-induced down-scaling. The strongest up-regulation was observed for Bdnf and Pcdh8, which exhibited increased synthesis as well as decreased degradation. Bdnf is released in a calcium- and activity-dependent manner, and was one of the first proteins implicated in homeostatic scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rutherford et al., 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rutherford et al. (1998)</xref> showed that Bdnf is required for and negatively regulates homeostatic up-scaling. Pcdh8 (also named Arcadlin) is an activity-induced protocadherin that binds to N-cadherin to promote its endocytosis and thereby weaken synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arikkath and Reichardt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yasuda et al., 2007</xref>). Our data suggest that the expression of Pcdh8 might bidirectionally regulate the strength of synaptic connections during homeostatic down-scaling (through increased synthesis and decreased degradation of Pcdh8) and homeostatic up-scaling (through decreased synthesis of Pcdh8).</p><p>During TTX-induced up-scaling, many synaptic proteins were up-regulated by increased synthesis and/or decreased degradation. For instance, increased protein synthesis was observed for GluA1, but not for GluA2 and GluA3. GluA2-lacking receptors have a higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability, channel conductance and open probability than GluA2-containing receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burnashev et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oh and Derkach, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swanson et al., 1997</xref>), and an increased contribution of GluA2-lacking AMPARs has been observed upon synaptic strengthening induced by long-term activity blockade by TTX and APV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sutton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thiagarajan et al., 2005</xref>). Nitric oxide synthase 1 (Nos1) — a protein that is required for long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haley et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hardingham et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schuman and Madison, 1991</xref>) — is another interesting candidate that is up-regulated by increased synthesis as well as by decreased degradation during TTX-induced up-scaling. Hence, our data suggest that Nos1 and NO signaling is also regulated by homeostatic up-scaling and might be a link between the presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms underlying homeostatic scaling. Among the proteins that were down-regulated by decreased synthesis, we found an over-representation of (among others) proteins associated with GABA-ergic synapses, which makes sense for a system that is in the process of up-scaling. Together, these changes accomplish a proteomic remodeling at the synapses that might strengthen the synaptic connections.</p><p>Temporal analysis revealed that many proteins showed transient changes in synthesis and/or degradation during homeostatic scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Proteins that were only regulated at the first time point or that showed decreasing strength of regulation (e.g. Bdnf during down-scaling; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) might play a role in the initiation of homeostatic scaling, whereas proteins that were permanently regulated (such as PSD-95 during down-scaling; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) might be involved in maintenance of the scaling.</p><p>In addition to the protein candidates highlighted above, our comprehensive dataset contains hundreds of proteins that showed changes in synthesis and/or degradation during homeostatic up- or down-scaling. The use of the ‘semi-heavy’ internal standard enabled us to correct for the experimental and technical variation introduced during sample preparation and LC-MS acquisition. Therefore, we obtained a high-precision dataset that allowed us to quantify even small changes in protein synthesis and degradation with statistical significance; small changes are often missed with label-free or label-free-like (separate evaluation of isotopic channels without internal normalization) experimental designs. We believe that small changes in protein synthesis and/or degradation (detected in the whole-cell lysate) might be biologically relevant as they could have a strong local impact either in different neuron types or at specific sub-cellular locations. In support of our data, many of these regulated proteins were previously implicated in synaptic plasticity. In addition, we discovered regulation of proteins that were not yet implicated in homeostatic scaling or synaptic plasticity, which are promising candidates for future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation and maintenance of primary cultured hippocampal cells</title><p>Dissociated hippocampal neurons were prepared and maintained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aakalu et al., 2001</xref>).

The lysates were incubated with Benzonase (1 µL of a ≥ 250 units/mL stock solution; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 10 min and cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 x g. Protein concentration was determined via BCA assay (Thermo). Three independent biological replicates were performed from each different preparation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Preparation of semi-heavy neurons as internal standard</title><p>Primary hippocampal neurons were prepared and plated as described above. Six hours after plating, the medium was fully exchanged with a medium that was depleted of arginine and lysine (customized; Invitrogen) and supplemented with ‘semi-heavy’ isotopically labeled arginine (R6; Thermo) and lysine (K4; Thermo). After 21 DIV, the cells were harvested and lysed as described above. Semi-heavy lysates from different culture dishes were merged to create one master mix (‘semi-heavy internal standard’; IS).

In addition, 25 µg samples of the dynamic SILAC lysates without internal standard (‘double SILAC’ samples) were also processed for MS analysis. Note, in one biological replicate, ‘double SILAC’ samples were only prepared for the untreated control samples (sample overview in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The proteins were digested according to the ‘Filter-Aided Sample Preparation’ (FASP) protocol as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wiśniewski et al. (2009)</xref>. After digestion, the ‘double SILAC’ samples were desalted using C18 StageTips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rappsilber et al., 2007</xref>). The digested ‘triple SILAC’ samples were fractionated into four fractions using strong-cation-exchange (SCX) StageTips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rappsilber et al., 2007</xref>). All fractions were desalted using C18 StageTips.

Peptides were separated on a PepMap RSLC analytical column (C18, L = 50 cm, &lt;2 µm particle size, Dionex) by a gradient of phase A (water with 5% v/v dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO] and 0.1% FA) and phase B (5% DMSO, 15% water and 80% ACN v/v/v). The gradient was ramped from 4% B to 48% B in 178 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. All solvents were LC-MS grade and purchased from Fluka. Eluting peptides were ionized online using a Nanospray Flex ion source (Thermo Scientific) and analyzed either in a QExactive Plus (Thermo Scientific) or in a Lumos Fusion (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer in data-dependent acquisition mode. The full parameter sets are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification. Protein-N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation were set as variable modifications. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was applied at the peptide-spectrum-match (PSM) and protein level. To assess the rate of re-incorporation of ‘light’ arginine and lysine into nascent proteins during the’ heavy’ pulse (‘recycling rate’), the ‘double SILAC’ samples were analyzed with multiplicity set to one, and heavy arginine (R10) and heavy lysine (K8) were set as additional variable modifications. For precise quantification of nascent and pre-existing proteins, the ‘triple SILAC’ samples were searched with a multiplicity of 3 (light [K0, R0], semi-heavy [K4, R6], and heavy [K8, R10]). All MaxQuant results were filtered to remove contaminants and decoys. If not stated otherwise, only unique peptides were included in downstream analysis.

The ratio of the following combinations was calculated for each sample (except t<sub>0</sub> samples) based on the number of detections: ‘light-heavy’ and ‘heavy-heavy’. The probabilities of incorporation of light or heavy arginine or lysine into nascent proteins were calculated as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dörrbaum et al. (2018)</xref>. For each biological replicate, the average heavy incorporation probability was calculated and used as a ‘recycling correction factor’ for the ‘triple SILAC’ data.

Using the peptide results of the ‘triple SILAC’ data, the fractions of the remaining light peptides (%L) were calculated for each measurement and each peptide based on the H/L ratios. For t<sub>0</sub> samples, %L was set to 1 if the peptide was only detected in its ‘light’ form. The fraction of light peptide was converted into the fraction of pre-existing peptide (%old) using the above-described correction factors, which correct for the incorporation of light Arg/Lys into newly synthesized proteins. Resulting negative values were excluded from further analysis. Peptides were subsequently filtered within biological replicates. Only unique peptides that were quantified at all four time points (t<sub>0</sub>, 1d, 3d, 7d) and with a mean %old &gt;0.9 at t<sub>0</sub> were considered for further analysis. In a few cases, two protein groups were merged (in order to rescue peptides) and only peptides unique for the merged group were further considered. For downstream analysis, only protein groups in which at least one peptide fulfilled the above criteria in each biological replicate were used. Peptide outliers as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dörrbaum et al. (2018)</xref> were removed. For each protein and each condition (BIC, TTX, Ctrl), the filtered peptide data (%old over time) were natural log transformed and fitted by a linear function.

MaxQuant peptide results from the ‘triple SILAC’ data were filtered for decoys and contaminants. For each protein in each sample, the sample-to-IS ratio ([H+L]/M) was calculated. To correct for slight inaccuracies during IS spike-in, all samples were scaled to the same median sample-to-IS ratio. The ‘recycling correction factors’ (described above) were used to correct for re-incorporation of light Arg/Lys into nascent proteins during the heavy pulse, and to convert the scaled H/M signals into nascent protein signals and the L/M signals into pre-existing protein signals. Resulting negative values were excluded from further analysis. For the quantitative comparison between different conditions (treatments vs untreated control), only unique peptides that were quantified in both the treatment and the corresponding control sample (treatment–control peptide pairs) were used.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Proteome dynamics during homeostatic scaling in cultured neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors have quantified changes in protein synthesis and degradation as well as changes in protein turnover and abundance in hippocampal neuronal cultures during homeostatic scaling induced by neuronal activity. The authors demonstrate that a large percentage of the neuronal proteome changes during to synthesis and/or degradation during both homeostatic up- and down-scaling. Especially interesting, and perhaps surprising, is that more than half of the quantified synaptic proteins were regulated. These included both pre- and post-synaptic proteins that have diverse functions.</p><p>However, the evaluation indicated several reservations. There are deficits raised in the experiments and the description of the results that warrant improvements. The first is the need for additional validation of the mass spectrometry results. A second problem is the need to emphasize the main findings in a clearer fashion, which will require a reorganization of the paper. Both reviewers felt these concerns could be addressed in a two month period. Their detailed comments are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The major concern is that the authors are assuming that endogenous proteins are all light labeled and that all newly synthesized proteins are heavy labeled. The potential problem is that not every protein will have abundant arginine/lysine amino acids and that no label is 100% efficient. How do the authors know that they have 100% efficiency in labeling? The authors could address this issue in either of two ways. One would be to double label with SILAC and AHA (i.e., QuaNCAT). The other way would be to medium label, followed by a heavy label for the 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, etc. In either case, there would be a coincidence detection and the authors could make a more direct comparison between two groups of labeled proteins.</p><p>2) The experiments are generally well performed however, the conclusions are rather complicated and in some cases vague – often leaving the reader wondering what can be learned from all these measurements. The manuscript contains a very large number of figures (nine) and the flow of narrative is rather winding and the experiments do not flow well together. Overall, this reviewer is very fond of these type of projects and many of the compelling previous studies from the Schuman lab. However, this manuscript reads as it was pieced together from extra datasets that were left out of previous publications. Many modern and powerful strategies have been used but very tough to interpret most of the results, save for a few controls (such as BDNF). The take away message it just too soft.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52939.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The major concern is that the authors are assuming that endogenous proteins are all light labeled and that all newly synthesized proteins are heavy labeled.

How do the authors know that they have 100% efficiency in labeling?</p></disp-quote><p>For our analysis, we only use tryptic peptides (with up to 2 missed cleavages) that contain at least one arginine or lysine. More than 99% of the proteins contained in the UniProt database for <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> contain at least one arginine or lysine, making almost the entire proteome accessible for this approach. Based on the measured peptide precursor masses, we can unambiguously distinguish heavy from light peptide species. This is a well-established approach in the proteomics community. All pre-existing proteins (proteins that were produced before the heavy SILAC labeling) were ‘light labeled’, as the cells were only exposed to natural light, but not heavy amino acids before. Natural (light) peptides also contain natural heavy isotopes, however, due to the low abundance of natural heavy isotopes, the interference with heavy or semi-heavy labeled peptides (resulting from SILAC labeling) is negligible (see isotopic patterns in Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Upon the change to the heavy SILAC medium, mainly heavy arginine and lysine were incorporated into nascent proteins. However, the medium contained approximately 20% of remaining light arginine/lysine and additional light arginine/lysine might have become available by degradation of pre-existing proteins. To correct for the potential incorporation of light arginine/lysine into nascent proteins during the heavy SILAC pulse, we developed a correction factor. Based on peptides that contained two arginine/lysine residues (due to one missed tryptic cleavage site), we calculated the probability of the incorporation of light or heavy arginine/lysine, respectively. The procedure is described in more detail in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors could address this issue in either of two ways.

However, in our experiments, newly synthesized proteins are labeled for longer durations of 24 hours, 3 days and 7 days. We and others previously showed that 1 day SILAC labeling in primary neuronal cultures is sufficient for accurate quantification of heavy and light peptide counterparts (Cohen et al., 2013; Mathieson et al., 2018; Dörrbaum et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The other way would be to medium label, followed by a heavy label for the 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, etc. In either case, there would be a coincidence detection and the authors could make a more direct comparison between two groups of labeled proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t understand the advantage of a ‘semi-heavy’ (‘medium’) pulse prior to the ‘heavy’ pulse. We hope that the above explanation about how all proteins are light-labeled from the outset, might clarify things for the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The experiments are generally well performed however, the conclusions are rather complicated and in some cases vague – often leaving the reader wondering what can be learned from all these measurements.

This is absolutely not the case. The aim of the project was singular: to quantify the proteome dynamics that underlie homeostatic scaling in neurons. To this end, we used dynamic SILAC labeling together with mass spectrometry to quantify the changes in protein synthesis and degradation as well as resulting changes in protein turnover or protein abundance for several thousand neuronal proteins. The SILAC-MS data, which is the first dataset that comprehensively describes the changes in protein synthesis, degradation, turnover and abundance during homeostatic scaling, is the core of the manuscript. All additional experiments were performed to validate, support or explain the SILAC-MS results, as outlined below:</p><p>– Electrophysiological recordings were performed to confirm that BIC and TTX treatments induced homeostatic down- or up-scaling, respectively, over the entire duration of the experiment.</p><p>– AHA labeling and western blot analysis was performed to validate the finding that a large fraction of proteins exhibited decreased synthesis rates during homeostatic scaling.</p><p>– Following up on the observation that protein synthesis was reduced during homeostatic scaling, western blot analysis was performed to demonstrate that eIF2α was phosphorylated during homeostatic scaling. Phosphorylation of eIF2α inhibits protein synthesis and is hence one underlying mechanism that may lead to the decrease in protein synthesis observed in the SILAC-MS data.</p><p>– Based on the SILAC-MS data we also found that a large proportion of proteins exhibited reduced degradation rates during homeostatic scaling. Following up on this observation, we analyzed ongoing proteasomal degradation (proteasome activity assay) and autophagy (based on the SILAC-MS data) to find that neither proteasome activity nor ongoing autophagy was impaired during homeostatic scaling.</p><p>– In addition, we now included western blot analyses to verify our SILAC-MS results for some candidate proteins.</p><p>We nevertheless take the reviewer’s comment to indicate that the original version of the paper was very dense- we agree. To improve the flow of the manuscript, we condensed and restructured the Results and Discussion sections to make the take-home messages more clear. We also wish to emphasize, though, that we chose <italic>eLife</italic> as the preferred journal for publication because it allows for the publication and exploration of complete datasets.</p></body></sub-article></article>
