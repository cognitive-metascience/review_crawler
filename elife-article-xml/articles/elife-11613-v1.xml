Here, we investigate genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility in mouse rods and cones and correlate differences in these features with gene expression, histone marks, transcription factor binding, and DNA sequence motifs. Loss of NR2E3 in rods shifts their epigenomes to a more cone-like state. The data further reveal wide differences in DNA methylation between retinal photoreceptors and brain neurons. Surprisingly, we also find a substantial fraction of DNA hypo-methylated regions in adult rods that are not in active chromatin. Many of these regions exhibit hallmarks of regulatory regions that were active earlier in neuronal development, suggesting that these regions could remain undermethylated due to the highly compact chromatin in mature rods. This work defines the epigenomic landscapes of rods and cones, revealing features relevant to photoreceptor development and function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11613.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11613.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11613.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Vision in humans is made possible by a light-sensing sheet of cells at the back of the eye called the retina. The surface of the retina is populated by specialized sensory cells, known as rods and cones. The rod cells detect very dim light, while the cones are less sensitive to light but are used to detect color. Together, the rods and cones gather the information needed to create a picture that is then transmitted to the brain.</p><p>Rods and cones have been studied for decades, and genetic analyses have revealed the patterns of gene expression that lead a cell to develop into either a rod or a cone. Researchers have also identified several key regulatory genes that control these patterns, but less is known about the role of other factors that control the expression of genes.</p><p>Chemical modifications to DNA or modifications to the proteins associated with DNA – which are collectively called epigenetic modifications – can either promote or inhibit the activation of nearby genes. Now, Mo et al. have shown that rods and cones from mice have very different patterns of epigenetic modifications. The experiments also revealed that many sections of DNA that are marked to promote gene activation contain known rod-specific or cone-specific genes; and that rod cells need a known regulatory gene to develop their specific pattern of epigenetic modifications. Finally, Mo et al. showed that epigenetic regulation differed between brain cells and rods and cones.</p><p>These insights into epigenetic regulation of rod and cone genes may help explain why some people with eye diseases caused by the same genetic mutation may develop symptoms at different ages or lose vision at different rates. The new information about gene regulation may also help scientists to reprogram stem cells to become healthy rods or cones that could be transplanted into people with eye disease to restore their vision.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11613.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11613.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>retinal photoreceptors</kwd><kwd>retinal development</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Medical Scientist Training Program (T32)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mo</surname><given-names>Alisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Visual Neuroscience Training Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mo</surname><given-names>Alisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Chongyuan</given-names></name><name><surname>Eddy</surname><given-names>Sean R</given-names></name><name><surname>Ecker</surname><given-names>Joseph R</given-names></name><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Fred P</given-names></name><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>Gilbert L</given-names></name><name><surname>Picard</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00NS080911</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mukamel</surname><given-names>Eran A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HG0007348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beer</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1-U01-MH105985</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ecker</surname><given-names>Joseph R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GBMF3034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ecker</surname><given-names>Joseph R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation and accessible chromatin shows that retinal rods and cones have distinct epigenomic features that reflect differences in their development and function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The retina is the starting point of vision. It originates from the embryonic diencephalon and contains three layers of neurons: an outer nuclear layer with rods and cones; an inner nuclear layer with bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine cells; and a ganglion cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Swaroop et al., 2010</xref>). Rods can respond to a single photon and mediate vision in dim light. Cones are less sensitive to light and mediate color vision. Photoreceptor specialization results from well-defined rod- and cone-specific patterns of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kefalov, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siegert et al., 2012</xref>), which are in part controlled by retinal transcription factors (TFs) OTX2, CRX, NRL, and NR2E3. In both rods and cones, OTX2 determines photoreceptor cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nishida et al., 2003</xref>), and CRX regulates expression of terminal photoreceptor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Furukawa et al., 1997</xref>). Rod photoreceptor fate and gene activation are induced by NRL and its downstream target NR2E3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mears et al., 2001</xref>). Loss of NR2E3 leads to enhanced S-cone syndrome, an autosomal recessive human retinal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haider et al., 2000</xref>) that is recapitulated in retinal degeneration 7 (<italic>rd7</italic>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haider et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>rd7</italic> rods show a partial conversion of photoreceptor identity because they retain expression of rod-specific genes but also de-repress a subset of cone-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corbo and Cepko, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peng et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Regulatory regions such as enhancers and promoters control functional differences between rods and cones. Although these regions are beginning to be defined, current studies have limitations. ChIP-seq can identify TF binding sites but requires high-quality antibodies and can only interrogate one TF at a time. TF binding sites are typically marked by increased chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thurman et al., 2012</xref>). However, existing datasets measuring chromatin accessibility are limited to whole retina from wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wilken et al., 2015</xref>). Because rods make up 70–80% of all mouse retinal cells and outnumber cones by 35:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeon et al., 1998</xref>), whole retina studies can approximate features of rods but mask differences between rods and cones that contribute to their unique identities. Therefore, the current understanding of photoreceptor gene regulation also remains limited by the lack of cell type-specific information.</p><p>Of special interest is the high positive correlation between accessible chromatin and local regions of low DNA methylation that has been observed in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ziller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mo et al., 2015</xref>). TF binding can result in local regions of low DNA methylation, leading to strong overlaps between regions identified as DNA hypo-methylated and as accessible chromatin. At present, genome-wide, single-base resolution DNA methylation profiles have not been reported for either rods or cones, precluding a large-scale analysis of this phenomenon in either photoreceptor type. Also of interest is the small size of the rod nucleus (~5 μm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Solovei et al., 2009</xref>) and its highly condensed chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kizilyaprak et al., 2010</xref>), which may potentially impact how chromatin accessibility correlates with DNA methylation. In addition, rods are the only known cell type in mice with nuclei that have heterochromatin centers surrounded by peripheral euchromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carter-Dawson and LaVail, 1979</xref>). This inverted organization is thought to facilitate nocturnal vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Solovei et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast, cone nuclei are larger and exhibit the conventional arrangement of central euchromatin and peripheral heterochromatin.</p><p>Here, we explore the epigenomic differences that contribute to rod and cone photoreceptor identity. Unexpectedly, most rod-specific regions of low DNA methylation are not located in accessible chromatin in adult rods. Instead, our evidence suggests that these regions are potential active regulatory sites in fetal neural tissue and, despite loss of active chromatin marks, remain hypo-methylated in adult rods due to the barrier to cytosine methyltransferases posed by chromatin condensation. In addition, we identify rod- and cone-enriched regions of accessible chromatin that may play gene regulatory functions and carry distinct DNA sequence motifs. Integrated analysis of <italic>rd7</italic> rods, together with normal rods and cones, shows that NR2E3 function is necessary for rods to gain their complete ensemble of epigenomic features. We further examine epigenomic patterns in retinal photoreceptors versus brain neurons. Overall, our findings highlight both global and local epigenomic differences between retinal rods and cones that reflect unique aspects of their biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Compared to cones, rods have a larger fraction of hypo-methylated DNA that is discordant with accessible chromatin</title><p>To characterize putative regulatory DNA in adult rod and cone photoreceptors, we purified their nuclei using either affinity purification (INTACT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mo et al., 2015</xref>) or flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We identified a set of 55366 regions in rods and 75650 regions in cones with increased ATAC-seq densities that mark accessible chromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>In both rods and cones, ATAC-seq peaks exhibit low levels of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

However, we were surprised to find substantial differences between rods and cones in the fraction of LMRs that are located within accessible chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). 38% (24830) of cone LMRs overlap with ATAC-seq peaks, a percentage close to previous reports in embryonic stem cells and cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mo et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, only 19% (15984) of rod LMRs overlap with ATAC-seq peaks. In fact, 31% of rod LMRs show no sign of chromatin accessibility (&lt;0.1 ATAC-seq FPKM), whereas this fraction is only 7% for cones. This analysis shows that rods harbor a substantial compartment of demethylated, but inaccessible, DNA that is largely absent in cones.</p><p>To further explore this observation, we applied ATAC-seq to an independent set of retinal samples that did not require nuclear purification. Approximately 70–80% of cells in the WT mouse retina are rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeon et al., 1998</xref>) and, in the absence of NRL, cells fated to become rods are converted <italic>en masse</italic> to S-cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mears et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, the sites of accessible chromatin in unfractionated nuclei from WT and <italic>Nrl KO</italic> retinas would be expected to largely mirror those in rods and cones, respectively. Similar to our results using purified nuclei, a greater fraction of cone LMRs overlap <italic>Nrl KO</italic> ATAC-seq peaks (49%; 31952) compared to rod LMRs that overlap WT ATAC-seq peaks (26%; 22590) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rod-specific hypo-methylated regions are putative active regulatory regions in fetal neural tissue</title><p>A previous study demonstrated that a subset of active enhancers in embryonic tissue have low levels of DNA methylation in adult tissues in the absence of ongoing enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hon et al., 2013</xref>). Referred to as vestigial enhancers, these hypo-methylated regions are not enriched for active histone marks and DNaseI hypersensitivity in adult cells. When we examine the densities of sub-nucleosomal-length ATAC-seq reads, a subset of reads that may better capture sites of TF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2014</xref>), we observe a bimodal distribution of rod ATAC-seq signals at LMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), with the lower peak at nearly zero signal. This distribution is significantly different than that of cone ATAC-seq signals at LMRs (bootstrap Kolmogorov-Smirnov p&lt;2.2 x 10<sup>–16</sup>) and potentially reflects a greater number of vestigial enhancers in rod, compared to cone, LMRs. If this hypothesis were correct, we would expect these regions to show differential methylation between rods and cones, with rods retaining low levels of DNA methylation and cones gaining methylation.

In this assay, candidate <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (CREs) from retina, brain, heart, and liver were joined to a minimal promoter and a barcoded transcription unit. Enhancer activity was tested in three independent experiments by introducing the CRE library (~45,000 barcodes covering &gt;3000 CREs) into neonatal mouse retina, composed of primarily rods, followed by quantification of barcode abundances in the resulting RNA population. Using the number of replicates in which RNA was detected to discretize the expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), we find that gkm-SVM trained on WT retina ATAC-seq is a strong predictor of expression level. Among the 12858 constructs with RNA detected in at least one replicate, the Pearson correlation between the gkm-SVM WT retina ATAC-seq score and the average retinal CRE expression level is 0.427 (p&lt;10<sup>–320</sup>). Relative to all candidate CREs, those that score in the top 10% of gkm-SVM scores are 4-fold enriched for high-level expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Non-CG methylation--referred to as mCH (where H=A, C, or T)--is a defining feature of brain neurons but is rare outside of neurons and pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lister et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schultz et al., 2015</xref>). As retinal rods and cones are specialized sensory neurons, we asked whether they also have a high level of mCH. Compared to cerebral cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mo et al., 2015</xref>), rods and cones have similar levels of mCG but up to 29- and 7-fold lower levels of mCH, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>). However, rods and cones have higher mCH levels compared to most other non-brain tissue types (&lt;0.05% mCH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schultz et al., 2015</xref>). WT rods have lower mCH (0.11–0.13%) compared to cones (0.42–0.45%), whereas <italic>rd7</italic> rods show an intermediate mCH level (0.21–0.25%). Because NR2E3 is expressed after terminal mitoses in rods, our data also suggests that mCH accumulates post-mitotically in photoreceptors, as it does in the brain.</p><p>To further explore similarities and differences between retinal photoreceptors and cortical neurons, we quantified the epigenomic distance between samples by calculating the genome-wide Pearson correlation of DNA methylation at CG sites between all pairwise sample combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Hierarchical clustering shows that retinal photoreceptors are tightly clustered, whereas cortical neurons cluster separately. In addition, cortical neurons show greater epigenomic distance between neuron subtypes compared to the rod-cone distance. A similar pattern is observed when epigenomic distance is calculated using chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Based on their DNA methylation patterns, the fetal cortex clusters more closely to mature retinal photoreceptors than to mature cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). This clustering organization exists despite the anatomical difference between the cerebral cortex and retina and the development of many fetal cortical cells into mature cortical neurons. One interpretation of this clustering pattern is that cortical neurons may acquire more extensive cell type-specific modifications than photoreceptors during their developmental maturation. We therefore defined DMRs across all retinal and cortical samples and found twice as many regions that showed hypo-methylation only in retinal photoreceptors (63384) compared to those that showed hypo-methylation only in cortical neurons (31483; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Also consistent with our interpretation, a larger proportion of retinal hypo-DMRs, compared to cortical hypo-DMRs, display low-to-moderate levels of DNA methylation in fetal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>A lower concordance between accessible chromatin and DNA methylation is correlated with increased chromatin condensation</title><p>In comparing rod and cone landscapes of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility, we have uncovered several unusual features of rod photoreceptors. First, rods have relatively fewer regions of high chromatin accessibility, and on average, rod-enriched accessible chromatin sites are located closer to promoters. Second, rods have more un-methylated and low-methylated regions compared to cones. Third, compared with cone hypo-DMRs, rod hypo-DMRs are located at greater distances from the TSS and show seven-fold lower overlap with ATAC-seq peaks. Furthermore, rod hypo-DMRs are enriched for regions that are both hypo-methylated and marked by active histone modifications in fetal neural tissue. These findings suggest that many hypo-methylated regions in rods may mark previously active fetal enhancers that have retained their hypo-methylation despite loss of enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Such regions have previously been described as vestigial enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hon et al., 2013</xref>), but the factors that contribute to continuing hypo-methylation and to variation in the number of vestigial enhancers across different cell types remained unclear.</p><p>Mammalian cells show a spectrum of nuclear size, and rod nuclei fall near one extreme of this spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Solovei et al., 2009</xref>). Mouse rod nuclei are exceptionally small, and increased chromatin condensation in rods could potentially pose a barrier to DNA methylation by limiting the accessibility of DNA methyltransferases. In support of this hypothesis, we find that <italic>rd7</italic> rods, a hybrid rod/cone cell with slightly increased nuclear size and lower levels of chromatin condensation compared to rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corbo and Cepko, 2005</xref>), show higher levels of DNA methylation at putative rod vestigial enhancers. <italic>rd7</italic> rods also show intermediate levels of mCH relative to normal rods and cones. A previous study showed that dense heterochromatin regions surrounding immunoglobulins or olfactory receptor clusters in brain neurons coincide with regions of low mCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lister et al., 2013</xref>), consistent with the idea that the highly condensed chromatin in rods could be a global limiting factor to mCH accumulation. Taken together, our results suggest that high chromatin compaction could provide a unifying explanation of some of the unique epigenomic features of rod photoreceptors. These observations may be relevant to other cell types with different nuclear sizes and extents of chromatin condensation. For example, cells in the oligodendrocyte lineage undergo chromatin compaction as they progress from progenitors to mature myelinating oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shen et al., 2005</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11613.027</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Epigenomic model of rod and cone photoreceptor development.</title><p>Enhancers that are active only in progenitor cells (termed 'fetal-only', as the fetal brain was used as a rich source of generic neural progenitors) have low levels of DNA methylation and are enriched for H3K27ac and H3K4me1 histone modifications.

In contrast, in mature rods, fetal-only enhancers lose H3K27ac and H3K4me1 but the DNA remains unmethylated, potentially due to the barrier to cytosine methyltransferases posed by their high level of chromatin condensation. In both rods and cones, expressed genes, including rod- and cone-specific photoreceptor genes, have promoters marked by low DNA methylation, high chromatin accessibility, and enrichment for H3K27ac and H3K4me3.

In this landscape, a ball rolls down a succession of narrowing valleys. The ball represents a differentiating cell traveling along a trajectory that leads to a progressively restricted fate. Our finding that rods show fewer accessible chromatin regions than cones suggests that, at the epigenomic level, a rod could represent a more developmentally restricted cell type than a cone. This idea is consistent with current models of photoreceptor genesis, which propose that NRL, perhaps in combination with NR2E3, is necessary to direct photoreceptor precursors to turn off the default S-cone fate and differentiate along the rod lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Swaroop et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We find that perturbing normal rod development by inactivating NR2E3 converts the rod epigenome to a state that is intermediate between that of rods and cones. <italic>rd7</italic> rods fail to attain WT rod levels of chromatin accessibility and DNA hypo-methylation at rod-specific regions, and they exhibit increased accessibility and hypo-methylation at multiple cone-specific regions.

Nucleosomes for native ChIP-seq were prepared by digesting 1–2 million nuclei with 0.025 units/µl micrococcal nuclease (LS004798, Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) at 37°C for 15 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Library preparation and sequencing</title><p>Libraries for RNA-seq, MethylC-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq were prepared as previously described, with slight modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lister et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mo et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, total RNA was converted to cDNA and amplified (Ovation RNA-seq System V2, #7102, NuGEN Technologies Inc., San Carlos, CA). After adding a spike-in of ERCC RNA (4456740, Life Technologies), amplified cDNA was fragmented, end-repaired, linker-adapted, and sequenced for 50 cycles on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). MethylC-seq libraries were PCR amplified with KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix (KK2802, Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 up to 101 cycles. Histone ChIP-seq was performed by scaling down the HT ChIP-seq protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garber et al., 2012</xref>). Each ChIP-seq reaction used chromatin prepared from 0.5–1 million nuclei, 25 µl Protein G Dynabeads (10004D, Life Technologies), and 1 µg of the following antibodies: rabbit anti-H3K27me3 (07–449, Millipore, Billerica, MA), rabbit anti-H3K27ac (ab4729, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit anti-H3K4me3 (ab8580, Abcam), and rabbit anti-H3K4me1 (ab8895, Abcam). Input and ChIP-enriched DNA was end-repaired, linker-adapted, amplified, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 for 50 cycles.

The homogenate was brought up to 5–6 ml with homogenization buffer and pelleted at 400 g for 10 min at 4°C. After rinsing the pellet once with 1 ml of homogenization buffer, the pellet was incubated with 50 µl of homogenization buffer on ice for 10 min with gentle pipetting to resuspend the nuclei. After quantifying the nuclei concentration using a hemocytometer, approximately 50,000 nuclei (up to 2.5 µl of the concentrated suspension) were used in a 50 µl Tn5 transposition reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>General</title><p>Basic data processing used BEDTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) and custom scripts.

This approach used DSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2014</xref>), a beta-binomial distribution approach that incorporates replicate information in the modeling. DMSs were filtered with false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;0.01.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The work provides an excellent dataset for those in the field, and beyond, as well as provides an example for others who wish to carry out a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the chromatin of a specific cell type. The data also provide a more in depth view of photoreceptor biology, including the interesting findings concerning the differences between rods and cones, with implications regarding the evolution and function of photoreceptors.</p><p>However, I am sorry to say that the paper was not judged as reaching a novel enough conclusion for <italic>eLife</italic>. The findings regarding rods and cones were not judged significant enough by two of the reviewers. Due to the negative opinion on this point, I did consult another person who is knowledgeable in the field of retinal biology, to see if I could find additional support. Though this individual was not able to perform a full review, he did look it over for the overall conclusions, and again, the opinion was essentially the same. However, the work is beautiful and for a fan of photoreceptors, very interesting.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> This manuscript details the epigenetic landscape and correlative features of separated retinal rod and cone cells, as distinguished from studies of the whole retina. This appears to be the first study of this kind. The authors perform comprehensive epigenomic profiling separately integrating ATAC-seq, DNA methylation, RNA-seq and histone modifications. A main result is the unusual pattern specific for rods of unmethylated reigons in closed chromatin and without enhancer activity, but with enhancer activity at a prior stage (fetal). This idea is not entirely novel as it has previously been called vestigial enhancers. The computational analyses are standard except for the use of a new Motif tool (MotifSpec) which is to be described elsewhere (though the advantage of the tool relative to what is available is unknown).</p><p>The paper is well written and the findings appear solid with conventional computational correlations. The major issue for this reviewer is the cursory attention to function. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> provides the only functional data which shows that ATAC-seq regions often provide enhancer activity. The extent of enhancer analysis is not up to what can be done to go beyond mere description. In weighing strengths and weaknesses for <italic>eLife</italic> publication here one has to balance the overall quality of the descriptive data with the relative lack of really new insights into epigenetics and function. Frankly I am on the fence as to whether this manuscript meets criteria for <italic>eLife</italic> or its more suitable for a genomics journal. The datasets will be useful to workers in the field but probably not more widely.</p><p>[Minor comments not shown.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This research article by Mo et al. continues exploration of cell type-specific epigenomic landscapes, building on their own recently published work in Neuron (NeuroResource: Epigenomic Signatures of Neuronal Diversity in the Mammalian Brain; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2015.05.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2015.05.018</ext-link>).</p><p>As shown in that earlier publication, combined analysis of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility is an effective way to characterize cell type-specific regulatory elements. The authors apply this strategy by combining MethylC-Seq and ATAC-Seq analysis to nuclei isolated by FACS sorting or affinity purification (INTACT, a technique they adapted to mammalian cells in their Neuron paper). Unlike that earlier work, this new paper does not introduce a novel, widely applicable technical approach such as INTACT.</p><p>The biological observation that the report centers on is that chromatin in rods has hypomethylated regions that correspond to regulatory loci playing important roles in the fetal neuronal development. The authors argue convincingly that these regions are likely shielded from methylation due to the (well-characterized) unusually compact chromatin structure in rod cells. The authors also use comparisons between wildtype and <italic>Nr2e3 KO (rd7</italic>) rods and between <italic>rd7</italic> and <italic>Nrl KO</italic> (with massive shift to cones) retinas to argue that <italic>rd7</italic> rods acquire intermediate epigenetic landscapes between rods and cones.</p><p>This is a generally solid descriptive paper which does not happen to yield a new biological insight. It thus appears to fall short of <italic>eLife</italic>'s stated goal of publishing highly significant work. If the editors feel this work belongs in <italic>eLife</italic>, perhaps it might be a better fit to the Tools and resources section. (Cf. a recent publication in that section: &quot;Cell type-specific transcriptomics of hypothalamic energy-sensing neuron responses to weight-loss&quot;; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e09800">http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e09800</ext-link>).</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>H3K27me3 ChIP-Seq: one of the replicates has very low coverage (3.5M deduplicated aligned reads vs. 16.5M in the other experiment; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This is likely indicative of a technical failure. At the very least, combining data from these two replicates should be explained; better, the replicate should be redone or removed.</p><p>Electroporation analysis of regulatory regions is not particularly convincing. Shouldn't rod- or cone-specific expression lead to a large number of cells with signal (as in Nr2e3), regardless of signal strength? So it is unclear why native GFP was preferred to AP. The scoring is also confusing. Based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, it is unclear why signal from Pde6h(-4.6kb) fragment is called &quot;moderate&quot; while <italic>Pde6h</italic>(-0.8kb) is called &quot;weak&quot; (in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Even if we fully accept the authors' interpretation, there is no particular reason to think that the regions tested by electroporation are representative of all regions used for motif analysis. It might make more sense to first perform the motif finding, and then use the regions with most characteristic motifs to test experimentally.</p><p>Authors note that the INTACT analysis was less cell specific in the retina, because after isolation, nuclei typically formed aggregates (possibly with nuclei from cells of different types), rather than stay as singlets. Since cell specificity of the analysis is a major point, it would be important to understand how much of a distortion is introduced by this aggregation. What is the distribution of nuclei per the singlet, doublet, etc. bins? How often doublets and higher order aggregates contain both rod and cone nuclei (perhaps even rough analysis based on the nuclear appearance might suffice)?</p><p>[Minor comments not shown.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> This is a very novel study which, for the first time, presents a comprehensive analysis of both global as well as specific/local epigenomic states in rods and cones. Although the work is a bit less mechanistic than would be desired, the vast array of data and comprehensive, broad spanning nature of the work makes this a strong manuscript, suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The focus on NR2E3 loss is quite interesting and impactful; it would have been great if they could identify additional combinations of genes which (when lost/modified) promote the cone-like state to a greater extent/achieve more complete conversion. While this (the rod/cone biology component) is slightly removed from my field of expertise, based on the work presented and the conclusions derived, I think this paper should be accepted, pending minor revisions.</p><p>This is without question the most comprehensive analysis of the epigenomic features of rods and cones, and the first to generate such data in cones, which are far less abundant than rods in the retina. The authors have the difficult task of bringing forward the key, focused points (i.e. the studies on NR2E3) while showing massive amounts of data that were needed to inform more specific mechanisms.</p><p>Are there additional mechanistic insights that have been gained since submission of the manuscript with respect to the loss of NR2E3? Or cooperating genes which would further promote a cone-like state?</p><p>Technical comments:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>A) Could the authors extend this to show not only a gene expressed by both but other genes expressed in either rods or cones? The general accessibility patterns would be valuable to see as comparison here.</p><p>B) Are there ways to indicate the statistical significance on the figure for B and C? The curves appear very close, and hence, some measurement of significance here would be helpful, if possible. Perhaps a bar graph for site distance next to these graphs?</p><p>C) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, is there anything you can generalize about these specific sites in this figure to substantiate the finding? Or show tracks next to the bar graph to indicate what this looks like on key genes?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>Could the authors simplify <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>? Reduce the # tracks? The key point is a bit lost in the number of tracks shown here. Best to separate between this figure and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>To complement this, are there quantitative summaries that could be displayed in the figure, i.e.% GFP expression for the key comparisons? Also, to save space/redundancy, perhaps the authors could show just 2 of the 'near cone genes' and place the rest of these in supplemental? I think the point is well illustrated and quite clear.</p><p>If possible, as part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, a</xref> model/summary figure would improve the paper and allow more citations via highlighting the model. I think this would be an important addition.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11613.056</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We are gratified by the generally positive comments from the three reviewers, and we are therefore surprised that the decision was not more favorable. This is the first report of a genome-wide comparison between and integrated analysis of the methylomes and the accessible chromatin landscapes in rods and cones. It is also only the second report of such a comparison between purified neuronal cell types, the first report being our Neuron paper earlier this year describing that comparison for subsets of cortical neurons. Additionally, the present manuscript pushes the purification, methylome sequencing, and chromatin accessibility technologies to a new level by targeting a cell type (cones) that is rarer than any cell type to which these methods have yet been applied. The high quality datasets that we have generated, the extensive computational analyses that we have performed, the whole genome nature of the insights derived from those analyses, and the surprising differences that we have uncovered between rod and cone epigenomes, all set the present study apart from everything else in the scientific literature on sensory receptor cells.</p><p>Given the central importance of rods and cones in vision research and in clinical ophthalmology, as well as their central place in the larger field of sensory neuroscience, we predict that this work will be of broad and enduring interest. The editor's letter states &quot;The work is beautiful and for a fan of photoreceptors, very interesting.&quot; We agree, and we would add that the study of vertebrate photoreceptors is not a niche field. A recent PubMed search shows &gt;7000 papers with the search term 'cone photoreceptor' and &gt;10,000 papers with the search term 'rod photoreceptor'.</p><p>Reviewer #2 suggested that this manuscript might be a better fit as a Tools and Resources article instead of a regular article. We think that this is an excellent suggestion, since the &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; paragraph of the eLife &quot;Information for Authors&quot; section states: &quot;For example, we welcome the submission of.. . genomic or other datasets...&quot; If you agree that this is a reasonable path forward, we would be happy to submit a revised version that addresses the various technical points raised by the reviewers and that adjusts the text to the Tools and Resources venue.</p><p>Responses to the individual reviews follow.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The paper is well written and the findings appear solid with conventional computational correlations. The major issue for this reviewer is the cursory attention to function. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> provides the only functional data which shows that ATAC-seq regions often provide enhancer activity. The extent of enhancer analysis is not up to what can be done to go beyond mere description. In weighing strengths and weaknesses for eLife publication here one has to balance the overall quality of the descriptive data with the relative lack of really new insights into epigenetics and function. Frankly I am on the fence as to whether this manuscript meets criteria for eLife or its more suitable for a genomics journal. The datasets will be useful to workers in the field but probably not more widely.</p><p>As described below, the revised manuscript includes additional analysis validating the functional role of motifs predicted by our computational analysis (gkm-SVM). We believe this new analysis, taking advantage of a large-scale dataset published while our paper was under review, greatly bolsters the functional relevance of our results and should address the reviewer’s concern.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>[…] This is a generally solid descriptive paper which does not happen to yield a new biological insight. It thus appears to fall short of eLife's stated goal of publishing highly significant work. If the editors feel this work belongs in eLife, perhaps it might be a better fit to the Tools and resources section. (Cf. a recent publication in that section: &quot;Cell type-specific transcriptomics of hypothalamic energy-sensing neuron responses to weight-loss&quot;; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e09800">http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e09800</ext-link>).</italic> We respectfully disagree with the reviewer’s characterization of our study. We integrate an enormous amount of new epigenomic and transcriptomic data with extensive quantitative analyses that offer the first high-resolution (e.g., single base-pair DNA methylation data), genome-wide, and cell type-specific window into the organization of any mammalian sensory neuron. Our analysis yields multiple new biological insights. For example:</p><p>1) Despite the close developmental and functional relationship between retinal rods and cones, we show that there is a <italic>profound difference in the organization of their DNA methylation landscapes</italic>. In particular, rod photoreceptors, but not cones, show a substantial discrepancy between regions of low DNA methylation and of accessible chromatin. This is the first observation of such a widespread dissociation between chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation in a mammalian cell type.</p><p>2) Sophisticated computational approaches are used to identify DNA sequence features of accessible chromatin in rods and cones, including the discovery of a novel motif in rod-specific accessible chromatin.</p><p>3) In the revised manuscript, we show that scores obtained from training a machine learning algorithm on retinal accessible chromatin peaks are strongly predictive of functional enhancer activity.</p><p>4) Extending beyond the retina, we find that, despite the anatomical difference, DNA methylation patterns in the fetal cerebral cortex are more similar to mature retinal photoreceptors than to mature cortical neurons.</p><p><italic>Specific comments: H3K27me3 ChIP-Seq: one of the replicates has very low coverage (3.5M deduplicated aligned reads vs. 16.5M in the other experiment; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This is likely indicative of a technical failure. At the very least, combining data from these two replicates should be explained; better, the replicate should be redone or removed.</italic> </p><p>We agree that 3.5M reads are low, but our assessment of this data shows extremely good agreement with the dataset that has 16.5M reads. We have now calculated the correlation of ChIP-seq signals between replicate pairs and find high correlations (Pearson r = 0.96 – 1.0) between all pairs, including H3K27me3. For this assessment, we evaluated the ChIP-seq signals over the union of peaks called in each individual replicate (for example, input-subtracted H3K27me3 replicate 1 and replicate 2 signals over the union of their SICER peaks; r = 0.97). Therefore, we believe that combining data from the two replicates is justified. We have added the correlations to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>Electroporation analysis of regulatory regions is not particularly convincing. Shouldn't rod- or cone-specific expression lead to a large number of cells with signal (as in Nr2e3), regardless of signal strength? So it is unclear why native GFP was preferred to AP. The scoring is also confusing. Based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, it is unclear why signal from Pde6h(-4.6kb) fragment is called &quot;moderate&quot; while Pde6h(-0.8kb) is called &quot;weak&quot; (in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Even if we fully accept the authors' interpretation, there is no particular reason to think that the regions tested by electroporation are representative of all regions used for motif analysis. It might make more sense to first perform the motif finding, and then use the regions with most characteristic motifs to test experimentally.</p><p>In this experiment, we consistently found that weak regulatory sites gave fewer cells with detectable native GFP signal. This observation is most likely due to the variation in the number of plasmids taken up by each cell. We hypothesize that, for plasmids containing a weak enhancer, only those few cells that have taken up a large number of plasmids are detectably GFP+. On the other hand, strong enhancers give an appreciable GFP signal in many cells, even those that have taken up a small number of plasmids. Supporting this hypothesis, we typically observe a wide range of signal intensities in both the GFP and TdT channels, even when comparing adjacent cells in the same retina.</p><p>Either GFP or AP staining could have been used. We chose to use GFP because it offered greater precision in quantifying the number of labeled cells than AP staining. Furthermore, native GFP and TdT signals are linearly related to protein levels, whereas immunostaining or an enzymatic reporter would introduce a non-linearity. We have now simplified the categories into “strong,” “weak,” and “none.” We have further quantified the % of electroporated (TdT+) cells that are GFP+ for each construct and added it to the figure and to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 6</xref>.</p><p><italic>Authors note that the INTACT analysis was less cell specific in the retina, because after isolation, nuclei typically formed aggregates (possibly with nuclei from cells of different types), rather than stay as singlets. Since cell specificity of the analysis is a major point, it would be important to understand how much of a distortion is introduced by this aggregation. What is the distribution of nuclei per the singlet, doublet, etc. bins? How often doublets and higher order aggregates contain both rod and cone nuclei (perhaps even rough analysis based on the nuclear appearance might suffice)?</italic> </p><p>We would first like to clarify that GFP+ nuclei from a Cre-recombined R26-CAG-LSL-Sun1-sfGFP-myc mouse can either be isolated by using affinity purification (as described in Mo et al., 2015) or by using FACS. Because the GFP tag is tethered to the nuclear membrane, the fluorescence remains associated with the nuclei throughout the FACS procedure. We isolated cone nuclei using FACS because FACS can differentiate between singlets and higher-order aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1-—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Therefore, our purified cone nuclei are free of nuclear aggregates.</p><p>We note that there is a practical advantage of affinity purification over FACS. In our experience, affinity-purified nuclei are easier to manipulate than FACS-sorted nuclei for subsequent ATAC-seq reactions.</p><p>Our FACS profile of the distribution of singlet and higher-order nuclei after the initial homogenization step (performed identically for both the FACS- and INTACT-purified nuclei, with the latter samples further processed through a 20 μm filter; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) shows that the large majority of nuclei are singlets. Moreover, most of the doublets and higher-order aggregates are likely to contain only rods because the majority of the retina is composed of rods. Taken together, this implies that affinity purification of rods will be highly specific. We have now calculated and added to the text that, based on fluorescence microscopy of purified nuclei (&gt;400 nuclei counted per experiment), INTACT purification of rod photoreceptors was 97.5% specific (96.7 – 98.2%; n = 5). Essentially 100% of the non-rod nuclei arose from higher-order aggregates, rather than from contaminating singlets.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>This is a very novel study which, for the first time, presents a comprehensive analysis of both global as well as specific/local epigenomic states in rods and cones. Although the work is a bit less mechanistic than would be desired, the vast array of data and comprehensive, broad spanning nature of the work makes this a strong manuscript, suitable for publication in eLife. The focus on NR2E3 loss is quite interesting and impactful; it would have been great if they could identify additional combinations of genes which (when lost/modified) promote the cone-like state to a greater extent/achieve more complete conversion. While this (the rod/cone biology component) is slightly removed from my field of expertise, based on the work presented and the conclusions derived, I think this paper should be accepted, pending minor revisions.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this appreciation of our study’s novelty and impact. Indeed, we went to great lengths to comprehensively analyze both global and local genomic regulatory features of the rod and cone datasets we generated, including by applying advanced computational tools such as gkm-SVM.</p><p><italic>This is without question the most comprehensive analysis of the epigenomic features of rods and cones, and the first to generate such data in cones, which are far less abundant than rods in the retina. The authors have the difficult task of bringing forward the key, focused points (i.e. the studies on NR2E3) while showing massive amounts of data that were needed to inform more specific mechanisms.</italic> </p><p> <italic>Are there additional mechanistic insights that have been gained since submission of the manuscript with respect to the loss of NR2E3? Or cooperating genes which would further promote a cone-like state?</italic> </p><p>To add additional mechanistic information into the remodeling process, we extended our <italic>k</italic>-mer analysis to identify motifs that could distinguish <italic>rd7</italic>-specific ATAC-seq peaks from random regions, as well as shared <italic>rd7</italic> and WT retina ATAC-seq peaks from random regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>). We find that the sets of enriched sequences are similar between the two comparisons, as well as to our previous comparisons using WT and <italic>Nrl KO</italic> retina, including large SVM weights for <italic>k</italic>-mers matching the CRX binding site (GATTA). In contrast, the sets of depleted sequences are substantially different (albeit, with lower weights).</p><p><italic>Technical comments:</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>A) Could the authors extend this to show not only a gene expressed by both but other genes expressed in either rods or cones? The general accessibility patterns would be valuable to see as comparison here.</italic> </p><p>We agree that visual examples of different types of genes are helpful. However, our main goal for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> is to present an example of our various types of sequencing datasets. In later figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, and their supplemental figures), we show genes with different expression patterns.</p><p><italic>B) Are there ways to indicate the statistical significance on the figure for B and C? The curves appear very close, and hence, some measurement of significance here would be helpful, if possible. Perhaps a bar graph for site distance next to these graphs?</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity in this figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows that rods and cones both have lower mean DNA methylation levels at their respective ATAC-seq peaks. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows that rods and cones both have higher ATAC-seq levels at their respective un- and low-methylated regions. Rather than comparing the green and purple curves to each other, these curves should be compared to the gray curves that depict CG methylation (1B) and ATAC-seq signal (1C) at randomly selected genomic regions (please note that what might appear as a single gray curve is actually multiple curves from random sampling of matched genomic regions). There is a striking difference between either the green or purple curve and the gray curves. Therefore, we believe that showing the magnitude of effect is more helpful than the statistical significance, given that the significance would be predominantly driven by the large size of the datasets.</p><p>C) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, is there anything you can generalize about these specific sites in this figure to substantiate the finding? Or show tracks next to the bar graph to indicate what this looks like on key genes?</p><p>We present our in-depth integration of chromatin accessibility with DNA methylation using hypo-DMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), rather than using UMRs and LMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), because there is a greater discrepancy between hypo-DMRs and ATAC-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) than between UMRs/LMRs and ATAC-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Because rod hypo-DMRs are largely a subset of rod UMRs and LMRs (74% of rod hypo-DMRs are included in the set of rod UMRs+LMRs), this discrepancy suggests that vestigial enhancer locations are uniquely hypo-methylated in rods. We expect that analysis using UMRs and LMRs would yield similar, but less dramatic, results.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>Could the authors simplify <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>? Reduce the # tracks? The key point is a bit lost in the number of tracks shown here.
