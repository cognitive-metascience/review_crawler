The C-termini of all isoforms localize to the active zone. Specific loss of the ~9000 amino acid long isoform results in vesicle clustering defects and increased synaptic depression.

When the neuron on one side of a synapse becomes active, calcium ions flood into the cell. This causes the neuron to release signals called neurotransmitters, which activate the cell on the other side of the synapse. Neurons store their neurotransmitter molecules inside packages called vesicles, and keep them clustered close to their release site, a region called the active zone. The active zone contains a number of different proteins. Some of these hold vesicles in position. Others respond to calcium entry by fusing vesicles with the cell membrane.</p><p>The identity of many of the proteins within the active zone remains unknown, especially those responsible for keeping vesicles clustered nearby. Xuan, Manning et al. therefore introduced mutations at random into the genome of the roundworm <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and searched for mutant worms with altered patterns of vesicles. Worms with mutations in a previously unknown gene, which they named <italic>clarinet</italic>, showed abnormal distribution of vesicles within the presynaptic compartment. They also released fewer vesicles compared to non-mutant worms.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that the <italic>clarinet</italic> gene encodes three different proteins with varying sizes, all found at the active zone. Using microscopy and electrode recordings, as well as a genetic technique called CRISPR, Xuan, Manning et al. showed that the three forms of clarinet have different roles. The shorter ones contribute to the development of synapses. They help ensure that the active zone forms correctly and that neurons have an appropriate number of synaptic connections. The longest form of clarinet is responsible for clustering vesicles, which allows cells to continue releasing vesicles during bursts of repeated neuronal firing.</p><p>Problems with synapses contribute to many brain disorders, including autism and intellectual disability. Xuan, Manning et al. hope that an increased understanding of how synapses form, and how they work, will provide insights into these and other conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>active zone</kwd><kwd>presynaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle</kwd><kwd>synaptogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS076558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xuan</surname><given-names>Zhao</given-names></name><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Jessica</given-names></name><name><surname>Colón-Ramos</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Kang</given-names></name><name><surname>Kurshan</surname><given-names>Peri T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01NS048392</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Kang</given-names></name><name><surname>Kurshan</surname><given-names>Peri T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF IOS 1353845</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xuan</surname><given-names>Zhao</given-names></name><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Jessica</given-names></name><name><surname>Colón-Ramos</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Clarinet, a novel <italic>C. elegans</italic> active zone protein with homology to vertebrate Piccolo and Rim, uses its different isoforms for diverse functions, including synaptic vesicle clustering, vesicle release and synaptogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The coordinated and precise release of synaptic vesicles from presynaptic compartments underlies neuronal communication and brain function. This is achieved through the concerted action of conserved proteins that make up the cytomatrix at the active zone, a protein dense region within the presynaptic bouton that is surrounded by synaptic vesicles. Active zone proteins regulate neurotransmission by recruiting synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane, positioning calcium channels adjacent to the site of exocytosis, and priming synaptic vesicles for calcium-dependent release. In vertebrates, the main active zone proteins that coordinate synaptic vesicle release are Liprin-α, RIM, RIM-BP, Elks and Munc-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Südhof, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Two additional proteins, Bassoon and Piccolo, serve to cluster synaptic vesicles near the active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cases-Langhoff et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Langnaese et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mukherjee et al., 2010</xref>). Although the core components of the active zone are conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates, Bassoon and Piccolo have long been considered exclusive to vertebrates. While the N-terminus of Drosophila Bruchpilot (BRP) contains significant sequence homology to vertebrate ELKS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wagh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kittel et al., 2006</xref>), like Bassoon and Piccolo it also has a large C-terminal domain rich in coiled-coil structures that is thought to function in tethering synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matkovic et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fife, a protein that contains ZnF, PDZ and C2 domains, was discovered based on sequence homology to the PDZ domain of vertebrate Piccolo, and shown to be an active zone protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruckner et al., 2012</xref>). Fife binds to and functionally interacts with Rim to dock synaptic vesicles and increase probability of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruckner et al., 2017</xref>). No clear homologs of Piccolo, Bassoon, Fife, or of the coiled-coil domain of BRP have been identified for <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>We performed forward genetic screens in <italic>C. elegans</italic> for proteins required for synaptic vesicle clustering, and identified clarinet (<italic>cla-1</italic>). CLA-1 is required for normal synapse number and <italic>cla-1</italic> null mutants exhibit reduced spontaneous synaptic vesicle release. <italic>Cla-1</italic> mutants have a smaller dense projection and display defects in the clustering of the active zone protein SYD-2/Liprin-α. They exhibit a dramatic reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles contacting the dense projection, and increased synaptic depression. The <italic>cla-1</italic> gene encodes three main isoforms (CLA-1L, CLA-1M and CLA-1S) containing PDZ and C2 domains with sequence homology to vertebrate Piccolo and RIM. While all three isoforms share a C-terminal region that localizes to the active zone, their genetic requirement in synapse function and development differ: the N-terminus of CLA-1L is specifically required for synaptic vesicle clustering and proper synaptic function during repeated stimulations, whereas the shorter isoforms or C-terminus are required for active zone assembly and proper synapse number. Together our findings indicate that <italic>cla-1</italic> encodes novel active zone proteins that are required for proper synapse development, active zone structure and synaptic vesicle clustering, and thus play a role in synaptic function during prolonged activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CLA-1 is required in the NSM neuron for synaptic vesicle clustering</title><p>We performed unbiased forward genetic screens to identify molecules required for the localization of synaptic vesicle proteins in the serotonergic NSM neuron of the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). From this screen, we identified allele <italic>ola104</italic>, which displayed a diffuse distribution of the synaptic vesicle protein VMAT/CAT-1 as compared to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). In <italic>ola104</italic> mutants, reduced intensity of synaptic puncta was accompanied by an increase in the extrasynaptic signal, suggestive of a defect in synaptic vesicle clustering at the synapse. Using single-nucleotide polymorphism mapping, we identified <italic>ola104</italic> as a missense mutation in <italic>cla-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Based on the length of the proteins, we classified them into three categories: CLA-1L (long) including CLA-1a and b; CLA-1M (medium) including CLA-1c and d; CLA-1S (short) including CLA-1e and f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Distinct alleles affect different isoforms. <italic>cla-1(ok560)</italic> results in a deletion of the promoter and part of the coding region of cla-1L, and will be referred to henceforth as <italic>cla-1(L). cla-1(wy1048)</italic>, an allele we generated using CRISPR, eliminates most of cla-1S and M, including the PDZ and C2 domains. Because these domains are shared by all isoforms, this deletion is likely a null and the allele will henceforth be referred to as <italic>cla-1(S/M/L)</italic>. Importantly, in <italic>cla-1(L)</italic> deletion mutants, the shorter isoforms are still expressed, as evidenced by RT-PCR to the C-terminal PDZ domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Synaptic vesicle clustering was examined in five alleles affecting different isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and all alleles examined showed defects in synaptic vesicle clustering in NSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Since the long-isoform-specific allele <italic>cla-1(L)</italic> exhibited as dramatic a defect as the null allele, we hypothesize that CLA-1L may thus be specifically required for proper clustering of vesicles at the synapse.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29276.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>cla-1</italic> mutants display disrupted synaptic vesicle clustering in NSM neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the nematode head and the NSM neuron (in red inside blue-boxed region).

CLA-1L is a large (~9000 amino acid) protein, and its N-terminal domain could lie far from its C-terminus. To examine this, we endogenously tagged the C-terminal region of the cla-1 genomic locus, which would label the C-termini of all CLA-1 isoforms, including CLA-1L.

Briefly, fluorescence values for individual neurites (ventral neurite for the NSM and PVD neurons, Zone3 for the AIY neuron, and dorsal neurite for DD GABAergic or cholinergic motor neurons) were obtained through segmented line scans using ImageJ. A sliding window of 2 μm was used to identify all the local fluorescence peak values and trough values for an individual neuron.

To measure penetrance, animals were scored as displaying either ‘punctate’ or ‘diffuse’ phenotypes for synaptic vesicles proteins. Percentage of animals displaying diffuse distribution of synaptic vesicle proteins was calculated for each genotype. For each experiment, at least 30 animals were scored for each genotype and at least five independent experiments were performed.

SEC consists of a hygromycin resistance gene (hygR), a visible marker [sqt-1(d)]) and an inducible Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

In the first method, a CRISPR protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paix et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arribere et al., 2014</xref>) was used to create cla-1 (ola324), in which two loxP sites were inserted into two introns of cla-1L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We used three criteria to ensure that our insertion sites efficiently and specifically target CLA-1L. First, we avoided inserting loxP sites into small introns to prevent any effects on splicing. Second, to ensure that CLA-1M is unaffected after Cre-loxP recombination, the second loxP site was positioned about 4 kb away from the start codon of cla-1M. Third, the sequence flanked by loxP sites is about 16 kb and is close to the start codon of cla-1L. Thus removal of the sequence should result in a CLA-1L null mutation. Cell-specific removal of CLA-1L in NSM was achieved with a plasmid driving the expression of cre cDNA under the NSM-specific <italic>tph-1</italic> promoter fragment as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nelson and Colón-Ramos, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the second method, we modified a CRISPR protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dickinson et al., 2015</xref>) to create cla-1(ola321[gfp:: CAS::cla-1L]), in which CAS consists of a hygromycin resistance gene (hygR) and a visible marker [sqt-1(d)]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Since CAS contains a transcriptional terminator, this strain is a <italic>cla-1</italic>L null allele.

Upon crossing to a strain containing cell-specific FLPase, the endogenous stop site and exogenous 3’UTR are excised, leaving the C-terminal GFP inserted in front of the endogenous 3’UTR. To achieve DA9-specific expression of CLA-1::GFP we used a FLPase driven by the Pmig-13 promoter, which has previously proven to be specific to DA9 within the posterior dorsal cord. However, Pmig-13 seems to express at very low levels in other neurons in this region (enough to generate excision at the FRT sites), as evidenced by the fact that we see CLA-1::GFP puncta outside DA9 driven exogenously expressed CLA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Aldicarb assays</title><p>Animals were assayed for acute exposure to aldicarb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mahoney et al., 2006</xref>).

Animals were considered paralyzed once they no longer moved even when prodded with a platinum wire three times on the head and tail. The ratio of animals moving to the total number of animals on the plate was calculated for each time point.

Ultra thin (40 nm) serial sections were cut using an Ultracut 6 (Leica) and collected on formvar-covered, carbon-coated copper grids (EMS, FCF2010-Cu). Post-staining was performed using 2.5% aqueous uranyl acetate for 4 min, followed by Reynolds lead citrate for 2 min.

A synapse was defined as a set of serial sections containing a dense projection and two flanking sections without dense projections from either side. Synaptic vesicles were identified as spherical, light gray structures with an average diameter of ~30 nm. To control for inherent variability in the size of synaptic terminals, we measured the density of synaptic vesicles in the terminal by dividing the number of synaptic vesicles by the area of the terminal in micrometers. Terminal area was defined as the average cross-sectional area of every profile containing a dense projection plus two flanking sections. A synaptic vesicle was considered docked if it contacted the plasma membrane. Vesicles that were within 1–4 nm of the plasma membrane that exhibited small tethers to the PM were not scored as docked.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Clarinet (CLA-1), a novel active zone protein required for synaptic vesicle clustering and release&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Graeme Davis, (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Martin Mueller (Reviewer #2).</p><p>In this manuscript, Xuan and colleagues provide the first characterization of a novel nematode active zone protein (clarinet or CLA-1) and investigate its presynaptic role. As the authors mention, there is a fair amount of evolutionary divergence across phyla among active zone proteins that play a structural/organizational role. This is in contrast with the highly-conserved core fusion machinery. To date, worm homologs to bassoon and piccolo have not been described. The authors provide a careful and thorough initial characterization of what appears to be a functional homolog of bassoon and piccolo in mammals and BRP in fly. Using some very nice genomic manipulations as well as imaging, electrophysiology, behavior, and electron microscopy to take full advantage of their model system, the authors conclude that CLA-1 resides in the active zone and may help tether and/or organize SVs as part of normal synaptic function. In addition, CLA-1 may contribute to synapse assembly during development.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>There was an extensive online conversation among the reviewers concerning the manuscript. All reviewers agree that there remains a single major issue that needs additional experimental attention (Comment 1). The additional major concerns are mostly explanations that will help clarify or extend the manuscript. Minor concerns that can be addressed at the author's discretion are listed afterward.</p><p>1) A major conclusion of the authors is that CLA-1 is necessary for normal vesicle clustering and release. The EM data underscore the defect in vesicle clustering. However, evoked synaptic transmission following single action potential stimulus is normal. More specifically, the authors need to address how a similar evoked response can be obtained upon single stimulation in <italic>cla-1(S/M/L)</italic> when considering fewer synapses (-30%), a dramatic decrease in the number of vesicles docked to the dense projection and an increase in the number of &quot;stranded&quot; vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>)? Could an increase in release counteract the decrease in vesicle density/synapse number (see below, 7., 8.)?</p><p>Furthermore, <italic>cla-1(S/M/L)</italic> mutants display increased short-term depression and the authors claim that this phenotype is due to a &quot;defect in the number of vesicles that can be readily recruited by depolarization&quot;. There remain other interpretations that could explain these data, including changes in vesicle recruitment, replenishment, and release sensors. Indeed, it seems reasonable that a compensatory increase in release could have adjusted release probability to achieve normal release on the first action potential followed by enhanced depression on subsequent action potentials (see Davis and Muller, 2015 for review of presynaptic compensatory mechanisms).</p><p>At the heart of this issue is whether CLA-1 actually has a function to control synaptic vesicle release, or whether it has a primary function to control synapse number and vesicle clustering, with the release deficit being a secondary effect. Since this is the first annotation of CLA-1 function, and since it is being proposed as homologous to other central regulators of active zone function, this phenotype needs to be explored in greater detail. Indeed, <italic>cla-1</italic> appears to be similar to Bassoon/Piccolo, which have been implicated in vesicle recovery/replenishment without affecting release after single AP stimulation at most synapses. This is in contrast to a number of mutants, including <italic>brp, rim</italic> or <italic>rbp</italic> that are required for normal release levels upon single AP stimulation.</p><p>After considerable discussion, the reviewers suggest two potential avenues that might help resolve this issue, taking into account the unique challenges of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> system for synaptic electrophysiology. One possible approach would be to probe whether <italic>cla-1</italic> is a sensitized genetic background for neurotransmitter release, combining <italic>cla-1</italic> with other gene mutations in key genes involved in synaptic transmission. Ideally, the analysis would be electrophysiology, but if multiple genetic tests were pursued, then behavior could be suitable. This is very standard genetic epistasis in fly and worm. An alternative approach would be to explore the phenotype of enhanced synaptic depression in greater detail. Specifically, could the authors probe recovery from depression and determine if this is altered in <italic>cla-1</italic>? Finally, if the authors have a different approach that would address these issues directly, this would be fine. You may wish to address your response to this in a letter which we would share with the Reviewing Editor and the reviewers for their recommendation.</p><p>2) Subsection “Localization of CLA-1 isoforms at the active zone and their role in synaptic vesicle clustering”, first paragraph, the authors estimate an upper bound for the physical extent of CLA-1L. I guess a true upper bound would be if the protein were fully extended N to C with each peptide bond being 0.54 nm long, giving 9000*0.54 = 4.8 microns. Since it appears that much of the protein is disordered, a very different estimate comes from the statistical size of a random coil given approximately by 0.54*(9000)^0.6 ~ 130 nm (see Flory 1949). I didn't find the purely α helical size estimate that useful since it isn't a true upper limit and doesn't describe much of the actual protein secondary structure. Estimates on the order of 200 nm are particularly interesting since they fit nicely with the 3D dense projection reconstructions in Kittelmann. Based on the amount of fluorescence measured in the CLA-1S::mCh or the GFP::CLA-1L imaging, is it possible to estimate the number of copies present at the synapse? I'm just wondering if there is some stoichiometric relationship between the number of SVs contacting a dense projection and the number of CLA-1 copies present. In a <italic>cla-1</italic> heterozygote, would there be a difference?</p><p>3) The conclusions that the different isoforms fulfill different roles at the synapse would be strengthened if the authors showed expression of the different isoforms in the different mutants (e.g. by RT-PCR), especially that the M and S isoforms are still expressed normally in the <italic>cla-1(L)</italic> mutant.</p><p>4).Authors should use the null allele <italic>cla-1(S/M/L)</italic> for assessing localization of active zone proteins if they want to state that <italic>cla-1</italic> does not affect localization of these proteins at the synapse (subsection “CLA-1 is required in the NSM neuron for synaptic vesicle clustering”, last paragraph).</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> it looks as if terminal branching of the NSM neuron is altered in the mutant, while this is not the case in the images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. Could the authors comment if this could be part of the phenotype, or whether this is simply a consequence of the representative images chosen?</p><p>6) It is not completely clear, especially in panel 6C, how the number of undocked vesicles contacting the DP was quantified.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: It would be very helpful to show example traces of miniature and evoked EPSCs in this figure. Also, could the authors please show absolute evoked amplitudes in addition to the normalized data, as well as example trains? It would be also helpful to graph the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> as a function of time to know the stimulation frequency.</p><p>8) It is interesting to compare these data with <italic>syd-2</italic> mutants. In <italic>syd-2</italic>, both minis and evoked EPSCs are down (by 50-60%) and both the total number of SVs and docked SVs are also down by a similar factor (based on Kittelmann 2013). In <italic>cla-1S/M/L</italic> mutants, minis are down by 50% but evoked EPSCs are normal and there is an increase in the number of docked SVs. This seems to imply different relationships between docked SVs, minis, and evoked in the different mutant backgrounds. Since CLA-1S is strongly decreased in <italic>syd-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), could the more severe phenotype in <italic>syd-2</italic> be closer to a <italic>syd-2;cla-1</italic> double mutant? Did the authors ever look at this double for any genetic interactions? Or is <italic>syd-2</italic> synthetically lethal? This should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29276.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Comments:</p><p>There was an extensive online conversation among the reviewers concerning the manuscript.

It is also required for the recruitment and/or tethering of synaptic vesicles to the dense projection. In <italic>cla-1</italic> null mutants, these structural and morphological defects lead to functional consequences, those being a reduction in mini frequency as well as increased depression upon repeated stimulation. However, the response to a single stimulus is normal, suggesting that there may be either redundancies or compensatory mechanisms that can overcome these structural defects. Indeed, we see an increase in the number of docked vesicles within 100nm of the dense projection in <italic>cla-1</italic> mutants (newly quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting one potential compensatory mechanism.</p><p>The active zone protein UNC-‐10/RIM, which promotes synaptic vesicle release by coupling vesicles to calcium channels, is specifically involved in docking synaptic vesicles at the plasma membrane within 100nm of the dense projection (Weimer et al., 2006). We therefore hypothesized that UNC-‐10/RIM may mediate either a redundant function or a compensatory mechanism responsible for the normal evoked response in <italic>cla-1</italic> mutants, as suggested by the reviewers. To investigate this possibility we recorded evoked responses in <italic>unc-10;cla-1</italic> double mutants. <italic>unc10</italic> single mutants have a pronounced defect in evoked synaptic transmission.</p><p>Strikingly, the <italic>unc-10;cla-1</italic> double mutants showed a greatly enhanced defect in evoked release in response to a single stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Importantly, the number of synapses in <italic>unc-10;cla-1</italic> double mutants is not significantly different from <italic>cla-1</italic> mutants alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>), indicating that this enhancement of the defect in evoked release cannot be attributed to a synthetic effect on synapse number. These results reveal than in the absence of UNC‐10/RIM, there is indeed a functional consequence of the loss of CLA-1 in the response to a single stimulus, consistent with the hypothesis that redundancy or compensatory mechanisms responsible for the lack of an evoked phenotype in <italic>cla-1</italic> single mutants are mediated by UNC-10/RIM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Localization of CLA-1 isoforms at the active zone and their role in synaptic vesicle clustering”, first paragraph, the authors estimate an upper bound for the physical extent of CLA-1L.

We have now also included additional data from a new CRISPR line we generated showing that the endogenously tagged N- and C-termini of CLA-1L localize to different regions. The endogenously tagged C-terminus fluorescence localizes precisely to the active zone while the endogenously tagged N-terminus fluorescence is more diffuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E</xref>), suggesting that the two ends of this protein extend far away from each other.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to estimate protein copy number from fluorescence levels, since it is not clear how we would establish a baseline (e.g. fluorescence from a single molecule).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The conclusions that the different isoforms fulfill different roles at the synapse would be strengthened if the authors showed expression of the different isoforms in the different mutants (e.g. by RT-PCR), especially that the M and S isoforms are still expressed normally in the cla-1(L) mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include RT-PCR experiments showing that shorter isoforms are still expressed in <italic>cla-1(L)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Authors should use the null allele cla-1(S/M/L) for assessing localization of active zone proteins if they want to state that cla-1 does not affect localization of these proteins at the synapse (subsection “CLA-1 is required in the NSM neuron for synaptic vesicle clustering”, last paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>We now include data showing that CLA-1 is in fact important for the localization of other AZ proteins.
