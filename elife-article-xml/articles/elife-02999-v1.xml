Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a newly discovered histone PTM that is enriched at active gene promoters and potential enhancers in mammalian cell genomes. However, the cellular enzymes that regulate the addition and removal of Kcr are unknown, which has hindered further investigation of its cellular functions. Here we used a chemical proteomics approach to comprehensively profile ‘eraser’ enzymes that recognize a lysine-4 crotonylated histone H3 (H3K4Cr) mark. We found that Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3 can catalyze the hydrolysis of lysine crotonylated histone peptides and proteins. More importantly, Sirt3 functions as a decrotonylase to regulate histone Kcr dynamics and gene transcription in living cells. This discovery not only opens opportunities for examining the physiological significance of histone Kcr, but also helps to unravel the unknown cellular mechanisms controlled by Sirt3, that have previously been considered solely as a deacetylase.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02999.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02999.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02999.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most of the DNA in a cell is wound around histone proteins to form a compacted structure called chromatin. Enzymes can modify the histones by adding small chemical tags on to them, and these histone modifications can cause the chromatin to either become more tightly packed or more open. Opening up the chromatin makes the DNA more accessible to the cellular machinery involved in gene expression. Thus, cells can regulate which genes they express, and by how much, by modifying the histone proteins.</p><p>Like all other proteins, histones are made of smaller molecules called amino acids. Specific amino acids within histone proteins can be modified in a number of different ways, with different effects. For instance, adding a chemical tag called an acetyl group onto an amino acid in a histone weakens the interaction between the histone and the DNA, which opens up the chromatin and increases gene expression.</p><p>Another way that histones can be modified is by the addition of crotonyl groups. These chemical tags have not been examined much because the enzymes that add or remove them remain to be identified. However, it was recently suggested that enzymes called sirtuins—which are known to remove acetyl groups from histones—might also remove the crotonyl groups.</p><p>Finding histone-modifying enzymes is challenging because the interactions between these enzymes and the histones are both weak and brief. Bao, Wang, Li, Li et al. have now overcome this challenge by developing a method to firmly link any protein that interacts with a crotonylated histone to the histone. Three out of the seven sirtuin enzymes found in humans were revealed to bind to crotonylated histones. All three of these enzymes—called Sirt1, Sirt2 and Sirt3—could remove crotonyl groups from histones in a test-tube, and Sirt3 could also do the same in living cells. Further biochemical experiments suggested that the mechanism used by these enzymes to remove crotonyl groups is the same as the mechanism they use to remove acetyl groups.</p><p>Bao, Wang, Li, Li et al. then uncovered the three-dimensional structure of the Sirt3 enzyme bound to a crotonylated histone, and revealed that the enzyme recognizes the crotonyl group on the histone via a unique interaction between the crotonyl group and a specific amino acid in the binding pocket of Sirt3. This amino acid is also found in Sirt1 and Sirt2, but not in other sirtuins; this interaction can thus explain why decrotonylation activity was only detected for these three enzymes.</p><p>Moreover, the levels of crotonylated histones and gene expression were higher in cells that lacked Sirt3, but not in those lacking Sirt1 or Sirt2. By identifying Sirt3 as the main decrotonylation enzyme in living cells, the role of histone crotonylation can now be investigated in greater detail.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02999.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02999.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>posttranslational modification</kwd><kwd>crotonylation</kwd><kwd>chemical proteomic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, Hong Kong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Early Career Scheme, HKU 709813P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiang David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, Hong Kong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>General Research Fund, GRF766510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hao</surname><given-names>Quan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003803</institution-id><institution>University of Hong Kong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hung Hing Ying Physical Science Research Fund, 20373739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiang David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, Hong Kong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>General Research Fund, GRF17303114</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiang David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sirt3 functions as decrotonylase to regulate histone crotonylation dynamics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) play a crucial role in regulating a wide range of biological processes, such as gene transcription, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>). Increasing evidence has indicated that PTMs of histones can serve as a heritable ‘code’ (so-called ‘histone code’), which provides epigenetic information that a mother cell can pass to its daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jenuwein and Allis, 2001</xref>). Histone code is ‘written’ or ‘erased’ by enzymes that add or remove the modifications of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goldberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>). Meanwhile, ‘readers’ of histone code recognize specific histone modifications and ‘translate’ the code by executing distinct cellular programs necessary to establish diverse cell phenotypes, while the genetic code (DNA) is unaltered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Seet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Taverna et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Lysine acetylation (Kac) was among the first covalent modification of histones to be described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allfrey and Mirsky, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allfrey et al., 1964</xref>). Since its identification, histone Kac has been correlated with gene expression. However, the mechanistic insights into the regulation and functions of histone Kac remained challenging and elusive, until the identification and characterization of the enzymes responsible for the addition and removal of this PTM, which are now known as histone acetyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Roth et al., 2001</xref>) and deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sauve et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang and Seto, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Haberland et al., 2009</xref>), respectively. Extensive studies have now revealed that Kac plays an important role in controlling chromatin structure and gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grunstein, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang and Seto, 2008a</xref>). By neutralizing positively charged lysine residues, acetylation alters the coulumbic interactions between basic histones and the negatively charged DNA, and thereby influences the structure of chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shogren-Knaak et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, acetylation may serve as a docking site for ‘reader’ proteins (e.g., bromodomain containing proteins), which are recruited onto chromatin to carry out downstream cellular processes, such as gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dhalluin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marmorstein and Berger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a newly discovered histone PTM that is specifically enriched at active gene promoters and potential enhancers in mammalian cell genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tan et al., 2011</xref>). In postmeiotic male germ cells, Kcr specifically marks testis specific X-linked genes, suggesting it is likely that it is an important histone mark for male germ cell differentiation. However, further mechanistic and functional studies of histone Kcr have been limited by a lack of knowledge of the enzymes that catalyze the addition or removal of Kcr in cells. In a systematic screening of the activities of the 11 human zinc-dependent lysine deacetylases (i.e., HDAC1–HDAC11) against a series of C-terminal lysine acylated peptides, Olsen et al. found that HDAC3 in complex with nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (HDAC3–NCoR1) had detectable decrotonylase activity towards a model peptide substrate in a fluorometric assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Madsen and Olsen, 2012</xref>). Recently, using a radioactive thin layer chromatography based assay, Denu et al. demonstrated that Sirt1 and Sirt2 can catalyze the removal of a crotonyl group from a histone H3K9Cr peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>). However, this discovery was based on a single peptide substrate. Due to lack of further characterization of these identified enzymes, their mechanisms of catalysis and the molecular bases of substrate recognition remain unclear. More importantly, since both discoveries relied on peptide based in vitro screening assays, there is still an essential need to identify endogenous histone decrotonylases.</p><p>To fill this knowledge gap, a method to profile ‘eraser’ enzymes that recognize Kcr is needed. A Cross-Linking Assisted and Stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) based Protein Identification (CLASPI) approach has recently been reported to identify histone PTM ‘readers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li and Kapoor, 2010</xref>). However, this approach has not previously been explored to identify histone PTM ‘erasers’, which are likely involved in weak and transient interactions. Here we present the application of an optimized CLASPI approach to comprehensively profile ‘eraser’ enzymes that recognize histone Kcr marks. We identified human Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3 as decrotonylases in vitro and examined the molecular basis for how the enzymes recognize Kcr using X-ray crystallography. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Sirt3 can function as an ‘eraser’ enzyme to regulate histone crotonylation dynamics in living cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chemical proteomics approach to profile proteins recognizing histone H3K4Cr mark</title><p>We first focused on a crotonylation mark discovered on histone H3K4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tan et al., 2011</xref>). We designed a peptide probe (probe <bold>1</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to convert non-covalent protein–protein interactions mediated by this Kcr into irreversible covalent linkages through photo-cross-linking. The probe is based on the unstructured N-terminal region of histone H3, with lysine-4 crotonylated, a photo-cross-linker (benzophenone) appended to alanine-7, and a bio-orthogonal handle (alkyne) at the peptide C terminus to enable selective isolation of captured binding partners. To identify proteins that bind H3K4Cr with high selectivity and high affinity, we performed two types of CLASPI experiments with cell lysates derived from HeLa S3 cells grown in medium containing either ‘heavy’ (<sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N-substitued arginine and lysine) or ‘light’ (natural isotope abundance forms) amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02999.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cross-Linking Assisted and SILAC based Protein Identification (CLASPI) strategy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical structures of probe <bold>1</bold> and probe <bold>C</bold>.

The captured proteins were then conjugated to biotin using click chemistry, followed by affinity purification, gel electrophoresis, and in-gel trypsin digestion. The digested peptide mixtures were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and analyzed with a LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Using this method, proteins that show a high SILAC ratio of heavy/light (H/L) are likely H3K4Cr selective binders. To further distinguish the high affinity interactions, we performed an ‘affinity filter’ CLASPI experiment, in which both lysates were photo-cross-linked with probe <bold>1</bold> but the ‘light’ sample also contained H3K4Cr peptide as a competitor (30 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Together, we consider a protein as a selective and tight binder of H3K4Cr when it shows high SILAC ratios of H/L in both ‘selectivity filter’ and ‘affinity filter’ experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3 recognize histone H3K4Cr mark</title><p>A two-dimensional plot with logarithmic (Log<sub>2</sub>) SILAC ratios of H/L of the identified proteins in the ‘selectivity filter’ and ‘affinity filter’ experiments, along the x axis and y axis, respectively, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. As expected, the majority of identified proteins did not show significant differences between the signal intensities of their ‘heavy’ and ‘light’ forms (i.e., H/L close to 1:1), suggesting they are not likely to be H3K4Cr binding proteins. In contrast, three nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Imai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Landry et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sauve et al., 2006</xref>), Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3, were enriched by more than 10-fold by the K4 crotonylated probe (<bold>1</bold>) in the ‘selectivity filter’ experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that they preferentially bind to this histone Kcr mark.

The asymmetric unit consists of six molecules, each containing one Sirt3–H3K4Cr complex. The two globular domains of Sirt3 composed of an NAD binding Rossmann fold and a zinc binding motif are similar to other sirtuins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avalos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Du et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yuan and Marmorstein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>). Residues <sup>2</sup>RTKQTAR<sup>8</sup> of the H3K4Cr peptide were clearly identified based on electron density. The way that the substrate is bound is similar to the published complex structure of Sirt3, with a lysine acetylated AceCS2 peptide (PDB 3GLR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jin et al., 2009</xref>).

Residue His248, a catalytic residue for the deacetylation activity of Sirt3, interacts with the crotonyl amide oxygen via hydrogen bonding in the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Strikingly, the phenyl ring of residue Phe180 aligns parallel to the planar crotonyl group and has a short distance of 3.6 Å to its conjugated carbon–carbon double bond (C=C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>), indicating a robust π-π stacking interaction between the two functional groups. Interestingly, a primary sequence alignment of all sirtuins revealed that the phenylalanine residue (Phe180) of Sirt3 is conserved in Sirt1 and Sirt2, but not in other sirtuins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), which may explain why Sirt4–Sirt7 were not identified in our CLASPI experiments.

Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to monitor hydrolysis of the H3K4Cr peptide by Sirt3. As expected, Sirt3 efficiently catalyzed the hydrolysis of the crotonyl peptide only in the presence of NAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting an NAD-dependent decrotonylation mechanism.

Consistent with the work of Denu and coworkers, Sirt1 and Sirt2 also catalyzed the hydrolysis of the H3K4Cr peptide, although they were relatively weaker binders towards this substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, for Sirt5 or Sirt6, little hydrolysis of the crotonyl peptide was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). These results agree well with the observation that the phenylalanine residue, which is involved in recognition of crotonyl lysine via π−π stacking interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>), is only conserved in Sirt1–Sirt3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). To further examine the importance of this conserved phenylalanine to the decrotonylase activity of the enzyme, we mutated Phe180 of Sirt3 to a leucine residue (F180L), which lacks an aromatic ring as a π donor but retains a similar hydrophobicity. We then carried out kinetic studies on this F180L mutant Sirt3. The steady state kinetic data showed that the catalytic efficiency of Sirt3 F180L mutant (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>=21 s<sup>−1</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>) for the hydrolysis of the H3K4Cr peptide was about 40-fold lower than that of wild-type Sirt3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating a critical role of the phenylalanine mediated π−π interaction in the decrotonylation activity of the enzyme. Interestingly, the F180L mutation caused only about a two-fold decrease in the deacetylation activity of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). This result rules out the possibility that the observed significant decrease in the decrotonylase activity of the enzyme is caused by a potential disruption of the NAD binding pocket in the mutated Sirt3.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3 remove Kcr marks from histone proteins in vitro</title><p>To test whether Sirt1–Sirt3 decrotonylate proteins, we incubated whole-cell proteins that were resolved in a sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel and transferred onto a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane with the enzymes in the presence of NAD. A pan antibody against Kcr was used to assess protein crotonylation levels. While the incubations with Sirt1–Sirt3 had little influence on lysine crotonylation in most of the protein bands, substantial reductions in Kcr levels were observed in two bands with a molecular mass of approximately 15 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Considering Sirt1–Sirt3 can decrotonylate histone peptides in vitro, we speculated that these 15 kDa proteins with reduced Kcr levels could be histones. We therefore examined the decrotonylation activity of Sirt1–Sirt3 using purified core histone proteins as substrates. Indeed, Sirt1–Sirt3 not only reduced global Kcr levels of all core histones, they also showed robust decrotonylation activity towards two known histone Kcr sites, H3K4Cr and H3K27Cr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02999.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Sirt3 regulates histone lysine crotonylation and gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analyses showing Sirt1–3 catalyzed decrotonylation of whole-cell lysates on the membrane.

Although Sirt1 and Sirt2 can decrotonylate histone peptides and proteins in vitro, their knockdowns by siRNA did not cause an appreciable increase in crotonylation levels for both the global histone and the two tested Kcr (i.e., H3K4Cr and H3K27Cr) sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, Sirt3 knockdown caused accumulation of global histone crotonylation and the H3K4Cr mark, while the histone H3K4Ac and H3K4Me3 levels were unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>), suggesting that Sirt3 selectively targets histone crotonylation. Interestingly, the crotonylation level on H3K27 was not influenced by the knockdown of Sirt3, which may be explained by the observation that Sirt3 showed weaker activity towards the H3K27Cr peptide in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). It should be noted that Sirt3 was found to localize predominantly to mitochondria and was mainly involved in metabolic regulations through controlling protein acetylation dynamics. However, recent evidence has suggested that Sirt3 can also be present in the nucleus in its full length form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iwahara et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, using an antibody that targets the N-terminal region of Sirt3, we detected endogenous full length Sirt3 in the nucleus of HeLa cells by both immunofluorescence and western blotting analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that endogenous Sirt3 can function as an ‘eraser’ enzyme to regulate histone crotonylation dynamics in cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Sirt3 regulates histone Kcr levels and gene expression on its defined chromatin regions</title><p>Finally, we sought to determine the potential biological consequence of histone decrotonylation mediated by Sirt3. It has been reported that Sirt3 can bind to chromatin and cause repression of the neighboring genes in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iwahara et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that Sirt3 could regulate gene transcription via controlling local histone Kcr levels. To test this hypothesis, we focused on seven candidate genes, <italic>Baz2a</italic>, <italic>Brip1</italic>, <italic>Corin</italic>, <italic>Ptk2</italic>, <italic>Tshz3</italic>, <italic>Wapal</italic>, and <italic>Zfat</italic>, whose transcription start sites are close to the Sirt3 enriched region. Chromatin precipitation (ChIP) coupled with quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed in U2OS cells with the pan anti-Kcr antibody to measure Kcr levels near the transcription start sites of the candidate genes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, Sirt3 knockdown by siRNA resulted in significant increases in Kcr levels of five of the seven genes analyzed, indicating that Sirt3 may directly regulate crotonylation dynamics at the genomic loci where it binds. Interestingly, the mRNA levels of the three candidate genes with increased Kcr levels, <italic>Ptk2</italic>, <italic>Tshz3</italic>, and <italic>Wapal</italic>, were also significantly upregulated on Sirt3 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Given that histone Kcr is enriched at active gene promoters and potential enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tan et al., 2011</xref>), this positive correlation between the gene transcription level and the nearby histone Kcr level on Sirt3 knockdown suggests that Sirt3 might relieve a repressive effect on these target genes through ‘erasing’ histone Kcr ‘marks’.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have established a robust chemical proteomics approach to comprehensively profile histone decrotonylases. There have been important advances in our ability to detect PTMs. However, we currently lack reliable methods to identify, without bias, enzymes that regulate the addition and removal of PTMs, as interactions between PTMs and their regulating enzymes can be weak and transient, thereby limiting the applicability of conventional biochemical ‘pull-down’ methods. Our CLASPI approach overcame this difficulty by applying photo-cross-linking chemistry to convert weak and transient enzyme–PTM interactions into irreversible covalent linkages, and enabled a systematic profiling of the ‘erasers’ of protein PTMs. The present study has also largely broadened the scope of CLASPI technology from finding PTM ‘readers’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li and Kapoor, 2010</xref>), which are usually involved in relatively more stable protein–protein interactions, to identifying dynamic and transient interactions between PTMs and their ‘erasers’. We anticipate that this approach can be used to comprehensively profile ‘erasers’ of other PTMs, such as arginine demethylases.</p><p>Siruins were initially recognized as NAD-dependent deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Imai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Landry et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sauve et al., 2006</xref>). However, emerging evidence revealed that some sirtuins that displayed weak deacetylation activity had substrate specificity towards other acyl groups attached to lysine residues. For examples, Lin et al. recently demonstrated that Sirt5 can preferentially hydrolyze malonyl and succinyl lysine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Du et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peng et al., 2011</xref>), and Sirt6 can remove long chain fatty acyl groups (e.g., myristoyl group) from lysine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that the three human sirtuins, Sirt1–Sirt3, catalyzed the hydrolysis of crotonyl lysine. This newly discovered decrotonylase activity broadens the landscape of PTMs that are targeted by sirtuins, and it also provides new impetus to investigate the cellular mechanisms and functions of Sirt1–Sirt3, which to date have been considered solely as deacetylases. This finding is also partially in agreement with the work of Denu and coworkers, in which only Sirt1 and Sirt2 exhibited decrotonylase activity, whereas Sirt3 was totally inactive, towards a histone H3K9Cr peptide in their radioactive [<sup>32</sup>P]-NAD thin layer chromatography assay. In contrast, Sirt3 displayed robust decrotonylase activity against a variety of crotonylated histone peptides, including an H3K9Cr peptide in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Given the fact that the activity of Sirt3 can be peptide sequence-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), this discrepancy may be caused by the different H3K9Cr peptide substrates used in Denu's and this study, which consisted of amino acid residues 5–13 and 1–15 of histone H3, respectively.</p><p>We have demonstrated that endogenous Sirt3 functions as an ‘eraser’ to regulate histone crotonylation in cells. This finding opens new opportunities to investigate the cellular mechanisms and functions of histone crotonylation. In contrast, while the knockdowns of Sirt1 and Sirt2 did not cause accumulation of histone global or H3K4 crotonylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), we cannot rule out the possibility that these two sirtuins could target other histone crotonylation sites. Future studies are therefore needed to systematically profile mammalian crotonylome and analyze the lysine crotonylation sites that are targeted by Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3, by comparing the corresponding wild-type and genetic knockout cells or tissues in conjunction with quantitative proteomics approaches.</p><p>The seven human sirtuins have distinct subcellular localizations. Sirt1, Sirt6, and Sirt7 are in the nucleus, Sirt3–Sirt5 localize to the mitochondria, and Sirt2 is primarily found in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Houtkooper et al., 2012</xref>). However, Sirt3, in its full length form, has recently been found in the nucleus, and nuclear Sirt3 can associate with chromatin and result in repression of nearby genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iwahara et al., 2012</xref>). Based on the focused analysis at several Sirt3 target gene loci, the current study suggests a potential correlation of the transcriptional upregulation and the increase in local histone Kcr levels on Sirt3 knockdown. It also generates a hypothesis that Sirt3 could lead to silencing through ‘erasing’ Kcr at target genes. To test this hypothesis and examine the correlation between Sirt3 catalyzed histone deacrotonylation and gene expression genome-wide requires comprehensive profiling of global histone Kcr and gene expression regulated by Sirt3 using ChIP coupled to high throughput sequencing, in combination with RNA sequencing in future studies.</p><p>In addition, the same type of PTM at different modification sites of histones may have distinct effects on gene expression. For example, trimethylation at histone H3 Lys-4 (H3K4Me3) ‘marks’ genes that are being actively transcribed, whereas the same modification at H3 Lys-27 (H3K27Me3) ‘marks’ transcriptionally silent chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martin and Zhang, 2005</xref>). By analogy, it is possible that crotonylation at specific lysine sites of histones could also play different roles in the regulation of gene expression. This possibility may account for the fact that the transcription of the two genes (i.e., <italic>Brip1</italic> and <italic>Zfat</italic>) with elevated Kcr levels was not influenced in our study. The study of the effects of site-specific histone Kcr ‘marks’ (e.g., H3K4Cr) targeted by Sirt3 on the regulation of gene expression is an important next step.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, all chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Your article has been evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior editor), Wilfred van der Donk (Reviewing editor), and 3 reviewers. The study was judged to be of interest and could be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic> provided you are able to fully address some critical questions that were raised.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the comments below to help you prepare a revised submission. Overall, the reviewers found the observed decrotonylation activity interesting and of high potential impact, but they felt that some key and essential experiments are required to support the interpretation of the authors.</p><p>1) One of the main concerns is the localization of Sirt3. The authors cite references that suggest it could be in the nucleus, but other studies have reported exclusive localization to the mitochondria. Without conclusive evidence that active Sirt3 is indeed in the nucleus in the experiments performed, the relevance of histone decrotonylation would be in question.</p><p>2) A closely related question is the impact of Sirt1-3 knockdown/overexpression on histone acetylation and methylation (1, 2 and 3 Me) levels of H3K4. For instance, could the observed effects on crotonylation be caused by changes of other modifications at these sites in these proteins due to knockdown? These experiments would be straightforward and are critical to support the interpretation of the authors.</p><p>3) A different important concern is the lack of quantitation with respect to the decrotonylation activity. The authors convincingly demonstrate that decrotonylation occurs <italic>in vitro</italic> and that O-crotonyl-ADPR is formed, but without any steady-state kinetic parameters it is unclear how robust (and hence meaningful) this activity is. Only physiologically relevant kinetic parameters would support a functional role of histone decrotonylation.</p><p>4) The biological consequences (and therefore importance) of decrotonylation activity are currently not clear. Given the apparent selectivity for histones (based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), a relatively straightforward first look would involve analysis of transcriptional changes upon knockdown of Sirt3. RNA-seq with H3K4Cr Chip-Seq, or alternatively focusing on a few loci and examining potential correlations of H3K4Cr (Chip-PCR) upon Sirt3 knockdown, would provide important information.</p><p>5) The structural studies of crotonylated peptide to SIRT3 propose a binding mode involving Phe180 that is highly conserved. What is not mentioned is that this residue is known to interact strongly with NAD in prior structural work (e.g. Wolbergers comprehensive studies, which include termolecular structures of both NAD and peptides bound to sirtuin active sites). The authors state that this residue is not conserved in SIRT4-7, but its identification and conservation has been supported by many sequence comparison and structural studies. The observed lack of decrotonylation activity upon mutation may therefore be a consequence of disrupted NAD binding rather than demonstrating substrate selectivity. It also questions whether the observed binding mode in the absence of NAD is relevant if NAD is bound to the enzyme. Steady state parameters for the decrotonylation activity of the mutant and binding studies of NAD and the crotonylated peptide to the mutant may be able to address these concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02999.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) One of the main concerns is the localization of Sirt3.

The first line of evidence involves the direct visualization of recombinant GFP-fused or epitope-tagged Sirt3 in the mitochondria of cells through GFP fluorescence or immunofluorescence (IF) using antibodies against the fused tags, respectively (see references 1-4 and 7-9 in the table above). The second line of evidence is from the detection of overexpressed epitope-tagged Sirt3 and endogenous Sirt3 in the mitochondrial fractions of cells by immunoblotting (IB) using anti-tag and anti-Sirt3 antibodies, respectively (see reference 1,3 and 6-9 in the table above). It should be noted that in these studies the detection of endogenous Sirt3 relied on antibodies that recognize the C-terminal regions of Sirt3. These anti-Sirt3 (<italic>C</italic>-term) antibodies have been used to reveal the localization of endogenous Sirt3, more specifically, short-form (i.e., N-terminal truncated) Sirt3, in the mitochondria fractions using immunoblotting analysis. However, the application of the anti-Sirt3 (<italic>C</italic>-term) antibodies to detect of endogenous full-length Sirt3 has not been limited in these studies, most likely due to the relatively low abundance of full-length Sirt3. Also, the IF detection of endogenous Sirt3 using these antibodies has NOT been shown in these studies.</p><p>In contrast, as shown in the table, several studies have provided evidences to support that while short-form Sirt3 predominantly localize in the mitochondria, full-length Sirt3 can be present in the nucleus.(need to check carefully about IB data) Reinberg <italic>et al.</italic> generated an antibody that specifically targets a Sirt3 N-terminal region. Using this anti-Sirt3 (<italic>N</italic>-term) antibody, endogenous Sirt3 was detected in the nucleus of HEK 293 and HeLa cells by IF (see reference 11 in the table above). Furthermore, a ChIP-Seq experiment using the anti-Sirt3 (<italic>N</italic>-term) antibody revealed the Sirt3’s localization on chromatin and the transcriptional level of several tested genes where Sirt3 localizes were indeed regulated by Sirt3 (see reference 12 in the table above).</p><p><italic>Our experimental results:</italic></p><p>To examine the subcellular localization of Sirt3, we also performed a couple of experiments by ourselves. First, we prepared mitochondrial and nuclear fractions from HeLa cells and examined whether endogenous Sirt3 were present in these fractions by Western blotting using antibodies that target the <italic>C</italic>-terminal (from Cell signaling) and the <italic>N</italic>-terminal (from D. Reinberg lab) regions of Sirt3, respectively. Consistent with the literature, while the short-form Sirt3 were identified in the mitochondrial fraction exclusively, we indeed detected full-length Sirt3 in the nuclear fraction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3b</xref>). Furthermore, using anti-Sirt3 (<italic>N</italic>-term) antibody, we were also able to show that Sirt3 indeed localize in the nucleus of the HeLa cells using IF (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3a</xref>). In addition, another line of evidence that supports the nuclear localization of Sirt3 came from our chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) type of experiments. As mentioned above, Sirt3 was found to localize to a broad variety of genomic regions (see reference 12 in the table above). We therefore focused some of these regions and examined whether Sirt3 could regulate the lysine crotonylation (Kcr) levels on these regions. Our data showed that knockdown of Sirt3 indeed caused significant increase in Kcr levels of the tested genomic regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). This result will be further discussed in our response to the point #4 raised by the reviewers.</p><p>Taken together, although Sirt3 was identified as the primary deacetylase in mitochondria and involved in metabolic regulation through controlling protein acetylation dynamics, it did not rule out the possibility that Sirt3 may play roles outside mitochondria. Indeed, both the literature review and our experimental data suggest that Sirt3 can be present and function in nucleus.</p><p><italic>2) A closely related question is the impact of Sirt1-3 knockdown/overexpression on histone acetylation and methylation (1, 2 and 3 Me) levels of H3K4. For instance, could the observed effects on crotonylation be caused by changes of other modifications at these sites in these proteins due to knockdown? These experiments would be straightforward and are critical to support the interpretation of the authors</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ thoughtful comments. To rule out the possibility that the increase in the crotonylation level on histone H3K4 upon Sirt3 knockdown was caused by the changes of other modifications on the same site, we also examined the acetylation (H3K4Ac) and methylation (H3K4Me3) levels in the Sirt3 knockdown experiments. Our data showed that while the H3K4Cr level was significantly enhanced by Sirt3 knockdown, the H3K4Ac and H3K4Me3 levels remained unaltered, suggesting that Sirt3 indeed selectively targets histone crotonylation. We have now included this data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) A different important concern is the lack of quantitation with respect to the decrotonylation activity. The authors convincingly demonstrate that decrotonylation occurs in vitro and that O-crotonyl-ADPR is formed, but without any steady-state kinetic parameters it is unclear how robust (and hence meaningful) this activity is. Only physiologically relevant kinetic parameters would support a functional role of histone decrotonylation</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the steady-state kinetic parameters are important to this newly identified decrotonylase. In the revised manuscript (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3b</xref> in the revised manuscript), we determined the <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> (0.01 s<sup>-1</sup>)<italic>, K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> (12.6 μM)<italic>, and k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub><italic>/K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> (7.83 × 10<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>) values for Sirt3’s decrotonylase activity using H3K4Cr as the substrate. These values are comparable to the steady-state kinetic parameters for some recently identified deacylases, such as Sirt5 as demalonylase and desuccinylase, and Sirt6 as de-long-chain fatty acylase (e.g., demyristoylase). Therefore, we believe the decrotonylase activity of Sirt3 is robust.</p><p><italic>4) The biological consequences (and therefore importance) of decrotonylation activity are currently not clear. Given the apparent selectivity for histones (based on</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5a</italic></xref><italic>), a relatively straightforward first look would involve analysis of transcriptional changes upon knockdown of Sirt3. RNA-seq with H3K4Cr Chip-Seq, or alternatively focusing on a few loci and examining potential correlations of H3K4Cr (Chip-PCR) upon Sirt3 knockdown, would provide important information</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ helpful comments and suggestions about the preliminary exploration of potential biological significance of (de)crotonylation. It has been reported that Sirt3 can bind to chromatin and cause the repression of the neighboring genes in U2OS cells. We therefore hypothesized that Sirt3 could regulate the gene transcription via controlling the local histone Kcr levels. To test this hypothesis, we focused on seven candidate genes, <italic>Baz2a</italic>, <italic>Brip1</italic>, <italic>Corin</italic>, <italic>Ptk2</italic>, <italic>Tshz3</italic>, <italic>Wapal</italic> and <italic>Zfat</italic>, whose transcription start sites (TSS) are close to Sirt3 enriched region. Chromatin precipitation (ChIP) coupled with quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed in U2OS cells with the pan anti-Kcr antibody to measure the Kcr levels near TSS of the candidate genes. We found that Sirt3 knockdown by siRNA resulted in significant increases in the Kcr levels of five of the seven genes analyzed, indicating that Sirt3 may directly regulate crotonylation dynamics at the genomic loci where it binds to (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Interestingly, the mRNA levels of the three candidate genes with increased Kcr levels, <italic>Ptk2</italic>, <italic>Tshz3</italic> and <italic>Wapal</italic>, were also significantly up-regulated upon Sirt3 knockdown (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref> ). Given that histone Kcr is enriched at active gene promoters and potential enhancers, this positive correlation between the gene transcription level and the nearby histone Kcr level upon Sirt3 knockdown suggests that Sirt3 might relieve a repressive effect on these target genes through ‘erasing’ histone Kcr ‘marks’. To examine this correlation genome-wide requires comprehensive profiling of global histone Kcr and gene expression regulated by Sirt3 using ChIP couple to high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), in combination with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in future studies.</p><p>In addition, same type of PTM at different modification sites of histones may have distinct effects on gene expression. For example, trimethylation at histone H3 Lys-4 (H3K4Me3) ‘marks’ genes that are being actively transcribed, whereas the same modification at H3 Lys-27 (H3K27Me3) ‘marks’ transcriptionally silent chromatin. By analogy, it is possible that crotonylation at specific lysine sites of histones could also play different roles in the regulation of gene expression. The study of the effects of site-specific histone Kcr ‘marks’ (e.g., H3K4Cr) targeted by Sirt3 on the regulation of gene expression is an important next step. Unfortunately, in our preliminary ChIP-qPCR study, we found that the only commercial available antibody that target H3K4Cr (from PTM BioLabs) is not suitable for ChIP experiments (the immune-precipitated chromatin was less than 0.1% of input). Therefore, new antibodies for this purpose need to be developed in future studies.</p><p><italic>5) The structural studies of crotonylated peptide to SIRT3 propose a binding mode involving Phe180 that is highly conserved. What is not mentioned is that this residue is known to interact strongly with NAD in prior structural work (e.g. Wolbergers comprehensive studies, which include termolecular structures of both NAD and peptides bound to sirtuin active sites). The authors state that this residue is not conserved in SIRT4-7, but its identification and conservation has been supported by many sequence comparison and structural studies. The observed lack of decrotonylation activity upon mutation may therefore be a consequence of disrupted NAD binding rather than demonstrating substrate selectivity. It also questions whether the observed binding mode in the absence of NAD is relevant if NAD is bound to the enzyme. Steady state parameters for the decrotonylation activity of the mutant and binding studies of NAD and the crotonylated peptide to the mutant may be able to address these concerns</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this thoughtful comment. Indeed, Wolberger’s studies revealed that an invariant Phe33 in Sir2Tm (conserved in sirtuins and corresponding to human Sirt3 Phe157 rather than Phe180) strongly interacts with NAD. To the best of our knowledge, the interaction between Phe180 of Sirt3 and NAD have not been described. In our crystal structure of Sirt3-H3K4Cr complex, Phe180 is involved in recognition of crotonyl lysine via π−π stacking interaction. To further examine the importance of this conserved phenylalanine to the enzymes’ decrotonylase activity, we mutated Phe180 of Sirt3 to a leucine residue, which lacks an aromatic ring as a π-donor but remains a similar hydrophobicity. We then carried out kinetic studies on this F180L mutant Sirt3. The steady-state kinetics data showed that the catalytic efficiency of Sirt3 F180L mutant (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> = 21 s<sup>-1</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>) for the hydrolysis of the H3K4Cr peptide was about 40-fold lower than that of wild-type Sirt3 (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> = 783 s<sup>-1</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating a critical role of the phenylalanine-mediated π−π interaction in the enzymes’ decrotonylation activity. Interestingly, the F180L mutation caused only around 2-fold decrease in the enzyme’s deacetylation activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4–figure supplement 6</xref>). This result rules out the possibility that the observed significant decrease in the enzyme’s decrotonylase activity is caused by a potential disruption of the NAD-binding pocket in the mutated Sirt3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
