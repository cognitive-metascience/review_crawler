cognitive decline in neurological disorders, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). HAND persists in treated patients as a result of chronic inflammation and low-level expression of viral proteins, though the mechanisms involved in synaptic damage are unclear. Here, we report that the chemokine CXCL12 recoups both cognitive performance and synaptodendritic health in a rodent model of HAND, which recapitulates the neuroinflammatory state of virally controlled individuals and the associated structural/functional deficiencies. CXCL12 preferentially regulates plastic thin spines on layer II/III pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex via CXCR4-dependent stimulation of the Rac1/PAK actin polymerization pathway, leading to increased spine density and improved flexible behavior. Our studies unveil a critical role of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in spine dynamics and cognitive flexibility, suggesting that HAND - or other diseases driven by spine loss - may be reversible and upturned by targeting Rac1-dependent processes in cortical neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chemokine</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>cognitive decline</kwd><kwd>neuroHIV</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA015014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meucci</surname><given-names>Olimpia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA032444</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meucci</surname><given-names>Olimpia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA040519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meucci</surname><given-names>Olimpia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH078795</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Festa</surname><given-names>Lindsay K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Floresco</surname><given-names>Stan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unveiling a novel role of the chemokine CXCL12 in the mature brain that opens up new lines of investigation for the development of therapeutics against cognitive impairment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The neurological complications of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection, collectively known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), remain an important and unmet clinical need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heaton et al., 2010</xref>). While the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly reduced the severity of neurological impairments in HIV+ individuals, approximately 30–50% of infected patients will develop some form of neurocognitive dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saylor et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, these impairments continue to be important determinants of quality of life, as well as disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simioni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tozzi et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The neuropathology of HAND is complex and has shifted dramatically since the implementation of ART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McArthur et al., 2010</xref>); however, the presence of chronic, low-level inflammation and viral neurotoxins disrupt neuroprotective and bioenergetic mechanisms that converge on aberrant synaptodendritic pruning and functional alterations in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">González-Scarano and Martín-García, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raybuck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanna et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saylor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stern et al., 2018</xref>). Developing novel adjuvant therapies that correct these dendritic alterations may be an effective strategy to help neurons face the multiple chronic insults associated with HIV infection and rescue cognitive function in these patients. A reduction in the number of dendritic spines, the main sites of excitatory neurotransmission, in the frontal cortex of HIV+ patients is significantly correlated with neurocognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">HNRC Group et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Masliah et al., 1997</xref>). This finding has been recapitulated in animal models of HAND, including the non-infectious HIV-1 transgenic (HIV-Tg) rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Festa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reid et al., 2001</xref>). HIV-Tg rats are being increasingly used in HAND research, as they recapitulate key neurochemical, genetic, and behavioral features of the human pathology as seen in treated patients, such as undetectable viral replication, reduction of post-synaptic markers, neuroinflammation, changes in gene expression, and behavioral deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Festa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Homji et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">June et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McLaurin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reid et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Repunte-Canonigo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Royal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vigorito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wayman et al., 2016</xref>). In these animals, as in patients, viral proteins are expressed at low levels in the brain - including in the prefrontal cortex, an area involved in higher cognitive functions and neuroHIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ann et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The chemokine CXCL12 and its main signaling receptor CXCR4 regulate several critical steps of CNS development, including neuronal survival and neuronal-glial communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacharyya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guyon and Nahon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicolai et al., 2010</xref>). Our previous findings in differentiated central neurons suggested that the chemokine could also modulate spine morphology, an important factor for input-specific alterations in synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yuste, 2011</xref>), particularly in the mature brain. Dendritic protrusions are often grouped into four major classes: mushroom, thin, and stubby spines and filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peters and Kaiserman-Abramof, 1970</xref>). Mushroom and thin spines are classically considered mature structures, while stubby spines and filopodia are thought of as immature or spine precursors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourne and Harris, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that intracebroventricular (ICV) administration of CXCL12 completely rescues dendritic spine loss and cognitive dysfunction in the HIV-Tg rat. The chemokine specifically increased the number of thin spines, which are associated with learning and plasticity, in layer II/III pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In the same animals, upregulation of spine density by CXCL12 correlates with an improvement in cognitive flexibility, a task mediated by the mPFC. Our mechanistic studies demonstrate the essential role of the Rac1/PAK pathway in mediating the effects of CXCL12 on dendritic spines and cognition. Overall, this study provides evidence of complete restoration of structural and functional deficits in a model of HAND, reveals a novel fundamental role of CXCL12 in the mature brain, and identifies the molecular pathway responsible for CXCL12-mediated restoration of dendritic spines and cognitive performance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Attentional set-shifting is impaired in adult male HIV-Tg rats</title><p>We have previously reported reductions in overall dendritic spine density in layer II/III pyramidal neurons in the mPFC in HIV-Tg rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Festa et al., 2015</xref>); however, it is currently unknown if these pathophysiological alterations result in discernable cognitive dysfunction. We assessed cognitive flexibility in adult male WT and HIV-Tg rats utilizing an automated three-phase lever pressing paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brady and Floresco, 2015</xref>). In the first two phases of the task (position discrimination and position reversal), there was a slight but significant difference between WT and Tg rats for position discrimination (30.17 ± 2.212 TTC for WT compared to 52.50 ± 11.90 TTC for Tg; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and none observed for position reversal (81.17 ± 18.11 TTC for WT compared to 64.50 ± 4.19 TTC for Tg; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the shift to cue phase, however, Tg rats performed significantly worse than control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Only four out of six Tg animals reached criterion by day 10 of the set-shifting phase and those who did complete the task took significantly longer to reach criterion (949.5 ± 146.3 TTC compared to 350.8 ± 84 TTC for WT). Additionally, a linear regression analysis on the cumulative proportion of animals reaching criterion over sessions revealed that a different curve was best fit for each group (F<sub>(1,11)</sub>=15.94, p=0.0021) further illustrating the gap between the groups in the number of sessions needed to reach criterion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Male adult HIV-Tg rats are deficient in strategy shifting and initial rule discrimination, but not reversal learning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HIV-Tg rats performed worse on the position discrimination task compared to age- and sex-matched WT animals.

From the same set of animals used in the above-mentioned behavioral study, we assessed dendritic spine density and morphology in layer II/III pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic (PrL) region of the mPFC. Compared with control animals, Tg rats had significantly reduced dendritic spine density, as we previously observed in older animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Festa et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition to spine density, subtle spine morphological changes were also present, whereby the density of thin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and mushroom spines was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), while stubby spines were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This demonstrates a shift in spine morphology from mature (mushroom and thin) to immature (stubby), which is expected to alter cognition. Indeed, spine density in the mPFC was negatively correlated with performance to the shift to cue phase (Pearson’s r = −0.7368, p=0.0151, α = 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and this relationship became stronger when only thin spine density was considered (Pearson’s r = −0.7920, p=0.0063, α = 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). On the contrary, spine density in the mPFC was not correlated with performance on position discrimination (Pearson’s r = −0.4548, p=0.1374, α = 0.05) or position reversal (Pearson’s r = 0.4862, p=0.1090, α = 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Layer II/III pyramidal neurons in the PrL region of the mPFC of HIV-Tg rats have alterations in spine density and morphology.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dendritic spine density and morphology were assessed using Neurolucida 360 software.

When Rac1 is in its active form, it is bound to GTP, which allows it to physically interact with the serine/threonine kinase PAK1. Thus, we utilized a Rac1 activity assay that uses PAK1 agarose beads to specifically pull down Rac1 bound to GTP.

These novel CXCL12-induced neuronal changes are instrumental for rescuing cognitive flexibility. Importantly, this work demonstrates recovery of executive function and dendritic spines when impairment is already present, opening up new therapeutic avenues for HAND and other neuroinflammatory conditions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Complete rescue of behavioral and structural deficits in HAND</title><p>Characterization of executive function deficits in HIV-Tg rats revealed selective alterations in set-shifting, but not initial rule discrimination or reversal learning. Thus, neuronal injury induced by viral neurotoxins or low-level inflammation that results in appreciable cognitive dysfunction may be restricted to particular brain regions. The mPFC, in particular the PrL region, is known to mediate strategy shifting, as inactivation or lesions to this area specifically impairs this behavioral phenotype while sparing both initial learning and reversal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birrell and Brown, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Floresco et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, damage to the anterior cingulate cortex or orbitofrontal cortex results in deficits in initial rule acquisition or reversal learning respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamilton and Brigman, 2015</xref>). Based on our behavioral data, we predict minimal changes in dendritic spines in these regions and ongoing studies in the same animal model are exploring whether other brain regions besides the mPFC display deficits in spine number and morphology. Regional analysis revealed selective alterations in the motor cortex, while there are marginal changes in the neighboring somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nash et al., 2019</xref>). In line with clinical imaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sanford et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sanford et al., 2017</xref>), dendritic damage in the context of HIV infection seems to be region specific and very subtle. Importantly, our data are in line with others who have demonstrated subtle structural deficits of dopaminergic medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens of female HIV-Tg rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roscoe et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Using DiOlistic staining coupled with Neurolucida 360 software, we were able to successfully classify individual spines into one of the four main categories based on established parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rodriguez et al., 2008</xref>). This revealed a significant increase in stubby spine density, associated with decreases in both thin and mushroom spine density, on layer II/III pyramidal neurons in the mPFC in HIV-Tg rats. This demonstrates an overall shift in spine morphology, whereby there is a greater proportion of immature (e.g. stubby) spines remaining on these neurons and fewer mature (e.g. thin and mushroom) ones. Combined with the overall reduction in spine density, this finding has major implications for neurotransmission and cognitive function. Stubby spines are considered immature structures due to their usual prevalence during early postnatal development and scarcity in the adult CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris, 1999</xref>). Their lack of a distinctive head and neck suggests that these spines are unable to properly sequester incoming electrical and chemical signals, leading to inappropriate propagation of downstream pathways. Particularly, a dendritic spine’s head and neck configuration is essential to properly compartmentalize incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through glutamate receptors in order to prevent excitotoxicity from occuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2009</xref>). Excitotoxic neuronal injury is a common endpoint for viral proteins and inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saylor et al., 2016</xref>) and the higher proportion of stubby dendritic spines may represent a common modality by which these proteins can induce damage. Additionally, electrophysiological data from HIV-Tg rats demonstrated that layer V pyramidal neurons from the PrL region of the mPFC are hyper-excitable compared to neurons from non-Tg controls, as indicated by reduced rheobase, spike amplitude, an inwardly-rectifying K<sup>+</sup> influx, increased number of action potentials, and a trend towards aberrant firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khodr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wayman et al., 2016</xref>). While our studies focused on dendritic spine alterations in layer II/III neurons, additional data from the same set of animals demonstrated similar deficits in layer V cells and recovery by CXCL12 administration (data not shown) suggesting that injury in the mPFC is not layer-specific. Thus, the increase in stubby spine density on these neurons may result in aberrant synaptic transmission and hyper-excitability, leading to inappropriate activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzymes and structural damage to the neuron. This would result in considerable circuit alterations and behavioral dysfunction.</p><p>Notably, treatment with exogenous CXCL12 completely restored the reduction in dendritic spine density observed in the mPFC of HIV-Tg rats, as well as the associated dysfunction in set-shifting. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting recovery of both structural and behavioral deficits in the HIV-Tg rat model. Importantly, studies were conducted at an age where animals were already impaired, demonstrating that dendritic spine injury and cognitive dysfunction are completely reversible. This has important implications for HIV+ patients on ART where viral replication has been suppressed, but viral proteins and inflammatory mediators may still be produced, especially in the CNS, and continue to induce damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saylor et al., 2016</xref>). It also supports the notion that targeting homeostatic mediators of neuronal function and synaptic transmission that are disrupted during HIV infection may be a valid therapeutic strategy for HAND patients. Our data also suggest that restoring highly plastic thin spines is a key driver in regulating cognitive function mediated by the mPFC. This is the first time this phenomenon has been reported in a rodent model of HAND, suggesting that therapeutics to target this spine type are an appropriate strategy to combat the deficits seen in these patients. Interestingly, the extended treatment with CXCL12 did not reveal any side effects in both WT and Tg animals, indicating that potential effects of the chemokine on other cellular targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guyon, 2014</xref>) do not interfere with its neuroprotective function - at least within the time frame of this study. Most importantly, our work dissecting out the molecular mechanisms of CXCL12-mediated spine alterations points to the key involvement of the Rac1/PAK pathway. Therefore, therapies targeting this pathway specifically in neurons would be beneficial in HAND and other types of cognitive dysfunction, such as aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hao et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of Rac1/PAK pathway in CXCL12-enhanced cognitive performance</title><p>Though the chemokine CXCL12 is well known for its homeostatic action in the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lysko et al., 2014</xref>), its relevance in the mature brain has been mainly associated with inflammatory responses. Here, we demonstrated that CXCL12 activates the small GTPase Rac1 and its downstream mediators to modulate dendritic spine density in mature, excitatory cortical neurons. Activation of this pathway is associated with actin polymerization and this resulted in a specific increase in thin spine density on cortical neurons. The involvement of the Rac1/PAK pathway in mediating the effects of CXCL12 on actin polymerization has not been described in cortical neurons. Our data show that Rac1 activation is the exclusive mediator of CXCL12’s alterations on spine density and morphology, suggesting that targeted therapeutics to selectively activate this pathway through CXCR4 could recover dendritic spine loss. CXCL12 not only activated the Rac1/PAK pathway but also modulated the phosphorylation status of the phosphatase Slingshot homolog 1. This dual regulation of cofilin demonstrates that CXCL12 acts on multiple components of this pathway to exert control on actin polymerization. This also provides additional targets to positively modify dendritic spines. While it is presently unclear whether CXCL12 regulates phosphorylation of SSH1 in cortical neurons in a direct manner, there is evidence in non-neuronal cells that the chemokine can inhibit dephosphorylation of SSH1 via the 14-3-3 protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chernock et al., 2001</xref>). 14-3-3 proteins are a family of highly conserved proteins that are abundantly expressed in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dougherty and Morrison, 2004</xref>). They inhibit SSH1 phosphatase activity by binding to phosphorylated serine residues and sequestering SSH1 in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nagata-Ohashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soosairajah et al., 2005</xref>). Since our current data regarding CXCL12-induced activation of the Rac1/PAK pathway are in line with studies in non-neuronal cells, the mechanisms leading to SSH1 phosphorylation might also be conserved. However, this needs to be investigated.</p><p>Inactivation of Rac1 via a small molecule inhibitor completely blocked the beneficial effects of CXCL12 on set shifting as measured by trials to criterion and the rate to reach criterion. Furthermore, changes in spine density and morphology induced by daily CXCL12 treatment were completely dependent on its ability to activate Rac1 in the mPFC. Interestingly, blockade of Rac1 activation had no perceived effects on the first two phases of the behavioral task, suggesting specificity of the small GTPase in functions mediated by the mPFC but this warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this is the first study to connect Rac1 activation with behavioral flexibility, further underscoring the critical role of the small GTPase in regulating synaptic function. Additionally, our data support the notion that utilizing therapeutics to modulate Rac1/PAK signaling may be beneficial in reversing structural and behavioral deficits in the mPFC.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>CXCL12 in the mature CNS</title><p>The role of CXCL12/CXCR4 in the developing CNS is well established. On the other hand, the effects of CXCL12 on mature neurons, specifically in the context of synaptic connectivity, are not completely understood. In cortical neurons, induction of Rac1 is associated with F-actin polymerization and spine stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin and Koleske, 2010</xref>). This is in agreement with our data demonstrating a shift in F/G-actin ratio following CXCL12 treatment, as well as the specific increase in transient thin spines. Upregulation of thin spines, which at least initially only contain NMDARs and are considered ‘silent synapses’, would not be expected to result in significant alterations in synaptic transmission. However, as previously discussed, thin spines control neuronal signaling via regulation of calcium-dependent processes. Moreover, our previous work demonstrated that CXCL12 altered both sEPSC and mEPSC amplitude in whole-cell patch clamp slice recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pitcher et al., 2014</xref>). Changes in mEPSCs amplitude typically reflect alterations to postsynaptic receptors, suggesting that CXCL12 is contributing to the maturation of dendritic spines. Furthermore, Rac1 activation is implicated in spine head morphing, or twitching, that promotes the maturation of synaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tashiro and Yuste, 2004</xref>). While we did not observe any changes in mushroom spine density by CXCL12 in vitro or in vivo, this is not surprising given that mushroom spines are the most mature and stable spines, typically implicated in long-term memory and potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourne and Harris, 2007</xref>). Ongoing studies in the laboratory are investigating whether CXCL12 alters levels of post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), a necessary scaffolding protein present in mature synapses. Shifts in the actin ratio towards F-actin results in an increase in spine motility and spine head enlargement; thus, this chemokine plays a critical and unique role in regulating synaptic connectivity via modulation of the number of contacts as well as their maturation.</p><p>It is important to note that the relationship between CXCL12 and CXCR4 is not exclusive, as CXCL12 can also interact with another receptor, atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3), also known as CXCR7. ACKR3 contains a mutated ‘DRYLAIV’ motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sierro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thelen and Thelen, 2008</xref>), a region critical for G-protein coupling, and thus does not demonstrate G-protein-dependent signaling. Early reports supported a scavenger role, acting to internalize and degrade CXCL12, thereby regulating extracellular concentration. Removal of ACKR3 causes a significant increase in extracellular levels of CXCL12, which favors its binding to CXCR4 and triggers CXCR4 endocytosis and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, ACKR3 can form heterodimers with CXCR4 and regulate CXCR4-mediated signaling; however, the presence of these heterodimers occurring in vivo has been called into question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levoye et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luker et al., 2012</xref>). While the above-mentioned evidence demonstrates that ACKR3 may modulate CXCR4 signaling pathways and responsiveness, the demonstrated absence of cell-surface ACKR3 in mature neurons (ACKR3 is only transiently expressed on the surface of developing neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shimizu et al., 2011</xref>), suggests a predominant role of CXCR4 in CXCL12-mediated effects on dendritic spines and cognition.</p><p>While CXCR4 expression has been detected on other cell types of the CNS, including astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajetto et al., 1999</xref>), microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lipfert et al., 2013</xref>), and oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maysami et al., 2006</xref>), CXCL12’s effects on neurons are observed both in the presence and absence of glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pitcher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sengupta et al., 2009</xref>), and its ability to regulate dendritic spines in cultured neurons is replicated in the intact brain. Thus, the chemokine’s interaction with neuronal CXCR4 is sufficient to induce these changes. Our current studies aim to establish whether CXCL12 is modulating specific neuronal subpopulations (i.e. excitatory or inhibitory neurons). CXCL12 is known to alter GABAergic neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacharyya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guyon and Nahon, 2007</xref>), which may result in dendritic spines changes on excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, recent evidence has also shown that CXCL12 targets parvalbumin (PV)+ basket interneuron axons and inhibitory perisomatic synapses, which modulates neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Ongoing experiments are utilizing dCas9-base CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to selectively knockdown CXCR4 in either excitatory (CamKIIα+) or inhibitory (mDIx+) neurons and determine the contribution of each neuronal subpopulation to dendritic spine dynamics.</p><p>In conclusion, these studies open the possibility of creating therapeutics to target synaptic and cognitive deficits in HAND patients via restoration of endogenous neuroprotective pathways. While drug discovery involving chemokine receptors has primarily focused on developing antagonists, our work suggests that CXCR4 agonists may be beneficial in alleviating structural and behavioral dysfunction. The in vitro studies reported here dissected out the molecular players regulating CXCL12-induced spine changes, as well as identified the specific spine type targeted by the chemokine. The in vivo experiments validated our mechanistic studies and confirmed the involvement of Rac1 signaling in CXCL12-regulated dendritic spine and cognitive changes. Taken together, these data suggest that targeting these signaling pathways may represent a valid strategy for neurorestorative therapies for HAND and other diseases characterized by spine loss and/or CXCR4 dysregulation, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and schizophrenia. This represents a major paradigm shift, as previous attempts against HAND or AD focused on inhibition of excitotoxicity through targeting of glutamate receptors, transporters, or ion channels. Interestingly, small molecule CXCR4 agonists that may be exploited for further preclinical studies are now available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mishra et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>R.

Animals were purchased from Envigo Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN) until the license for breeding HIV-Tg rats was returned to the University of Maryland, who originally developed this transgenic line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reid et al., 2001</xref>). Rats were singly housed in isolation in our Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited barrier facilities in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and institutional approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were food-restricted one week prior to the initiation of lever pressing training.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cannula implantation and intracerebroventricular administration</title><p>Rats were implanted stereotaxically under isoflurane anesthesia and ketamine/xylazine (50 mg/kg; 10 mg/kg, PennVet), with 26-gauge stainless-steel guide cannulas (Plastics One) placed 0.96 mm posterior and 2.00 mm lateral to bregma, 3.5 mm below the surface of the cranium. Four stainless-steel screws (#0–80) were placed around the cannula and acrylic dental cement was used to anchor them. Following surgery, animals were allowed seven days to recover before the initiation of infusions and behavioral testing. Animals received once daily infusions of either vehicle (0.1% BSA in PBS, 5 μL total volume), CXCL12 (5 ng/μL in 0.1% BSA in PBS, 5 μL total volume), or NSC23766 (2 μg/μL in diH<sub>2</sub>O, 5 μL total volume) via a micropump set for an infusion rate of 0.5 μL/min throughout the duration of behavioral testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Attentional set-shifting task</title><p>Reversal learning and strategy shifting were assessed using an automated operant-based approach whereby the behavioral tasks occurred within operant chambers controlled by custom software programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brady and Floresco, 2015</xref>). Each chamber was equipped with a house light, fan, two retractable levers, a tone generator above each lever, a pellet dispenser, a stainless-steel pellet trough located between the levers, and a panel light just above the pellet trough. Food-restricted rats were initially trained to respond by lever pressing under a fixed-ratio (FR1) schedule of reward presentation (45 mg sucrose pellet, Bio-Serv, Flemington, NJ). Side biases were avoided by presenting each lever an equal number of times in a pseudorandom order. Following training, the 3-phase task was conducted, consisting of position discrimination, position reversal, and rule shifting. During position discrimination, one lever (left or right) was designated as the ‘correct’ choice. Both levers were presented but only responses on the ‘correct’ lever were rewarded while responses on the other had no programmed consequences. An inter-trial interval of 20 s followed each response, during which time the levers were retracted. Rats underwent position discrimination until they attained the criterion of 10 consecutive correct trials with a maximum of 150 trials per day. One day following completion of the discrimination phase, the rats performed a reversal learning task in which the opposite lever of the ‘correct’ choice from the discrimination phase was now rewarded. Twenty reminder trials of the previous rule were conducted prior to the reversal trials. As with position discrimination, rats underwent reversal learning until they attained 10 consecutive correct trials. After successful completion of the reversal task, the strategy shift task was initiated on the following day. In this phase both levers were presented in each trial. In addition, an audible tone was presented above one of the two levers. The ‘correct’ lever, which resulted in reward presentation, was that which was associated with the tone, regardless of position (left or right) within the chamber. Tone, rather than a cue light, was used in this phase to account for any inherent visual impairment due to cataract development in Tg rats. Rats conducted the strategy shift phase until they attained the criterion of 10 consecutive correct trials, with a maximum of 150 trials on a single day. If animals failed to reach criterion by day 10 of the shift to cue phase, the task was terminated. Cognitive performance was determined by measuring the number of trials needed to reach criterion during each phase of the task, as well as the rate at which they reached criterion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Neuronal cultures</title><p>Primary cortical neurons were obtained from E17 embryos from Holtzmann rats and cultured in Neurobasal medium as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brewer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pitcher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sengupta et al., 2009</xref>). To further reduce the growth of non-neuronal cells, cytosine arabinoside (1 μM) was added to the cultures. This results in a virtually glia-free culture (&gt;95% neurons) as assessed by expression of neuronal and non-neuronal markers. Briefly, neurons were plated at a density of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> on 60 mm dishes or 35,000 on 15 mm coverslips in Neurobasal medium containing B27 (2%) and horse serum (2%). Medium was replaced after 3 hr of plating with serum-free Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, Glutamax (0.5 mM), and glutamic acid (25 μM). On the fourth and eighth day in vitro (DIV), the culture medium was replaced again with Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 and Glutamax. On the fourteenth day of culture, half of the media were changed with Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 and Glutamax.

Male WT or HIV-Tg F344 rats (approximately 4 months old) were randomly assigned to groups for behavioral and in vivo studies. In vivo data collection and analysis was conducted blinded to genotype and treatment. All in vitro experiments were performed with at least N = 3 biological replicates, and each biological replicate used neurons derived from a different litter of E17 rats. Outliers were neither encountered nor removed from any analysis. Data are represented as mean ± SEM for in vitro and in vivo experiments. The number of trials to criterion for each behavioral task was analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc. Dendritic spine density and morphology were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett post hoc if comparing experimental groups to a control group or Tukey post-hoc if comparing all groups against each other. The correlation between spine density and trials to criterion was calculated as Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>. The rate for reaching criterion was assessed by linear regression analysis to determine if the slopes of each line were equal. For multispectral imaging, a two-tailed Student’s t-test was used.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Norman Haugey (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Festa and colleagues reports activation of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in prefrontal cortex of HIV-Tg rat, an animal model of HAND. Moreover, they provide evidence that the pathological deficits in dendritic spine density and maturation can be reversed by infusion of CXCL12 through the Rac1/PAK actin polymerization pathway.</p><p>Specifically, the authors showed that HIV-Tg rat showed 1) impaired attentional set-shifting behavior, which is correlated with the loss of spine density in the mPFC 2) CXCL12 treatment through ICV infusion rescued the deficit in spine density and attentional set-shifting behavior and 3) CXCL12-induced rescue effect was mediated through the CXCR4/Rac1/PAK actin polymerization pathway.</p><p>Cognitive deficits are a serious complication associated with AIDS even in treated subjects. The authors report an interesting set of findings that start to identify a new mechanism. However, in vivo validation and evidence of this CXCL12/CXCR4/Rac1/PAK signaling mechanism would significantly strengthen this study and its impact. Moreover, a few key points and questions need to be addressed as outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Is there a deficit in CXCL12/CXCR4/Rac1/PAK signaling in the HIV-Tg model? Most of the studies of signaling pathways were carried out with cultured WT neurons. It would be important to characterize the signaling changes in PFC of the HIV-Tg model.</p><p>2) CXCR4-independent effects of CXCL12 should be considered. Chemokines are known to have multiple targets. For example, CXCL12 can activate receptors such as CXCR7. Please address in Discussion.</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1) Is the result in Figure 1A sufficiently powered? It appears that the HIV-Tg result is higher than WT.</p><p>2) The results in Figure 5A, 5B, 5C and Figure 6C suggest that the pLIMK1/LIMK1 findings are not consistent.</p><p>3) Thin spine density in Figure 8D (WT) is similar with Figure 9D (HIV-Tg), which is not consistent with Figure 3D.</p><p>4) The method for labelling spines in vivo does not seem to be included in the paper</p><p>Representative images of in vivo spine density and morphology for some of the in vivo pathological and behavioral reversals would be useful for completeness.</p><p>5) It is interesting that the most robust effect of CXCL12 appears to be on thin spines with a reciprocal reduction in stubby spines. These findings are entirely consistent with their data on cytoskeletal stabilization, and suggest that CXCL12 promotes the elongation of stubby spines. It is somewhat curious that the behavioral effects do not appear to correlate with the increased presence of mushroom shaped spines, as these presumably would be synaptically connected. It is possible this effect is due to the timing of CXCL12 infusions, behavioral testing and sacrifice date. i.e. it is possible that the increase of mushroom shaped spines occurred earlier during the infusion regimen and subsequently downregulated after the behavioral task was mastered, or it is possible that the presence of mushroom shaped spines does not accurately reflect synaptic connectivity. PSD95 staining or Western would address the curiosity. If the authors do not have sufficient tissue left over (even contralateral side may be sufficient based on their data), a further discussion of this phenomenon would be sufficient.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49717.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Is there a deficit in CXCL12/CXCR4/Rac1/PAK signaling in the HIV-Tg model?

Additionally, new related studies are included in Figure 7—figure supplement 1. The short answer to the reviewer’s question is <italic>No</italic> – i.e. the ability of the chemokine to activate Rac1/PAK signaling remains intact in the HIV-Tg model.</p><p>More specifically, though the level of PAK phosphorylation in PFC neurons of control (i.e. vehicle treated) HIV-Tg rats is lower than in the corresponding WT group, CXCL12 effectively induces PAK phosphorylation in the HIV-Tg brain and this stimulation is as pronounced as that observed in WT rats (Figure 7A). When compared to the basal value in their respective controls, the magnitude of pPAK increase is comparable in the two groups (average signal per area D = 37 in Tg rats and 36 in WT rats; Figure 7A bottom graph). As predicted from the robust CXCL12-induced PAK stimulation in both genotypes, we did not find significative difference in the expression of total Rac1 protein in HIV-Tg PFC tissue versus WT (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).However, in line with the above pPAK results under basal conditions, pulldown studies from PFC of untreated rats show reduced levels of active Rac1 in HIV-Tg compared to untreated WT (Figure 7—figure supplement 1) – suggesting a reduced basal tone of PAK activation in the HIV-Tg model.</p><p>Overall, these studies indicate that the CXCL12/CXCR4/Rac1/PAK pathway is fully functional in the HIV-Tg model – a conclusion further supported by the finding that the ability of CXCL12 to rescue spine deficits in the HIV-Tg model is completely blocked by the Rac1 inhibitor (Figure 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) CXCR4-independent effects of CXCL12 should be considered.

Please address in Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize the contribution of CXCR7 to other CXCL12 functions and, as suggested by the reviewer, we have discussed this point in the revised manuscript. However, evidence pointing to a main role of CXCR4 in these effects comes not only from the signaling studies presented in this manuscript (Figure 4), but also from previous findings concerning the role of CXCL12/CXCR4 in excitatory neurotransmission and its regulation by endogenous and exogenous factors (e.g. Sengupta et al., 2009, Nicolai et al., 2010, Pitcher et al., 2014, Nash et al., 2019). Additionally, CXCR7 expression on the plasma membrane of differentiated neurons is thought to be modest in the adult brain (e.g. Shimizu et al., 2011). This receptor is certainly critical during development, as it regulates migration of neural precursors and CXCR4 signaling. However, it does not signal via the canonical G-protein coupling and appears less relevant in this specific context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1) Is the result in Figure 1A sufficiently powered?

Thus, some variability in the time course is to be expected as these studies come from 12 different cultures (n=3 for each individual set of experiment) and multiple rat embryos. That said, CXCL12 consistently stimulated PAK activation, with peaks at 5-15 minutes. LIMK1 phosphorylation is downstream PAK and was also consistently activated during the first 30-60 minutes, as one would expect. While there is biological variability due to the use of primary tissue over an extended period of time and the complexity of the biochemical process in question, we do typically see subsequent stimulation of the downstream targets within the PAK/LIMK1/cofilin pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Thin spine density in Figure 8D (WT) is similar with Figure 9D (HIV-Tg), which is not consistent with Figure 3D.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to intrinsic biological variability, this may be explained by minor differences related to the source of animals, which changed toward the end of this project. All the experiments utilized the transgenic line generated by Bryant’s group at the University of Maryland in 2001 (Reid et al., 2001). However, until recently breeding of the HIV-Tg was licensed to a commercial vendor, i.e. Envigo. In the summer of 2017 Envigo’s license was not renewed and they returned the colony to the University of Maryland. At that point, we started purchasing the animals from the University of Maryland directly. Hence, while the experiments in Figures 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 were entirely performed with rats from Envigo, for Figure 9 we used a first set of animals (n=12) from Envigo but the rest (n=24) were provided by the University of Maryland animal facility. Importantly, for both cohort of animals we run the four different groups (Vehicle, CXCL12, NSC, NSC+CXCL12) at the same time. Despite the modest change in the number of thin spines compared to the past (possibly due to slight difference in animal age, housing or environment), the effect of CXCL12 and NSC were highly reproducible within the different cohorts – which further increased our confidence in the results. Indeed, independently of the thin spine density under basal conditions, CXCL12’s effect was clear, and it was consistently inhibited by NSC. Furthermore, the changes in thin spine density nicely correlated with cognitive performance as in the previous studies.We have clarified the issue about the animal source in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The method for labelling spines in vivo does not seem to be included in the paper</p><p>Representative images of in vivo spine density and morphology for some of the in vivo pathological and behavioral reversals would be useful for completeness.</p></disp-quote><p>The method is included in the section titled “<italic>Diolistic labeling of brain slices</italic>”. As requested, we have added representative images in Figures 2A, 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is interesting that the most robust effect of CXCL12 appears to be on thin spines with a reciprocal reduction in stubby spines. These findings are entirely consistent with their data on cytoskeletal stabilization, and suggest that CXCL12 promotes the elongation of stubby spines. It is somewhat curious that the behavioral effects do not appear to correlate with the increased presence of mushroom shaped spines, as these presumably would be synaptically connected. It is possible this effect is due to the timing of CXCL12 infusions, behavioral testing and sacrifice date. i.e. it is possible that the increase of mushroom shaped spines occurred earlier during the infusion regimen and subsequently downregulated after the behavioral task was mastered, or it is possible that the presence of mushroom shaped spines does not accurately reflect synaptic connectivity. PSD95 staining or Western would address the curiosity. If the authors do not have sufficient tissue left over (even contralateral side may be sufficient based on their data), a further discussion of this phenomenon would be sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment and agree on the complexity of the issue. Live imaging studies aiming at further exploring the relationship between the reciprocal changes in thin and stubby spines will help address this question. The idea that CXCL12 promotes elongation of stubby spines is attractive, but it is also possible that CXCL12 stabilizes thin spines by reducing their turnover rate. Spine changes may also result from E/I circuit adaptations. We too were intrigued by potential changes in PSD95 and have been investigating this issue recently. So far, we have not observed modifications in overall PSD95 expression in cultured neurons exposed to CXCL12, but we are currently investigating possible changes at the synaptic level specifically (both in cultured neurons and brain tissue slices). In regard to mushroom spines, they were not significantly affected by CXCL12. This is not that surprising as mushroom spines are the most mature and stable type of spines, typically implicated in long term memory. Thin spines on the other hand are thought to be critical for cognitive flexibility. We modified the Discussion to cover these valid points.</p></body></sub-article></article>
