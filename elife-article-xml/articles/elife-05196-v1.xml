As the brain develops, several different signaling molecules control how the connections between neurons develop. If these signals occur at the wrong time or wrong place, or in the wrong amount, the neurons may not connect in the right way; this is the cause of several brain disorders.</p><p>One of the signaling molecules that helps neural circuits to form in the developing brain is the Dscam protein. Having too much Dscam has been linked to neurons with enlarged presynaptic terminals. Presynaptic terminals are the parts of each neuron that send information on to the next cell, and when they are enlarged it results in the neuron not being able to communicate with other neurons in a targeted way. People with brain disorders including Down syndrome, epilepsy and possibly fragile X syndrome often have excessive amounts of Dscam.</p><p>It was not known precisely how Dscam signals within neurons. Sterne, Kim and Ye have now investigated this by exploring the effects of Dscam on a group of well-known neurons in the larvae of the fruit fly species <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The presynaptic terminals of single neurons in this group were labeled in the larvae using a genetic marker. This revealed that the neurons of larvae that had been engineered to produce too much Dscam had larger presynaptic terminals than normal.</p><p>Further investigation showed that for Dscam to influence how a presynaptic terminal grows, it must interact with another signaling protein called Abelson tyrosine kinase (or Abl for short). Therefore, the larger presynaptic terminals seen in larvae that produce too much Dscam are a result of the Dscam protein activating too much Abl.</p><p>There are several drugs that are approved for use in humans that suppress the activity of Abl. Sterne, Kim and Ye used two of these to treat fruit fly larvae, and found that they reversed the detrimental effects of extra Dscam on the larvae's neural circuit. Furthermore, the drugs fixed neural defects in a fruit fly model designed to reproduce the symptoms of fragile X syndrome.</p><p>Overall, the results presented by Sterne, Kim and Ye suggest that suppressing the abnormally high activity of the Abl protein could be a way of treating the brain disorders caused by having excessive amounts of the Dscam protein. The next step is to test whether Dscam and Abl interact in the same way in mammals and whether the proposed treatment is effective in treating mammalian models of disorders that involve dysregulated Dscam signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05196.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05196.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Dscam</kwd><kwd>Abl</kwd><kwd>fragile X syndrome</kwd><kwd>tyrosine kinase inhibitor</kwd><kwd>presynaptic terminal</kwd><kwd>neuronal development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH091186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Bing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2009-000359-016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Bing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007270</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan (U-M)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Protein Folding Disease Initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Bing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeting Abelson kinase can be beneficial for treating disorders characterized by dysregulated Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dscam levels are increased in the brains of human patients with DS and in mouse models of DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Saito et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves-Sampaio et al., 2010</xref>). Recent research also suggests that fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) binds directly to the mRNAs of Dscam from mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>), and studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons further confirmed that FMRP suppresses Dscam translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cvetkovska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). In the dendritic arborization (da) neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva, Dscam expression level is instructive for presynaptic terminal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this, increased Dscam in <italic>Drosophila</italic> FXS models results in enlarged presynaptic arbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). These findings indicate the importance of proper Dscam levels in normal development and in the pathogenesis of brain disorders.</p><p>Because of the link between increased Dscam expression and neuronal defects in DS and FXS models, targeting Dscam or its signaling mechanism might prove therapeutic for these disorders. Currently, neither methods for targeting Dscam proteins nor those for targeting the signaling pathway activated by dysregulated Dscam are available, impeding the development of such therapies. In fact, very little is known about how Dscam signaling is transduced in vivo. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Dscam has previously been shown to bind to Dock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schmucker et al., 2000</xref>), while in mammals it has been shown to associate with Uncoordinated-5C, Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Fyn kinase, and PAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li and Guan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Purohit et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, studies suggest possible genetic interactions between Dscam and the Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl) in neurite development in the central nervous system (CNS) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). However, evidence demonstrating the requirement of these potential interactors for the defects that arise from increased Dscam expression is lacking. Moreover, whether pharmacologically targeting these molecules in vivo might alleviate the effects of increased Dscam expression is unknown.</p><p>The evolutionarily conserved Abl kinase transduces extracellular cues into cytoskeletal rearrangements that affect cell motility and shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bradley and Koleske, 2009</xref>) and is implicated in axonal development, including axon guidance and extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wills et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wills et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wills et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsouna et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Forsthoefel et al., 2005</xref>). Overexpression of Abl causes increased axon growth in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leyssen et al., 2005</xref>), which is reminiscent of the effect caused by Dscam overexpression in C4da neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have indicated that <italic>abl</italic> mutations have an additive effect with <italic>Dscam</italic> mutations, such that <italic>abl</italic>/<italic>Dscam</italic> double mutant embryos have more severe axon midline crossing defects than either <italic>abl</italic> or <italic>Dscam</italic> mutants alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). However, the molecular nature of this interaction, that is, whether or not Dscam acts through Abl, and particularly whether inhibition of Abl mitigates neuronal defects caused by dysregulated Dscam, is unknown.</p><p>Here we show that Dscam activates Abl through its cytoplasmic domain, which is required for the presynaptic arbor enlargement caused by dysregulated Dscam expression in vivo. Importantly, we demonstrate that the pharmacological inhibition of Abl ameliorates exuberant presynaptic arbor growth both in flies overexpressing Dscam and in a fly model of FXS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We took advantage of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons to delineate the molecular mechanism of Dscam signaling in presynaptic arbor development, because the presynaptic terminal growth of these neurons is highly sensitive to Dscam levels in a linear fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). For example, loss of <italic>Dscam</italic> causes C4da presynaptic terminals to fail to grow while increased Dscam levels lead to increased presynaptic terminal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). From tests of candidate genes that potentially mediate Dscam function, including FAK, Fyn, PAK, RhoA, and Abl, we identified Abl as a key molecule mediating Dscam's functions in presynaptic terminal growth. We first asked whether Abl is sufficient to promote presynaptic terminal growth in C4da neurons. Consistent with a previous study performed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult CNS neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leyssen et al., 2005</xref>), overexpression of Abl in C4da neurons caused significant overgrowth of the presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,E</xref>). Since Abl is known to have both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henkemeyer et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwartzberg et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tybulewicz et al., 1991</xref>), we tested whether expression of a kinase-dead form of Abl, Abl-K417N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henkemeyer et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wills et al., 1999b</xref>), could promote presynaptic terminal growth. We found that C4da presynaptic terminals overexpressing Abl-K417N were indistinguishable from wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>), indicating that Abl kinase activity is required. Consistent with the idea that Abl kinase activation is important, expression of a constitutively active form of Abl, BCR-Abl, led to extremely exuberant overgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that Abl is sufficient to promote presynaptic terminal growth and that the extent to which Abl instructs presynaptic terminal growth is related to Abl kinase activation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05196.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dscam requires Abl to promote presynaptic terminal growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>E</bold>) Abl is sufficient to cause presynaptic terminal overgrowth in C4da neurons.

Abl can be activated by binding to specific proteins, such as the cytoplasmic domains of membrane receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bradley and Koleske, 2009</xref>). In contrast to the exuberant presynaptic terminal overgrowth caused by Dscam overexpression in C4da neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, middle), overexpressing a mutant form of Dscam that lacked most of the cytoplasmic domain (DscamΔCyto) did not cause presynaptic terminal overgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom). DscamΔCyto was trafficked to the axon terminals and expressed at a similar level to full-length Dscam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that the cytoplasmic domain is required for Dscam to instruct presynaptic terminal growth.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05196.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dscam binds to Abl through its cytoplasmic domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The cytoplasmic domain of Dscam is required for instructing presynaptic terminal growth.

We found that Dscam and Abl proteins co-immunoprecipitated from transfected <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider 2 (S2) cells expressing these two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, second lane from right). In contrast, DscamΔCyto did not co-immunoprecipitate Abl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, furthest right lane). These results suggest that Dscam and Abl proteins form a complex through Dscam's cytoplasmic domain. Next, to test the in vivo interaction of Dscam and Abl in presynaptic terminals specifically, we determined whether Abl localization in presynaptic terminals was altered by the expression of Dscam or DscamΔCyto (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). When expressed alone or with DscamΔCyto::GFP, Abl::Myc was diffusely distributed in the presynaptic terminals, with little colocalization with DscamΔCyto::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, middle and bottom). However, when expressed with Dscam::GFP, Abl::Myc became more punctate and clearly colocalized with Dscam::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, top). We used Manders' Correlation Coefficients to quantify the colocalization of Dscam::GFP and Abl::Myc. Colocalization analysis revealed a significant increase in both M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, bottom right) when Abl::Myc was coexpressed with Dscam::GFP as compared to when Abl::Myc was coexpressed with DscamΔCyto::GFP, where M<sub>1</sub> represents the fraction of Abl that overlaps with Dscam, and M<sub>2</sub> represents the fraction of Dscam that overlaps with Abl. These findings support the idea that Abl and Dscam interact in presynaptic terminals in vivo.</p><p>Do increased Dscam levels activate Abl kinase? In mammals, autophosphorylation of Abl at tyrosines 245 and 412 (Y245 and Y412) stabilizes the active conformation of the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brasher and Van Etten, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tanis et al., 2003</xref>). As a result, phospho-specific antibodies raised against Y412 have been employed to detect active Abl kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brasher and Van Etten, 2000</xref>). This approach has been used successfully to recognize the phosphorylation of the corresponding tyrosines (Y539/522) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as an assay for Abl kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stevens et al., 2008</xref>). Since the ability of Abl to instruct presynaptic terminal growth relies on Abl kinase activity, we tested whether Dscam activates Abl using a phosho-Y412-Abl (p-Abl) antibody. We found that Abl kinase activation was significantly increased (2.6 fold) when Abl and Dscam were co-expressed in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, unlike wild-type Dscam, DscamΔCyto did not increase Abl kinase activation. In fact, it appears to act as a dominant-negative, as Abl activity was significantly decreased from control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right). As a negative control, no signal was detected when the kinase-dead Abl-K417N was blotted with p-Abl antibody in the same assay, suggesting that our assay specifically reported Abl activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that Dscam enhances Abl kinase activity. To investigate whether the same is true in presynaptic terminals in vivo, we devised a novel method of reporting Abl activation specifically in C4da presynaptic terminals. To achieve this, we used a previously reported probe that reports Abl activity, Pickles2.31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mizutani et al., 2010</xref>). Pickles2.31 is composed of a fragment of a characteristic Abl substrate, CrkL, sandwiched between the fluorescent proteins Venus and enhanced CFP (ECFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). It has previously been reported that activated Abl phosphorylates Pickles2.31 on the Y207 residue of the CrkL fragment, which can be detected with an antibody against CrkL-phospho-Y207 (p-CrkL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mizutani et al., 2010</xref>). After expressing Pickles2.31 specifically in C4da neurons with the <italic>ppk</italic>-Gal4 driver, we dissected the larval CNS and immunoprecipitated Pickles2.31 from the lysates. Since the cell bodies of C4da neurons reside in the body wall, using only the larval CNS allowed us to monitor Pickles2.31 phosphorylation only in the C4da neuron presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We found that overexpression of Dscam in C4da neurons led to an increase in Y207 phosphorylation of Pickles2.31 in the presynaptic terminals, while overexpression of DscamΔCyto was indistinguishable from control (mCD8-mRFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Consistent with the notion that Pickles2.31 is an Abl activity indicator, overexpression of BCR-Abl led to a robust increase in phospho-Y207 levels as compared to the control. These results suggest that Dscam activates Abl both in culture and in C4da presynaptic terminals in vivo, and that this activation requires the cytoplasmic domain of Dscam.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05196.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Dscam activates Abl kinase in culture and in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dscam activates Abl in cultured S2 cells.

Phosphorylation of Pickles2.31 by Abl can be detected with an anti-phospho-Y207-CrkL (p-CrkL) antibody. (<bold>C</bold>) Schematic of in vivo assay for detecting Abl activity in C4da presynaptic terminals. Pickles2.31 is specifically expressed in C4da neurons. As can be appreciated from the larval fillet diagram (left), the cell bodies and dendrites of C4da neurons reside in the larval body wall while their presynaptic terminals reside in the CNS. To assay Abl activity only in presynaptic terminals, larval CNS are dissected out and solubilized into lysates. Pickles2.31 in the presynaptic terminals is then immunoprecipitated with an anti-Venus antibody (left). After running on an SDS-PAGE gel, Pickles2.31 expression level can be assayed using an anti-Venus antibody, while the phosphorylation of Y207, a proxy for Abl activity level, can be ascertained by western blotting with a p-CrkL antibody. (<bold>D</bold>) Dscam activates Abl in presynaptic terminals in vivo. Overexpression of BCR-Abl leads to a robust increase in p-CrkL staining of Pickles2.31 when compared to the mCD8-mRFP control. Similarly, overexpression of Dscam leads to consistent, though less extreme, increase in p-CrkL when compared to control. In contrast, overexpression of DscamΔCyto is indistinguishable from the mCD8-mRFP control.

Abl is a well-established target for treating chronic myeloid leukemia, and there are multiple Abl inhibitors that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As a proof-of-concept experiment, we attempted to rescue the developmental defects caused by Dscam overexpression using Abl inhibitors. We first tested nilotinib, which is a FDA-approved second-generation Abl kinase inhibitor that can cross the blood–brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Weisberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hebron et al., 2013</xref>). Using cultured S2 cells overexpressing Abl, we found that nilotinib robustly inhibited <italic>Drosophila</italic> Abl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Based on these results, we tested whether administration of nilotinib to developing larvae could rescue the effects of increased Dscam expression in C4da presynaptic terminals in vivo. To do this, we performed MARCM to visualize single C4da neurons in animals fed nilotinib or vehicle and assessed presynaptic terminal length. While overexpression of Dscam caused increased (152%) presynaptic terminal length in animals fed vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>), the effect was significantly rescued (to 115% of control) by feeding the animals with nilotinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,E</xref>). Consistent with the idea that these effects were due to inhibition of Abl activity rather than a reduction in Dscam expression, nilotinib did not change the expression of the Dscam transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05196.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Pharmacological inhibition of Abl mitigates the neuronal defects caused by increased Dscam expression in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nilotinib inhibits <italic>Drosophila</italic> Abl kinase.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We note key findings of the paper which show that loss of Abl kinase can reduce presynaptic terminal overgrowth caused by DsCAM overexpression, DsCAM intracellular domain can interact and activate Abl kinase and in particular that an FDA approved Abl inhibitor nilotinib can reduce presynaptic overgrowth caused by DsCAM overexpression or in fly <italic>dFMRP</italic> mutants, which also show increased Dscam expression. An added significance of the work therefore is the potential translational application of Abl inhibitors in treatment of neurological disorders.</p><p><italic>General assessment:</italic></p><p>CNS phenotypes for <italic>Dscam</italic> loss or misexpression had been explored in prior work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al. (2008)</xref> showed that loss of both Dscam and its paralog Dscam3 result in CNS midline crossing defects, and that overexpression of Dscam results in ectopic midline crossings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yu et al. (2009)</xref> showed that RNAi knockdown of Dscam resulted in morphogenesis defects as well as commissureless phenotypes. However, the effects of <italic>Dscam</italic> loss at axon terminals growth does not appear to have been demonstrated. Overall, this is a well-written and interesting study with some exciting results linking Dscam to a key axonal signalling molecule, even if some aspects of the work are at a preliminary stage.</p><p>The conclusion that Abl kinase activity is a relevant output of Dscam in determining presynaptic arbor size is supported by a convincing set of experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (and supplements), and this is a real strength of the manuscript. Given how little is known about signal transduction downstream of Dscam, this is significant. Further, the observation that Dscam signaling in regulating presynaptic arbor size and dendrite self-avoidance involves different molecular mechanisms is an interesting discovery. The studies demonstrating that Dscam can interact with Abl and promote Abl activation in S2 cells support the model that Dscam modulates Abl activity in neurons, but demonstrating the interaction in neurons would substantially improve the manuscript. Finally, the authors convincingly show that the Abl pharmacological inhibitor nilotinib can suppress presynaptic arbor overgrowth induced by Dscam or FMRP mutation, but the mechanism of action is unclear. The following substantive concerns need to be addressed.</p><p><italic>Substantive concerns:</italic></p><p>1a) A principal concern is that data for in vivo specificity of nilotinib on Abl are not convincing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> is not interpretable without controls, such as <italic>abl(lf)</italic> and <italic>abl(CA)</italic> or DsCAM overexpression. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-H</xref>, the analyses on the neuronal phenotypes in flies fed with nilotinib are surprisingly limited or selective. The value of using a fly model to test potential drug targets is that we can gain a full understanding of any possible off-target or side effects. Thus, it is equally important that they show other aspects of the neurons and animal health etc. are, or are not, affected by the drug treatment. Moreover, one can't find any data showing how the dose of nilotinib treatment, which would be highly relevant for any further interests in translational application, was decided.</p><p>1b) The specificity of the inhibitor is not discussed (or examined). Nilotinib inhibits a number of tyrosine kinases and appears to broadly inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation in larvae. The assertion that the effects on presynaptic arbor size reflect inhibition of Abl activation is not convincing. Do other small molecule inhibitors of Abl exist that have a more targeted effect (i.e., they don't broadly block tyrosine kinases) and if so, do they similarly affect presynaptic arbor growth?</p><p>1c) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The specificity of nilotinib to Abl in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is not verified. The decrease in phospho-tyrosine in 3b demonstrates a general decrease in the CNS, and does not necessarily show a specific targeting of Abl. This must be addressed. To demonstrate specificity, a possible experiment is to repeat the experiment shown in 3B in flies that are mutated in the Abl phosphorylation site Tyr412, or simply null for Abl. If nilotinib is specific to blocking phospho-Abl, there should be no difference in p-Tyr levels whether or not nilotinib is added, if Abl phospho-sites are blocked or Abl is missing. However, if addition of nilotinib still results in a decrease in p-Tyr even when Abl phospho-sites are blocked, this suggests nilotinib is having an effect on the catalytic activity of other kinases.</p><p>2a) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. What is the effect of nilotinib treatment in wild-type flies? The results of wild type + nilotinib can be shown in addition to the experiments in 3c-g. It would be very reassuring to see that nilotinib elicits <italic>abl</italic>-like phenotypes in other parts of the nervous system or elsewhere (e.g. epithelial development in the embryo)—if the drug is selectively blocking Abl, it should phenocopy <italic>abl</italic> mutants, but not mutants in other kinases.</p><p>2b) What is the effect of drug treatment on presynaptic arbor size in a wild type background? It's impossible to evaluate the experimental results without this control.</p><p>3a) The data presented suggest that Dscam can associate with Abl and promote Abl phosphorylation, but this is not demonstrated in vivo.</p><p>3b) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The results shown in panel 2B and 2C demonstrate binding of Abl to the cytoplasmic domain of Dscam in S2 cells using transfected constructs and levels of expression that may contribute to detection of non-physiological interaction. This is important because the fraction of the input pool that IPs with Dscam in cells overexpressing both proteins is rather low. More importantly, they do not show that this binding occurs in vivo, and that even if it does occur in vivo, that this binding is important to axon terminal growth in particular. To determine the role of Abl-Dscam binding in vivo the group should consider performing fluorescence tagging and/or immunolocalization of Abl in the three genetic backgrounds shown in panel 2A (WT, Dscam::GFP OE, Dscam cyto::GFP OE). If there is a bona fide interaction with Dscam at the terminal, co-localization of Abl with Dscam::GFP should be observed. Moreover, if this interaction requires Dscam cytoplasmic domain, expression of Dscam cyto::GFP instead of full- length Dscam should result in a re-distribution of Abl.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. The text (second paragraph of the Results section) and the figure legend state that Abl overexpression leads to a pre-synaptic overgrowth phenotype. However, while a defect in the axons is apparent in panel 1B, it is not clear whether this is due to increased growth necessarily. For example, the gross defects could result from fasciculation defects between axons as they enter the CNS neuropil. Indeed, the apparent decrease in mRFP signal intensity in the Abl OE flies raise the possibility that it is not overgrowth, but defasiculation, that is observed in 1B. This is important because Abl has been linked to many receptors/adhesion molecules that may also contribute to the normal neuropil structure for sensory terminals. Abl nulls are not shown to confirm that the phenotypes are only selective to overexpression.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, general comment. All axon terminal phenotypes shown are for Dscam OE. While <italic>Dscam</italic> loss phenotypes have been shown in other systems (e.g. midline crossing), it has not been demonstrated for terminal growth. It would be useful to include data on the effects of <italic>Dscam</italic> loss at the synaptic terminal, as well as genetic experiments on the interaction between <italic>Dscam</italic> and <italic>abl</italic> loss of function alleles (as has been done in other systems). If the two genes are in one pathway for sensory terminal growth, then the double null should be indistinguishable from the single mutants. It is curious that Abl mutant terminals look relatively normal. Does this mean that Abl is not required for other receptors or DSCAM under normal expression levels?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A</xref>. Dscam-GFP levels in the neuronal soma is shown to be unchanged in <italic>abl</italic> mutants. However, the observations in the cell body do not rule out the possibility that at the synapse, <italic>abl</italic> loss could have effects on Dscam levels, perhaps due to changes in Dscam protein trafficking (Abl has been implicated in axon transport by Bill Saxton). Just because <italic>abl</italic> nulls revert the Dscam OE phenotype, this doesn't prove a downstream function. Abl can be required upstream of Dscam at the synapse. To test this, a parallel analysis of Dscam-GFP could be done at axon terminals to verify that the effect of <italic>abl</italic> is the same both in the soma and at the presynaptic terminal.</p><p>7) The <italic>abl C4da</italic> dendritic phenotype analysis should be added to the supplemental figures.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. There are no data confirming the stability of the Dscam cytoplasmic domain deletion. In fact the recovery in the IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) is very poor and raises the concern that this receptor mutant is not capable of accumulating to the same concentration in the OE experiment, which could explain the lack of an in vivo OE phenotype in a way that does not support requirement of the Cyto domain. Moreover, why is full-length Dscam detected as a doublet? Can this be explained by cleavage, phosphorylation, etc.?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05196.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1a) A principal concern is that data for in vivo specificity of nilotinib on Abl are not convincing.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref> <italic>is not interpretable without controls, such as</italic> abl(lf) <italic>and</italic> abl(CA) <italic>or DsCAM overexpression.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C-H</italic></xref><italic>, the analyses on the neuronal phenotypes in flies fed with nilotinib are surprisingly limited or selective.

Moreover, one can't find any data showing how the dose of nilotinib treatment, which would be highly relevant for any further interests in translational application, was decided</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ critiques. Following up on the reviewers’ suggestions, we have investigated the in vivo specificity of nilotinib on Abl with several experiments. The results strongly support that the effect of nilotinib on Dscam-induced presynaptic arbor growth is through Abl. In addition, we have addressed the issue of off-targets in our response to comment #1b). In the initial submission, we presented <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> to show the accessibility of nilotinib into central nervous system in fly, rather than to show the specificity of nilotinib. We apologize for the confusion, and have removed the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> to avoid the confusion.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have included the analysis of the viability of flies fed either vehicle (DMSO) or nilotinib (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>), which shows no difference between the two groups. Furthermore, we have analyzed C4da dendrite development in flies treated with nilotinib and found no difference between DMSO- and nilotinib-treated larvae (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that the nilotinib concentration required for rescuing axonal phenotypes does not cause any severe side effects. Together with known clinical safety of nilotinib (Kantarjian et al 2011. nilotinib is effective in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase after imatinib resistance orintolerance: 24-month follow-up results Blood 117 (4), 1141-1145), these results show the therapeutic potential of nilotinib.</p><p>In the revised manuscript (in the subsection headed “Drug treatment of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae and S2 cells”), we have explained how the dose of nilotinib (and bafetinib) for treating larvae was selected. The dose was the highest concentration (among various concentrations tested) that was tolerated by the larvae without displaying any toxic responses.</p><p><italic>1b) The specificity of the inhibitor is not discussed (or examined). Nilotinib inhibits a number of tyrosine kinases and appears to broadly inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation in larvae. The assertion that the effects on presynaptic arbor size reflect inhibition of Abl activation is not convincing. Do other small molecule inhibitors of Abl exist that have a more targeted effect (i.e., they don't broadly block tyrosine kinases) and if so, do they similarly affect presynaptic arbor growth?</italic></p><p>The reviewers are correct that, depending on the concentration, nilotinib also inhibits several other targets. We have added a discussion on nilotinib specificity in the revised manuscript (pleas see the Results and Discussion section). In addition, we tested another Abl inhibitor, bafetinib, which has a chemical scaffold different from nilotinib. This compound is also known to cross blood-brain barrier in mice. We found that the administration of bafetinib, like nilotinib, was able to significantly rescue axon terminal length in larvae overexpressing Dscam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>). The known off-targets of nilotinib in mammals are c-Kit, PDGFR, Arg, NQ02, and DDR1, while those of bafetinib are Fyn and Lyn. Since the off-targets of these two drugs are different, their common effect on Dscam-induced axon terminal growth is likely through Abl inhibition. Furthermore, we treated the larvae overexpressing Dscam in homozygous <italic>abl</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neurons and found that the nilotinib treatment did not further decrease size of presynaptic arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, even though nilotinib also inhibits several other tyrosine kinases, its effect of rescuing enlarged presynaptic arbors is through Abl inhibition.</p><p><italic>1c)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>. The specificity of nilotinib to Abl in Drosophila is not verified. The decrease in phospho-tyrosine in 3b demonstrates a general decrease in the CNS, and does not necessarily show a specific targeting of Abl. This must be addressed. To demonstrate specificity, a possible experiment is to repeat the experiment shown in 3B in flies that are mutated in the Abl phosphorylation site Tyr412, or simply null for Abl. If nilotinib is specific to blocking phospho-Abl, there should be no difference in p-Tyr levels whether or not nilotinib is added, if Abl phospho-sites are blocked or Abl is missing. However, if addition of nilotinib still results in a decrease in p-Tyr even when Abl phospho-sites are blocked, this suggests nilotinib is having an effect on the catalytic activity of other kinases</italic>.</p><p>We again apologize for the confusion caused by previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, which was to evaluate the accessibility of nilotinib into central nervous system in fly rather than the specificity of nilotinib treatment. In agreement with that nilotinib has off-targets, we found that Abl inhibition is not the main cause of the decrease in overall tyrosine phosphorylation in larval brain upon nilotinib treatment. The extent of the decrease in overall tyrosine phosphorylation persists even when nilotinib was fed to homozygous <italic>Abl</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants (data not shown).</p><p>Nevertheless, as we explained in the response to comment #1b), we have performed additional experiments to demonstrate the rescuing effect of nilotinib on Dscam-induced overgrowth of presynaptic arbors is due to the inhibition of Abl. We have also added a discussion of nilotinib specificity in the revised manuscript (please see the Results and Discussion section).</p><p><italic>2a)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>. What is the effect of nilotinib treatment in wild-type flies? The results of wild type + nilotinib can be shown in addition to the experiments in 3c-g. It would be very reassuring to see that nilotinib elicits</italic> abl<italic>-like phenotypes in other parts of the nervous system or elsewhere (e.g. epithelial development in the embryo)—if the drug is selectively blocking Abl, it should phenocopy</italic> abl <italic>mutants, but not mutants in other kinases</italic>.</p><p>Although Abl is involved in multiple processes in embryonic development, we do not expect to observe similar severity of phenotypes in nilotinib-treated animals as <italic>abl</italic> mutant. This is because nilotinib was administrated through food and was thus not accessible to the animal until embryonic development is completed. Moreover, the nilotinib treatment in our experiments likely partially inhibited Abl activity for three reasons. First, the efficacy of presynaptic arbor rescue in Dscam overexpressing neurons was partial as compared to the complete rescue achieved by homozygous <italic>Abl</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutations (compare new <underline>Figure 4B-G</underline> with new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F-K and O</xref>). Second, the same dose of nilotinib almost completely rescued presynaptic arbor enlargement in <italic>FMRP</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants while reducing only 50% of <italic>Abl</italic> gene dosage was sufficient for the same extent of rescue (compare new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-C and 4G-H</xref> with new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L-N and 1P</xref>). Third, homozygous mutation of <italic>abl</italic> causes pupal lethality (or embryonic lethality when <italic>abl</italic> is mutated maternally) while nilotinib treatment at the concentration used does not affect fly development through adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, Abl is known to have kinase-independent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henkemeyer et al. 1990</xref>. A novel tyrosine kinase-independent function of <italic>Drosophila abl</italic> correlates with proper subcellular localization. Cell 63:949-960), so even if nilotinib were capable of inhibiting all Abl kinase activity, we would not expect to see identical phenotypes as <italic>abl</italic> mutants.</p><p>We have performed additional experiments whose results support the conclusion that the effects of nilotinib on presynaptic arbor growth is through Abl inhibition (see the response to comment #1b). Our new results also demonstrate that the nilotinib concentration used in this study does not affect neuronal and animal development (see the response to comment #1a). Therefore, although nilotinib does not only inhibit Abl, its inhibition of Abl kinase is responsible for mitigating the presynaptic terminal overgrowth caused by dysregulated Dscam.</p><p><italic>2b) What is the effect of drug treatment on presynaptic arbor size in a wild type background? It's impossible to evaluate the experimental results without this control</italic>.</p><p>We have performed the experiment and added in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. There is no difference in axon terminal length between wild-type flies treated with vehicle (DMSO) and with nilotinib (for the statistics see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p><italic>3a) The data presented suggest that Dscam can associate with Abl and promote Abl phosphorylation, but this is not demonstrated in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We have performed two additional experiments to address this concern. The new results are presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 and 3</xref>.</p><p>First, to test if Dscam and Abl associate in vivo we expressed Dscam::GFP or DscamΔCyto::GFP along with Abl::Myc in C4da neurons, and then analyzed the extent that Dscam and Abl::Myc colocalized in C4da axon terminals (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results support the notion that Abl binds to Dscam in vivo in axon terminals.</p><p>Second, to determine whether Dscam promotes Abl phosphorylation in vivo, we developed a novel method that reports Abl activation only in the axon terminals of C4da neurons in vivo (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). We specifically expressed a probe that reports Abl activity in C4da neurons. Since the cell bodies of C4da neurons reside in the body wall, in the larval CNS this probe is only present in the axon terminals of C4da neurons. The Abl activity probe was then immunoprecipitated from the larval CNS after dissection. The phosphorylation state of the Abl target site in the probe was monitored with western blotting by using a phospho-specific antibody. Compared to a negative control transgene, expression of Dscam led to an increase in probe phosphorylation while DscamΔCyto did not (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that Dscam activates Abl in vivo and that this activation requires the Dscam cytoplasmic domain.</p><p><italic>3b)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>. The results shown in panel 2B and 2C demonstrate binding of Abl to the cytoplasmic domain of Dscam in S2 cells using transfected constructs and levels of expression that may contribute to detection of non-physiological interaction.

The text (second paragraph of the Results section) and the figure legend state that Abl overexpression leads to a pre-synaptic overgrowth phenotype. However, while a defect in the axons is apparent in panel 1B, it is not clear whether this is due to increased growth necessarily. For example, the gross defects could result from fasciculation defects between axons as they enter the CNS neuropil.

This is important because Abl has been linked to many receptors/adhesion molecules that may also contribute to the normal neuropil structure for sensory terminals. Abl nulls are not shown to confirm that the phenotypes are only selective to overexpression.</italic></p><p>In the abdominal segments 5-8 (A5-A8), the axon terminals of the three C4da neurons in each hemi-segment consist of an anterior projection that extends within one segment length. These axon terminals form a fascicle that connects two adjacent neuropils. Between the axon entry points of abdominal segment 5 and 6, fewer than three connectives were typically observed (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (Wang, et al., 2014, PLOS Biology 11 (6). e1001572). Both BCR-Abl and Abl overexpression caused thickened bundle of connectives in the C4da neuropil ladder (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). We have quantified the number of connectives between the neuropil of abdominal segment 5(A5) and that of A6 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The results clearly showed an overgrowth phenotype as opposed to a defasciculation phenotype because overexpression of Abl/BCR-Abl led to a significant increase in the number of connectives when compared to wild-type. The increase in the number of connectives could either arise from increased axon branches from neurons in the same segment or overextended axons from other segments.</p><p>This particular assay is only useful for analyzing striking changes in axon growth, as single axon terminals cannot be distinguished. <italic>Abl</italic> null mutants were not shown since the decrease in axon terminal growth is subtle and would not be visible when all C4da axon terminals are imaged together.

Can this be explained by cleavage, phosphorylation, etc</italic>.<italic>?</italic></p><p>Thank you for making us aware that this point needed clarification. We have analyzed the expression and presence of this <italic>Dscam</italic> mutant, which is GFP-tagged, in axon terminals. The new result is shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>. When stained and imaged simultaneously, Dscam-GFP and DscamΔCyto-GFP are present in the axon terminals at comparable levels. In addition, we saw robust axon terminal overgrowth in the Dscam condition but never saw any change in axon terminal growth in the DscamΔCyto condition.</p><p>We believe that the lower molecular weight band of the doublet in old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> is a degradation product. This is supported by the lack of this doublet under essentially identical transfection conditions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
