Here, we present and validate a computational method to predict cohesin-and-CTCF binding sites that form intra-TAD DNA loops. The intra-TAD loop anchors identified are structurally indistinguishable from TAD anchors regarding binding partners, sequence conservation, and resistance to cohesin knockdown; further, the intra-TAD loops retain key functional features of TADs, including chromatin contact insulation, blockage of repressive histone mark spread, and ubiquity across tissues. We propose that intra-TAD loops form by the same loop extrusion mechanism as the larger TAD loops, and that their shorter length enables finer regulatory control in restricting enhancer-promoter interactions, which enables selective, high-level expression of gene targets of super-enhancers and genes located within repressive nuclear compartments. These findings elucidate the role of intra-TAD cohesin-and-CTCF binding in nuclear organization associated with widespread insulation of distal enhancer activity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34077.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human genome contains the complete set of DNA instructions – including all genes – needed to build and maintain an organism. To fit all of this genetic information in the cell’s nucleus, the DNA is neatly wrapped around so-called histone proteins, which help to package the genetic material into chromatin, which forms thread-like structures, the chromosomes.</p><p>Chromatin is further folded into large DNA loops held together by an anchor protein, CTCF, and by a second protein, cohesin, whose ring-shaped structure ties each loop at its base. DNA segments that are within the same loop may interact frequently, whereas those outside the loop rarely do. Many of these large DNA loops are further pinched off into sub-loops. These sub-loops may help a cell fine-tune whether a gene needs to be turned on or off by limiting the contact between genes and the DNA regions that regulate the activity of genes.</p><p>Knowing where these DNA sub-loop are located is very important for understanding how each gene is controlled. However, this can be very costly to determine, and therefore, is only known for a few cell types. Now, Matthews and Waxman tackle this issue by creating a computer model that can correctly predict many of these sub-loops. The method used experimental data obtained from mouse liver cells to identify the locations of CTCF and cohesin.</p><p>The results showed that DNA sub-loops in the liver cells can shield genes from regulatory DNA segments outside the looped area. For example, a small sub-loop that contains a single gene related to obesity is highly active, even though the large DNA loop containing the sub-loop is an otherwise inactive gene region. Similarly, certain genes critical for liver function are positioned within sub-loops containing DNA regions that greatly enhance the gene activity in liver cells. This allows the selected genes to be highly active – unlike other genes that are close by but outside the sub-loop.</p><p>This new approach will make it easier and cheaper to discover DNA loops and sub-loops across the genome. A better knowledge of where these loops form may also allow us to better understand how genes are turned on and off in different types of cells, and in response to biological stimuli or environmental stresses. This may also help understand and treat conditions that arise from mutations that disrupt the boundaries of DNA loops or sub-loops, which can allow certain DNA segments to activate the wrong genes and can lead to developmental defects and diseases such as cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin domains</kwd><kwd>compartmentalization</kwd><kwd>nuclear organization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK33765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waxman</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1247312</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matthews</surname><given-names>Bryan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES024421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waxman</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Certain types of 3D chromatin loops are easy to predict from existing or easily obtainable 2D information, which benefits gene expression studies in tissues/cells/organisms without extensive pre-existing 3D information.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian genome is organized into stereotypical domains, averaging ~700 kb in length, called Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nora et al., 2012</xref>). TADs are insulated chromatin domains whose genomic boundaries are often retained across tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>) and have been conserved during mammalian evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vietri Rudan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dixon et al., 2015</xref>). TADs provide a stable genomic architecture that constrains enhancer-promoter contacts, while allowing for dynamic tissue-specific interactions that stimulate gene expression within TADs, thereby linking chromatin structure and positioning to gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dowen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sexton et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Hi-C, an unbiased genome-wide chromosome conformation capture method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>), identifies TADs based on their insulation from inter-domain interactions and by the increased frequency of intra-domain interactions that occurs within individual TADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nora et al., 2012</xref>). TADs show substantial overlap with features of nuclear organization identified using other approaches, including replication domains, lamina-associated domains, and A/B chromatin compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dixon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pope et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nora et al., 2013</xref>). TADs impact gene expression by insulation, which limits a given gene’s access to regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le Dily et al., 2014</xref>). While TAD structures are often shared across tissues within a species, some individual TADs show tissue-specific differences in their spatial positioning within the nucleus, and in their overall activity, transcription factor (TF) binding patterns, and patterns of expression of individual genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dixon et al., 2015</xref>). It is unclear to what extent these large megabase-scale chromatin structures exert regulatory control over the multiple, often variably-expressed, genes found within their boundaries.</p><p>Two key protein factors, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and the multi-subunit cohesin complex, are the primary architects of nuclear organization in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ong and Corces, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). CTCF and cohesin cooperatively engage genomic DNA via a loop extrusion complex, which is dynamically mobile within TAD boundaries and may help organize TAD structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fudenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). CTCF is an 11 zinc finger protein that stably binds DNA and can serve as an insulating enhancer-blocker and a modulator of 3D chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Phillips and Corces, 2009</xref>). Sites bound by both cohesin and CTCF (cohesin-and-CTCF (CAC) sites) are associated with insulator function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dowen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zuin et al., 2014</xref>) and are found at TAD boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nora et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, sites bound by cohesin but not CTCF (cohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) sites) are found at tissue-specific promoters and enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kagey et al., 2010</xref>) and may help to stabilize large TF complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faure et al., 2012</xref>). CAC complexes are also associated with topoisomerase-IIβ (Top2b), which presumably relieves the torsional strain of the extrusion complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Uusküla-Reimand et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Complete knockout of either CTCF or cohesin is embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heath et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">White et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2010</xref>), whereas partial depletion of CTCF or cohesin results in altered gene expression but has more limited phenotypic impact, increasing radiation sensitivity, DNA repair defects, and cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ong and Corces, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore et al., 2012</xref>). Complete removal of CTCF or cohesin-related factors, achieved using inducible degradation systems, leads to a complete loss of virtually all loop structures in a highly dosage-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwarzer et al., 2017</xref>). Mutations affecting CAC loop anchors are frequently seen in cancer and lead to dysregulation of adjacent genes, evidencing the functionality of these loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ji et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katainen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fujimoto et al., 2016</xref>). However, there are many more CAC sites within TADs than at TAD boundaries, and it is not clear what factors differentiate loop-forming CAC sites at TAD boundaries from other CAC sites in the genome.</p><p>Chromatin interactions can be studied by Hi-C analysis, which under standard conditions provides a resolution of 25–100 kb and has been used to study nuclear organization at the level of megabase-scale TAD structures. However, high resolution Hi-C datasets obtained using extreme deep sequencing (&gt;25 billion reads) have led to two key discoveries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). First, ~90% of DNA loops (‘loop domains’, defined as local peaks in the Hi-C contact matrix) are associated with both CTCF binding and cohesin binding, and 92% of such loops involve inwardly oriented CTCF anchors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, loop anchors are bound at asymmetric CTCF motifs that face the loop interior. This previously unappreciated feature of CTCF loops facilitates the identification of such loops <italic>in silico</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oti et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, expression of neighboring genes changes in a predictable manner when CTCF anchors are inverted or deleted by CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dowen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). Second, extreme deep sequencing Hi-C studies identify a much larger number of shorter loops than previously recognized (~10,000 loops with a median size of 185 kb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2014</xref>), many of which represent complex nested structures (e.g., isolated cliques) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>). The ability to distinguish between such substructures has led to predictions ranging from 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> loops per genome, depending on the 3C-based analysis method and the cutoff values employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Handoko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fullwood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 2013</xref>). The presence of nested loop structures may be a general feature of topological nuclear organization, and the ability to detect such structures is dependent on the method, resolution, and computational approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Handoko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fullwood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hnisz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weinreb and Raphael, 2016</xref>).</p><p>While sub topologies within TADs have been observed, it is unknown whether those interactions represent enhancer-promoter loops or other looped structures, and whether they are mediated by cohesin, mediator, or other architectural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zuin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sofueva et al., 2013</xref>). Short,&lt;200 kb CTCF-anchored loops, termed chromatin contact domains or super-enhancer domains, have been identified in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) by ChIA-PET experiments that select for CTCF and cohesin binding sites (via immunoprecipitation of Smc1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Handoko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tang et al., 2015</xref>), and are enriched for tissue-specific genes and enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dowen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Handoko et al., 2011</xref>). However, these genomic regions represent a minority of CTCF-anchored DNA loops, and likely do not fully represent all of the nuclear topological domains evident in high resolution Hi-C maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rowley et al., 2017</xref>). Given the inability to identify CAC-anchored intra-TAD loops from standard, low resolution Hi-C data, we sought to build on the above advances and develop a computational method to predict such subTAD-scale loops by using only 2D (CTCF and cohesin ChIP-seq binding activity) and 1D (CTCF motif orientation) information. Here we define intra-TAD loops anchored by cohesin and CTCF, and that contain at least one gene, which represent a superset encompassing super-enhancer and polycomb domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dowen et al., 2014</xref>). These CAC-mediated intra-TAD loops are mechanistically distinct from short range enhancer-promoter loops, and from longer range genomic compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwarzer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stevens et al., 2017</xref>), whose impact on gene expression in mouse liver is also discussed.</p><p>Here we present, and then validate in three mouse tissues and two human cell lines, a computational method to identify intra-TAD loops genome-wide. We elucidate the structural and functional features of the intra-TAD loops identified, and those of the better-established TADs, including their impact on gene expression in a mouse liver model. We show that, mechanistically, intra-TAD loops are anchored by loop extrusion CAC complexes that are shared across tissues and show strong conservation. Further, we demonstrate that, at a functional level, intra-TAD loops insulate repressive chromatin mark spread and thereby enable selective expression of genes at a high level compared to their immediate genomic neighbors, notably genes targeted by super-enhancers, and genes that are otherwise found in repressive nuclear compartments. These findings reveal how intra-TAD loops harness many of the same mechanisms as TAD-scale loops but in ways that allow for greater local control of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Features of TADs and their functional impact on gene expression</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Features associated with TAD boundaries</title><p>We characterized TADs identified in mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vietri Rudan et al., 2015</xref>) using matched ChIP-seq datasets for CTCF and the cohesin subunit Rad21, which we obtained for a group of individual adult male mouse livers.

Next, we explored the impact of cohesin depletion on CAC sites associated with TAD boundaries, following up on the finding that many cohesin binding sites are maintained upon knockout or knockdown of components of the cohesin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faure et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows the distribution of cohesin-bound regions that are either resistant or sensitive to haploinsufficiency of the cohesin subunit Rad21 in hepatocytes, or to knockout of the cohesin subunit Stag1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In both cell types, sites resistant to cohesin loss are enriched at TAD boundaries, while those sensitive to cohesin loss are more equally distributed along the TAD length. This may explain the unexpected finding that domains and compartments are largely maintained after depletion of cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zuin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sofueva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seitan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34077.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Features of TAD boundaries and TAD insulator function.</title><p>Profiles in A-E represent a normalized aggregate count of peaks or features along the length of all TADs, sub-divided into 100 equally-sized bins per TAD, where bin #1 is the 5’ start of the TAD and bin #100 is at the TAD 3’ end.

By these dual mechanisms, TADs can exert control over tissue-specific gene expression, despite the TADs themselves being largely structurally invariant across tissues. As TADs are defined based on their insulation of chromatin contacts, we investigated their impact on chromatin mark spread. We examined four broad histone marks associated with either transcriptional repression (H3K9me3, H3K27me3) or activation (H2AK5ac, H3K36me3). We also examined Global Run-on Sequencing data to identify actively transcribed regions of the genome, as well as Lamina Associated Domain (LAD) coordinates to visualize areas of the genome associated with the nuclear periphery. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> shows a heat map representation of a 1 Mb window around each TAD boundary in mouse liver, clustered using k-means clustering (k = 4) based on H3K9me3 and H2AK5ac ChIP-seq data and on the Eigen value of the Hi-C principal component analysis (PCA), which provides an estimate of active versus inactive genomic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>).

Also shown is an example of a transitional TAD boundary on chromosome 13, where there is a shift from active to inactive chromatin marks separated by inversely-oriented CTCF binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Using the clusters shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, each TAD was designated as active, weakly active, inactive, or weakly inactive, based on the signal distribution around the boundary and the eigenvalue from Hi-C PCA analysis along the length of the TAD (see Materials and methods and listing of TADs in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Striking differences in gene expression were seen between active and inactive compartment TADs (median liver expression 1.095 FPKM for 12,258 genes in active TADs vs. 0.003 FPKM for 4643 genes in inactive TADs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>We sought to determine the tissue-specificity of the genes in active vs. inactive TADs.

Tau values close to one are highly tissue specific, while lower values (&lt;0.3) are widely expressed and considered housekeeping genes (see Materials and methods). A greater fraction of genes located in inactive TADs are tissue-specific compared to genes in active TADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Overall, only 939 (20.2%) of all 4643 genes in inactive TADs are expressed in liver (FPKM &gt;1) vs. 6,290 (51.3%) of the 12,258 genes in active TADs. Furthermore, genes whose TSS is close to a TAD boundary (i.e., TSS within 2% of the total TAD length in either direction from the boundary) tend to be less tissue specific than the genomic average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Active transcription may be a key driver of dynamic cohesin movement in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Busslinger et al., 2017</xref>), and RNA polymerase II, in vitro, is capable of translocating cohesin rings along DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the ubiquitous expression of genes at TAD boundaries could be either a driver or an initiator of loop extrusion, although the exact mechanism remains unknown.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of intra-TAD loops</title><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Predicting intra-TAD loops from TAD-internal CTCF and cohesin binding sites</title><p>While CAC sites that are tissue ubiquitous, cohesin knockdown-resistant, or species-conserved show a clear 2 to 5-fold enrichment at TAD boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), a large majority of such sites are TAD-internal and presumably do not contribute to TAD formation. Overall, only 14.7% of liver CTCF binding sites are associated with TAD boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), consistent with other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>), and only 23% of the CTCF-bound regions that retain all four of the above features are within 25 kb of a TAD boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We considered two possibilities: (1) TAD-internal CAC sites form intra-TAD loops that are too short to be detected in standard Hi-C datasets; and (2) additional factors associated with TAD boundary CTCF sites differentiate them from other such binding sites in the genome (see Discussion). To examine the first possibility, we modified an algorithm for analysis of CTCF loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oti et al., 2016</xref>) and adapted it to predict subTAD-scale loops in silico, using CTCF and cohesin peak strength and CTCF orientation as inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our approach builds on the finding that &gt;90% of CTCF-based loops are formed between inwardly-oriented CTCF sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). Each mouse liver CAC site was given a score that represents its CTCF peak strength and CTCF motif score, and an orientation was assigned based on whether the non-palindromic CTCF motif was present on the (+) strand or the (-) strand, considering the highest scoring CTCF motif at each CAC site. Scanning the genome, each (+) strand CAC peak was connected to putative downstream (-) strand CAC sites. Low scoring CAC peaks were removed and the process was iteratively repeated until the top 20,000 candidate loops remained. The set of loops was then filtered, as detailed in Materials and methods, to take into account cohesin scoring, and to ensure TSS overlap and &lt;80% TAD overlap, to restrict our definition of intra-TAD loops to TAD-internal CAC-mediated loops that contain at least one TSS. Applying this algorithm to each of 4 matched pairs of liver ChIP datasets for CTCF and cohesin, we identified a set of 9543 intra-TAD loops present in all four liver samples, with a median length of 151 kb. The set of intra-TAD loops identified includes many nested loops, and differs substantially from the generally shorter and much larger number of CTCF loops predicted by the original algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oti et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; see Materials and methods). Functionally, anchors of the shorter loops predicted using the method of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oti et al., 2016</xref>) show less insulation and weaker directional interactions than the intra-TAD loop anchors identified in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>; also see below). Moreover, 91% of our predicted intra-TAD loops were wholly contained within a single TAD, versus only 67% for a random shuffled control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> illustrates intra-TAD loop structures within TADs along a segment of chromosome two and highlights their substantial overlap with ‘CTCF-CTCF’ DNA loops identified by ChIA-PET analysis of cohesin-mediated interactions in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) using antibodies to the cohesin subunit Smc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dowen et al., 2014</xref>). The final set of 9543 liver intra-TAD loops includes 1632 intra-TAD loops (17.1%) that share one CTCF loop anchor with a TAD boundary (i.e., an intra-TAD loop nested in a TAD with a potential shared anchor). Consistent with these findings, high resolution Hi-C data in mouse CH12 cells reveals the presence of single, multiple, and more complex nested intra-TAD loops that were predicted in mouse liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34077.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Predicted intra-TAD loop anchors share many properties of TAD anchors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram illustrating intra-TAD loop prediction based on CTCF motif orientation and CTCF and cohesin (Rad21) ChIP-seq binding strength data.

While ‘Other CAC’ sites tend to be weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, below), 93% are bound by CTCF in at least one other mouse tissue, and 66% were verified in at least six other tissues.

Results show that a large majority of intra-TAD loop anchors are bound by CTCF in at least 10 of the 15 mouse tissues examined. Indeed, CTCF binding at the TAD-internal intra-TAD loop anchors is more deeply conserved across mouse tissues than that at TAD boundaries. In contrast, CTCF sites not associated with cohesin binding (lone CTCF sites), and to a lesser extent CAC sites not at intra-TAD or TAD loop anchors (other CAC sites), showed much greater tissue specificity for CTCF binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>The enrichment of knockdown-resistant cohesin binding sites at TAD boundaries, seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, may explain the persistence of domain structures following CTCF or cohesin depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zuin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seitan et al., 2013</xref>).

Downstream from the core CTCF motif (within the loop interior) we observed a shoulder of high sequence conservation, as well as additional complex motif usage, likely due to the multivalency of CTCF-DNA interaction, as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakahashi et al., 2013</xref>). TAD and intra-TAD loop anchors showed broader and more complex CTCF motif usage outside of the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>); however, only a small minority of sites contained any specific motif in this flanking region. It is less clear to what extent this broader motif usage is a general property of strongly-bound CTCF regions or of the loop anchors themselves. In fact, we observed a consistent positioning of the cohesin peak just downstream of the CTCF peak, independent of whether the CTCF site was predicted to participate in loop formation or not (i.e. at both loop anchors and ‘Other CAC’ sites; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), in accordance with the loop extrusion model and other observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kagey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faure et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-3"><title>Intra-TAD loops in other mouse tissues and in human cells</title><p>Given the highly tissue-conserved binding of CTCF at sites that we predicted to serve as intra-TAD loop anchors in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), we sought direct experimental evidence for the presence of these loops in two other mouse cell types, ESCs and NPCs, where domain and loop definitions have been established based on high-resolution Hi-C datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonev et al., 2017</xref>).

We predicted more loops in human cells (~15,000 loops that contain a TSS) than in mouse (~10,000 loops with a TSS), owing in part to the lack of a TAD overlap filter. We observed substantially more overlap of the predicted set of intra-TAD loops with loop domains (40–54%) or with K562 cell CTCF ChIA-PET interactions (60–65%) than with contact domains (26–35%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A</xref>). Biologically, this difference makes sense, as ChIA-PET and our intra-TAD prediction method both define a CTCF/CAC mediated interactome.

In contrast, interactions were generally skewed in the upstream direction for viewpoints placed upstream of the same set of intra-TAD loop anchors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, OUT). These shifts in the distribution of interactions further support the insulating nature of these intra-TAD anchors, and were seen both for intra-TADs that are tissue-specific (Albumin, Sox2) and for those that are common (Hnf4a, Scd1) across the three tissues we examined (liver, NPC and mESC cells).</p><p>To visualize features of these anchors, aggregate liver Hi-C profiles spanning 1 Mb around each anchor were generated for each group of CTCF sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Each group was further subdivided into a left (upstream) and a right (downstream) anchor based on its CTCF motif orientation. All non-anchor CTCF sites used for comparison in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref> were required to contain a CTCF motif to assign directionality, and CTCF peaks were required to be present in a minimum of 2 individual biological replicates. By aggregating many sites, we can visualize the overall interaction properties of each group of sites at high resolution (5 kb bins), revealing features that are much harder to discern at an individual CTCF site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). TAD and intra-TAD loop anchors both show strong enrichment of interactions towards the loop interior when compared to CTCF sites that were not predicted to participate in loop formation (non-anchor CTCF sites). Furthermore, intra-TAD anchors show less enrichment of long-range contacts compared to TAD anchors, likely because of their shorter length compared to TADs. This may also explain the lower inward bias scores of intra-TAD loops seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. Depletion of interactions that span across loop anchors (dark blue density above anchor points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) was seen for both TAD and intra-TAD anchors, however, this local insulation was substantially greater for TAD anchors. This may be due to the compounding impact of adjacent TAD loops, that is, the end of one TAD is often close to the beginning of an adjacent TAD loop anchor (median distance between TAD anchors = 33.5 kb, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). GO term analysis of genes whose TSS fall within these inter-TAD regions revealed enrichment for housekeeping genes (ribosomal, nucleosome, and mitosis-related gene ontologies), whereas neighboring genes found just within the adjacent TADs were enriched for distinct sets of GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The nearby but oppositely oriented TAD anchors flanking the inter-TAD regions likely contribute to the more bidirectional interaction pattern for TADs seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. For instance, the left TAD anchor plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> shows a well-defined pattern of interaction enrichment downstream from the anchor, but also a more diffuse enrichment upstream contributed by upstream loop anchors located at various distances. In contrast, non-anchor CTCF sites do not show strong directional interactions and only very weak distal contact depletion. CNC-bound regions are predominantly found at enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faure et al., 2012</xref>) and do not show any discernable patterns of insulation or focal and directional interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). Thus, the weak contact depletion spanning each of the CTCF-containing groups shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> is likely real, and not an artifact of the background model or other noise.</p><p>To determine if intra-TAD loops share with TADs the ability to block histone mark spread and establish broad, insulated chromatin domains of activity and repression, we analyzed the distribution of two repressive marks in relation to CTCF binding sites: H3K27me3 and H3K9me3. An insulation score based on Jansen Shannon Divergence (JSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuglede and Topsoe, 2004</xref>) was calculated for ChIP signal distribution within a 20 kb window around each CTCF peak. A low JSD value indicates less divergence from a string representing perfect insulation (i.e., high signal on one side of peak, and low or no signal on the other). This scoring allows for a direct comparison of different classes of CTCF sites, or other TF-bound sites, in terms of their insulation properties. In addition to TAD and intra-TAD loop anchors, we examined three other sets of sites as controls: other CAC sites, sites bound by CTCF alone, and CNC sites. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> shows the cumulative distribution of JSD scores for each set of sites, where a leftward shift indicates greater insulation across the site for the chromatin mark examined. For H3K27me3 signal distribution, TAD and intra-TAD loop anchors showed the greatest insulation, but were not significantly different from each other (Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test; p=0.52). The same general trend was observed for H3K9me3 signal insulation; however, intra-TAD loop anchors actually showed greater insulation than TAD anchors and all other groups (KS test; p&lt;0.001). CNC sites consistently showed the least insulation of both repressive histone marks, as expected. Sites where CTCF is bound alone showed a small but significant increase in insulation compared to CNC sites, as did the CAC group. As a control, the distribution of IgG signal (input signal) showed much less insulation overall and no significant differences between the various classes of CTCF/cohesin binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref> show heat map representations of H3K27me3 ChIP-seq signal around the top 500 active and top 500 inactive intra-TAD loops, based on a ranked list of JSD insulation scores. These represent intra-TAD loops that have significantly lower (or higher) H3K27me3 signal in the loop interior based on the combined rank of JSD insulation scores for each anchor, respectively (p&lt;0.05, two-sided t-test). For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> shows intra-TAD loops with lower H3K27me3 signal within the loop than in neighboring regions (and thus the left anchor transitions from high to low signal, while the right anchor transitions from low to high signal). No such pattern was seen for the IgG (control) ChIP-seq signals for these same regions, indicating this is not an artifact of the sequence read mappability of these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Impact of intra-TAD loops on <italic>cis</italic> regulatory elements in mouse liver</title><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>Classifying open chromatin regions and defining super-enhancers in mouse liver</title><p>Many TADs, and also intra-TAD loops, are structurally conserved across tissues, yet the activity of enhancers and promoters contained within these looped structures is highly tissue-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dowen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heidari et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, it is important to understand the ability of TADs and intra-TAD loops to insulate active enhancer interactions, that is enhancer-blocking activity. To address this issue, we examined the distribution of CTCF and cohesin binding sites in relationship to promoters and enhancers across the genome, as well as the impact of TADs and intra-TAD loops on their associated genes and enhancers.</p><p>We previously identified ~70,000 mouse liver DNase hypersensitive sites (DHS), whose chromatin accessibility is in part determined by TF binding and their flanking histone marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sugathan and Waxman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ling et al., 2010</xref>). To assign a function for each DHS, we classified each DHS according to the ratio of two chromatin marks, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, which are respectively associated with enhancers and promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). The ~70,000 DHS were grouped into five classes: promoter, weak promoter, enhancer, weak enhancer and insulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>; see Materials and methods). Promoter-DHS were defined as DHS with a H3K4me3/H3K4me1 ratio ≥1.5, and enhancer-DHS by a H3K4me3/H3K4me1 ratio ≤0.67 (as first described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hay et al., 2016</xref>]). DHS with similar signals for each mark (H3K4me3/H3K4me1 ratio between 0.67 and 1.5) were designated weak promoter-DHS, based on their proximity to TSS and comparatively lower expression of neighboring genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). DHS with low signal for both marks were classified as weak enhancers, or as insulators, in those cases where they overlapped a CTCF peak with a comparatively strong ChIP-seq signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Using this simplified five DHS class model, we observed that enhancer-DHS bind cohesin largely in the absence of CTCF, while promoter-DHS are bound by both CTCF and cohesin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Additionally, H3K27ac is enriched at promoter-DHS and enhancer-DHS but not at weak enhancer-DHS, which are less open (lower DNase-seq signal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and more distal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

To determine if some intra-TAD loops correspond to these ‘super-enhancer domains’, we first identified super-enhancers in mouse liver. We used 19 publicly available mouse liver H3K27ac ChIP-seq datasets to score clusters of individual enhancer-DHS + weak enhancer-DHS identified above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

We hypothesized that the true gene target of the super-enhancer will be more highly expressed. Indeed, we found that genes neighboring super-enhancers and found within the same intra-TAD loop are significantly more highly expressed than the alternative potential gene targets, located outside of the intra-TAD loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similarly, when comparing the tissue specificity of genes within TADs and intra-TAD loops to a random shuffled set of regions, we observed less variance in the Tau value (index of tissue specificity) for genes within TAD or intra-TAD loops compared to the shuffled set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; KS test p-value&lt;0.0001). Thus, groups of genes within intra-TAD loops are more uniformly tissue specific (as in the case of some super-enhancer-adjacent genes) or tissue ubiquitous (as in the case of groups of housekeeping genes). Examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, which illustrate the impact of a TAD loop on the expression of <italic>Cebpb</italic> and the impact of an intra-TAD loop on the expression of <italic>Hnf4a</italic>.

It is unclear what other mechanisms allow for selective expression of the other 648 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>4C-seq analysis of super-enhancer contacts at Alb promoter</title><p>To test directly for the insulation of an intra-TAD loop containing a super-enhancer, we performed 4C-seq analysis for the promoter of albumin (<italic>Alb</italic>), the most highly expressed gene in adult mouse liver. 4C-seq is designed to identify all chromatin contacts originating from a single genomic region (the promoter of <italic>Alb</italic> in this case), known as the 4C viewpoint. Using 4C-seq, we captured many highly specific, reproducible interactions with the <italic>Alb</italic> promoter, a majority of which are localized across an upstream ~50 kb region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). 40% of the interactions are localized within DHS that are constituent enhancers of the <italic>Alb</italic> region super-enhancer. Furthermore, &gt;80% of chromatin contacts are within the <italic>Alb</italic> super-enhancer, and &gt;98% are contained within the <italic>Alb</italic> intra-TAD loop, in both male and female liver. These interactions become more diffuse with increasing genomic distance from the viewpoint, which may represent dynamic interactions, or alternatively, may reflect averaging across a heterogeneous cell population. Comparing the combined interaction profiles between male and female livers, we observed highly reproducible results, with 92.9% of male interactions also present in female liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Looking beyond local interactions, we observed 4C interaction frequencies that span several orders of magnitude, going from local (intra-TAD) to <italic>cis</italic> (intra-chromosomal) and <italic>trans</italic> (genome-wide) interactions. Thus, for the <italic>Alb</italic> promoter, the 4C signal per TAD was &gt;1000 RPKM for local interactions, &gt;100 RPKM for <italic>cis</italic> interactions within 3 TADs adjacent to the viewpoint, and ~10 RPKM beyond that (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). <italic>Trans</italic> interactions were almost exclusively &lt;10 RPKM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Using a separate background model for far-<italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> 4C signals, we categorized TADs as either high, medium, low, or non-interacting (see Materials and methods). As <italic>Alb</italic> is the most highly expressed gene in liver and is proximal to a strong super-enhancer, we expected that distal interacting regions would also be active genomic regions, as proposed in the transcription factory model of nuclear compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iborra et al., 1996</xref>). Indeed, we found that &gt;80% of the distal high interacting TADs (both far-<italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>) were active TADs, and &gt;90% were either active or weakly active TADs. In contrast, only 16.6% of the non-interacting TADs in cis and 25.9% of those in trans were active TADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>).

While select instances of CAC-mediated loop insulation within TADs have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dowen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Willi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanssen et al., 2017</xref>), our work establishes that this phenomenon is a more general feature of genomic organization and regulation than previously appreciated. The intra-TADs described here are nested, CAC-anchored loops whose formation may be a result of extrusion complex pausing within larger domains (i.e., TADs); these loops act to constrain the promoter contacts available to a given distal enhancer, and correspondingly, the distal enhancer contacts available to a given promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hnisz et al., 2016</xref>). We also provide evidence that the loop-forming CTCF sites, but not other CTCF sites, are highly insular. This insulation is apparent from the blockage of repressive histone mark spread and by the inhibition of chromatin contacts across intra-TAD loop and TAD boundaries. The impact of this insulation is highlighted for super-enhancer regions, such as the super-enhancer upstream of <italic>Alb</italic>, where local insulation by CAC-anchored intra-TAD loops both enables and constrains strong near-<italic>cis</italic> interactions, which facilitate the high expression of <italic>Alb</italic> and presumably also other liver-expressed genes regulated by super-enhancers. Weaker <italic>trans</italic> interactions with distal active regions were also observed, and are likely driven by a distinct mechanism, such as aggregation of transcription factories or super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osborne et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Genomic interactions occur at three levels: (1) compartmentalization, where inactive regions localize to the nuclear periphery and active chromatin compartments aggregate toward the center of the nucleus in <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> in a largely cohesin-independent manner, as proposed in the transcription factory model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seitan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osborne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>); (2) CAC-dependent looping, which generates many tissue-invariant scaffolds along the linear chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hnisz et al., 2016</xref>); and (3) enhancer-promoter looping within CAC-loops, which may be directed by cohesin non-CTCF (CNC) sites, mediator, or tissue-specific TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dowen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kagey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faure et al., 2012</xref>). If TADs define the broad domain within which a cohesin-driven extrusion complex generally operates, then we have presented a simple method to identify loops within this region that form as a result of dynamic loop extrusion movement and pausing at additional loop anchors. We have used the term intra-TAD loops, also referred to as sub-TADs, to highlight their subdivision of TAD-internal genomic space, although they are functionally similar to loop domains, isolated cliques, and insulated neighborhoods, which tend to overlap or be contained within TADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hnisz et al., 2016</xref>). Our computational method cannot predict CTCF-independent loops, such as those mediated cohesin alone (enhancer-promoter loops), although such loops are likely constrained by CAC driven intra-TADs, as was highlighted by our <italic>Albumin</italic> 4C-seq results.</p><p>The method for CAC-mediated intra-TAD loop identification described here builds on the strong preference for inward-facing CTCF motifs evident from high resolution Hi-C data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2014</xref>), and will be most useful for the identification of intra-TAD CAC loops for the large number of cell lines and tissues that lack high resolution Hi-C data. In these cases, intra-TAD loop domains cannot be identified because there is not sufficient local enrichment to calculate a corner score with the arrowhead algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). Further, while we used TAD boundaries from standard resolution liver Hi-C data to filter out longer CAC loops, the frequent conservation of TADs across both tissues and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vietri Rudan et al., 2015</xref>) broadens the applicability of our method to cell types, and perhaps to new species, for which Hi-C data is not available and TAD boundaries have not been determined. Thus, even in the absence of TAD coordinates, our method identifies TAD and intra-TAD looping events, which may provide an invaluable first approximation for understudied organisms. As we have tuned our parameters to identify loop structures comparable in size and number to those found previously in mouse and human models, the parameters used to filter an initial set of loop anchors may need to be adjusted for other model organisms.</p><p>We have used both CTCF and cohesin peak strength as the primary predictor of intra-TAD loop strength, which is a reasonably good predictor of interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oti et al., 2016</xref>). An alternative machine learning approach to predicting CTCF/cohesin-mediated interactions, posted as an on-line preprint during review of our manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kai et al., 2017</xref>), uses data from up to 77 genomic-derived features to predict CTCF-mediated loops in three human cell lines. A key finding from this work was that cohesin strength was consistently the most predictive feature of CTCF loops, followed by CTCF binding strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kai et al., 2017</xref>). This method also captures loops that lack convergent CTCF motif orientation, which represent as few as 8% of the total for loop domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2014</xref>), or as many as 20% in the case of Insulated Neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ji et al., 2016</xref>). However, the identification of this subset of loops comes at the expense of requiring a minimum of 16 features for a given cell type, whereas our approach only requires three features (CTCF motif, CTCF ChIP-seq, and cohesin ChIP-seq data). Importantly, the three features used by our method represent 3 of the top four predictive features identified in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kai et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The computational method presented here, which was validated in both mouse and human cell models, provides a practical alternative to using high resolution Hi-C libraries for the identification of intra-TAD loops. High resolution Hi-C requires extremely deep sequencing, which is costly, both in terms of computational and experimental laboratory resources, and has only been achieved for a small number of cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonev et al., 2017</xref>). Strategies to reduce the need for extreme deep sequencing to identify interactions at high resolution have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weinreb and Raphael, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), and are beginning to make higher resolutions possible in more systems, however, the sequencing depth and cost will likely remain out of reach for many labs. Antibody enrichment for select genomic regions followed by chromosome conformation capture, as implemented in ChIA-PET, is an experimental alternative to intra-TAD prediction. ChIA-PET and other 3C-based antibody enrichment methods select for genomic regions that are highly bound by the protein(s) of interest (e.g., CTCF and cohesin), and can therefore identify ‘many to many’ interactions, instead of the ‘all to all’ interactions identified by Hi-C; these methods are therefore more practical than Hi-C, in terms of their sequencing depth requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fullwood et al., 2009</xref>). However, ChIA-PET still requires ~10 fold more extensive deep sequencing per sample (~400 million reads) than is needed to obtain the CTCF and cohesin ChIP-seq data utilized in our computational analysis to identify intra-TAD loops. Further, as ChIA-PET uses antibody to select for genomic regions bound by CTCF and/or cohesin, it is difficult to differentiate strength of antibody binding to the anchor proteins from strength of chromatin interaction between the anchors. Of the various CTCF loops described in the literature, insulated neighborhoods are most similar to the intra-TAD loops described here. Insulated neighborhoods are proposed to rectify the observation of smaller and more abundant loops, evident in ChIA-PET datasets, with the established TAD model of large loops from Hi-C experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dowen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The TAD and intra-TAD loop anchors identified here together comprise 27% of all liver CTCF binding sites, consistent with the 30% of murine ESC CTCF peaks that overlap insulated neighborhood anchor regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hnisz et al., 2016</xref>). The precise mechanism that differentiates these CTCF sites, which anchor intra-TAD and TAD loops, from the larger number of non-anchor CTCF binding sites present in any given tissue is unknown. Further, it is unclear what role the typically weaker remaining ~70% of CTCF sites play in organizing the nucleus. Some of these non-(intra-)TAD anchor CTCF sites may serve other, unrelated functions, given the ability of CTCF to interact with other TFs, bind RNA, and regulate splicing mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lutz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ross-Innes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saldaña-Meyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shukla et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, some of these CTCF sites may anchor loops present in only a minority of cells in the population analyzed, which would account for their overall weaker signals. Early single cell Hi-C experiments suggested that TADs are present in virtually all individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nagano et al., 2013</xref>), however, more recent studies indicate cell-to-cell variability in TADs within a given cell population, although the presence of distinct active and inactive genomic compartments is common across most individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stevens et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Truly high-resolution elucidation of single cell intra-TAD structures may not be possible due to the intrinsic limitation of two potential ligation events per fragment in any given cell.</p><p>We found that CAC sites are found at insulators and also at promoters, which we defined as DNase hypersensitive sites (DHS) with high a histone-H3 K4me3/K4me1 ratio, whereas CNC sites are primarily at enhancers and weak enhancers. Others find that promoters, when defined as the set of all TSS upstream regions (including those not at a DHS), are bound by cohesin alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kagey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faure et al., 2012</xref>). Further, we found that CTCF-bound open chromatin regions distal to promoters (insulator-DHS) show features that distinguish them from other classes of open chromatin (promoter-DHS and enhancer-DHS), including the absence of enhancer marks and their general conservation across tissues. Thus, these insulator-DHS regions are not simply enhancers with CTCF bound. Supporting this, insulator regions consistently show less intrinsic enhancer activity than weak enhancers in <italic>in vivo</italic> enhancer screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vanhille et al., 2015</xref>). It is less clear what role CTCF binding in the absence of cohesin plays in the nucleus, as we found such sites lack insulating activity and also lack strong directional interactions. As CTCF binding is always intrinsically directional, due to its non-palindromic motif, the absence of directional interactions from CTCF-non-cohesin sites suggests that the directionality of interactions with CTCF sites at TAD and intra-TAD loop anchors is conferred by other factors associated with the extrusion complex, such as cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fudenberg et al., 2016</xref>) or Top2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Uusküla-Reimand et al., 2016</xref>). However, our findings suggest that the interactions of Top2b involve binding to cohesin, and not CTCF, as indicated by the high frequency of CNC sites bound by Top2b vs. very low frequency of Top2b binding at CTCF-non-cohesin sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Furthermore, binding by Top2b does not distinguish TAD anchors from intra-TAD loop anchors. Indeed, by all metrics tested, we found no TF or motif that differentiates TAD anchors from intra-TAD loop anchors, although the existence of some unknown differentiating factor cannot be ruled out. Cohesin can stabilize large protein complexes comprised of up to 10 distinct TFs at enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faure et al., 2012</xref>), and could thus facilitate the binding of other unknown proteins to the loop extrusion complex.</p><p>Cohesin is continuously recycled throughout the genome by loading and release factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Busslinger et al., 2017</xref>), and so it is unclear how insulator activity is effectively maintained at TAD and intra-TAD loop anchors in such a dynamic environment. We found that CNC sites, which are primarily found at enhancers, consistently show the least insulation of repressive histone marks, just as they show the least insulation of chromatin contacts. This provides further evidence that TAD and intra-TAD loop anchors are functionally unique sites, and are not a moonlighting feature of CTCF bound to enhancer regions. Furthermore, while enhancers are strongly enriched for genetic non-coding variants, genetic variations at loop anchors are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hnisz et al., 2016</xref>). Mutations that occur at loop anchors can result in dramatic phenotypes like polydactyly or tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lupiáñez et al., 2015</xref>) and often occur in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ji et al., 2016</xref>). Disruption of specific, individual CAC-mediated loop anchors using genomic editing tools results in aberrant chromatin contacts and misregulation of neighboring genes in a largely predictable manner, although some redundancy may occur when multiple nearby anchors are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dowen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hnisz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Willi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The computational method for intra-TAD loop discovery, described here, is a substantial improvement over prior implementations of computational loop prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oti et al., 2016</xref>). The loops we identified were longer and fewer in number (~9500 vs ~60,000), showed much stronger insulation of chromatin interactions and greater insulation of repressive histone marks, and displayed considerably greater overlap with cohesin-mediated loops identified by ChIA-PET using antibody to the cohesin subunit Smc1. Key features of our computational method include the consideration of both CTCF and cohesin binding strength, as noted above, as well as TAD structure and consistency across biological replicates. Our use of both CTCF and cohesin binding strength in predicting intra-TAD loops is supported by a recent study of CTCF sites nearby the mouse α-globin gene cluster, where the presence of CTCF alone was not sufficient to predict DNA loop interactions, and where insulation by individual CAC sites ranged widely – from none to moderate to very strong insulation – in direct proportion to the strength of CTCF binding, as revealed by deletion of individual CTCF sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanssen et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, we developed a simple extension of our method that predicts TAD anchors when given a set of TAD boundaries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref>), and thereby overcome the limitation in identifying TAD anchors from low resolution, standard sequencing depth Hi-C datasets. We were thus able to identify well-defined inter-TAD regions, which we found are enriched for unique gene ontologies, notably, housekeeping genes with ribosomal, nucleosome, and mitosis-related functions. A further extension of our findings would be the explicit use of the intra-TAD and refined-TAD loop coordinates defined here to improve gene target assignments for distal regulatory elements, based on the insulating capacity of these CAC-anchored looped domains. Such an approach may be beneficial for the many model systems where distal enhancer activity is the clear driver of tissue specificity or a given disease state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hnisz et al., 2016</xref>). The ability to identify intra-TAD loops based solely on CTCF motif orientation and CTCF and cohesin ChIP-seq binding data, and then use these loops to improve gene target assignments for distal regulatory elements is likely to constitute a substantial improvement over ‘nearest gene’ and other, more nuanced target assignment algorithms, such as GREAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raviram et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our studies reveal that while TAD structures are readily apparent in routine Hi-C experiments, their structural organization and functional impact on the genome is not unique. Structurally, the 9,543 TAD-internal sub-loops that we identified for mouse liver have strong cohesin-and-CTCF-bound anchors and appear to be formed by the same loop extrusion mechanism responsible for TAD formation. Functionally, we hypothesize that these intra-TAD loops contribute to nuclear architecture as intra-TAD scaffolds that further constrain enhancer-promoter interactions. We further show that these intra-TAD loops maintain key properties of TADs, most notably insulation of chromatin interactions and insulation of repressive histone mark spreading. The insulation provided by intra-TAD loops may enable high expression of super-enhancer target genes, as illustrated for <italic>Alb</italic> in mouse liver, as well as high expression of individual genes within otherwise inactive TADs, as exemplified by <italic>Scd1</italic> and the many other single gene intra-TAD loops that we identified. Given the increasing interest in interactions of genes with distal enhancers and other intergenic sequences, the rapid and cost-effective method described here for identification of intra-TAD structures that constrain long-range chromatin interactions may prove invaluable in many areas of genomic research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and processing of liver</title><p>Adult male and female CD-1 mice (ICR strain; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5659424">MGI:5659424</ext-link>) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and were housed in the Boston University Laboratory Animal Care Facility.

Livers were homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer using high sucrose homogenization buffer (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 25 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M sucrose, 10% glycerol, 0.05 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.2% (v/v) spermidine, 1 mM Na orthovanadate, 10 mM NaF, and Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) to prevent aggregation of nuclei and preserve chromatin structure. The resulting slurry was transferred on top of a 3 ml cushion of homogenization buffer followed by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 RPM for 30 min at 4°C in an SW41 Ti rotor to pellet the nuclei and remove cellular debris. The supernatant was carefully decanted to remove liquid, and residual solid debris was removed from the tube walls using a sterile spatula and a dampened Kimwipe. Nuclei were resuspended in 1 ml of crosslinking buffer (10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.6), 25 mM KCl, 0.15 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.34 M sucrose, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and transferred to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. To ensure consistent crosslinking, tubes were incubated for 3 min at 30°C prior to the addition of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 0.8% (v/v). Samples were incubated in a 30°C water bath for 9 min with periodic mixing. Crosslinking was halted by the addition of 110 μl of 1 M glycine, followed by a 5 min incubation at room temperature. The crosslinked material was layered on top of 3 ml of high sucrose homogenization buffer and then centrifuged as above. The crosslinked nuclear pellet was resuspended at 4°C in 1 ml of 1X Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% IPEGAL, 0.5% deoxycholic acid) containing 0.5% SDS and protease inhibitors until homogenous by gentle pipetting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sonication</title><p>Crosslinked nuclei in RIPA buffer containing 0.5% SDS were transferred to 15 ml polystyrene tubes (BD Falcon # 352095) for sonication using a Bioruptor Twin instrument (UCD-400) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

To adapt the protocol for liver, care was taken to rapidly isolate single liver cells or nuclei suspensions prior to crosslinking. Specifically, two approaches to crosslinking were taken and both gave similar results. One male mouse liver and one female mouse liver sample were processed through the crosslinking step as described for the ChIP protocol, above, prior to quantification of nuclei. The other liver samples (3 males and 3 females) were crosslinked as follows. Half of a liver (~0.5 g) was dissected from each mouse, the gall bladder was removed, and the liver was rinsed with PBS. The liver was then minced and rapidly processed with 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer in PBS containing protease inhibitors (PBS-PI; 1X Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail; Roche #11697498001). The resulting slurry was passed through a 40-micron cell strainer (Corning #431750), then pelleted and rinsed with PBS-PI (centrifugation at 1,300 RPM for 5 min at 4°C). Following an additional spin, the cell pellet was resuspended well in 9 ml of PBS-PI at room temperature. 270 μl of 37% formaldehyde was added to give a final concentration of 1%, and crosslinking was carried out for 10 min with nutation at room temperature. The remaining formaldehyde was quenched with 1.25 ml of 1 M glycine. Crosslinked cells were pelleted and rinsed with PBS twice (as above) prior to lysis. The supernatant was removed following the second wash, and cell pellets were resuspended in 8 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 1% TX-100, and 1X Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) and incubated on ice for 40 min with occasional mixing. Lysed cells were spun down at 2,000 RPM for 5 min at 4°C then washed twice with PBS-PI, as above. Nuclei were pelleted, quantified using an Invitrogen Countess instrument, and snap frozen in 10 million nuclei aliquots. Primary digestion of 10 million nuclei with 50,000 U of DpnII (NEB: #R0543) was performed overnight at 37°C in 450 μl of NEBuffer 3 (NEB: #B7003S; 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.9) with agitation at 900 RPM. After confirming digestion by agarose gel electrophoresis, DpnII was inactivated with SDS (2%, final concentration) and the samples then diluted 5-fold in 1X ligation buffer (Enzymatics #B6030). 200 U of T4 DNA ligase was added and primary ligation was carried out overnight at 16°C (Enzymatics #L6030). Ligation was confirmed by analysis of a small aliquot on an agarose gel, and reverse crosslinking was conducted by overnight incubation with 600 μg proteinase K at 65°C. After RNase A digestion and phenol/chloroform cleanup, samples underwent secondary digestion with 50 U of Csp6I (Fermentas #ER0211) overnight at 37°C in 500 μl of 1X Buffer B (Fermentas: #BB5; 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mg/ml BSA). Csp6I was then heat inactivated for 30 min at 65°C. Samples were diluted 10-fold and secondary ligation was carried out as above, overnight at 16°C. The final PCR template was purified by phenol/chloroform clean up, followed by QiaPrep 2.0 column cleanup (Qiagen #27115). PCR reactions were performed using inversely-oriented 4C primers specific to the <italic>Alb</italic> promoter (sequences shown in bold, below) with dangling 5’ half adapter sequences (Reading primer: ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT<bold>GGTAAGTATGGTTAATGATC</bold>; Non-reading primer: GACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT<bold>CTCTTTGTCTCCCATTTGAG</bold>). This design has two advantages: 1) the addition of barcodes in a secondary reaction allows a primer to be reused across samples; and 2) it avoids barcoding at the start of 4C read, which would reduce the mappable read length available for downstream analyses. 4C templates were amplified using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen #10966026) under the following conditions: 94°C for 2 min, 25 cycles at (94°C 30 s, 55°C 30 s, 72°C 3 min), then 4°C hold. A total of eight liver samples were analyzed (four males, M1-M4; and four females, F1-F4). For liver samples M3, M4, F3 and F4, eight identical PCR reactions for each liver, processed in parallel, were prepared and then pooled to limit the impact of PCR domination in any single reaction. For liver samples M1, M2, F1 and F2, two PCR reactions for each liver were sequenced separately then pooled at the fastq file level for downstream analyses. We observed that the 8 PCR pool reactions gave a more reproducible profile than the single PCR reactions. After pooling, 4C samples were purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter: #A63882) at a 1.5:1 ratio of beads to sample, washed with 75% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 0.1X TE buffer to elute the DNA. 4C-seq samples were multiplexed and PCR amplified using standard NEB barcoded primers (NEB #E7335), as was done for ChIP-seq library preparations, but for five additional PCR cycles rather than the eight cycles used for ChIP libraries (total of 30 cycles of PCR per sample: 25 cycles with viewpoint-specific primers followed by five cycles with viewpoint-generic barcoded NEB primers). 4C libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hi-Seq 2500 instrument at the New York Genome Center giving 125 bp long paired end reads. Samples were each sequenced to a depth of ~1–5 million reads.

Reads were then mapped to the mouse mm9 reference genome using the Burrows-Wheeler aligner (bwa-mem) allowing for up to two mismatches. The package r3Cseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thongjuea et al., 2013</xref>) was used to analyze the distribution of signal in <italic>cis</italic>, both near the bait and along chromosome 5. Reads were counted per restriction fragment to obtain the highest possible resolution. Data shown in the main text figures are for the intersection of four male and four female mouse livers, merged according to sex using the intersection option, meaning that the 4C interactions shown are those present in all four samples for a given sex. This produces both a normalized read depth signal (reads per million per restriction fragment) and an associated p-value for the interaction, taking into account distance from viewpoint and reproducibility across replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). A comprehensive view of all replicates is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>. For all pairwise comparisons, a correlation between samples was calculated genome-wide using the UCSC utility bigWigCorrelate with default settings. To account for high signal immediately surrounding the viewpoint, this analysis was only conducted for regions &gt; 10 kb from the viewpoint fragment. To analyze more distal <italic>cis</italic> interactions, we first calculated the normalized 4C signal observed per TAD along chromosome 5, in units of RPKM per TAD. We observed a robust logarithmic decay of signal with increasing distance from the viewpoint TAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.719). Interacting TADs were defined according to observed over expected 4C signal relative to this background model. Interacting TADs were designated as follows: high, defined as regions with &gt;2 fold enrichment over this background model (observed/expected); medium, defined as 1.5 to 2-fold enrichment; and low, between 1.5-fold enrichment and 1.5-fold depletion. Non-interacting TADs showed &gt;1.5 fold depletion of signal. For the <italic>Alb</italic> viewpoint, we identified 17 high, 20 medium, 128 low, and 30 non interacting <italic>cis</italic> TADs along chromosome 5. We required a more comprehensive background model to analyze interactions in <italic>trans</italic>. The tool 4Cker was used for its adaptive windowing and Hidden Markov model approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raviram et al., 2016</xref>). The count tables from r3C-seq were merged by sex and imported, then <italic>trans</italic> analysis was conducted with the recommended parameters (k = 20). The default output identifies three classes of regions: interacting, low-interacting, and non-interacting. For our analysis, the interacting group was divided into two equal-number groups: high-interacting and medium-interacting, based on 4C interaction strength in the male liver samples. <italic>Trans</italic> interacting regions tend to be large (median size of 1.8 Mb), therefore <italic>trans</italic> interacting TADs were defined as TADs wholly contained within these interacting regions.

For a given CAC site, the highest scoring motif occurrence for the canonical core CTCF motif (MA0139.1) was considered. A (+) strand orientation indicates that the motif is found on the (+) genomic strand (Watson strand). Each CAC site was represented by two different scores: a CTCF score = p * (m/10), where p is the CTCF peak strength (MACS2 score) and m is the CTCF motif score, as determined by FIMO; and a cohesin score = p <italic>* (m/10), where p is the cohesin (Rad21) peak strength (MACS2 score) and m is the CTCF motif score, as determined by FIMO.</italic></p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Intra-TAD loop prediction method</title><p>We modified a published algorithm for CTCF-mediated loop prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oti et al., 2016</xref>) to predict intra-TAD loop structures. Key modifications to the algorithm include the following: incorporation of cohesin ChIP-seq data in scoring, based on the finding that CTCF signal in the absence of cohesin is not sufficient to predict chromatin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanssen et al., 2017</xref>); consideration of TAD structure, TSS overlap, and consistency across biological replicates when filtering to obtain the final set of predicted loops; and a final target set of approximately 10,000 intra-TAD loops, based on experimental results from high resolution Hi-C analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). First, CAC sites were identified from mouse liver ChIP-seq data for Rad21 and CTCF, obtained as described above. Next, each chromosome was scanned for putative intra-TAD loops, formed between a (+) anchor [upstream anchor, that is, CAC site with a CTCF motif (JASPAR motif MA0139.1) on the (+) strand] at the start of a loop and a (-) anchor [downstream anchor, that is, CAC site with a CTCF motif on the (-) strand] at the end of a loop, as described for prediction of intra-chromosomal CTCF loops in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oti et al., 2016</xref>). Scanning was initiated from the beginning of each chromosome, and a list of putative (+) anchors was generated. Next: (1) if the next CAC site encountered was a (-) anchor, the pair of (+) and (-) anchors was recorded as a putative intra-TAD loop. The (+) anchor was paired with all subsequent, downstream (-) anchors until another (+) anchor was encountered, at which point the list of putative intra-TAD loops was closed, ending with the last (-) anchor. Alternatively, (2) if the next CAC sites encountered were (+) anchors, then all such (+) anchors were retained as putative upstream anchors, until the next (-) anchor was reached, and then all such (+) anchors were paired (i.e., assigned to loops) with all of the subsequent, downstream (-) anchors until a new (+) anchor was encountered, as described under (1), at which point the list of putative loops was closed, ending with the last (-) anchor. A new scan for putative intra-TAD loops was then initiated in a linear fashion, starting from the next (+) anchor until all chromosomes were scanned and a set of putative intra-TAD loops was obtained. Chromosome scanning for putative intra-TAD loops was then repeated as described above after removing 10% of the CAC sites – those with the lowest <underline>CTCF</underline> scores (defined above). Chromosome rescanning was repeated iteratively until the number of putative intra-TAD loops decreased to as close to 20,000 as possible (removing the lowest scoring loops if needed so that all replicates had exactly 20,000 loops prior to merging). A parallel series of iterative scans was carried out, except that 10% of the CAC sites with the lowest <underline>cohesin</underline> scores (defined above) were removed at each iteration, to generate a second set of ~20,000 putative intra-TAD loops. The intersection of the two sets of 20,000 putative intra-TAD loops was then determined. The same iterative process of intra-TAD loop prediction was carried out independently for each of the n = 4 individual mouse livers, based on an analysis of matched CTCF and cohesin (i.e., Rad21) ChIP-seq datasets for each liver. Thus, for each liver sample, a single putative intra-TAD loop set was generated from the intersection of two sets of predicted CAC-based loops, one using the CTCF score and the other using the cohesin (Rad21) score; these scores were calculated using MACS2 scores for CTCF and cohesin (Rad21), respectively, together with the CTCF motif score m value, as described above. The overlap of these two putative intra-TAD loop sets was approximately 80%, and ranged from 15,999 to 16,892 loops for a given liver sample. Additional filters were then applied to remove intra-TADs that did not contain either a protein-coding TSS or a liver-expressed multi-exonic lncRNA TSS (as defined in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Melia et al., 2016</xref>]), as we were primarily interested in the impact of intra-TADs on gene expression and regulation. Putative intra-TAD loops that overlapped &gt;80% of the length of a TAD, or whose (+) and (-) anchors are both TAD anchors (defined below) were also excluded, as these loops could not be distinguished from TAD loops. These two filters further reduced the putative intra-TAD loop sets to approximately 63% of the original 20,000 (ranging from 12,395 to 12,962 loops across the four liver samples). A single merged ChIP-seq dataset (merged at the fastq file level, separately for CTCF and for Rad21 datasets) was treated as a fifth dataset. It was run through the full pipeline, above, and then sequentially intersected with the set of putative intra-TAD loops predicted for each individual liver to obtain a final set of 9543 intra-TAD loops identified in all four livers and also present in the 5<sup>th</sup> dataset (merged sample). Each intra-TAD loop was assigned an intra-TAD loop score equal to the geometric mean of the (+) anchor’s CAC site CTCF score and that of its (-) anchor. A second intra-TAD loop score, equal to the geometric mean of the (+) anchor’s CAC site cohesin score and that of its (-) anchor, was also assigned. The CTCF and cohesin scores reported for each loop in the final intra-TAD loop lists (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>) are those obtained from the merged sample.

Next, these bins were compared to the peak positions of various publicly available ChIP-seq datasets using the Bedtools coverage command, and the number of peaks per bin was counted. This resulted in a string of 100 values for each TAD, representing the number of ChIP-seq peaks per bin, where the first value is the start of the TAD and the last value is the end of the TAD. Conducting this analysis across all TADs yielded a matrix of 3617 rows (one per TAD) x 100 columns (one per bin).

This allows the y axis to represent bin enrichment relative to the center of the TAD, as shown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>TAD activity and compartment assignment</title><p>TAD boundaries were defined at single nucleotide resolution as the end of one TAD and the start of another (as defined in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vietri Rudan et al., 2015</xref>]), thus excluding the start of the first TAD in each chromosome and the end of the last TAD. In contrast, all references to ‘TAD anchors’ refers to the CTCF sites most likely to be anchoring TAD loops based on distance from the boundary and proper orientation (as described in TAD Anchor Identification, below). Data sources for all ChIP-seq, GRO-seq, Hi-C, and other datasets are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>. H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H2AK5ac, and H3K36me3 marks were processed from the raw sequencing data (fastq files) through the standard ChIP-seq pipeline, above. H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 mark data were expressed as log<sub>2</sub>(ChIP/IgG signal). Lamina-associated domain coordinates and GRO-seq data were downloaded as pre-processed data. Heat maps were generated using Deeptools reference point, with a bin size of 10 kb. TAD boundaries were grouped according to k-means clustering (k = 4) using signal within a 1 Mb window from three datasets: H3K9me3, H2AK5ac, and the eigenvalue of the Hi-C PCA analysis (above). Based on these clusters, TADs were classified as active, weak active, weak inactive, or inactive, as follows. If both the start and end boundary of a given TAD were classified as active, then the TAD was designated active. Specifically, a TAD was considered ‘active’ if the boundary at the start of a TAD fell into clusters 1 or 2 (as marked in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and the boundary at the end of the same TAD fell into clusters 1 or 3. The corresponding metric was applied to identify inactive TADs. If the activity status of the start and the end of a given TAD were not in agreement, then the TAD was designated weakly active if the median Hi-C PC1 eigenvalue within the TAD was positive, or weakly inactive if the median Hi-C PC1 eigenvalue was negative. Gene expression and tissue specificity metrics represent expression or Tau values of genes whose TSS overlap active or inactive TADs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Additional Hi-C analysis</title><p>Contact profiles around TAD, intra-TAD loop, and non-loop-anchor CTCF sites were generated using Homer (v4.9) using the command analyzeHiC and the options ‘-size 500000 -hist 5000’ to generate interaction profiles for 1 Mb windows around CTCF sites with 5 kb resolution. TAD and intra-TAD loop anchors were split into left and right anchors when found at the start and at the end of the predicted loop, respectively. Non-anchor CTCF sites were defined as other CTCF sites, based on the merged CTCF sample, that also contained a CTCF motif. Left and right groupings were determined based on the orientation of the strongest CTCF motif within the non-anchor peak regions. The inward bias index (IBI) was modified from the more genome-wide directionality index (DI) described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). Both DI and IBI use a chi-squared statistic to determine the extent to which Hi-C reads from a given region have a strong upstream or strong downstream bias. While DI is genome wide, IBI focuses on the directionality of <italic>cis</italic> interactions (within 2 Mb) from a 25 kb window immediately downstream of a CTCF peak relative to the motif orientation. A large positive value indicates a strong interaction bias towards the loop center, as the motif orientation would predict. Values close to zero indicate a roughly equal distribution of interactions upstream and downstream. By orienting the sign of the IBI value relative to the CTCF motif directionality, we were able to group left and right loop anchors together.</p><p>Virtual 4C plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and Hi-C screenshots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A–CF</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7A–C</xref>) were generated using the 3D Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://promoter.bx.psu.edu/hi-c/index.html">http://promoter.bx.psu.edu/hi-c/index.html</ext-link>).

The merged list of CTCF peaks was filtered to only consider peaks that were found across all four biological replicates, that contained CTCF motifs, and that were within 50 kb of a TAD boundary, as defined previously for mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vietri Rudan et al., 2015</xref>). This 50 kb distance was chosen based on the ambiguity of binned Hi-C data to more accurately determine the precise TAD boundary. Then, for each TAD boundary, all pairs of (+) and (-) CTCF peaks were considered and scored based on their combined distance to the called TAD boundary. Pairs of ‘+/-” CTCF peaks that were comprised of a (+) anchor upstream of a (-) anchor (i.e., CTCF peak pairs that were not divergently oriented) were considered an invalid combination to define the end of one TAD and the beginning of the next TAD, and were not considered. The valid pairs with the shortest combined distance to the previously defined liver TAD boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vietri Rudan et al., 2015</xref>) were retained and all others were removed. If no valid pair for a TAD boundary was identified, the single CTCF peak closest to the TSD boundary was retained as the TAD anchor.

This provides an objective measure to compare the performance of each computational method in identifying TAD-like loops and loop anchors within TADs. To this end, we used the complete mouse liver CTCF peak list from the merged CTCF sample as input and implemented the loop prediction algorithm exactly as described previously (60% proportional peak cutoff, CTCF signal +motif scores as above, retaining only loops &lt; 200 kb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oti et al., 2016</xref>). As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, this analysis yielded many more loops (60,678; '60 k loop set') than we obtained using our method (9543 intra-TAD loops). Furthermore, the loops in the 60 k loop set were shorter (median size of 61 kb), and they showed less overlap with cohesin-mediated loops present in the mESC ChIA-PET dataset (25.5% versus 63.2% overlap for our set of intra-TAD loops). 59% of the intra-TAD loops characterized in our study are found in the 60 k loop set. To characterize loops unique to the 60 k loop set, we had to first filter out anchors found intra-TAD or TAD loops (to insure that each list was mutually exclusive, as above). Any 60 k loop anchor within 50 kb of a TAD boundary was excluded from downstream analysis. We also excluded any 60 k loop with at least one anchor that coincided with an intra-TAD loop anchor. These mutually exclusive lists of intra-TAD loop anchors and the filtered set of 60 k loop anchors (25,983 loop anchors in total; representing a subset of ‘Non Anchor CTCF’ in the main text, and referred to as ‘26 k loop anchors’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>) were then compared based on insulation of repressive histone marks (see ‘Repressive histone mark insulation’, below) and Hi-C interaction profiles (see ‘Additional Hi-C analysis’, above). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref> compares the insular features of intra-TAD loop anchors to those of the set of 26 k alternative loop anchors, which are not intra-TAD loop or TAD anchors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Anchor/Loop overlap</title><p>CTCF ChIP-seq data for 15 non-liver tissues from the ENCODE Project were downloaded (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=mm9&amp;g=wgEncodeLicrTfbs">https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=mm9&amp;g=wgEncodeLicrTfbs</ext-link>) and intersected with replicates to form a single peak list for each tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shen et al., 2012</xref>).

Specifically, regions 10 kb upstream and 10 kb downstream of each peak in a given peak list (i.e., TAD anchors, CNC, etc.) were each divided into 50 bins of 200 bp each. The number of H3K27me3, H3K9me3, or IgG ChIP-seq reads within each bin was tallied, resulting in a vector of 50 + 50 values for each peak region. These were then compared to two test vectors representing complete (maximal) insulation: fifty 0’s followed by fifty 1’s, and fifty 1’s followed by fifty 0’s. These are theoretical representations of low signal upstream of the peak followed by high signal downstream, and vice versa. Using a custom python script (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>), the similarity between the experimentally derived vector and each of the test vectors was calculated, where a lower value represents less divergence from the test vector.

The general schematic is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>. Promoter DHS were defined as DHS with a &gt; 1.5 fold ratio of H3K4me3 relative to H3K4me1 ChIP-seq signal; enhancer DHS were defined as DHS with a &lt; 0.67 fold ratio of H3K4me3 relative to H3K4me1 ChIP-seq signal, calculated as reads per million for each factor. Both DHS sets were filtered to remove DHS with &lt;4 reads per million for both marks after subtracting IgG signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These cutoff values leave two remaining DHS groups, one with a roughly equal ratio between the two histone-H3 marks, and one with low signal (&lt;4 reads per million) for both marks. The former DHS were classified as weak promoter DHS, based on their close proximity to RefSeq TSS and the low expression of neighboring genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). The remaining DHS group, characterized by low ChIP-seq signals, was largely intergenic but showed weak to undetectable levels of canonical histone marks. Low signal regions that overlapped a CTCF site with higher CTCF ChIP-seq signals than H3K4me1 signals were classified as insulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The remaining regions were designated weak enhancer-DHS based on their distance from TSS and their low levels of H3K27ac ChIP-seq signal compared to the enhancer-DHS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The majority of promoter-DHS and weak promoter-DHS were &lt;1 kb from a TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To compare the level of expression for genes with promoter-DHS or weak promoter-DHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), the TSS was required to be within 10 kb of the DHS summit. Any gene with both a weak promoter-DHS and a promoter-DHS within 10 kb was categorized as being regulated by a promoter-DHS; thus, there was no overlap between weak promoter-DHS-regulated genes and promoter-DHS-regulated genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Comparison of DHS classes across tissues</title><p>All available mouse tissue DNase-seq peak regions were downloaded from the ENCODE Project website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.encodeproject.org/">https://www.encodeproject.org/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shen et al., 2012</xref>).

Due to variable replicate numbers across tissues, the following cutoffs were used to form merged DHS lists for each tissue. If a tissue had only two replicates (as was the case for 12 of the 20 non-liver tissues), we required that the DHS be present in both replicates. If a tissue had 3 or 4 replicates, then the DHS were required to be present in all or all but one replicate (this was the case for 7 of the 20 non-liver tissues). For whole brain tissue, the merged peak list required that a DHS was present in at least 5 of the 7 replicates. These regions were compared to each other using the Bedtools multiinter command with the –cluster option to generate a union DHS peak list for all tissues, where the score column represents the number of non-liver tissues in which a given region was found. For all liver DHS assigned to one of the above five DHS classes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A</xref>), each liver DHS summit was mapped to this all tissue union peak list, allowing only one match per summit up to 150 nt away.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers overall appreciated the extensive analysis performed by the authors, and recognized the potential impact of this work upon further analysis. A major concern raised by all reviewers is that further evidence is required to better characterize the subTAD predictions made by the authors and relate these to known phenomena. The reviewers suggested using the available high-resolution Hi-C datasets by Rao et al., 2014 and Bonev et al., 2017 to comprehensively evaluate how the subTAD predictions made by the authors relate to small TADs and localized loop interactions which were found in these datasets. If successful, such an analysis will significantly strengthen the applicability of this approach as an alternative for high-resolution Hi-C. This would allow to evaluate whether loop interactions detected in Hi-C are mostly explained by convergent CTCF interaction. Together, these would significantly strengthen the paper.</p><p>In addition, the reviewers suggest restructuring the manuscript such that previously known results and anecdotal results are made less central in the manuscript (e.g. by moving these to the supplement).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this work the authors extend a previously-published computational method, that uses ChIP-seq data to predict chromatin loop structures, in order to identify loops within TADs. They refer to these loops as subTADs (confusing terminology, see below). Based on this method and on several published datasets, the authors analyze several aspects of the relations between TADs, subTADs, epigenetic state and gene expression. Their main biological result suggests that subTAD loop anchors are functionally similar to TAD loop anchors.</p><p>While the presented method is useful, taken together, in my view both the methodological and biological findings in this manuscript are not of sufficient novelty.</p><p>1) The authors define subTADs as intra-TAD loops which are anchored by CTCF and cohesin. This definition is very confusing, since the term TAD typically refers to a domain-like square/triangle interaction pattern in 3C-type experiments, and subTADs are typically defined as TAD-like patterns that are contained within larger TADs (e.g. Phillips-Cremins Cell 2013). It has been observed that TAD patterns often have end-to-end loop patterns (by loops I mean local peaks in Hi-C, as defined by the authors), but these phenomena are generally distinct as some TADs do not show localized looping interactions and some looping interactions appear outside TADs.</p><p>2) However, this is more than an issue of terminology, since the subTAD loops detected in this work may actually just represent small TADs. If this is the case, there may not be any reason to expect them to behave differently than other larger TADs, simply because the decision of what is called a TAD vs. subTAD is quite arbitrary in TAD-detection methods. In other words, the finding that TAD anchors are functionally similar to subTAD anchors may be of little novelty if the methodological distinction between the two is not clearly motivated.</p><p>3) In terms of methodological novelty, the method used to predict subTAD loops is novel but incremental, as its core has been published (prediction of loops based on CTCF ChIP-seq and motif directionality). The authors extend it to include cohesin occupancy and filter some loops so that they do not overlap TAD loops etc., but this extension is not a conceptual advance in the method (in fact the panel explaining the method is very similar to a panel from the previous paper describing the method).</p><p>4) Some of the analyses in the manuscript are of little novelty and are only indirectly linked to subTAD analysis (e.g. Figure 1 is a general analysis of TADs (A-E) and the association between gene expression and chromatin state (F-H); Figure 4 presents an analysis of enhancers and super enhancers, mostly unrelated to TADs or subTADs).</p><p>5) As far as I understand, &quot;other CAC&quot; sites will mostly be weak sites that did not pass the filters (this is supported by Figure 2F). How do we even know they are real sites? Given this observation, it may not be meaningful to compare with them.</p><p>6) The same goes for &quot;other CTCF&quot; sites: looking at Figure 2F, the ChIP signal shows they are mostly not actual sites.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript &quot;Insulation of gene expression by CTCF and cohesin-based subTAD loop structures&quot; Mathews and Waxman provide a detailed characterization of their CTCF and cohesin ChIP-seq on mouse liver. They focus on TADs and characterize their features with the help of published datasets. The characterization is later use as a proxy to compare TADs with identified/predicted subTADs. They use a previously published algorithm, to predict TADs, modified by the authors to predict subTADs by considering genomic and structural parameters. Furthermore, they identify enhancer, insulators and super-enhancers specific to mouse liver with the help of previously published data. They end by experimentally testing a subTAD insulation containing a super-enhancer.</p><p>I would recommend for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> with major modifications.</p><p>1) It is this reviewer's opinion that an essential part missing from this manuscript is for the authors to clearly show examples of subTADs that are not detected by Hi-C or ChIA-PET but are indeed predicted by their computational method. This will help the readers make sense of the very detailed bioinformatics analyses and bring home the relevance of the prediction of subTADs.</p><p>2) Why use 4C and not 5C, capture Hi-C or similar approach where you would be able to visualize your subTADs. I understand these approaches cost can be higher yet if not that at least the addition of extra viewpoints inside and outside the subTADs would be needed to show the insulation experimentally. Although unlikely, what is shown here can simply be explained by the 4C interaction frequency dropping exponentially from the viewpoint that is conveniently located at the center of the subTAD.</p><p>3) The extent of how the authors modified the method previously published and improved upon is largely unclear. I strongly suggest they make the code/scripts available to the community for all of their analyses otherwise their contributions most likely will remain unnoticed/unused.</p><p>4) Concerns about novelty: besides the obvious similarity from approaches published before additionally there is a paper found on bioRxiv (Predicting CTCF-mediated chromatin interactions by integrating genomic and epigenomic features. Kai et al., 2017) that predicts subTADs based on machine learning of ChIA-PET results. Might be helpful to discuss the pros/cons between methods.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors build on a previous method that uses CTCF binding and orientation (and predicts nearly 60k loops of average length 61kb) to define subTADs that are strictly contained in TADs and are fewer in number than the original method that predicted 60k loops. Motivated by other recent findings they incorporated cohesin ChIP-seq data as well as TAD boundaries, TSS overlap and consistency across replicates and trained their model to come up with a target number of approximately 10k (number of contact domains identified from 1kb/5kb resolution Hi-C data) subTADs with convergent CTCF sites on their boundaries. Even though there is not much in terms of robustness and stability analysis of some selected parameters and targets, their approach is mostly justifiable by the literature and what we know about TADs.</p><p>The manuscript thoroughly characterizes the properties of these newly defined subTADs in mouse liver and compares them to TADs and several other types of &quot;domains&quot;. Main conclusions are that subTADs are slightly weaker but smaller versions of TADs that carry all key TAD features and provide finer-scale control of gene expression.</p><p>1) My one main concern is the missing out on an opportunity to clearly distinguish these subTADs from the contact domains defined by Rao et al., 2014 paper on several different cell lines. All the data needed to perform subTAD predictions are available for most (if not all) of these cell lines and a clear, cell-type matched comparison of what subTADs are and how they overlap with contact domains (as well as the subset of loop domains). Only in Figure S4C there is an indirect comparison of contact domains from a mouse B-cell lymphoma cell line (CH12-LX) and subTADs from mouse liver. I think it is crucial for the field to understand similarities and differences of many different definitions of domains and subdomains in order to converge to a consensus. This paper could have done more towards that goal.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34077.071</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers overall appreciated the extensive analysis performed by the authors, and recognized the potential impact of this work upon further analysis.

An important outcome of our study, however, is that these small TAD-like loops have properties consistent with those of the larger TAD loops, and perhaps more importantly, can be reliably predicted by our analysis method, which presents what we believe to be a rather useful alternative to high-resolution Hi-C. We essentially started with the concept that TADs subdivide the genome into functional blocks of genomic activity/inactivity but that gene expression and activity is not uniform within many TADs. Our study constitutes a useful approach to reliably subdivide intra-TAD space into finer-scale blocks of regulatory domains. Our method is most useful when Hi-C data is not available, as it requires ChIP-seq data for only two factors: CTCF and Cohesin.</p><p>Prior efforts ignored two key features of our analysis method, cohesin signal strength and TAD structure. Regardless of what nomenclature is best used to describe these intra-TAD loop structures, we believe that the practical application of our method is its ability to identify these structures, which we show impact gene expression and regulation. We had demonstrated the utility of our method for mouse liver, and with the new results added to the revised manuscript, we show that our method can successfully predict loops in other mouse cell types (mESC and NPC) and also in human cells (GM12878 and K562 cells). For mESC and NPC cells, where TADs were defined using the highest resolution Hi-C currently available, our method is able to correctly detect intra-TAD loop structures (supported by ChIA-PET and in the Hi-C contact matrix) that were not detected as “small TADs,” further strengthening the utility of our method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In terms of methodological novelty, the method used to predict subTAD loops is novel but incremental, as its core has been published (prediction of loops based on CTCF ChIP-seq and motif directionality).

While we can see why the reviewer described our changes as incremental, small changes in approach can sometimes lead to dramatically improved results – as is the case here. Evidence for this improvement is provided, for example, in Figure 2—figure supplement 1, where we present a direct comparison of the results of our method with that of the prior method. One of the key ‘incremental’ changes is the incorporation of cohesin ChIP-seq data into our loop prediction model. Independent support for the importance of cohesin has now been provided in the form of a preprint recently made available by Kai et al. 2017 (also see our response to reviewer 2, comment 4 below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some of the analyses in the manuscript are of little novelty and are only indirectly linked to subTAD analysis (e.g. Figure 1 is a general analysis of TADs (A-E) and the association between gene expression and chromatin state (F-H); Figure 4 presents an analysis of enhancers and super enhancers, mostly unrelated to TADs or subTADs).</p></disp-quote><p>Per the guidance of the senior editor, we did not alter the presentation in Figures 1 and 4, which we consider as narratively important to understand the breadth of intra-TAD loops’ impact on gene expression and enhancer-promoter interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) As far as I understand, &quot;other CAC&quot; sites will mostly be weak sites that did not pass the filters (this is supported by Figure 2F).

Additionally, in our comparison across mouse tissues presented in Figure 2C, we found that 93% of all the “Other CAC” sites used in our analyses were verified to be bound by CTCF in at least one other mouse tissue, and 66% were verified in at least 6 other tissues. Similarly, for “Lone CTCF”, 81% of sites were bound by CTCF in at least one other mouse tissue, and 39% were verified in at least 6 other tissues. We have revised the manuscript to incorporate these findings about the robustness of the Other CAC and Lone CTCF sites (see legend to Figure 2C). Further, we now mention in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Intra-TAD loops show strong, directional interactions and insulate chromatin marks” that all CTCF peaks were required to be present in a minimum of 2 individual biological replicates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] I would recommend for publication in eLife with major modifications.</p><p>1) It is this reviewer's opinion that an essential part missing from this manuscript is for the authors to clearly show examples of subTADs that are not detected by Hi-C or ChIA-PET but are indeed predicted by their computational method. This will help the readers make sense of the very detailed bioinformatics analyses and bring home the relevance of the prediction of subTADs.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer asks what properties or features might characterize subTADs (now referred to as intra-TAD loops; see above) that we predicted computationally in liver but for which there is no supporting experimental data in the available Hi-C or ChIA-PET datasets from other mouse tissues. Overall, we found that ~75% of our predicted intra-TAD loops have support from experimental Hi-C, Hi-ChIP, or ChIA-PET datasets (subsection “Intra-TAD loops in other mouse tissues and in human cells”, second paragraph). To address the reviewer’s comment, we examined the remaining set of ~25% of subTAD (intra-TAD) loops, which are apparently tissue-specific. We also examined two other sets of tissue-specific loops that we identified by applying our algorithm to two other mouse cell types and two human tumor cell lines (Figure 2—figure supplements 3 and 4). Our findings, presented in Figure 2—figure supplements 3C 4C show that tissue-specific loops tend to be weaker (as measured by ChIA-PET interaction strength in mESC and K562 cells), but are real and observable in the Hi-C contact matrices (Figure 2—figure supplements 3E-F and 4E-F). Further, these tissue-specific loops show directional interactions in the new virtual 4C data that we have now added to the manuscript (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Why use 4C and not 5C, capture Hi-C or similar approach where you would be able to visualize your subTADs. I understand these approaches cost can be higher yet if not that at least the addition of extra viewpoints inside and outside the subTADs would be needed to show the insulation experimentally. Although unlikely, what is shown here can simply be explained by the 4C interaction frequency dropping exponentially from the viewpoint that is conveniently located at the center of the subTAD.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this issue by adding to the manuscript 4C analyses for a total of 12 virtual 4C viewpoints located at 6 intra-TAD loop anchors. These new data, which are presented in the third paragraph of the subsection “Intra-TAD loops show strong, directional interactions and insulate chromatin marks” and are shown in Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1, are based on our analysis of the high resolution Hi-C data of Bonev et al., 2017, as proposed by the senior Editor. The viewpoints analyzed are both inside and outside of a predicted intra-TAD loop, just as the reviewer suggested, to further test the insulation of intra-TAD loop anchors directly. These interaction profiles presented provide evidence for the loop itself and also for its insulation of interactions, as the directionality of Hi-C interactions shifts when the viewpoint is moved from just outside to within the intra-TAD loop.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The extent of how the authors modified the method previously published and improved upon is largely unclear. I strongly suggest they make the code/scripts available to the community for all of their analyses otherwise their contributions most likely will remain unnoticed/unused.</p></disp-quote><p>All code and scripts have now been made available (Source code 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Concerns about novelty: besides the obvious similarity from approaches published before additionally there is a paper found on bioRxiv (Predicting CTCF-mediated chromatin interactions by integrating genomic and epigenomic features. Kai et al., 2017) that predicts subTADs based on machine learning of ChIA-PET results. Might be helpful to discuss the pros/cons between methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a section to the Discussion (fourth paragraph) where we highlight several notable differences between our approach and that described in the recent bioRxiv posting cited by the reviewer. Further, a key finding of their work, namely, that strength of cohesin binding is a more significant predictor of CTCF-mediated interactions than strength of CTCF binding, complements our work – where we introduce cohesin binding strength as a key component of our model – and supports the importance of considering cohesin strength in any TAD or subTAD/intra-TAD loop prediction model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) My one main concern is the missing out on an opportunity to clearly distinguish these subTADs from the contact domains defined by Rao et al., 2014 paper on several different cell lines. All the data needed to perform subTAD predictions are available for most (if not all) of these cell lines and a clear, cell-type matched comparison of what subTADs are and how they overlap with contact domains (as well as the subset of loop domains). Only in Figure S4C there is an indirect comparison of contact domains from a mouse B-cell lymphoma cell line (CH12-LX) and subTADs from mouse liver. I think it is crucial for the field to understand similarities and differences of many different definitions of domains and subdomains in order to converge to a consensus. This paper could have done more towards that goal.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive suggestion, as a converging consensus is critical to this rapidly expanding area of research. We have now applied our computational approach to identify intra-TAD loops in two mouse cell types (mESCs and NPCs) from Bonev et al., 2017, which provides CTCF/Cohesin ChIP, TADs, and sub-kilobase resolution Hi-C data (new data, results in Figure 2—figure supplement 3). We also applied our method for loop prediction to two human cell lines using data from Rao et al., 2014, which provides CTCF and Cohesin (Rad21) ChIP-seq data for at least 2 independent biological replicates for GM12878 and K562 cells. Results of these new findings have been added to the manuscript, and are shown in the subsection “Intra-TAD loops in other mouse tissues and in human cells”, and in Figure 2—figure supplements 3 and 4. These new data show that there is greater overlap of our predicted loops with loop domains than contact domains in the human cell lines, and that there is substantial overlap of CTCF-mediated ChIA-PET loops in both the mouse and the human models. Predicted intra-TAD loops are at least as tissue-conserved as TADs, and more so than loop/contact domains. Loops that are predicted across multiple cell types or by both ChIA-PET and our approach tend to be much stronger, suggesting that a substantial core of strong loop predictions are consistently identified across multiple approaches.</p></body></sub-article></article>
