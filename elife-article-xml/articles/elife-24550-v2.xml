In vertebrate cone photoreceptors, Ca<sup>2+</sup> controls photoresponse sensitivity, kinetics, and light adaptation. Despite the critical role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in supporting the function and survival of cones, the mechanism for its extrusion from cone outer segments is not well understood. Here, we show that the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> exchanger NCKX4 is expressed in zebrafish, mouse, and primate cones. Functional analysis of NCKX4-deficient mouse cones revealed that this exchanger is essential for the wide operating range and high temporal resolution of cone-mediated vision. We show that NCKX4 shapes the cone photoresponse together with the cone-specific NCKX2: NCKX4 acts early to limit response amplitude, while NCKX2 acts late to further accelerate response recovery. The regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by NCKX4 in cones is a novel mechanism that supports their ability to function as daytime photoreceptors and promotes their survival.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24550.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24550.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24550.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells known as photoreceptors sense light in the eye. Light activates signaling pathways inside the photoreceptors that relay visual information to nerve cells, which carry the information to the brain. Photoreceptors called cone cells allow us to distinguish different colors of light and therefore play an important role in daytime vision. Over the course of the day, the overall levels of light in the environment can vary widely and so photoreceptors need to be able to adjust their signaling pathways so that they can still respond to light stimuli.</p><p>Calcium ions modulate the signaling pathways inside cone cells to help them adjust to changing light levels. These ions also play other important roles in the health and activity of photoreceptors, so the cells need to carefully control how many calcium ions they contain.</p><p>Cone cells contain a structure known as the outer segment, which is responsible for detecting light stimuli. It is believed that cones control the levels of calcium ions in the outer segment by balancing the flow of calcium ions into and out of the segment. The calcium ions enter the outer segment via channels that sit in the membrane surrounding the cell. A transporter protein known as NCKX2, which is only found in cone cells, was thought to pump the calcium ions out of the cell. However, recent data has challenged this idea by demonstrating that NCKX2 only plays a minor role in this process.</p><p>Vinberg et al. investigated how calcium ions leave the outer segments of cone cells in several different animals. The experiments show that a transporter protein called NCKX4 – which belongs to the same protein family as NCKX2 – is the main transporter involved in removing calcium ions from the cone cells of mice. Loss of NCKX4 from mouse cones reduced the ability of these cells to respond to fast and rapidly changing light stimuli, and to operate in bright light.</p><p>Further experiments show that NCKX4 is also found in the outer segments of zebrafish and monkey cone cells. The next challenges will be to find out if NCKX4 is also present in human cones and whether it plays a role in regulating our daytime vision.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration regulate a wide variety of cellular processes such as synaptic transmission, muscle contraction, and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berridge et al., 2000</xref>). Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration reflects a dynamic balance between influx and efflux pathways, operating through plasma membrane channels or across intracellular stores such as endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. One mechanism for Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux from cells uses the electrochemical gradients of both Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> to extrude Ca<sup>2+</sup> via the SLC24 family of Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> exchangers (NCKX1-5). Roles for SLC24 proteins in physiology and disease are beginning to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Herzog et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li and Lytton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schnetkamp, 2013</xref>) and in several cases appear to involve Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation in sensory neurons. One Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> exchanger with a well-established function is NCKX4 (encoded by <italic>Slc24a4</italic>), which is expressed in olfactory sensory neurons. NCKX4-mediated extrusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cilia of olfactory receptor cells shapes the olfactory response and mediates sensory adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stephan et al., 2011</xref>). Another family member, NCKX1, is expressed strongly in rod photoreceptors and is the dominant mechanism for extruding Ca<sup>2+</sup> from their outer segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reiländer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vinberg et al., 2015</xref>). As a result, NCKX1 plays a critical role for maintaining the dynamic equilibrium of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in rod outer segments and is essential for the normal development, function, and survival of rods and for rod-mediated dim light vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reiländer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riazuddin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vinberg et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms that regulate the extrusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cone photoreceptors, remain controversial. As this process mediates light adaptation, it is critical for the ability of cones to function as our daytime photoreceptors. The prevailing view is that cones also express a cell-specific Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> exchanger, NCKX2, that mediates the extrusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from their outer segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prinsen et al., 2000</xref>), a role analogous to that of NCKX4 in olfactory neurons or NCKX1 in rods. However, in vivo electroretinogram recordings from NCKX2-deficient mice failed to detect any functional deficits in their cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2006</xref>), raising doubts about the role of NCKX2 in regulating cone Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. A recent more detailed analysis of isolated cone responses in NCKX2-deficient mice revealed delayed cone response recovery but normal light sensitivity and light adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakurai et al., 2016</xref>). These results suggest the existence of additional, as yet unidentified, mechanism(s) for extruding Ca<sup>2+</sup> from cone outer segments.</p><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx/efflux balance in cone photoreceptor outer segments is regulated by the activity of the phototransduction cascade. In the dark, part of the continuous current entering the outer segment through transduction cGMP-gated (CNG) channels is carried by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miller and Korenbrot, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Picones and Korenbrot, 1995</xref>), which is then extruded through mechanisms that remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yau and Nakatani, 1984</xref>). Following photoactivation, the closure of CNG channels blocks Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx but Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion continues until a new equilibrium is reached. As a result, light activation is accompanied by a decline in the concentration of outer segment Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sampath et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yau and Nakatani, 1985</xref>). This triggers the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated negative feedback on phototransduction, a process required for the timely recovery of the light response and for the adaptation of photoreceptors to background light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fain et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakatani and Yau, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakurai et al., 2011</xref>). This strong modulation of cone phototransduction allowed us to use functional analysis of cone photoreceptors to investigate the mechanisms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion from their outer segments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The olfactory Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger NCKX4 is expressed in the outer segments of mouse cones</title><p>To identify candidate proteins that might contribute to calcium homeostasis in cones, we examined published microarray data from rod-dominant wild type (WT) and cone-dominant NRL-deficient (<italic>Nrl<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mouse retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corbo et al., 2007</xref>). We noted that the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> exchanger <italic>Nckx4</italic> (<italic>Slc24a4</italic>) was strongly upregulated in the retina of <italic>Nrl<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, suggesting that NCKX4 could potentially be present in cone photoreceptors. This observation is also consistent with results of a recent study on differential expression of genes in rods and cones, where NCKX4 and NCKX2 (<italic>Slc24a2</italic>) were identified as cone-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>). To establish the identity of the retinal cells expressing <italic>Nckx4</italic>, we performed in situ hybridization experiments on retinal sections from WT and <italic>Nrl<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. We found sparse expression of <italic>Nckx4</italic> in cells at the top of the photoreceptor layer (ONL) of WT mouse retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Co-localization of peanut agglutinin (PNA), known to label cone outer segments, with the NCKX4 antibody demonstrated that NCKX4 expression was confined mainly to the cone outer segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, top row). Next, we obtained <italic>Nckx4</italic>-floxed mice (<italic>Nckx4<sup>f/f</sup></italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stephan et al., 2011</xref>]) and crossed them with the cone-specific HGRP Cre mouse line (<italic>Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Le et al., 2004</xref>]) to generate cone-specific <italic>Nckx4</italic> conditional knock-out (<italic>Nckx4<sup>f/f</sup> Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>, see Materials and methods and below) mice. The expression of Cre recombinase alone had no effect on the presence of NCKX4 in cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, middle vs. top rows). However, in <italic>Nckx4<sup>f/f</sup> Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice, NCKX4 immunofluorescence was absent from the cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, bottom row). In contrast, consistent with the cone-specific expression of Cre, the strong NCKX4 staining in the inner nuclear layer was not diminished in <italic>Nckx4<sup>f/f</sup> Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice. Comparable results (not shown) were obtained with another NCKX4 antibody, recently shown to specifically recognize NCKX4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bronckers et al., 2017</xref>). Further validation of the NCKX4 antibody by western blot demonstrated that it reacts with a ~50 kDa protein as was observed by Bronckers et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Thus, the NKCX4 antibody was selective for NCKX4 and did not cross-react with other proteins expressed in rod or cone photoreceptors. Together, these results indicate that the conditional knockout of NCKX4 in cones was successful. Importantly, the density and morphology of PNA-stained NCKX4-deficient cones were indistinguishable from these of wild type cones, suggesting that the absence of NCKX4 did not affect adversely cone survival.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24550.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>NCKX4 is expressed in the outer segments of cone photoreceptors.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Immunostaining for NCKX4 in vertical sections of mouse retinas (photoreceptors on the top).

The leading edge of the NCKX4-deficient cone response was similar to that of control cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, inset), indicating that the activation of the phototransduction reactions was not affected by the absence of NCKX4. Consistent with this, analysis of the amplification constant in control and NCKX4-deficient cones revealed comparable (p&gt;0.05) values of 0.5 ± 0.1 s<sup>−2</sup> (n = 6) and 0.8 ± 0.3 s<sup>−2</sup> (n = 6), respectively.

Thus, the efficiency of phototransduction activation was not compromised by deletion of NCKX4 but light responses were slower, particularly in their recovery, in the <italic>Nckx4<sup>f/f</sup> Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> cones compared to control mice, resulting in larger responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>) and increased sensitivity of cones lacking NCKX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Together these results demonstrate that NCKX4 is important for the timely recovery of cone phototransduction. This conclusion is consistent with the hypothesis that NCKX4 participates in the extrusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from cone outer segments, and thus allows a faster decline of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to accelerate light response termination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NCKX4 shifts the operating range of cones to brighter light and accelerates light adaptation</title><p>Rapid and efficient adaptation of cones to varying ambient illumination is required for proper visual function.

We began by measuring the kinetics of cone light adaptation in response to near half-saturating steps of light (see legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Both <italic>Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> control and <italic>Nckx4<sup>f/f</sup> Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> cones responded to the onset of a light step with initial hyperpolarization followed by an adaptation-mediated relaxation to a plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Thus, despite the absence of NCKX4, cones were able to undergo light adaptation in response to steady background light. However, the response relaxation appeared slower in NCKX4-deficient cones compared to that in control cones, suggesting a delay in Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion. The kinetics of light adaptation in response to a step of light could be fit by a sum of two exponential functions in both control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) and <italic>Nckx4<sup>f/f</sup> Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).

Here we report for the first time that NCKX4 is expressed in fish, mouse, and non-human primate cone (but not rod) photoreceptor outer segments and is required for rapid cone response recovery, light adaptation, and normal photopic vision. Our results provide explanation for the surprisingly mild cone phenotype of <italic>Nckx2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakurai et al., 2016</xref>) by demonstrating that NCKX4 is critical for the phototransduction feedback driven by extrusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from cone outer segments. We propose that use of two exchangers in cones may contribute to their unique functional properties, including rapid photoresponses, efficient adaptation, and a dynamic range suitable for daytime function. Such duplicity could also protect against severe visual disorders caused by mutations in individual <italic>Nckx2</italic> or <italic>Nckx4</italic> genes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Role of NCKX4 in cone phototransduction and light adaptation</title><p>The main effect of NCKX4 removal is to slow the cone light response recovery and to increase the peak amplitude of subsaturating flash responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), indicating slower Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion and phototransduction feedback. Detailed comparison of dim flash response waveforms from control and NCKX4-deficient cones demonstrates that the efficiency of phototransduction activation reactions is not affected by the presumptive slower Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Interestingly, dark-adapted NCKX4-deficient cone flash responses resemble those of GCAPs knockout cones in which the Ca<sup>2+</sup> feedback that accelerates cGMP synthesis is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakurai et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, NCKX4 appears to be important for rapidly lowering [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in cones following light-induced closure of CNG channels to mediate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> feedbacks in the time scale of flash responses (~500 ms).</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> contributes significantly to both rod and cone light adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fain et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakatani and Yau, 1988</xref>). Without Ca<sup>2+</sup> feedback, it has been suggested that rod cells would simply integrate single photon responses and saturate at very dim background light intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matthews et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakatani and Yau, 1988</xref>). Thus, disrupting Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion is expected to compromise light adaptation. Indeed, we found that deletion of NCKX4 delays light adaptation and shifts the operating range of cones to dimmer light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). However, cones without NCKX4 still adapt according to the Weber-Fechner law, indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is still extruded from their outer segments. The lack of detectable cone degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) and the normal cone light response amplitudes of NCKX4-deficient cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) also support the existence of additional Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion pathways in cones. Our results from cones lacking both NCKX2 and NCKX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) suggest that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion from NCKX4-deficient cones is mainly via NCKX2. This exchanger is expressed in chicken, human and mouse cones, where it has been shown to regulate cone phototransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prinsen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakurai et al., 2016</xref>). We propose that the combined activity of NCKX2 and NCKX4 is required for the rapid and efficient extrusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from cones and that this enables these cells to adapt rapidly and remain functional in a wide range of light backgrounds throughout the day.</p><p>Interestingly, adaptation was apparent even in cones lacking both NCKX2 and NCKX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9f</xref>). Our results do not allow us to distinguish between calcium-dependent and calcium-independent mechanisms of light adaptation in NCKX2/NCKX4-deficient cones. One possibility is that residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion somehow persists even in the combined absence of NCKX2 and NCKX4. Indeed, slow NCKX-independent extrusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been recently suggested for rod outer segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vinberg et al., 2015</xref>). Such a mechanism might be common to all photoreceptors, potentially serving as a safety valve for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Alternatively, it is possible that some residual calcium-independent adaptation exists in cones and becomes unmasked when Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion is blocked in NCKX-deficient cones.</p><p>By comparing the functional deficiency of cones lacking NCKX4 with the recent results from cones lacking NCKX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakurai et al., 2016</xref>), it is possible to identify the primary mechanism for Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion in cones. Whereas the deletion of both NCKX4 and NCKX2 causes a notable delay in the cone response recovery, the effect is substantially more pronounced in NCKX4-deficient cones than in NCKX2-deficient cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9d</xref>). In addition, the amplitude of the single photon response and, consequently, cone sensitivity are also substantially (&gt;2 fold) increased in the absence of NCKX4 compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), whereas a similar analysis of NCKX2-deficient cones revealed only subtle increase in the single photon response amplitude and no change in cone sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakurai et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the extrusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that modulates phototransduction after photoactivation appears to be dominated initially by NCKX4, with NCKX2 contributing mostly during the late phase of the flash response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9d</xref>). Such temporal separation could be the result of different kinetics or ionic equilibrium of inactivation of the two exchangers, enabling them to differentially modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion. Regardless of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the activities of NCKX2 and NCKX4, our findings lead to the conclusion that NCKX4 is the dominant Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion pathway in cone outer segments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Redundant roles of NCKX2 and NCKX4 in cone survival</title><p>Whereas the number of cones was similar between single knockout of NCKX2, NCKX4 and control <italic>Gnat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse retinas, removal of both exchangers had a marked effect on cone structure/function and survival. Results in the DKO retinas are similar to the findings from NCKX1-deficient rods, where the removal of the sole exchanger presumably renders the cells unable to efficiently extrude Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Importantly, lowering of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulates retinal guanylyl cyclase to synthesize cGMP through the action of GCAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dizhoor et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gorczyca et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mendez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palczewski et al., 1994</xref>). In support of this mechanism, we measured lowered cGMP levels in NCKX1-deficient retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vinberg et al., 2015</xref>). Due to the high cooperativity of the cGMP-gated channel, lowered cGMP provides an explanation for the large decrease in light sensitivity in <italic>Nckx1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> retinas. We hypothesize that loss of both NCKX2 and NCKX4 in cones has the same effect as loss of NCKX1 in rods. That is, in the absence of NCKX-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion, cGMP synthesis is not stimulated, and more cGMP-gated channels remain closed, leading to the observed dramatic decrease in response amplitude and light sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Over the long-term, the disrupted Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis may gradually lead to cone death.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Differences between rods and cones</title><p>The striking differences in adaptation capacity and kinetics of daytime color vision and dim-light vision can be attributed in part to the distinctive physiological properties of rods and cones, that is cones have faster light response kinetics and are able to remain functional under brighter light than rods. However, the molecular origins of these differences remain incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ingram et al., 2016</xref>). Biochemical evidence from non-mammalian species have shown faster decay of Meta II (active form of visual pigment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shichida et al., 1994</xref>), higher expression of RGS9 and resulting faster inactivation of PDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tachibanaki et al., 2012</xref>), faster synthesis rate of cGMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takemoto et al., 2009</xref>) and higher arrestin content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomizuka et al., 2015</xref>) in cones compared to rods. Such differences could potentially explain the faster function of cones compared to rods. However, direct physiological evidence of the significance of these molecular differences is still lacking, and it is not known if these differences hold in mammalian phototoreceptors. As light adaptation in both rods and cones is mediated by the light-induced decline in Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matthews et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakatani and Yau, 1988</xref>), it is reasonable to assume that the better light adaptation capacity of cones is mediated by more efficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion and Ca<sup>2+</sup> feedback. However, recent results indicate that one of the main Ca<sup>2+</sup> feedbacks, mediated by GCAP1/2, contributes similarly to the light adaptation capacity of rods and cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakurai et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, although recoverin appears to modulate cone phototransduction somewhat more efficiently than rod phototransduction, its role in light adaptation is quite marginal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Makino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sakurai et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the remaining possibility is that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent modulation of cone CNG channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Korenbrot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rebrik et al., 2012</xref>) together with larger and faster changes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the outer segments of cones between dark and bright light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sampath et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">1998</xref>) contribute to the faster and wider range of daytime cone-mediated vision compared to rod-mediated nighttime vision. Our data demonstrates that the cone-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger NCKX4 accelerates the responses of cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and cone-mediated vision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and shifts the operating range of cones to brighter background lights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). By doing so, NCKX4 contributes to the unique properties of cones and their ability to operate at brighter light as compared to rods.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Cell-specificity of NCKX expression in the mouse retina</title><p>Our recent work and the results presented here demonstrate that NCKX1 is the sole Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger expressed in rods, whereas cones express both NCKX2 and NCKX4 (but not NCKX1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakurai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vinberg et al., 2015</xref>]).

The reason for tissue/cell-specific expression patterns of different NCKX isoforms is still unclear, particularly considering the similarities in their biophysical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jalloul et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is known that NCKX1 dimers form hetero-oligomers with the rod transduction CNG channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bauer and Drechsler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poetsch et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwarzer et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schwarzer et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with this notion, our recent results suggest that NCKX1 is important for normal rod channel function and that deletion of NCKX1 leads to reduced expression and lower conductance of rod CNG channels in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vinberg et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, deletion of NCKX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakurai et al., 2016</xref>) or of NCKX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) does not affect the dark current of cones. The simplest explanation for this result is that, in contrast to the case in rods, the expression of NCKX does not control the expression or conductance of cone CNG channels. Such a scenario is consistent with biochemical evidence that NCKX2 does not interact directly with CNGA3 in cone outer segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matveev et al., 2008</xref>). However, coexpression of NCKX2 and CNGA3 in HEK293 cells was found to result in direct interaction between these two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kang et al., 2003</xref>), indicating that this issue will require further investigation.</p><p>Our data here also explains the striking phenotypic difference between deletion of NCKX1 (and nonsense mutation in the <italic>SLC24A1</italic> gene encoding NCKX1 that cause night blindness in humans) leading to 100-fold reduction of rod response amplitudes and severely compromised dim light vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vinberg et al., 2015</xref>), as compared to deletion of either NCKX2 or NCKX4 in cones leading only to altered kinetics of light responses and light adaptation without affecting cone dark current. The redundancy of NCKX2 and NCKX4 may further explain why mutations in NCKX2 or NCKX4 have not been linked to eye diseases.

Briefly, the dorsal half (dominated by M-cones) of the retina was flat-mounted photoreceptor-side upwards on a filter paper (HABG01300, Millipore, MA). A manual slicer was then used to cut a 200–250 μm vertical slice that was mounted on the bottom of a specimen holder by attaching the filter paper side of the slice on a wall made from vacuum grease (111, Dow Corning, MI). The slice was perfused at 3 ml/min with 37°C Locke’s solution containing (in mM): NaCl, 112; KCl, 3.6; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.4; 1.2, CaCl<sub>2</sub>; HEPES, 10; NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20; Na<sub>2</sub>-succinate, 3; Na-glutamate, 0.5; glucose, 10. In addition, the solution was supplemented with 0.1% of MEM vitamins and amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich, MO), and equilibrated with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C. The slice was visualized under infrared light with inverted microscope and the proximal outer nuclear layer was targeted with a glass pipette (tip resistance ~0.6 MΩ, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) containing (mM): NaCl, 140; KCl, 3.6; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.4; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2; HEPES, 3; and glucose, 10; pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH.

Transretinal voltage between the electrodes of the specimen holder was amplified (100X) by a differential amplifier (DP-311, Warner Instruments, CT) and data were low-pass filtered and collected at 300 Hz and 10 kHz, respectively, by using the same digitizer and analog low-pass filter as in suction electrode recordings (see above).

Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (15 mg/kg) cocktail and the eyes were dilated with drops of 1% atropine sulfate. During the recordings the mouse body temperature was maintained at ~37°C by using ATC1000 (World Precision Instruments, FL) temperature control system with mouse heating pad (model 502195, World Precision Instruments, FL). DC ERG signal between corneal electrodes (STelesSR, LKC Technologies, MD) and a reference electrode inserted under the skin at the skull as a response to flickering light at frequencies between 5 and 20 Hz were acquired at 1000 Hz with low-pass filter set at 300 Hz.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Fred Rieke, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Clint Makino (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers felt the paper made an important contribution to our understanding of cone function. Several points emerged as particularly important in the discussion among the reviewers:</p><p>1) Antibody validation. The immunohistochemistry is based on a newly developed antibody, and thus it is particularly important to validate its specificity. There are specific suggestions in the reviews, and the Journal of Comparative Neurology standards for reporting immunohistochemistry results also provide good guidelines. It is particularly important to include western blots of WT, NCKX KO and double KO.</p><p>2) Rising phase analysis. The lack of effect of NCKX4 deletion on the rising phase of the light response is a key point of interpretation. This needs to be shown more clearly (i.e. on an expanded time base) and quantified.</p><p>3) Writing. More care is needed to distinguish the direct observations in the paper (e.g. impact of NCKX deletion on light responses) from inferences (e.g. impact on calcium levels). This is particularly an issue in the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper explores the role of NCKX4 in cone photoreceptor function. The main conclusion is that NCKX2 and NCKX4 together regulate cone calcium levels and aspect of phototransduction that depend on calcium. The experiments generally appear well done and the data is clear. I have some concerns about the directness of the conclusions. Most importantly, in my view the paper could be considerably strengthened if a few of the interesting issues raised were explored in more depth.</p><p>1) Amplification phase of light response.</p><p>An important result in the paper is that NCKX4 deletion does not alter the rising phase of the light response. This is based in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. But the time base in the figure is too long to compare rising phases with any confidence, and quantification is needed to support the statement that the rising phases are unchanged as stated in the text.</p><p>2) Remaining adaptation.</p><p>Adaptation appears to persist in the absence of both NCKX2 and NCKX4. This is presented as a surprise, but then is not pursued. The conclusion reached in the paper is that cones possess another means of regulating calcium; this rests on the assumption that there are not calcium-independent forms of adaptation, and I think this assumption should be stated clearly.</p><p>3) Lack of NCKX2 data.</p><p>The paper is weakened by the fact that the NCKX2 data was published elsewhere, and is not part of the present paper. One of the most interesting aspects of the paper is the apparent functional redundancy of the two proteins. The paper would be much stronger if complementary experiments were presented for cones lacking each protein individually and both together. Could some of the data from the previous paper be replotted here for comparison?</p><p>4) Lack of direct measures of calcium.</p><p>In much of the paper, changes in response are equated with changes in calcium. In a few instances, the fact that this is an inference and not direct correspondence is clear, but in many cases the implications for changes in calcium are presented too strongly. I think it is quite important to separate the experimental observations from the inferences made about calcium signaling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Vinberg et al. describes carefully executed experiments to address the question of Ca extrusions mechanisms in retinal cone outer segments. It was long assumed that the NCKX2 Na/Ca-K exchanger was the main extrusion mechanism in this preparation based on the presence of abundant NCKX2 transcripts in chicken and human retinal cone photoreceptors and I gather the assumption that no redundancy in the form of other Na/Ca(-K) exchangers was present (as is the case in retinal rod photoreceptors). The fact that the NCKX2-/- mice showed only modest deficiencies in cone responses (as detailed in a previous publication by these authors) clearly showed the above assumptions were incorrect. In this paper, the authors identify NCKX4 as the &quot;additional&quot; Ca extrusion mechanism in mouse cone outer segments and using cone-specific knockdown of NCKX4. The authors combine immunohistochemistry with various methods of analyzing in detail cone photoresponses in retinas of various mouse models to arrive at their conclusions. I believe this is an excellent paper addressing a key outstanding question about the role of Na/ca-K exchangers and I recommend to publish this paper in <italic>eLife</italic> after the authors address the following minor concerns:</p><p>1) The immunohistochemistry is all based a novel NCKX4 antibody developed by the authors. I think for new antibodies it would be very helpful to carry out validation by demonstrating reactivity and specificity against in this case NCKX4 expressed in cell lines transfected with NCKX4 cDNA. The authors here show immunohistochemistry of WT and NCKX4 KO animals but only with cone-specific knockdown. Significant immunoreactivity is observed elsewhere in the retina. Have the authors carried out characterization of their antibody in cell lines expressing transfected NCKX4 or have they carried out immunohistochemistry in the NCKX2-4 DKO? Western blots of retinal extracts from WT and the various KO animals would address this well.</p><p>2) I noticed that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> the PNA and NCKX4 do not really co-localize but are found in different parts of the cone outer segment? This is in contrast to the zebrafish and macaque retinas where co-localization appears to be observed. Can the authors comment on this discrepancy?</p><p>3) In the subsection “Cell-specificity of NCKX expression in the mouse retina”, the authors argue that lack of reduced dark current in either the NCKX2 or NCKX4 KO would be consistent with a lack of interaction between CNGA3 and either NCKX2 or NCKX4. Not sure if I am convinced about this argument as it would require careful measurements of NCKX2 and NCKX4 expression and although Matveev et al. failed to detect an interaction between NCKX2 and CNGA3, co-expression of both in HEK293 cells was shown to result in a direct interaction between these two proteins (Kang et al., Biochemistry 42: 4593).</p><p>4) I would prefer to see the olfactory deleted from the title. Since NCKX4 was cloned it has been clear that NCKX4 had a broader expression pattern compared with say NCKX1 and the authors list in the introduction a number of other tissues in which NCKX4 has been shown to play an important role.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Calcium is a key regulator of phototransduction in rods and cones. Calcium enters the cone outer segment through ion channels and is removed by an exchanger, thought to be NCKX2. In mutant mice that develop an all cone retina at the expense of rods, expression of the olfactory exchanger NCKX4 was upregulated suggesting that it might be part of the cone phototransduction machinery. The present study confirms the hypothesis by mapping its expression in retina to cones and rod bipolar cells and by recording the electrical responses of cones from mice in which either NCKX4 or NCKX2 and NCKX4 expression was blocked. Absence of NCKX4 alone slowed flash response recovery so that the photon response continued to build for a longer time to a larger amplitude and it subsequently recovered slowly. The cones remained fully capable of adapting to light, but their Weber Fechner relation was shifted to lower intensities. Knockout of NCKX2 and 4 caused a slow degeneration but before cones disappeared, they did respond to light. Maximal response amplitude was reduced, flash responses had even slower kinetics and sensitivity was lower by an order of magnitude. The work greatly furthers our understanding of cone physiology and helps to explain the unexpectedly mild phenotype of NCKX2 knockout in cones. It reveals the existence of an additional mechanism for controlling intracellular calcium and raises other interesting issues about the role of calcium that will need to be characterized in future studies. The work should therefore be of general interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> exchanger NCKX4 is required for efficient cone-mediated vision&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Paul Schnetkamp (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper is much improved. There is a request for western blots to help validate the new NCKX antibody used in the paper. Including such data – specifically testing whether the antibody recognizes a protein with the correct MW – would help both validate data in the current paper and help determine how useful the new NCKX4 antibody is more generally.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>I believe the authors have done an excellent job to address this reviewer's comments, and, as far as I can tell, also the comments by the other two reviewers. I still would have liked to have seen a western blot of retinal homogenates that clearly demonstrates the presence of NCKX4 protein as recognized by the antibody used. NCKX proteins show a quite specific pattern of labeling, for example as shown in the Bronckers et al. paper that uses the validated Neuromab NCKX4 antibody, used here in the new immunohistochemistry images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Based on on the NCKX4 staining in the retina I would expect to see clear NCKX4 bands in a western blot of retinal homogenates of WT retinas (even more so in a western blot of retinal homogenates of the Nrl-/- mouse).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript is improved.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24550.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>All three reviewers felt the paper made an important contribution to our understanding of cone function. Several points emerged as particularly important in the discussion among the reviewers:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Antibody validation. The immunohistochemistry is based on a newly developed antibody, and thus it is particularly important to validate its specificity. There are specific suggestions in the reviews, and the Journal of Comparative Neurology standards for reporting immunohistochemistry results also provide good guidelines. It is particularly important to include western blots of WT, NCKX KO and double KO.</italic> </p><p>We have addressed this point in detail in our reply to the comment of reviewer 2 below. Briefly, we believe that our results already provide strong immunocutochemistry evidence for the specificity of our antibody. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> clearly demonstrates that the conditional knockout of NCKX4 in cones results in selective loss of the NCKX4 antibody staining in these cells without affecting the staining in the inner retina. Western blot analysis of retinal homogenates will not provide any meaningful information in this case, because of the remaining NCKX4 expression in the retina and because cones are a very minor cell population in the retina. We have tried cone isolation but currently we cannot obtain sufficient quantities for western blots.</p><p>In an effort to address this point further, we performed immunocytochemistry experiments with a different NCKX4 antibody that was just validated by another group (Bronckers et al., 2017). The results we obtained were comparable to the ones with our own antibody and are now provided as an additional column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and mentioned in the corresponding Results section (subsection “The olfactory Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger NCKX4 is expressed in the outer segments of mouse cones”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Rising phase analysis. The lack of effect of NCKX4 deletion on the rising phase of the light response is a key point of interpretation. This needs to be shown more clearly (i.e. on an expanded time base) and quantified.</italic> </p><p>We have performed the requested analysis and now include the quantification of the rising phase of the cone response in control and NCKX4-deficient cones in the Results section (subsection “NCKX4 is required for the fast inactivation of mouse cone phototransduction”, last paragraph). We have revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> to show in an inset the rising phase of the response on an expanded time scale as requested.</p><p><italic>3) Writing. More care is needed to distinguish the direct observations in the paper (e.g. impact of NCKX deletion on light responses) from inferences (e.g. impact on calcium levels). This is particularly an issue in the discussion.</italic> </p><p>We have revised the manuscript, with particular attention to the Discussion to address this issue.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>This paper explores the role of NCKX4 in cone photoreceptor function. The main conclusion is that NCKX2 and NCKX4 together regulate cone calcium levels and aspect of phototransduction that depend on calcium. The experiments generally appear well done and the data is clear. I have some concerns about the directness of the conclusions. Most importantly, in my view the paper could be considerably strengthened if a few of the interesting issues raised were explored in more depth.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Amplification phase of light response.</italic></p><p><italic>An important result in the paper is that NCKX4 deletion does not alter the rising phase of the light response. This is based in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. But the time base in the figure is too long to compare rising phases with any confidence, and quantification is needed to support the statement that the rising phases are unchanged as stated in the text.</italic> </p><p>We have revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> to include an inset showing the rising phase of the photoresponse on an expanded time scale. We have also included analysis of the leading edge of the photoresponse by determining the amplification constant of the rising phase in control and NCKX4-deficient cone responses: “analysis of the amplification constant in control and NCKX4-deficient cones revealed comparable (p&gt;0.05) values of 0.5 ± 0.1 s<sup>-2</sup> (N = 6) and 0.8 ± 0.3 s<sup>-2</sup> (N = 6), respectively. […] Thus, the efficiency of phototransduction activation was not compromised by deletion of NCKX4 but light responses were slower, particularly in their recovery, in the Nckx4<sup>f/f</sup> Cre<sup>+</sup> cones compared to control mice, resulting in larger responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and increased sensitivity of cones lacking NCKX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).”</p><p><italic>2) Remaining adaptation.</italic></p><p><italic>Adaptation appears to persist in the absence of both NCKX2 and NCKX4. This is presented as a surprise, but then is not pursued. The conclusion reached in the paper is that cones possess another means of regulating calcium; this rests on the assumption that there are not calcium-independent forms of adaptation, and I think this assumption should be stated clearly.</italic> </p><p>Our data does not allow us to distinguish between calcium-dependent and calcium-independent mechanisms of light adaptation in NCKX2/4-deficient cones. One possibility is that calcium is still somehow extruded from cone outer segments even in the absence of both NCKX2 and NCKX4. Alternatively, it is possible that some residual calcium-independent adaptation is functioning in cones and is unmasked by our block of calcium extrusion. To address the reviewer’s request, we have explicitly stated the two possibilities in the revised Results (subsection “Cones require both NCKX2 and NCKX4 for normal structure and function”, last paragraph) and Discussion (subsection “Role of NCKX4 in cone phototransduction and light adaptation”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Lack of NCKX2 data.</italic></p><p><italic>The paper is weakened by the fact that the NCKX2 data was published elsewhere, and is not part of the present paper. One of the most interesting aspects of the paper is the apparent functional redundancy of the two proteins. The paper would be much stronger if complementary experiments were presented for cones lacking each protein individually and both together. Could some of the data from the previous paper be replotted here for comparison?</italic> </p><p>To address the reviewer’s request, we have included dim flash responses from control and NCKX2-deficient cones as an inset to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref> for comparison.</p><p><italic>4) Lack of direct measures of calcium.</italic></p><p><italic>In much of the paper, changes in response are equated with changes in calcium. In a few instances, the fact that this is an inference and not direct correspondence is clear, but in many cases the implications for changes in calcium are presented too strongly. I think it is quite important to separate the experimental observations from the inferences made about calcium signaling.</italic> </p><p>We have revised the manuscript, with particular emphasis on the Discussion, in an effort to address this issue.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The immunohistochemistry is all based a novel NCKX4 antibody developed by the authors. I think for new antibodies it would be very helpful to carry out validation by demonstrating reactivity and specificity against in this case NCKX4 expressed in cell lines transfected with NCKX4 cDNA. The authors here show immunohistochemistry of WT and NCKX4 KO animals but only with cone-specific knockdown. Significant immunoreactivity is observed elsewhere in the retina. Have the authors carried out characterization of their antibody in cell lines expressing transfected NCKX4 or have they carried out immunohistochemistry in the NCKX2-4 DKO? Western blots of retinal extracts from WT and the various KO animals would address this well.</italic> </p><p>We did not perform western blot analysis because the bulk of NCKX4 in the retina is not expressed in cones, but rather in rod bipolar cells as we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>-3. Considering that cones represent only a small fraction of the neurons in the mouse retina (3% of all photoreceptors), and based on our experience with other cone-specific knockouts, we would expect that the reduction in the overall retinal NCKX4 expression in cone-specific NCKX4 knockout mice will be difficult to discern by western blots of retinal homogenates. We would respectfully reason that this issue is already clearly resolved by our immunocytochemistry results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which show the selective removal of NCKX4 immunoreactivity from cones but nor rod bipolar cells in cone-specific NCKX4 knockout mice. This result clearly demonstrates that our NCKX4 antibody is selective for NCKX4 and does not cross-react with NCKX2 or any other protein in cone photoreceptors. Essentially, this represents the experiment suggested by reviewer 2 but carried out in the relevant cone cells in the intact retina rather than in a cell line.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that as we do not have a knockout of NCKX4 that blocks its expression in the rest of the retina, we cannot experimentally test the specificity of the NCKX4 antibody in rod bipolar cells. To address this issue, we have revised the corresponding section of the Results to now read: “These results suggest that in addition to its presence in the outer segments of mouse cone photoreceptors, NCKX4 might be expressed in rod bipolar cells, where it could potentially be involved in regulating retinal synaptic transmission and signal processing. However, further experiments will be required to confirm the expression of NCKX4 in rod bipolar cells and to determine its potential role for rod signaling.”</p><p>While we were working on the revision of our manuscript, a paper was published that used a commercial NCKX4 antibody which they validated in their studies (Bronckers et al., 2017, Calcif Tissue Int, 100: 80-86). To address the reviewer’s concern, we acquired and tested that antibody and obtained results comparable to the ones shown in the original submission of our manuscript with the use of our antibody. We have now included that data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and comment on the antibody validation more explicitly in the Results section (subsection “The olfactory Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger NCKX4 is expressed in the outer segments of mouse cones”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) I noticed that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> the PNA and NCKX4 do not really co-localize but are found in different parts of the cone outer segment? This is in contrast to the zebrafish and macaque retinas where co-localization appears to be observed. Can the authors comment on this discrepancy?</italic> </p><p>PNA labels the inner segment more intensely than the outer segment sheath in cones of many species that have been examined (for example, see “Specific binding of peanut lectin to a class of retinal photoreceptor cells. A species comparison” by Blanks and Johnson, IOVS 25:546-557). In addition, PNA staining pattern can be altered by tissue fixation differences. We think that the reviewer’s observation of a difference in localization is likely due to differences in fixation between the different tissues, leading to some alteration of PNA staining. In contrast, NCKX4 labeling is consistently observed in the outer segment in all species presented here.</p><p><italic>3) In the subsection “Cell-specificity of NCKX expression in the mouse retina”, the authors argue that lack of reduced dark current in either the NCKX2 or NCKX4 KO would be consistent with a lack of interaction between CNGA3 and either NCKX2 or NCKX4. Not sure if I am convinced about this argument as it would require careful measurements of NCKX2 and NCKX4 expression and although Matveev et al. failed to detect an interaction between NCKX2 and CNGA3, co-expression of both in HEK293 cells was shown to result in a direct interaction between these two proteins (Kang et al., Biochemistry 42: 4593).</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that our results provide suggestive but certainly not definitive support for the lack of interaction between NCKX2/4 and the cone CNG channel. To address this point, we have revised the relevant text to now read: “The simplest explanation for this result is that, in contrast to the case in rods, the expression of NCKX does not control the expression or conductance of cone CNG channels. […] However, coexpression of NCKX2 and CNGA3 in HEK293 cells was found to results in direct interaction between these two proteins (Kang et al. 2003), indicating that this issue will require further investigation.”</p><p><italic>4) I would prefer to see the olfactory deleted from the title. Since NCKX4 was cloned it has been clear that NCKX4 had a broader expression pattern compared with say NCKX1 and the authors list in the introduction a number of other tissues in which NCKX4 has been shown to play an important role.</italic> </p><p>We have removed “olfactory” from the Title and Abstract as suggested.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The paper is much improved. There is a request for western blots to help validate the new NCKX antibody used in the paper. Including such data – specifically testing whether the antibody recognizes a protein with the correct MW – would help both validate data in the current paper and help determine how useful the new NCKX4 antibody is more generally.</italic> </p><p>We have performed the western blot analysis and now include that data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. The antibody recognizes a protein of ~50 kD. The molecular weight is comparable to the results obtained in the recently published data from Bronckers et al. using a commercial antibody (N414/25, NeuroMab, UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility) which was validated using western blot of enamel organ from wildtype and NCKX4 knockout mice. As discussed in the letter accompanying our previous resubmission, we did not perform western blot analysis from the cone-specific NCKX4 knockout mice as the overall expression of NCKX4 in the retina is unlikely to change significantly due to the small number of cones. Further, we also purchased the N414/25 antibody and reproduced identical ICC images as those obtained using our antibody (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Following the successful validation of our NCKX4 antibody, we also removed the 2 panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> showing control immunostainings with the antibody recently used by Bronckers and colleagues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>I believe the authors have done an excellent job to address this reviewer's comments, and, as far as I can tell, also the comments by the other two reviewers. I still would have liked to have seen a Western blot of retinal homogenates that clearly demonstrates the presence of NCKX4 protein as recognized by the antibody used. NCKX proteins show a quite specific pattern of labeling, for example as shown in the Bronckers et al. paper that uses the validated Neuromab NCKX4 antibody, used here in the new immunohistochemistry images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.
