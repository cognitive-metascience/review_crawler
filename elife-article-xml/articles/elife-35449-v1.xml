These parasites alternate between asexual reproduction in molluscan hosts and sexual reproduction in mammalian hosts; short-lived, water-borne stages infect each host. Thriving in such disparate environments requires remarkable developmental plasticity, manifested by five body plans deployed throughout the parasite’s life cycle. Stem cells in <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> provide a potential source for such plasticity; however, the relationship between stem cells from different life-cycle stages remains unclear, as does the origin of the germline, required for sexual reproduction. Here, we show that subsets of larvally derived stem cells are likely sources of adult stem cells and the germline. We also identify a novel gene that serves as the earliest marker for the schistosome germline, which emerges inside the mammalian host and is ultimately responsible for disease pathology. This work reveals the stem cell heterogeneity driving the propagation of the schistosome life cycle.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35449.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Parasitic flatworms called schistosomes infect around 250 million people, causing the disease schistosomiasis. Schistosomes live complex lives, spending part of their life cycle inside snails and part of it inside mammals; short-lived, water-borne stages infect each of these hosts. To thrive in such different environments, schistosomes go through several life-cycle stages. At each stage the flatworms transition to a new body plan adapted to its new environment. Understanding how these transitions occur could help researchers devise new strategies for eliminating these parasites.</p><p>Previous research suggested that stem cells help schistosomes transition to new body plans. Stem cells have the ability to transform into many different cell types, and have been found in schistosome larvae and adults. However, the relationship between the larval and adult stem cells was not clear.</p><p>Wang et al. used transcriptional profiling, a technique that measures the genes currently in use in different cells, to study the stem cells in the schistosome species <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>. This uncovered four types of stem cell, each of which uses a slightly different combination of genes. Examining the behaviour of these cells at different schistosome life-cycle stages revealed that certain larval stem cells produce adult stem cells. Other larval stem cells seem to be the source of the ‘germline’ cells that make gametes (egg and sperm) and allow the parasites to reproduce sexually.</p><p>Schistosomes only produce germline cells when they are inside mammals. Wang et al. found that as juvenile flatworms develop inside mouse blood vessels, a gene called <italic>eledh</italic> becomes active in some of their stem cells. Further investigation showed that this activity is the earliest indicator that germline cells are developing and is also required for proper development of the germline. This knowledge, along with future work to characterize the roles of the stem cell populations identified by Wang et al., could ultimately help researchers develop new ways to stop the spread of schistosomiasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Schistosoma mansoni</kwd><kwd>Biomphalaria glabrata</kwd><kwd>schistosome</kwd><kwd>flatworm</kwd><kwd>parasite</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Award at the Scientific Interface</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000997</institution-id><institution>Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newmark</surname><given-names>Phillip A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Distinct stem cell populations drive larval, somatic, and germline development of the human parasitic flatworm, <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flatworms include more than 44,000 parasitic species that form one of the largest groups of metazoan endoparasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loker and Hofkin, 2015</xref>). Their life cycles typically involve asexually and sexually reproducing stages, each with its own distinct body plan and strategy to enhance transmission between multiple hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clark, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pearce and MacDonald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Viney and Cable, 2011</xref>). Although the life cycles of these parasites were established more than a century ago, they have only recently been studied in cellular and molecular terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matthews, 2011</xref>). Since many parasitic flatworms are pathogenic, their life cycles are also the routes for disease transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoffmann et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, a deeper understanding of these life cycles is significant from both basic science and medical perspectives, as blocking transmission is an effective approach to fighting parasitic diseases.</p><p>Focusing on the cells that may drive such parasitic life cycles, we study <italic>Schistosoma</italic>, a parasitic flatworm infecting over 250 million people, which causes the major neglected tropical disease, schistosomiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoffmann et al., 2014</xref>). Schistosomes are transmitted through snail intermediate and human definitive hosts. Their life cycle begins with the parasite egg excreted from the mammalian host into water, releasing a free-swimming miracidium larva. The miracidium penetrates a snail host and transforms into a mother sporocyst that undergoes asexual clonal expansion to produce many daughter sporocysts that leave the mother and colonize other snail tissues. These daughters either self-renew to produce more daughters or enter embryogenesis to produce infective cercariae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng and Bier, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jourdane and Theron, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Whitfield and Evans, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Taft et al., 2009</xref>). This cloning process is repeated, allowing massive numbers of cercariae to be produced from a single miracidium. Mature cercariae emerge from the snail into water, then burrow through the skin of a mammalian host to become schistosomula. This transition initiates the sexual portion of the life cycle. Schistosomula then migrate to species-specific niches in the host vasculature and develop into juvenile worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basch, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilson, 2009</xref>). Juveniles remodel their tissues extensively to build a functional digestive system, and after they begin feeding on host blood, undergo massive growth and develop sexual reproductive organs de novo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clegg, 1965</xref>). Male and female worms pair to produce fertilized eggs, which are excreted to continue the life cycle.</p><p>A long-standing hypothesis proposes that a lineage of totipotent stem cells, called ‘germinal cells’, persists throughout the schistosome life cycle and drives reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cort et al., 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clark, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Whitfield and Evans, 1983</xref>). Histological and ultrastructural studies defined these cells in miracidia and sporocysts by their stem cell-like morphology and rapid proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schutte, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pan, 1980</xref>). Recently, we showed that these germinal cells indeed drive proliferation within developing sporocysts and share some molecular signatures with stem cells from diverse organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the cellular source of the schistosome germline, which underlies sexual reproduction in the mammalian host, remains an open question. Furthermore, because somatic stem cells were only recently identified in adult schistosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2013</xref>), the relationships between germinal cells, germ cells, and somatic stem cells are unclear.</p><p>To clarify these relationships, we transcriptionally profiled stem cells from <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> asexual (sporocyst) and sexual (juvenile) stages at both population and single-cell levels. We identified four transcriptionally distinct populations and validated this heterogeneity by in situ hybridization. By characterizing the behavior of these stem cells at major developmental transitions, we found that larvally derived stem cells serve as the source for the parasite’s adult stem cells. We also identified a novel gene that is activated during development inside the mammalian host and serves as the earliest marker for the schistosome germline. This work reveals the stem cell heterogeneity underlying the development and propagation of these important parasites.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell RNAseq defines three major sporocyst stem cell classes</title><p>Each miracidium carries 10–20 germinal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pan, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cort et al., 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), which expand massively and differentiate to produce many daughter sporocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Based on projections along the first two PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Treutlein et al., 2014</xref>), we identified additional genes that contribute to the distinctions between classes: a schistosome <italic>p53</italic> homolog and a zinc finger protein (<italic>zfp-1</italic>) expressed abundantly in δ-cells and at lower levels in φ-cells; and a hes family transcription factor (<italic>hesl</italic>) expressed specifically in φ-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We validated these transcriptomic findings by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on in vitro-cultured mother sporocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

However, these genes comprise only a small fraction of transcripts detected in these cells (N = 6,661), and most of them are not enriched in stem cells compared to differentiated cells. Notably, very few transcripts are specific to individual cell classes, with φ-cells showing the fewest specific markers. These observations confirm that sporocyst stem cells, regardless of the subpopulation to which they belong, share a common transcriptomic profile.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Stem cell classes display distinct spatiotemporal patterns throughout asexual development</title><p>Examining <italic>fgfrA</italic> and <italic>nanos-2</italic> enabled us to distinguish all three cell classes in situ: φ-cells express <italic>fgfrA</italic>, κ-cells express <italic>nanos-2</italic>, and δ-cells express both.

Here, we have used single-cell transcriptional profiling to characterize schistosome stem cells during intramolluscan and intramammalian development. We found that these stem cells are a heterogeneous population, consisting of four major classes, distinguished by several distinct markers. This analysis enabled cellular and molecular studies to trace the origin of the adult stem cells back to a handful of larvally derived cells packaged into the infectious stage; it also provided evidence for the origin of the schistosome germline.</p><p>During intramolluscan asexual development we find three classes of stem cells that can be distinguished by expression of either or both <italic>nanos-2</italic> and <italic>fgfr</italic>: κ (<italic>klf</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>nanos-2</italic><sup>+</sup>); φ (<italic>fgfrA</italic><sup>+</sup>); and δ (<italic>nanos-2</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>fgfrA</italic><sup>+</sup>) cells.

These studies reported that the scattered stem cells may persist in mother sporocysts for months and continuously undergo asymmetric divisions, with one daughter cell forming an embryo while the other remains undifferentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schutte, 1974</xref>). We found that κ-cells are dramatically enriched in mature, pre-migratory daughter sporocysts, consistent with the idea that these cells generate the other stem cell types observed in post-migratory daughter sporocysts.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35449.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A proposed model for the schistosome stem cell classes.</title><p>κ-cells are at the top of the hierarchy, and express <italic>nanos-2</italic> and <italic>klf</italic>.

The restricted distribution of φ-cells in transitory larval structures, including the sporocyst epidermis (tegument) and the cercarial tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,E</xref>), is consistent with the observations that φ-cells are not transmitted between life-cycle stages and are absent during the sexual stage. Our previous work identified rapidly cycling stem cells that do not express <italic>nanos-2</italic> (in contrast to slower-cycling cells that do) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2013</xref>); thus, φ-cells appear to be a lineage-committed, transit-amplifying population that produces temporary larval tissues. The distinction between κ, δ, and φ-cells is also consistent with early histological studies that observed germinal cells in three characteristic tissue locations within mother sporocysts: either scattered among daughter embryos, clustered inside of embryos, or situated close to mother sporocyst walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schutte, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pan, 1965</xref>).</p><p>The result of larval development in the snail is the production of cercariae, free-swimming infectious forms that penetrate mammalian skin to continue the life cycle. We observed five δ-cells, localized in a stereotypical pattern in the cercarial body. Using mouse skin explants to mimic the transformation that occurs after parasites enter their mammalian host, we found that these five cells proliferate during the first 24 hr after transformation. Given the similarities between the transcriptional profiles of δ-cells and the somatic stem cells found in juvenile parasites (δ’-cells that also express <italic>hesl</italic>), as well as their early proliferation upon penetrating host skin, we suggest that δ-cells serve as the source of the somatic stem cells identified in adult schistosomes. Because there is no growth during the first 2 weeks post-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clegg, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilson, 2009</xref>), these early-proliferating cells may contribute to the tissue remodeling (e.g. of the tegument or digestive system) required for the parasite’s subsequent growth and maturation.</p><p>Cercariae also contain two clusters of κ-cells, in the germinal cell cluster that is proposed to be the gonadal primordia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schutte, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorsey et al., 2002</xref>). These cells do not proliferate in the initial days after transformation; instead, we detect proliferation in the posterior of the schistosomula 9–10 days after transformation in vitro. Based on the antagonistic interaction between <italic>eled</italic> and <italic>nanos</italic>, we suggest that κ-cells downregulate <italic>nanos-2</italic> and activate expression of <italic>eled. eled</italic> is specific to the intramammalian stage of the life cycle and defines ε-cells. The absence of δ/δ’-cell markers, <italic>fgfr</italic>, <italic>zfp-1</italic>, <italic>p53</italic>, and <italic>hesl</italic>, in both κ and ε-cells favors the model that κ/ε-cells form a separate lineage from δ/δ’-cells. Expression of <italic>eled</italic> is dynamic: during juvenile development, <italic>eled</italic> is expressed in gonadal primordia and in a subset of proliferating cells in the posterior growth zone. In mature adults, <italic>eled</italic> expression is maintained in the reproductive system but is no longer detected somatically. Thus, ε-cells can either give rise to germline or to a transient somatic population that appears to drive the massive posterior growth exhibited by these parasites. During maturation, gonadal ε-cells subsequently activate germline-specific <italic>nanos-1</italic>. We suggest that the activation of <italic>nanos-1</italic> commits ε-cells to germline fate. How <italic>eled</italic><sup>+</sup> cells choose to generate germline (<italic>nanos-1</italic><sup>+</sup>) vs. posterior somatic cells (<italic>nanos-1</italic><sup>-</sup>) will be an important avenue for future studies.</p><p>Functional analysis of <italic>eled</italic> was limited to juvenile male parasites harvested after 3 weeks of growth in the mouse, due to technical constraints imposed by the parasite’s life cycle. Under these experimental conditions, <italic>eled</italic> (RNAi) males exhibited premature production of sperm; thus, <italic>eled</italic> appears to act as a brake on germ cell differentiation. Because it is also the earliest germline marker yet identified and could play a role in germ cell specification, new experimental techniques will have to be developed to analyze gene function during the first 3 weeks of development in the mammalian host, when the germline is formed. Similarly, rigorous experimental testing of the proposed lineage relationships between the stem cell classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) will require introduction of lineage-tracing techniques in these parasites.</p><p>Previous work noted similarities between schistosome stem cells and the neoblasts that drive regeneration in free-living planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2013</xref>). The heterogeneity we detected in schistosome stem cells is also reminiscent of that observed in the planarian neoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>), and we observed a striking overlap in a group of genes co-regulated between stem cell classes from both organisms. The genes <italic>fgfr</italic>, <italic>zfp-1</italic>, and <italic>p53</italic> were defined as markers of an epidermally committed population in planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). These genes are abundantly expressed in δ/δ’-cells, the major somatic population in schistosomes. Recently, schistosome adult stem cells were shown to have a strong differentiation bias toward the tegumental lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2016</xref>); the necessity of <italic>zfp-1</italic> family genes for proper tegumental fate or, more generally, for proper differentiation, further linked these parasites to their free-living ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wendt et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, in the planarian embryo, blastomeres produce temporary embryonic tissues but also give rise to neoblasts by downregulating a set of embryo-specific genes and upregulating genes associated with adult development (e.g., <italic>zfp-1</italic> and <italic>p53</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies et al., 2017</xref>). Our data suggest that a similar transition may also occur between κ-cells and δ/δ’-cells. Beyond planarians and schistosomes, stem cells have also been described in other parasitic flatworms, including tapeworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoffmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koziol and Brehm, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCusker et al., 2016</xref>). We expect that single-cell approaches applied to additional parasitic flatworms will provide a broader overview of the role of stem cell heterogeneity in driving such complex life cycles.</p><p>This study presents an important step toward understanding the fundamental mechanisms driving the propagation and long-term survival of schistosomes. As the causative agents of a neglected tropical disease impacting hundreds of millions of people, these parasites present a major threat to global health.

Cell suspensions were passed through a 100 μm nylon mesh (Falcon Cell Strainer) and centrifuged at 150 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Cell pellets were gently resuspended, passed through a 30 μm nylon mesh, and stained with Vybrant DyeCycle Violet (5 µM, Invitrogen), TOTO-3 (0.2 µM, Invitrogen), and calcein AM (0.1 µg/mL, Invitrogen) in sporocyst culture medium for 30–45 min. Dissociation of juveniles was performed similarly but with the following modifications: juveniles were permeabilized for 30 s, dissociated in 0.25% trypsin for 20 min, and triturated with serially narrowed flamed-tip glass. Dissociated cells were analyzed on an LSR II flow cytometer or sorted using a FACAria II flow sorter (BD Biosciences), with dead cells excluded based on TOTO-3 fluorescence. We confirmed that the FACS signature of the proliferative cells disappeared as early as 2 days after worms received high doses of X-ray irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). All flow sort profiles were confirmed on at least three biological replicates.</p><p>250,000 stem cells from either sporocysts or juveniles were sorted directly into lysis buffer (Qiagen) supplemented with 0.6% 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and total RNA was purified using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. After DNase treatment and poly(A) selection, stranded RNA-seq libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded RNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina), pooled in equimolar concentrations, and sequenced on a HiSeq2500 sequencer (Illumina) to acquire 100- or 160 bp reads with a depth of 40–100 million reads per library. To compare these transcriptomes of purified cell populations to those of whole animals, we also extracted total RNA from approximately 10,000 miracidia, in vitro-transformed mother sporocysts (48 hr post-transformation), or cercariae, or about 1000 juvenile worms, using the standard Trizol (Invitrogen) extraction method. All RNAseq data have been submitted to SRA and are available under accession number PRJNA395457.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Single-cell RNAseq</title><p>Single stem cells from in vitro-transformed mother sporocysts were captured on a medium-sized (10–17 µm) microfluidic RNA-seq chip (Fluidigm) using the Fluidigm C1 system. Sorted cells were resuspended at a density of 300 cells/µL, with size distribution and number density confirmed on a TC20 cell counter (Bio-rad). The single-cell suspension was then mixed with Fluidigm suspension reagent at 7:3 ratio and loaded onto the chip immediately. After capture, chambers on the chip were examined quickly by phase-contrast microscopy to assess the number, size, and morphology of captured cells and by fluorescence microscopy to examine the live-dead cell stain, and only chambers containing single round-shaped live cells were included in the downstream procedures. cDNAs were prepared on the chip using SMARTer Ultra Low RNA kit for Illumina (Clontech) following the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA quality was quantitated by qPCR analysis of two quality-control genes (<italic>ago2-1</italic> and <italic>h2a</italic>) on an Applied Biosystems Step One Plus station using GoTaq qPCR reagents (Promega). Libraries were constructed from this cDNA using Illumina Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit. Library size distribution and concentration were assessed using High Sensitivity DNA analysis kit on an Agilent Bioanalyzer, as well as fluorometrically using Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen). Libraries were then sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 to obtain 100 bp reads at a depth of 3–10 million reads per cell. Data from four biological replicates were pooled together for analysis, but two of them were later excluded from final results, as they had a high ‘dead cell’ rate.</p><p>Mapping of reads to the annotated <italic>S. mansoni</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Protasio et al., 2012</xref>) was performed using CLC Genomics Workbench 7.0 (CLC Bio) using standard settings. Expression levels were estimated based on transcripts per million (TPM). Ratio of expression levels between libraries was calculated using TPM+1, and TPM values below or equal to one were considered as being dominated by noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). In a subset of cells that passed quality control based on live-dead stains, quantitative PCR (qPCR) failed to detect <italic>ago2-1</italic> and <italic>h2a</italic>, two ubiquitous stem cell markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2013</xref>). RNAseq on these cells exhibited lower overall genomic mapping rates (&lt;60%), and detected significantly fewer transcripts per cell, more intergenic reads, and strong amplification bias towards the most abundant housekeeping genes. These cells were excluded from downstream analysis. The remaining libraries were then inspected for uniformity in mapping depth throughout the <italic>ago2-1</italic> transcript and the outlier cells were further excluded, as the schistosome stem cells (many of them were dividing) may be sensitive to the microfluidic capture process, leading to mRNA degradation. Although this stringent data selection step reduced the number of cells analyzed, it suppressed variations between cells that are likely attributable to technical artifacts.</p><p>PCA was performed using genes expressed in at least three cells and showing variance and bimodality coefficient of expression levels across all cells greater than empirically determined thresholds. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Euclidean distance metric on expression levels standardized gene-by-gene by mean-centering and dividing by the standard deviation of expressing cells. Assignment of cell classes is based on hierarchical clustering. As TPM values are well characterized as log-normal distributions for housekeeping genes, log<sub>2</sub>(TPM+1) was used as a measure of expression level in PCA and hierarchical clustering.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Single-cell qRT-PCR</title><p>For single-cell analysis of juvenile stem cells, cells were sorted directly into 96-well plates that contained 5 μL 1X CellsDirect One-Step Reaction mix (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.05 μL RNaseOUT (Invitrogen) in each well. Sorted cells were immediately frozen on dry ice and kept at −80°C until reverse transcription (RT). After thawing plates containing sorted cells, each well was supplemented with 5 μL 1X CellsDirect One-Step Reaction mix that also contained 0.2 μL SuperScript III/Platinum Taq mix (Invitrogen) and outer primer pairs with a final concentration of 10 nM per primer. Reverse transcription was performed at 50°C for 20 min and stopped by heating the plate to 95°C for 2 min. The cDNA was then amplified for 20 cycles (95°C 15 s, 60°C 4 min) before digestion of the remaining outer primers with <italic>ExoI</italic> (20 U/well, New England Biolabs) at 37°C for 30 min and inactivation of the RT enzyme at 80°C for 15 min. Amplified cDNA samples were diluted 1:6 in water. We performed 10 technical replicates (each replicate consisting of one 96-well plate).</p><p>For quality control, 5 μL of each well was used to quantify <italic>h2a</italic> levels by qPCR. We randomly picked cells from wells that generated C<sub>T</sub> values within 4 C<sub>T</sub> around the most probable values (~75% of total wells) for multiplex qPCR on the Fluidigm Biomark platform. For each reaction, 5 μL of diluted cDNA was loaded on a 96.96 DynamicArray IFC chip (Fluidigm) along with negative controls. Expression levels were assessed using inner (nested) primers for each gene. The primer sets are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p><p>C<sub>T</sub> values from the DynamicArray chip qPCR were determined from amplification curves with Fluidigm Real-time PCR analysis software using auto (detectors) thresholding and linear (derivative) baseline correction with a quality threshold of 0.65. The limit of detection was determined as 22 C<sub>T</sub> based on negative controls; undetected genes or C<sub>T</sub> values greater than 22 were all adjusted to 22. Expression values in log space were calculated as 22-C<sub>T</sub>. About 10% of cells showing substantially fewer numbers of genes detected were excluded from downstream analysis. To estimate technical variability, two independent sets of nested primers were designed for three genes, <italic>ago2-1</italic>, <italic>mier</italic> (Smp_101370), and <italic>hmt</italic> (Smp_055310), expression levels of which cover the full dynamic range of the qPCR analysis. The technical noise was determined as 2–3 C<sub>T</sub> and inversely correlated with gene expression level. PCA was performed on 90 amplicons (87 genes with the extra three technical-variability controls). Subsequently, genes with the highest scores in the first two PCs were identified and used for hierarchical clustering of cells. For hierarchical clustering, expression levels were standardized gene-by-gene by mean-centering and dividing by the standard deviation of expressing cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title><italic>In toto</italic> imaging of schistosome-infected snails</title><p>Fixed and bleached whole snails were rendered transparent by clearing in 50, 75, and 100% tetrahydrofuran (THF) in water, followed by dichloromethane, and hexane, successively, for 12–24 hr at each step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ertürk et al., 2012</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Stem cell heterogeneity drives the parasitic life cycle of <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have also agreed to reveal their identity: Peter W Reddien (Reviewer #2); Peter Olson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Wang et al., provide the first detailed single-cell analysis of stem cell heterogeneity in <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, a parasitic organism of great global clinical importance, across not one but multiple stages of its remarkably complex life cycle.</p><p>The authors use extensive transcriptome profiling of multiple and single, proliferating cells, together with ISH, qPCR and functional analyses that substantiate their quantitative results. It represents another major advance by these authors in our understanding of the genetics that underpin development in parasitic flatworms, and an important comparator to planarians, tapeworms and other flatworms – a phylum of 'super regenerators' that have long merited wider investigation.</p><p>Most notable perhaps is the discovery and robust evidence provided for the existence of a factor capable of inducing the germline in this parasite. Pinpointing the nature of germ cell origins in this animal as being driven by induction is, in our opinion, a great contribution to our understanding of parasitology.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Unless we missed it, there is little to no detailed description of the molecular nature of <italic>eled</italic>. For starters, Is <italic>eled</italic> an acronym? If so where in the paper is it defined? The first instance of its occurrence we could find was in the last paragraph of the subsection “Stem cells in juveniles reveal germline and somatic populations”, as &quot;eledh&quot;. Later in the Discussion, <italic>eled</italic> is described as being &quot;…specific to the intramammalian stage of the life cycle and defines the final class of schistosome stem cells, ε-cells, identified in this study&quot;, which strikes us as a byzantine circular definition of this molecule. Given the importance ascribed to this molecule as an inducer of the germline, more detail would be expected. Is this molecule unique to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> or is it present in other parasites, for example? Is it a single copy gene in the <italic>S. mansoni</italic> genome or are there isoforms/duplicated genes? Are there any recognizable motifs? What type of molecule is it predicted to be, i.e., secreted, transcription factor, membrane associated, etc.? Maybe we should know this, but I figure that if we don't most of the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic> may share the same puzzlement. Whether there is or there is no specific information available for this gene should be explicitly stated or the reader is left with the impression of an entirely mysterious molecule.</p><p>2) Figure 2. The authors used single of expression of <italic>fgfrA</italic> (negative for <italic>nanos-2</italic>) to mark phi cells; similarly expression of <italic>nanos-2</italic> but not <italic>fgfrA</italic> to mark nu cells. The absence of expression of a marker is weaker classification evidence than the presence of a unique marker because absence could be in some instances explained by technical detection limitation. <italic>klf</italic> and <italic>hesl</italic> would in principle, be more specific class markers. If these probes provide weaker signal would they work in case study single channel FISH to corroborate conclusions? Additionally, the presence of a single marker in common in the embryos to the sporocytes doesn't necessarily indicate these cells lack unique stage-specific attributes. For example, the early blastomeres of a planarian embryo express embryo-specific genes. This could be noted in the text.</p><p>3) Epsilon cells: We surmise that the argument for a contribution to soma in posterior growth is because of the very abundant presence of these cells in the posterior of males, which lack sexual structures in this region. If so, this could be explicitly stated. Do available methods allow assessment of whether the phenotype of <italic>eled</italic> RNAi animals is consistent with the model that epsilon cells produce posterior somatic cells for substantial posterior growth? Moreover, what happens to <italic>klf</italic> expression in juveniles? Is it expressed in epsilon cells? Also, the model in Figure 7 could list <italic>klf</italic> and <italic>nanos</italic> as expressed in nu cells. Addressing these issues would improve the clarity of the manuscript.</p><p>4) Because this manuscript is laying down an important foundation for defining stem cell lineages in <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, we would like to see a much more fleshed out discussion of the lineages proposed in Figure 7. As presented, there is some ambiguity as to the source of the <italic>eled</italic> cells. For instance, the first paragraph of the subsection “Stem cell classes display distinct spatiotemporal patterns throughout asexual development” seems central to aspects of the lineage argument but are not clearly worded, and further discussion evidence from Schutte 74 might help the arguments made. Also, how much expression overlap is there between cell types as they arise during the complex development of this parasite? For instance, are there transcriptional cohorts shared between nu cells and epsilon and δ cells? Or what about δ and δ prime and δ and psi cells? In other words, understanding why the present model is favored over others would strengthen the conclusion of this otherwise fascinating paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35449.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Unless we missed it, there is little to no detailed description of the molecular nature of eled.

We have now moved this description to the main text:</p><p><italic>&quot;eled</italic> is a single-copy gene (Smp_041540) that was previously annotated as a nuclear hormone receptor, <italic>dhr4</italic> (Protasio et al., 2012; Berriman et al., 2009); however, our analysis suggests that this gene does not encode a hormone receptor (Figure 4—figure supplement 4). […] Homologs of <italic>eled</italic> are found across <italic>Schistosoma</italic> species, whereas planarian and tapeworm genomes appear to lack them.&quot;</p><p>We have also carried out protein structure analysis that is presented in the new Figure 4D and described in the main text:</p><p>“Figure 4D shows the predicted architecture of <italic>eled</italic>, which has a transmembrane domain at the N-terminus (probability ~100%), a putative transmembrane domain at the C-terminus (probability ~35%), and an extracellular domain in between (probability ~85%). The extracellular domain contains 19% serine and 17% threonine, presenting the highest serine/threonine fraction in known proteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2.

We have been able to show that a subset of <italic>fgfrA</italic><sup>+</sup> cells expresses <italic>hesl</italic> (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), consistent with the distinction between δ and φ cells. However, in spite of repeated attempts to improve the sensitivity of our FISH protocols for the intramolluscan stage, we have been unable to detect <italic>klf</italic> expression during this portion of the life cycle. Additional work will be required to improve the detection sensitivity of our FISH protocols during intramolluscan development. We have added in the main text:</p><p>“Unfortunately, the κ class-specific marker klf was expressed at very low levels (Figure 1E), beneath the detection limits of our current FISH protocol.”</p><p>The reviewers are correct to point out that these cells may express other stage-specific genes, and we have added this point to the Discussion:</p><p>“Furthermore, in the planarian embryo blastomeres produce temporary embryonic tissues but also give rise to neoblasts by downregulating a set of embryo-specific genes and upregulating genes associated with adult development (e.g., <italic>zfp-1</italic> and <italic>p53</italic>) (Davies et al., 2017). Our data suggest that a similar transition may also occur between κ-cells and δ/δ’cells.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Epsilon cells: We surmise that the argument for a contribution to soma in posterior growth is because of the very abundant presence of these cells in the posterior of males, which lack sexual structures in this region. If so, this could be explicitly stated. Do available methods allow assessment of whether the phenotype of eled RNAi animals is consistent with the model that epsilon cells produce posterior somatic cells for substantial posterior growth? Moreover, what happens to klf expression in juveniles? Is it expressed in epsilon cells? Also, the model in Figure 7 could list klf and nanos as expressed in nu cells. Addressing these issues would improve the clarity of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the text in the last paragraph of the subsection “Stem cells in juveniles reveal germline and somatic populations”, to state that <italic>eled</italic> somatic expression is concentrated in the PGZ, which lacks reproductive organs in males. This pattern is distinct from that of the proliferation marker, <italic>h2a</italic>, which labels all stem cells and is more evenly distributed throughout the worm. Quantification shows that ~50% of the somatic <italic>h2a</italic>+ cells in the PGZ (1679/3576) and ~10% of the somatic <italic>h2a</italic>+ cells outside the PGZ (769/5366) expressed <italic>eled</italic>.</p><p>In the effort to experimentally assess cell differentiation in the PGZ after <italic>eled</italic> RNAi, we have performed EdU pulse-chase experiment. However, we noted a global reduction of EdU incorporation after extended in vitro culture (current RNAi methodology takes ~2 weeks for effective knockdown), even in control animals. In this case, the technical difficulty in sustaining schistosome juvenile growth and development in vitro complicated interpretation of RNAi phenotypes, and we are currently in the process of developing new methods to disrupt gene functions in parasites while they are still inside of mouse hosts.</p><p>Finally, we have modified Figure 4C to show that <italic>klf</italic> is expressed in both ε- and δ’-cells. We have also modified the model presented in the new Figure 8 to include <italic>klf</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Because this manuscript is laying down an important foundation for defining stem cell lineages in S. mansoni, we would like to see a much more fleshed out discussion of the lineages proposed in Figure 7.

Concerning the source of the ε-cells, we have expanded the Discussion to read:</p><p>“Based on the antagonistic interaction between <italic>eled</italic> and <italic>nanos</italic>, we suggest that κ-cells downregulate <italic>nanos-2</italic> and activate expression of <italic>eled</italic>. […] The absence of δ/δ’-cell markers, <italic>fgfr, zfp-1, p53</italic>, and <italic>hesl</italic>, in both κ and ε-cells favors the model that κ/ε-cells form a separate lineage from δ/δ’-cells.”</p><p>To be more specific when referring to the early histological studies, we have added additional evidence from Schutte 1974 to the Discussion:</p><p>“We posit that κ cells serve as “embryonic” stem cells: in addition to <italic>nanos-2</italic> they express a <italic>klf</italic> homolog and are found isolated in developing mother sporocysts. […] These studies reported that the scattered stem cells may persist in mother sporocysts for months and continuously undergo asymmetric divisions, with one daughter cell forming an embryo while the other remains undifferentiated (Schutte, 1974).” And also:</p><p>“The distinction between κ, δ, and φ-cells is also consistent with early histological studies that observed germinal cells in three characteristic tissue locations within mother sporocysts: either scattered among daughter embryos, clustered inside of embryos, or situated close to mother sporocyst walls (Schutte, 1974; Pan, 1965).”</p><p>Finally, we have added a new figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) to quantify expression overlap and differences between κ, δ, and φ-cells. We have added in the main text:</p><p>“In addition to these class-defining genes, the divergence of the three cell classes is manifested by hundreds of other genes that exhibit various levels of statistically significant differences between classes (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). […] These observations confirm that sporocyst stem cells, regardless of the subpopulation to which they belong, share a common transcriptomic profile.”</p><p>Because we used single-cell qPCR to classify juvenile stem cells, it is impossible to compare cell classes between intramolluscan and intramammalian stages across transcriptomes. However, among the 90 genes assayed by qPCR, only <italic>eled</italic> emerges as a juvenile-specific gene that defines a new cell class. This result is consistent with the transcriptional uniformity observed among sporocyst stem cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
