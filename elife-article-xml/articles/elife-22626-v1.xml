Two non-exclusive models have been proposed to explain Toddler function. The ‘specification model’ postulates that Toddler signaling enhances Nodal signaling to properly specify endoderm, whereas the ‘migration model’ posits that Toddler signaling regulates mesendodermal cell migration downstream of Nodal signaling. Here, we test key predictions of both models. We find that in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants Nodal signaling is initially normal and increasing endoderm specification does not rescue mesendodermal cell migration. Mesodermal cell migration defects in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants result from a decrease in animal pole-directed migration and are independent of endoderm. Conversely, endodermal cell migration defects are dependent on a Cxcr4a-regulated tether of the endoderm to mesoderm. These results suggest that Toddler signaling regulates mesodermal cell migration downstream of Nodal signaling and indirectly affects endodermal cell migration via Cxcr4a-signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Toddler</kwd><kwd>Apela</kwd><kwd>Elabela</kwd><kwd>Cxcr4a</kwd><kwd>Nodal</kwd><kwd>Gastrulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31HD081925</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Norris</surname><given-names>Megan L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD076935</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pauli</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001003</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pauli</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDA00066/2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pauli</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gagnon</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM056211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schier</surname><given-names>Alexander F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000997</institution-id><institution>Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lord</surname><given-names>Nathan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Elucidation of direct and indirect roles of GPCR signaling during gastrulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gastrulation is a conserved process in embryogenesis during which the three germ layers – endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm – undergo large-scale rearrangements to shape the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Solnica-Krezel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Schier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Langdon and Mullins, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Solnica-Krezel and Sepich, 2012</xref>). Following their specification, endoderm and mesoderm (jointly referred to as mesendoderm) internalize beneath the ectoderm and migrate away from the site of internalization. The germ layers then converge to the dorsal side of the embryo, narrowing and extending the axis. Defects in these cellular movements can lead to a truncated body axis and abnormal organs, while defects in initial specification cause absence or reduction of mesendoderm derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Solnica-Krezel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Schier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Langdon and Mullins, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Solnica-Krezel and Sepich, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Germ layer specification and migration are regulated by conserved signaling pathways. Endoderm and mesoderm specification depends on the TGFβ-ligand Nodal. Secreted Nodal ligands bind to Activin receptors, which leads to Smad2 phosphorylation and target gene induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Schier, 2009</xref>). Nodal signals also trigger transcription of their own inhibitors, which belong to the Lefty family. Thus, <italic>lefty</italic> mutants have increased Nodal signaling resulting in increased endodermal and mesodermal gene expression and cell number during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Meno et al., 1999</xref>; Rogers et al., unpublished ).</p><p>After specification by Nodal, endodermal cells are tethered to mesodermal cells through a fibronectin-integrin link genetically regulated by the GPCR Cxcr4a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Mizoguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nair and Schilling, 2008</xref>). Loss of Cxcr4a releases this tether and results in excessive animal pole-directed migration of endodermal cells, while mesodermal cell migration is unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Mizoguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nair and Schilling, 2008</xref>).</p><p>An additional GPCR pathway, regulated by Toddler/Apela/Elabela, is also required for proper endoderm and mesoderm formation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>). In this pathway, the secreted peptide Toddler, which is highly conserved throughout vertebrates, signals via the GPCR APJ (in zebrafish: Apelin receptor A and B, jointly referred to as Apelin receptor). In <italic>toddler</italic> mutants, initial specification of endoderm and mesoderm is normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>), but by mid-gastrulation, <italic>toddler</italic> mutants have fewer endodermal cells and mesendodermal cell migration is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>toddler</italic> mutants generally die around 7 days post fertilization (dpf) with deformed hearts, blood accumulation, edema and endodermal abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Two non-exclusive models have been proposed for the role of Toddler signaling in gastrulation. One model, the ‘specification model’, postulates that Toddler’s primary role is to promote the specification of endoderm, which when defective leads to abnormal migration of mesendodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chng et al., 2013</xref>). This model is supported by the observation of fewer endodermal cells in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants. Moreover, Apelin receptor signaling has been proposed to enhance Nodal signaling, possibly accounting for the endoderm cell number defects in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deshwar et al., 2016</xref>). Based on these findings, it has been proposed that Toddler signaling enhances Nodal signaling, allowing for proper endoderm specification, which in turn promotes mesendodermal cell migration.</p><p>An alternative model for Toddler signaling, the ‘migration model’, postulates that the primary role of Toddler signaling is to regulate mesendodermal cell migration. This model is supported by the observation that mesendodermal cells migrate more slowly during internalization in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants, and that <italic>apelin receptor a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> gene expression depend on Nodal signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tucker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>). These findings place Toddler signaling downstream of Nodal signaling and endoderm specification and suggest a primary role for Toddler signaling in mesendodermal cell migration.</p><p>To clarify how Toddler regulates gastrulation, we tested four aspects of the specification and migration models. First, we determined if the defects in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants result primarily from reduced endoderm specification. Second, we analyzed if <italic>toddler</italic> mutants display reduced Nodal signaling. Third, we examined how migration of mesodermal cells is affected in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants. Fourth, we tested if Toddler’s primary site of action is endoderm, mesoderm, or both cell types. We found that reduced endoderm specification is not sufficient to explain the <italic>toddler</italic> mutant phenotype, that Nodal signaling initiates normally in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants, and that Toddler signaling acts on mesodermal cells to allow animal pole-directed migration. Our results support a modified version of the migration model in which Toddler signaling acts downstream of Nodal signaling to regulate mesodermal cell migration while indirectly regulating endodermal cell migration via Cxcr4a signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increased endoderm specification does not rescue <italic>toddler</italic> mutants</title><p>In <italic>toddler</italic> mutants, endoderm initially appears normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>), but by mid-gastrulation, the number of endodermal cells is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>).

Third, Toddler signaling is required for proper animal pole-directed migration of mesoderm during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Fourth, the defects in mesodermal cell migration are independent of endoderm in <italic>toddler;sox32</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Fifth, untethering endodermal and mesodermal cells in <italic>toddler;cxcr4a</italic> double mutants improves endodermal cell migration without affecting mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>These results and previous studies support the following model for Toddler function. Nodal signaling induces the expression of <italic>apelin receptor a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> in mesendodermal cells, rendering them sensitive to Toddler peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tucker et al., 2007</xref>).

A Cxcr4a-regulated tether between endodermal and mesodermal cells allows Toddler signaling to indirectly affect endodermal cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Mizoguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nair and Schilling, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our findings about Toddler signaling differ from a recent study that concluded Apelin receptor signaling enhances Nodal signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deshwar et al., 2016</xref>). Whereas Deshwar and colleagues reported that <italic>apelin receptor a and b</italic> double morphants appear to have a delayed onset of Nodal signaling, we find that <italic>toddler</italic> mutants as well as <italic>apelin receptor a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> single and double mutants establish Nodal signaling normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). There are multiple possibilities that may explain these different results. First, it is possible that Toddler and/or the Apelin receptors have independent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ho et al., 2015</xref>). Second, although apelin receptor mutants and morphants have similar morphological defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deshwar et al., 2016</xref>), knockdown of the receptors via morpholinos might reveal a phenotype that is masked or compensated in the null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Rossi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wei et al., 2017</xref>). Third, morpholino injection may cause non-specific delayed development or toxicity, as suggested by the epiboly defects seen in <italic>apelin receptor a</italic> morphants but not <italic>apelin receptor a</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ekker and Larson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kok et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deshwar et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our study indicates that Toddler is a regulator of mesodermal cell migration and only indirectly regulates endodermal cell migration during gastrulation. Accordingly, we find both similarities and differences in the role of Toddler signaling in the migration of endoderm versus mesoderm. Both endodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>) and mesodermal cells (this study, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) migrate more slowly in the absence of Toddler signaling. However, we find that <italic>toddler</italic> mutant mesodermal cells have reduced animal pole-directed migration during gastrulation. This is in contrast to endodermal cells, which initially undergo a random walk, including animal pole-directed movement, in wild-type and <italic>toddler</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>). The intrinsic ability of endoderm to migrate without Toddler signaling is fully revealed in the abundant animal pole-directed migration of endoderm in <italic>toddler;cxcr4a</italic> double mutants. Thus, the ability to undergo animal pole-directed migration is retained in endodermal cells but compromised in mesodermal cells in the absence of Toddler signaling.</p><p>These findings raise important questions for future studies. Our work and others have suggested an anti-apoptotic function for Toddler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ho et al., 2015</xref>), raising the question of whether the role for Toddler in cell survival is related to or independent of its role in cell migration? How does Toddler signaling regulate mesodermal cell migration? Our RNA-Seq results in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants did not reveal major changes in gene expression during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that Toddler’s primary function may be post-transcriptional. The identities of such potential effectors remain unknown. Equally unknown is the nature of the regulators of endodermal cell migration. In the absence of both Toddler and Cxcr4a signaling, endoderm migration is surprisingly normal. What regulates endoderm migration in this background? Toddler signaling will continue to provide an entry point to address these questions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish lines and husbandry</title><p>Zebrafish, including TLAB wild-type fish, were maintained according to standard protocols. <italic>toddler</italic> double mutant lines were obtained by crossing <italic>toddler</italic> mutants to either <italic>lefty1<sup>a154</sup>, lefty2<sup>a146</sup></italic> or <italic>cxcr4a</italic> mutants. <italic>toddler</italic> homozygous/<italic>lefty1<sup>a154</sup></italic> heterozygous, <italic>toddler</italic> homozygous/<italic>lefty2<sup>a146</sup></italic> heterozygous and <italic>toddler</italic> homozygous/<italic>cxcr4a</italic> heterozygous fish were obtained by injecting 2 pg <italic>toddler</italic> mRNA at the one cell stage as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>).

Intervals between frames was no more than 3 min. TrackMate data was exported to R for computational analysis. Data from each embryo were binned into four time windows of equal length based on real time. For each measurement, only cells with 5 of more data points per time window were utilized and the entire first time window was excluded from further analysis. Straightness was determined by dividing the total displacement by the total distance. Total displacement was determined by summing the displacement made by a cell during each frame in a time window. Total distance was measured as the distance between the cell’s location in the first and last frame of a time window. Velocity was measured by dividing the total displacement of a cell by the time for each time window. Rose plots were generated by plotting the angle moved weighted by the displacement traveled by each cell for each frame across a time window.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>TUNEL staining</title><p>Dechorionated embryos were collected at various time points in 4% paraformaldehyde, fixed at 4° overnight, then dehydrated into methanol (similar to collection for in situ hybridization) and stained using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, TMR red, from Sigma Aldrich (St Louis, Missouri). Embryos were mounted in low-melting point agarose and one lateral side of each embryo was imaged using an LSM 880 confocal microscope with a &lt; 1 micron pixel width and &lt;4.5 micron voxel-depth. Maximum intensity projections were analyzed and TUNEL+ cells were defined as a single, large positive spot or multiple, smaller spots in an aggregate.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Wiebke Herzog for her generous gift of <italic>aplnrA</italic> mutants.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that the function of Toddler in regulating Nodal signalling was an interesting topic. They also acknowledged that it has been controversial and that this manuscript aims to address the two proposed models in a precise and targeted manner. However, the results were found to be currently too preliminary to allow a firm conclusion to be drawn about the precise role of Toddler.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper addresses an ongoing dispute about the function of the Toddler peptide in controlling mesendodermal development during zebrafish gastrulation. Specifically the disputed question is whether Toddler acts early, to enhance Nodal signaling, and therefore to specify endoderm cells; or, alternatively, whether it acts later, to control the migration of mesendoderm.</p><p>This elegant paper addresses three predictions that may distinguish the two models. All three sets of experiments lead the authors to conclude that Toddler acts downstream of Nodal signaling to control the migration mesodermal cells and, secondarily, the migration of normally attached endodermal cells. The data are clear, and the conclusions, while quite narrow, appear well supported. That may be slightly different from saying that this paper absolutely settles the case: it is possible that more complex hybrid models would be consistent with all results.</p><p>The authors discuss the discrepancies with the earlier conclusion that favors the endodermal specification model, and suggest reasons that could account for the distinct conclusions.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Norris et al. investigates the mechanism by which the peptide Elabela/Toddler/Apela regulates mesendoderm development. Unlike the zebrafish cardia bifida mutants (cas, mil, fau) that also have reduced mesendoderm and endoderm cell migration defects, or nodal signaling mutants (cyc;sqt or oep) that have mesendoderm specification defects, in toddler mutants Nodal signaling is intact and mesendoderm specification is initially normal. Yet, there is a reduction in endoderm cells by mid-gastrula stages, mesoderm and endoderm cells do not migrate correctly, and toddler mutants have very small or no hearts. Using loss of lefty inhibitor to increase nodal signalling (and endoderm specification) in the context of toddler mutants, the authors tested and rule out the &quot;specification model&quot; which proposed a role for toddler as an enhancer of Nodal signaling. This part of the manuscript is, for the most part, nicely done.</p><p>Norris and coworkers then tested the &quot;migration model&quot; by loss of the GPCR/chemokine receptor, cxcr4a and suggest that Toddler indirectly affects endoderm migration via Cxcr4 signaling. This part of the manuscript is not very convincing: the tether postulate can only partially explain the cell migration defect (in the endoderm), and it is unclear how mesoderm migration is affected in toddler mutants. In addition, why are endoderm cell numbers reduced? Do these cells die or is there delayed/other cell division defects in the mutant mesendoderm?</p><p>Are the authors certain that initial mesendoderm specification is normal in toddler mutants? Norris and coworkers show that response to Nodal signalling is intact in toddler embryos, however both the Reversade and Schier groups have previously shown that in toddler mutants, the scl and gata5 expression domains are expanded. How can this be explained?</p><p>If the primary function for toddler is in regulation of cell migration, it might be useful to investigate individual cell behaviours, rather than exclusively rely upon the expression of germ layer markers. For instance, is protrusive activity altered in mutant cells (which might then affect cell migration)? Are there defects in cytoskeletal organization in toddler mutant mesendoderm, which might affect cell division and cell numbers as well as cell migration?</p><p>The authors examined RNAseq data and conclude that the gene expression profile is largely unchanged in toddler mutant embryos compared to controls, at least at early embryonic stages (sphere-shield). However, for abundant molecules (such as those comprising the cytoskeleton) and for those that have a significant maternal contribution, the subcellular distribution of the proteins might be important, but may not be evident from absolute transcript levels.</p><p>In summary, the manuscript has some novel findings; the data ruling out effects of Toddler on mesendoderm specification via Nodal signaling is interesting and contrasts with a recent report by the Reversade and Scott groups. However, the manuscript does not satisfactorily address how Toddler affects cell migration (especially the mesoderm). In its present form, the manuscript seems more appropriate for a specialized audience.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This paper seeks to distinguish between two models for Toddler function in zebrafish embryos. One model suggests that Toddler is required for Nodal signalling and thus is required to correctly specify endoderm. The other model postulates that Toddler regulates mesendodermal cell migration downstream of Nodal signaling. The authors' data do not support the first model, but give some support to the second model. However, in general, I think that the work is preliminary, and key controls are missing in my view. There is also no insight into how Toddler could be functioning to promote mesodermal cell migration.</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, the authors compare the toddler mutant and the lefty2;toddler double mutant, without showing data for the lefty2 mutant alone. This must be shown in order to be able to assess the effect of mutating toddler in the lefty2 mutant background.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the heart sizes should be quantitated. It is not sufficient to present the percentage of embryos with smaller hearts.</p><p>3) In general I think the images showing sox17 staining to quantitate numbers of endodermal cells are low in quality. It would be better to perform fluorescent in situs, which would be easier to image and quantitate.</p><p>4) The loss of function experiments for sox32 have been performed using transient expression of guide RNAs and Cas9. There are no controls showing that sox32 has been deleted. The authors must prove what deletions they are achieving in these embryos and they must prove the loss of sox32. It would be much better if they used a stable line as they have for the cxcr4a mutant.</p><p>5) There is no evidence presented that the lefty2 mutants or the cxcr4a mutants are nulls.</p><p>6) The authors say that loss of sox32 or overexpression of sox32 has no effect on aplnrB expression.

They also acknowledged that it has been controversial and that this manuscript aims to address the two proposed models in a precise and targeted manner. However, the results were found to be currently too preliminary to allow a firm conclusion to be drawn about the precise role of Toddler.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the helpful suggestions of the reviewers, we have provided additional results concerning the role of Toddler in regulating mesodermal cell migration. From our previous data it was not clear whether directionality, speed, persistence of migration, or aspects of each cause the migration defects observed in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants. Through live-cell imaging and analysis of mesodermal cells during gastrulation in wild-type and <italic>toddler</italic> mutant embryos we are now able to conclude that (Abstract): “Mesodermal cell migration defects in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants result from a decrease in animal pole-directed migration and are independent of endoderm. Conversely, endodermal cell migration defects are dependent on a Cxcr4a-regulated tether to mesoderm”.</p><p>We address the other questions raised by the reviewers in detail below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper addresses an ongoing dispute about the function of the Toddler peptide in controlling mesendodermal development during zebrafish gastrulation. Specifically the disputed question is whether Toddler acts early, to enhance Nodal signaling, and therefore to specify endoderm cells; or, alternatively, whether it acts later, to control the migration of mesendoderm.</p><p>This elegant paper addresses three predictions that may distinguish the two models. All three sets of experiments lead the authors to conclude that Toddler acts downstream of Nodal signaling to control the migration mesodermal cells and, secondarily, the migration of normally attached endodermal cells. The data are clear, and the conclusions, while quite narrow, appear well supported. That may be slightly different from saying that this paper absolutely settles the case: it is possible that more complex hybrid models would be consistent with all results.</p><p>The authors discuss the discrepancies with the earlier conclusion that favors the endodermal specification model, and suggest reasons that could account for the distinct conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for her/his strong support.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Norris et al. investigates the mechanism by which the peptide Elabela/Toddler/Apela regulates mesendoderm development. Unlike the zebrafish cardia bifida mutants (cas, mil, fau) that also have reduced mesendoderm and endoderm cell migration defects, or nodal signaling mutants (cyc;sqt or oep) that have mesendoderm specification defects, in toddler mutants Nodal signaling is intact and mesendoderm specification is initially normal. Yet, there is a reduction in endoderm cells by mid-gastrula stages, mesoderm and endoderm cells do not migrate correctly, and toddler mutants have very small or no hearts. Using loss of lefty inhibitor to increase nodal signalling (and endoderm specification) in the context of toddler mutants, the authors tested and rule out the &quot;specification model&quot; which proposed a role for toddler as an enhancer of Nodal signaling. This part of the manuscript is, for the most part, nicely done.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for her/his strong support of the part of our study that focuses on Nodal signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Norris and coworkers then tested the &quot;migration model&quot; by loss of the GPCR/chemokine receptor, cxcr4a and suggest that Toddler indirectly affects endoderm migration via Cxcr4 signaling. This part of the manuscript is not very convincing: the tether postulate can only partially explain the cell migration defect (in the endoderm), and it is unclear how mesoderm migration is affected in toddler mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it was unclear what aspect of migration, such as directionality, speed, or persistence of migration, caused migration defects. To address this question, we performed live-cell imaging of mesodermal cells during gastrulation in wild-type and <italic>toddler</italic> mutant embryos (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Our results reveal that mesodermal cells in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants migrate more slowly than wild type and have diminished animal-pole directed migration during gastrulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, why are endoderm cell numbers reduced? Do these cells die or is there delayed/other cell division defects in the mutant mesendoderm?</p></disp-quote><p>The decreased number of endodermal cells is indeed interesting and perplexing. We have included a paragraph in our discussion to address this remaining question: “The interplay between mesoderm and endoderm might modulate endodermal cell number, as has been suggested in mouse embryonic stem cells (Cheng et al. 2013). This fine-tuning may be disrupted when mesoderm fails to migrate properly. It is also conceivable that Toddler signaling promotes endoderm proliferation during gastrulation. In either case, our results show that increasing endodermal cell number does not rescue migration or other defects in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the authors certain that initial mesendoderm specification is normal in toddler mutants? Norris and coworkers show that response to Nodal signalling is intact in toddler embryos, however both the Reversade and Schier groups have previously shown that in toddler mutants, the scl and gata5 expression domains are expanded. How can this be explained ?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that Nodal signaling is paramount to proper mesendoderm specification. For this reason we included RNA-sequencing and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization data that show normal mesendoderm specification in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We have also previously shown that endoderm (<italic>sox17</italic>), mesoderm (<italic>fn1, ta</italic>) and ectoderm (<italic>gsc</italic>) appear normal during early stages of gastrulation in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants (Pauli et al. 2014 Suppl Figure S10). Comparatively, <italic>scl</italic> is ectopically expressed at much later stages, possibly as a secondary defect caused by abnormal gastrulation mutants (Pauli et al. 2014 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We are not aware of data that shows that <italic>gata5</italic> expression domains are expanded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the primary function for toddler is in regulation of cell migration, it might be useful to investigate individual cell behaviours, rather than exclusively rely upon the expression of germ layer markers. For instance, is protrusive activity altered in mutant cells (which might then affect cell migration)? Are there defects in cytoskeletal organization in toddler mutant mesendoderm, which might affect cell division and cell numbers as well as cell migration?</p><p>The authors examined RNAseq data and conclude that the gene expression profile is largely unchanged in toddler mutant embryos compared to controls, at least at early embryonic stages (sphere-shield). However, for abundant molecules (such as those comprising the cytoskeleton) and for those that have a significant maternal contribution, the subcellular distribution of the proteins might be important, but may not be evident from absolute transcript levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the precise mechanism by which Toddler regulates migration is an intriguing question. We have added live-cell imaging of mesodermal cells during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), which shows that Toddler is required for proper migration towards the animal pole as well as proper speed of migration. We do not yet understand the molecular mechanism regulating the directionality and speed changes observed in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants. A detailed analysis of cytoskeletal changes is difficult for technical reasons. First, there is currently a lack of genetic tools for specifically manipulating mesoderm during gastrulation. Second, there have been many attempts in the past decade to find the downstream target of the Apelin receptors, but each method failed to conclusively identify a well defined pathway (for example Deng et al. 2015; He, Chen, and Li 2016; Paskaradevan and Scott 2012) We hope to address this question in future studies that are beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, the manuscript has some novel findings; the data ruling out effects of Toddler on mesendoderm specification via Nodal signaling is interesting and contrasts with a recent report by the Reversade and Scott groups. However, the manuscript does not satisfactorily address how Toddler affects cell migration (especially the mesoderm). In its present form, the manuscript seems more appropriate for a specialized audience.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for her/his support and refer her/him to the end of this response, where we discuss in more detail why we believe that <italic>eLife</italic> is the best forum for this study. In addition, the new mesoderm migration data should make the paper more conclusive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This paper seeks to distinguish between two models for Toddler function in zebrafish embryos. One model suggests that Toddler is required for Nodal signalling and thus is required to correctly specify endoderm. The other model postulates that Toddler regulates mesendodermal cell migration downstream of Nodal signaling. The authors' data do not support the first model, but give some support to the second model. However, in general, I think that the work is preliminary, and key controls are missing in my view. There is also no insight into how Toddler could be functioning to promote mesodermal cell migration.</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, the authors compare the toddler mutant and the lefty2;toddler double mutant, without showing data for the lefty2 mutant alone. This must be shown in order to be able to assess the effect of mutating toddler in the lefty2 mutant background.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this inadvertent omission.

Exact quantification of heart sizes by absolute numbers is difficult based on in situ images and the irregular shape of the heart.

It would be much better if they used a stable line as they have for the cxcr4a mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for asking us to provide additional support for our sox32 loss-of-function experiment. We have included data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> that shows the high efficacy of injected Cas9 and <italic>sox32</italic> gRNAs in mutating the <italic>sox32</italic> locus.

This result will be published in Rogers et al. (in preparation) but we would be happy to share this data with the reviewer. We have also added more information about the <italic>cxcr4a</italic> mutant. This allele deletes 433 bp of a 1083 bp long coding sequence, rendering the GPCR non-functional. Moreover, the gastrulation phenotype of the homozygous <italic>cxcr4a</italic> mutant recapitulates the morphant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) (Mizoguchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008; Nair and Schilling, 2008).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors say that loss of sox32 or overexpression of sox32 has no effect on aplnrB expression.

We first confirmed that similar numbers of endodermal cells are present at 60% epiboly in wild-type and <italic>toddler</italic> mutant embryos and that the number of cells increases only in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To investigate a potential proliferation defect in <italic>toddler</italic> mutant embryos, we tracked division rates of <italic>sox17</italic>:GFP positive endodermal cells during gastrulation from light sheet movies. We found that wild type and <italic>toddler</italic> mutant endodermal cells proliferate at the same rate during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, while tracking proliferation, we observed endodermal cells dying in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To determine whether cell death was elevated in <italic>toddler</italic> mutant embryos, we used TUNEL staining and found that the number of TUNEL+ cells was increased throughout gastrulation in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants compared to wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> C,D). Together, this new data suggests that the missing endodermal cells observed at the end of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) are not due to initial specification or proliferation defects but instead may result from an increase in cell death in <italic>toddler</italic> mutants during gastrulation. This is consistent with other work, which observed Toddler had an anti-apoptotic role in human embryonic stem cells (Ho et al. <italic>Cell Stem Cell,</italic> 2015). We have also updated the text by adding a paragraph that discusses the fate of the missing endodermal cells. We would like to emphasize that, though the decreased endodermal cell number is an interesting phenomenon, it is not the primary role of Toddler signaling. This is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, whereby restoring endodermal cell numbers does not abrogate the <italic>toddler</italic> mutant phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be helpful to readers to include a more measured and constructive discussion about the differences between the present results and those described by Deshwar et al. Different reagents and approaches were used and it is not clear whether these could account for at least some of the differences.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct in noting differences in the experimental approaches between our paper and the Deshwar et al. paper. We have changed our discussion to more explicitly discuss how these differences may have affected our results and make direct comparison between the two studies difficult. Of the three suggested possibilities, we favor the hypothesis that the morpholinos cause off target effects and toxicity for the following reasons. 1.) There is currently no evidence for differential roles of Toddler and Apelin receptor signaling during zebrafish development. 2.) Unlike other disagreeing morpholino/mutant pairs, in which the mutant lacks all or most of the morphant phenotype, <italic>apelin receptor a and b</italic> mutants and morphants have similar defects in endoderm and mesoderm development during gastrulation and in heart development (Deshwar et al. 2016). We now write: “Our findings about Toddler signaling differ from a recent study that concluded Apelin receptor signaling enhances Nodal signaling (Deshwar et al. 2016). Whereas Deshwar and colleagues reported that apelin receptor a and b double morphants appear to have a delayed onset of Nodal signaling, we find that toddler mutants as well as apelin receptor a and b single and double mutants establish Nodal signaling normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). There are multiple possibilities that may explain these different results. First, it is possible that Toddler and/or the Apelin receptors have independent functions (Ho et al. 2015). Second, although apelin receptor mutants and morphants have similar morphological defects (Deshwar et al. 2016), knockdown of the receptors via morpholinos might reveal a phenotype that is masked or compensated in the null mutants (Rossi et al. 2015; Wei et al. 2016). Third, morpholino injection may cause non-specific delayed development or toxicity, as suggested by the epiboly defects seen in apelin receptor a morphants but not apelin receptor a mutants (Deshwar et al. 2016; Kok et al. 2015; Ekker &amp; Larson 2001).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) With regard to quantifying the heart size in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the authors argue that it is difficult to do this given the in situ images and the irregular shape of the heart. This may be the case, but it is essential to define what constitutes a small heart. Thus, some level of quantification is required.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to clearly define what constitutes a small or normal sized heart. We have expanded our description of how we quantify heart size in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and included more example images. We now write: “Hearts were classified as small if shortened by more than half of normal length and/or excessively narrow or thin. Hearts that were neither thin nor short but appeared to have looping defects or other patterning defects were classified as normal. In the case of toddler and toddler;lefty2 mutants, hearts were scored blind to genotype.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is important to demonstrate that the lefty mutants they use do actually lead to elevated Nodal signaling</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that the use of novel mutants warrants more careful analysis of phenotype and thank the reviewers for the opportunity to better characterize them. The <italic>lefty</italic> mutants are more completely characterized in a separate paper that we just resubmitted to <italic>eLife</italic> (Rogers et al.). This paper shows that the allele we study is a null allele and that both Lefty1 and Lefty2 have overlapping roles as inhibitors of Nodal signaling.
