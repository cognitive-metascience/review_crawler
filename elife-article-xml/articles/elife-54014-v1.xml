The brain’s arousal systems are activated during such decisions. In previous work in humans, we found that evoked responses of arousal systems during decisions are reported by rapid dilations of the pupil and track a suppression of biases in the accumulation of decision-relevant evidence (de Gee et al., 2017). Here, we show that this arousal-related suppression in decision bias acts on both conservative and liberal biases, and generalizes from humans to mice, and from perceptual to memory-based decisions. In challenging sound-detection tasks, the impact of spontaneous or experimentally induced choice biases was reduced under high phasic arousal. Similar bias suppression occurred when evidence was drawn from memory. All of these behavioral effects were explained by reduced evidence accumulation biases. Our results point to a general principle of interplay between phasic arousal and decision-making.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pupil</kwd><kwd>arousal</kwd><kwd>behavioral modeling</kwd><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>bias</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DO 1240/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donner</surname><given-names>Tobias H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DO 1240/4–1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donner</surname><given-names>Tobias H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 936A7</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donner</surname><given-names>Tobias H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>658581-CODIR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsetsos</surname><given-names>Konstantinos</given-names></name><name><surname>Donner</surname><given-names>Tobias H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03DC015618</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McGinley</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC017797</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McGinley</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>German Academic Exchange Service</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A/13/70362</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Urai</surname><given-names>Anne E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LPDS 2019-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Urai</surname><given-names>Anne E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Across species and domains of decision-making, pupil-linked phasic arousal predicts suppression biases in the accumulation of evidence leading up to a choice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The global arousal state of the brain changes from moment to moment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>). These global state changes are controlled in large part by modulatory neurotransmitters that are released from subcortical nuclei such as the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) and the cholinergic basal forebrain. Release of these neuromodulators can profoundly change the operating mode of target cortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Froemke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harris and Thiele, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee and Dan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pfeffer et al., 2018</xref>). These same arousal systems are phasically recruited during elementary decisions, in relation to computational variables such as uncertainty about making the correct choice and surprise about decision outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouret and Sara, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Colizoli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dayan and Yu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krishnamurthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parikh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Urai et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Most decisions – including judgments about weak sensory signals in noise – are based on a protracted accumulation of decision-relevant evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</xref>) implemented in a distributed network of brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pinto et al., 2019</xref>). In perceptual decisions, noise-corrupted decision evidence is encoded in sensory cortex, and downstream regions of association and motor cortices accumulate the fluctuating sensory response over time into a decision variable that forms the basis of behavioral choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bogacz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Siegel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang, 2008</xref>). All of these brain regions are impacted by the brain’s arousal systems. Thus, phasic arousal might shape the encoding of the momentary evidence, the accumulation of this evidence into a decision variable, and/or the implementation of the motor act.</p><p>We previously combined fMRI, pupillometry and behavioral modeling in humans to illuminate the interaction between phasic arousal and perceptual evidence accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>). We found that rapid pupil dilations during perceptual decisions report evoked responses in specific neuromodulatory (brainstem) nuclei controlling arousal, including the noradrenergic LC. We also showed that those same pupil responses track a suppression of pre-existing biases in the accumulation of perceptual evidence. Specifically, in perceptual detection tasks, spontaneously emerging ‘conservative’ biases (towards reporting the absence of a target signal) were reduced under large phasic arousal. Thus, it remains an open question whether phasic arousal promotes liberal decision-making, or suppresses biases in either direction (conservative and liberal).</p><p>It is also unclear whether the impact of arousal generalizes to decisions that are based on non-sensory evidence, such as memory-based decisions. Elementary perceptual choice tasks are an established laboratory approach to studying decision-making mechanisms, but many important real-life decisions (e.g. which stock to buy) are also based on information gathered from memory. Recent advances indicate that such decisions may entail the accumulation of decision-relevant evidence drawn from memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shadlen and Shohamy, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Finally, it is also unknown whether the impact of arousal on decision-making generalizes from humans to rodents. This is important because rodents are increasingly utilized as experimental models for studying decision-making mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carandini and Churchland, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Najafi and Churchland, 2018</xref>). Indeed, rodents (rats) can accumulate perceptual evidence in a similar fashion to that in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>), their arousal systems are organized homologously with those of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaral and Sinnamon, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berridge and Waterhouse, 2003</xref>), and pupil dilation reports arousal also in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>). But the interplay between phasic arousal and decision-making in rodents remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we address the issues pertaining to the interplay between phasic arousal and decision-making outlined above. Specifically, we asked (i) whether the phasic arousal-linked suppression of decision biases generalizes from humans to rodents; (ii) whether phasic arousal predicts liberal decision-making, or a suppression of both liberal and conservative biases; and (iii) whether the interaction between phasic arousal and decision biases generalizes from perceptual to memory-based decisions. We addressed these questions by combining pupillometry and computational model-based analyses of behavior, in both humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badre et al., 2015</xref>), and by studying human decision-making in several contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We measured pupil-indexed phasic arousal while humans and mice performed the same auditory go/no-go detection task. To test for generality across domains of decision-making, humans performed a forced choice (yes/no) detection task that was based on the same auditory evidence under systematic manipulations of target probabilities, as well as a memory-based decision task.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>In humans and mice, phasic arousal tracks a reduction of choice bias</title><p>We first trained mice (N = 5) and humans (N = 20) to detect a near-threshold auditory signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; 'Materials and methods'). Each trial was a distinct auditory noise stimulus of 1 s duration. A weak signal tone was added to the last trial in a mini block of two-to-seven consecutive trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The number of trials, and thus the signal position in the sequence, was drawn randomly with signal probability that decreased across the mini block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, left). Because stable signals were embedded in fluctuating noise, detection performance could be maximized by accumulating the sensory evidence over time, within each trial. To indicate a yes choice, mice licked for sugar water reward and human subjects pressed a button. Reaction times (RTs) decreased and perceptual sensitivity (d′, from signal detection theory; see 'Materials and methods') increased with tone loudness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). We quantified phasic arousal as the rising slope of the pupil, measured immediately after trial onset (see 'Materials and methods'). We chose this measure (i) for its temporal precision in tracking arousal during fast-paced tasks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), (ii) to eliminate contamination by movements, and (iii) to track noradrenergic activity most specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>), which may play a specific role in decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dayan and Yu, 2006</xref>). Thus, we use the pupil response derivative as a proxy for the amplitude of the phasic response of central arousal systems. In what follows, we refer to this as the ‘pupil response’ for simplicity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>High phasic arousal is associated with reduced perceptual choice bias.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Auditory go/no-go detection task.

Because trial timing was predictable, subjects were able to anticipate the sound starts, and to align their arousal response to trial onset. The shorter pupil response latencies in mice compared to humans might be due to species differences in impulsivity, timing estimation and/or physical properties (their smaller eye and brain size).</p><p>Pupil dilations occurred on all trials, whether or not there was a behavioral response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), as also observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee and Margolis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schriver et al., 2020</xref>). However, as in our earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>), we found a relationship between the early, task-evoked pupil response and choice bias. Both mice and humans had an overall conservative choice bias, often failing to report the signal tones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; bias computed after collapsing across signal loudness levels; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,H</xref> and 'Materials and methods'). In both species, this conservative bias was significantly reduced in trials characterized by large pupil responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Mice were faster and more sensitive in trials that were characterized by large pupil responses, but this relationship did not generalize to humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Correlation between pupil response and choice bias is not due to motor factors</title><p>One concern in the go/no-go task is that the bias suppression associated with pupil dilation was related to the motor response for go choices.

Such transient activity at lick or button-press responses would contribute to pupil responses in trials with go-choices, but not in trials with no-go choices. This might produce the observed correlation between mean pupil response (more motor transients) and more liberal choice bias (more go-choices). We here minimized contamination by the transient motor-related component by focusing on the very early component of pupil response (see 'Materials and methods').</p><p>However, this approach did not correct for any asymmetry between go and no-go trials in terms of motor preparatory activity, which commonly ramps up during perceptual decision formation seconds before response execution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Donner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</xref>). Also the central input to the pupil during decision formation contains a sustained component, which might, at least in part, be related to motor preparatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Gee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>). To address this concern further, we re-analyzed results from the forced-choice (yes/no) version of the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; 'Materials and methods'), which were published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>) and which partly stemmed from the same participants as those that produced the go/no-go data. In yes/no detection tasks, both motor responses and associated motor preparatory activity are balanced across yes and no choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Donner et al., 2009</xref>). We found that pupil responses in the go/no-go and yes/no tasks were correlated across participants, for both yes and no choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This result indicates that pupil response in both tasks primarily reflected decision processing rather than motor preparation or execution. Furthermore, we observed an arousal-linked suppression of perceptual choice bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, top). Taken together, the results indicate that the pupil-linked reduction of choice bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) is not due to motor factors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Phasic arousal reduces both conservative and liberal choice biases.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Auditory yes/no (forced choice) tone-in-noise detection task.

We fitted several variants of a popular version of such models, the drift diffusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bogacz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brody and Hanks, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>). The diffusion model describes the perfect accumulation of noisy sensory evidence in a single decision variable that drifts to one of two decision bounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). For all yes/no data sets, we quantified the effects of pupil-linked arousal on the following model parameters (see 'Materials and methods'): 1) the starting point of the decision, 2) the mean drift rate, 3) an evidence-independent bias in the drift (henceforth called ‘drift bias’), 4) boundary separation (controlling speed-accuracy tradeoff), and 5) non-decision time (the speed of pre-decisional evidence encoding and post-decisional translation of choice into motor response). The diffusion model accounted well for the overall behavior in each task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), with accurate predictions of RT, sensitivity and bias (blue ‘X’ markers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), and the expected increase of drift rate with signal loudness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Within the diffusion model, a bias might be due to a shift in the starting point or to a bias in the drift (alone or in combination with another model parameter, see below; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

The conditional response functions of all yes/no data sets exhibited pupil-linked shifts across the full range of RTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), a pattern more consistent with a shift in drift bias.

For the go/no-go task, the model was not fully constrained because of the absence of RTs for no choices. This precluded us from fitting both bias parameters (starting point or drift bias) as a function pupil response bin. Because model comparisons favored pupil-dependent variation of drift bias over pupil-dependent starting point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we proceeded with the former version, estimating a single starting point value irrespective of pupil bin.</p><p>We also formally compared the fit provided by the ‘full model’ described before to two alternative models: (i) the ‘starting point model’, with drift bias fixed across pupil bins and starting point varying with pupil bins (otherwise identical to the full model); and (ii) the ‘drift bias model’, with starting point fixed across pupil bins and drift bias varying with pupil bins (otherwise identical to the full model).

In the go/no-go data sets from both species, starting point was biased towards no-go (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Overcoming this conservative bias set by starting point required shifting the drift bias towards the yes bound, which occurred in trials with rapid pupil dilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

In summary, the pupil-linked behavioral effects in all of the data sets analyzed here were consistent with a phasic arousal-dependent, selective reduction in the bias of the evidence accumulation process that underlies the decisions assessed here.</p><p>Some accounts hold that arousal specifically enhances the representation of task-relevant variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mather et al., 2016</xref>). In the tasks used here, this scenario predicts increased sensitivity and/or reduced RT under high arousal. The pupil-linked effects in d′ or RT in several of the data sets analyzed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) are inconsistent with this prediction. Correspondingly, pupil dilation also exhibited no consistent (across data sets) association with changes of drift rate (measure of sensitivity), and no association with boundary separation (measure of response caution) or non-decision time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>).</p><p>Our results imply that the build-up (drift) of the decision variable varies dynamically across trials, irrespective of the sensory evidence but as a function of phasic arousal. The resulting variability in the drift would appear to be random when ignoring phasic arousal.

But when we forced the drift bias to be the same for both conditions, drift rate variability was overestimated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Lower BIC values indicate a model that is better able to explain the data, taking into account the model complexity; a BIC of 10 is generally taken as a threshold for considering one model to be a sufficiently better fit. Data points are for individual subjects. The urgency model provided the best fit. We reasoned, however, that the best overall model in terms of BIC does not necessarily best explain the behavioral correlates of pupil-linked phasic arousal. To investigate this, we refitted the urgency model, and now let urgency vary with a number of randomly defined (within subject) bins. This ‘random’ urgency model again outperformed the starting point and drift bias models (all mean BIC across subjects &lt; −10). This suggest that the urgency model’s goodness of fit is due to the powerful effect that the urgency has on the overall RT distribution (irrespective of pupil). Specifically, it can cut off the long tail in the RT distribution of the DDM, which agrees with the overall empirical RT distributions of the yes/no detection datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

(A fixed drift bias combined with varying urgency was not considered here because our simulations showed that this could not produce any biases of the observed magnitudes.) In each model, we fitted boundary separation, drift rate and non-decision time irrespective of pupil bin. For formal model comparison of these models, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Finally, we simulated data on the basis of the fitted parameters of the above starting point, drift bias and urgency models, and assessed the corresponding variations in overt choice biases as a function of pupil response bin. The model with collapsing bounds produced only negligible pupil-linked variations in choice bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), contrary to what we observed in all data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). We then compared the differences between the choice biases predicted by each model and the empirically measured choice biases, referred to as ‘residuals’ for simplicity. In each data set, the residuals of the urgency model were significantly larger than those of both the starting point and drift bias models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In each data set, the residuals of the drift bias model were smallest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that this model best captured the pupil-dependent variation in overt choice bias. Taken together, all of our modeling efforts converged on the conclusion that changes in drift bias, but in neither starting point nor decision urgency (combined with a pre-existing starting point bias), implement the pupil-linked shifts in choice bias.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Suppression of bias by phasic arousal is distinct from ongoing slow state fluctuations</title><p>One concern is that the bias suppression related to phasic arousal reported here might be ‘inherited’ through a previously observed negative correlation between phasic pupil responses and pre-trial baseline pupil diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Gee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gilzenrat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mridha et al., 2019</xref>). This is probably due to a combination of a true negative correlation between baseline and evoked arousal, and a general tendency of pupil size to revert to the mean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mridha et al., 2019</xref>). Pre-trial baseline pupil size might vary from trial to trial because it tracks slow (ongoing) arousal fluctuations and/or is contaminated by pre-trial spill-over effects (e.g., uncertainty [high/low], response [yes/no], and pupil response magnitude).</p><p>A dependence on baseline pupil could not account for the results reported here, for four reasons. First, there was a non-monotonic association between baseline pupil diameter and decision bias in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>), in contrast to the monotonic pattern that we observed here for phasic arousal in the same data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Second, pupil responses exhibited a negligible (go/no-go data sets) or weak (yes/no data sets) correlation with the preceding baseline diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>); in all cases, these correlations are substantially smaller than those for conventional baseline-corrected pupil response amplitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Gee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gilzenrat et al., 2010</xref>). Third, in three out of four data sets with a weak anticorrelation between pupil response and baseline pupil size, there was no consistent linear association between baseline pupil diameter and choice bias (yes/no equal, p=0.002; yes/no rare, p=0.265; yes/no frequent, p=0.157; yes/no recognition, p=0.592; using the same mixed-linear modeling approach as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). In summary, the reduction in choice bias linked to pupil responses reported here reflects genuine correlates of phasic arousal, and not of the slowly varying, baseline arousal state.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Arousal is traditionally thought to upregulate the efficiency of information processing globally (e.g., the quality of evidence encoding or the efficiency of accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mather et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>]). However, recent work indicates that phasic arousal signals might have distinct effects, such as reducing the impact of prior expectations and biases on decision formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Gee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krishnamurthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Urai et al., 2017</xref>). Our results are in consistent with the idea that phasic arousal suppresses biases in the accumulation of evidence leading up to a choice, a function that generalizes across species (humans and mice) and domains of decision-making (from perceptual to memory-based).</p><p>We observed pupil-linked bias-reduction in human and mouse choice behavior during analogous auditory tone-detection tasks. Task-evoked pupil responses occurred early during decision formation, even in trials without a motor response, and tracked a suppression of conservative choice bias. Behavioral modeling indicated that the bias reduction was due to a selective interaction with the accumulation of information from the noisy sensory evidence. We further showed that phasic arousal tracks a reduction of accumulation biases, whether conservative or liberal, as seen in the conditions with different stimulus presentation statistics. Finally, we showed, under the assumption that mnemonic decisions are based on samples from memory, that pupil-linked suppression of evidence accumulation bias also occurs for memory-based decisions. We conclude that the ongoing deliberation, culminating in a choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</xref>), interacts in a canonical way with transient boosts in the global arousal state of the brain: more phasic arousal tracks reduced evidence accumulation bias.</p><p>We here used pupil responses as a peripheral readout of changes in cortical arousal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Joshi and Gold, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Larsen and Waters, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>). Indeed, recent work has shown that pupil diameter closely tracks several established measures of cortical arousal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Larsen and Waters, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>). Changes in pupil diameter have been associated with locus coeruleus (LC) activity in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murphy et al., 2014</xref>), monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Varazzani et al., 2015</xref>), and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Breton-Provencher and Sur, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). However, some (of these) studies also found unique contributions to pupil size in other subcortical regions, such as the cholinergic basal forebrain and dopaminergic midbrain, and the superior and inferior colliculi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mridha et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the exact neuroanatomical and neurochemical source(s) of our observed effects of phasic arousal on decision-making remain to be determined.</p><p>There is mounting evidence for an arousal-linked reduction of biases and/or prior beliefs in humans, and our current findings generalize this emerging principle to rodents (mice) as well as to a higher-level form of decision-making that is based on information retrieved from memory. Previous work has shown a suppression of evidence accumulation bias similar to that which we found here during challenging visual perceptual choice tasks (contrast detection and random dot motion discrimination) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, during sound localization in a dynamic environment, phasic arousal tracks a reduced influence of prior expectations on perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krishnamurthy et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, suppressive effects of phasic arousal also apply to choice history biases that evolve across trials. In this case, phasic arousal reflects perceptual decision uncertainty in the current trial and a reduction of choice repetition bias in the next trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Urai et al., 2017</xref>). One study reported that phasic arousal tracked an overall reduction of reaction time during random dot motion discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">van Kempen et al., 2019</xref>). However, in this study, the signal strength was so high that the task could be solved without the temporal accumulation of evidence: reaction times were overall short (median &lt;600 ms) and performance was close to ceiling. Thus, the arousal-dependent bias suppression seems to be a principle that generalizes across species, directions of bias, and domains of decision-making.</p><p>Some studies found a relationship between pupil responses and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Binda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ebitz and Moore, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Naber et al., 2013</xref>). In our tasks, this would predict a relationship between pupil-linked arousal and participants’ sensitivity, RT or drift rate. But pupil responses were not systematically associated either of these measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the studies discussed above focused on visual stimulus-evoked pupil responses, whereas we focused on the non-luminance-mediated, arousal-related pupil responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Joshi and Gold, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Larsen and Waters, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>).</p><p>The use of the drift diffusion model in the current study was based on four main assumptions. First, in the go/no-go task, we assume that participants accumulated the auditory evidence <italic>within</italic> each trial (discrete noise token) during a mini block and reset this accumulation process before the next discrete sound. Second, in both the go/no-go and yes/no tasks, we assume that subjects actively accumulated evidence towards both yes and no choices, which is supported by neurophysiological data from yes/no tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deco et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Donner et al., 2009</xref>). Third, in the go/no-go task, we assume that subjects set an implicit boundary for no choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ratcliff et al., 2018</xref>). Fourth, in the picture recognition task, we assume that memory-based decisions follow the same sequential sample principle established for perceptual decisions, whereby the ‘samples’ that are accumulated into the decision variable are drawn from memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bowen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ratcliff, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shadlen and Shohamy, 2016</xref>). Although the quality of our model fits suggest that the model successfully accounted for the measured behavior, lending support to the validity of these assumptions, further work is needed to establish the evidence accumulation principle across decision tasks. This holds in particular for the memory-based decisions, where the hypothetical evidence ‘samples’ can neither be directly controlled nor observed.</p><p>The monotonic effects of ‘phasic’ arousal on the decision biases that we report here contrast with the observed effects of ‘tonic’ (pre-stimulus) arousal, which has a non-monotonic (inverted U) effect on behavior (perceptual sensitivity and bias) and neural activity (the signal-to-noise ratio of thalamic and cortical sensory responses) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gelbard-Sagiv et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>). Our study allows a direct comparison of tonic and phasic arousal effects within the same data set in mice. A previous report on that data set showed that the mice’s behavioral performance was most rapid and accurate, and the least biased, at intermediate levels of ‘tonic’ arousal (medium baseline pupil size) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>). By contrast, we show here that the behavioral performance of the mice was linearly related to phasic arousal, with the most rapid and accurate and the least biased choices being associated with the most rapid phasic arousal responses. It is tempting to speculate that these differences result from different neuromodulatory systems governing tonic and phasic arousal. Indeed, rapid dilations of the pupil (phasic arousal) are more tightly associated with phasic activity in noradrenergic axons, whereas slow changes in pupil (tonic arousal) are accompanied by sustained activity in cholinergic axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). Future physiological work should dissect the role of phasic and tonic neuromodulatory signals in decision-making computations in the brain.</p><p>Recent findings indicate that intrinsic behavioral variability is increased during sustained (‘tonic’) elevation of noradrenaline (NA) levels, in line with the ‘adaptive gain theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>). First, optical stimulation of LC inputs to anterior cingulate cortex caused rats to abandon strategic counter prediction in favor of stochastic choice in a competitive game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tervo et al., 2014</xref>). Second, chemogenetic stimulation of the LC in rats performing a patch-leaving task increased decision noise and subsequent exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kane et al., 2017</xref>). Third, pharmacologically reducing central NA levels in monkeys performing an operant effort exertion task parametrically increased choice consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jahn et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, pharmacologically increasing central tonic NA levels in human subjects boosted the rate of alternations in a bistable visual input and long-range correlations in brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pfeffer et al., 2018</xref>). In the drift diffusion model, increased within-trial decision noise manifested as a decrease of the mean drift rate (quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio of decision evidence), which was not consistently evident in the present data. This is another indication, together with the baseline pupil effects reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>, that the effects of phasic and tonic neuromodulation are distinct.</p><p>One influential account holds that phasic LC responses during decision-making are triggered by the threshold crossing in some circuit accumulating evidence, and that the resulting NA release then facilitates the translation of the choice into a motor act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>). Within the drift diffusion model, this predicts a reduction in non-decision time and no effect on evidence accumulation. In contrast to this prediction, we found in all our datasets that phasic arousal affected evidence accumulation (suppressing biases therein), but not non-decision time. Our approach does not enable us to rule out an effect of phasic arousal on movement execution (i.e., kinematics). Yet, our results clearly establish an important role of phasic arousal in evidence accumulation, ruling out any <italic>purely</italic> post-decisional account. This implies that phasic LC responses driving pupil dilation are already recruited during evidence accumulation, or that the effect of pupil-linked arousal on evidence accumulation are governed by systems other than the LC. Future experiments characterizing phasic activity in the LC or in other brainstem nuclei that are involved in arousal during protracted evidence accumulation tasks could shed light on this issue.</p><p>Anatomical evidence supports the speculation that task-evoked neuromodulatory responses and cortical decision circuits interact in a recurrent fashion. One possibility is that neuromodulatory responses alter the balance between ‘bottom-up’ and ‘top-down’ signaling across the cortical hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Friston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hasselmo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hsieh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kimura et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kobayashi et al., 2000</xref>). Sensory cortical regions encode likelihood signals and send these (bottom-up) to association cortex; participants’ prior beliefs (about target probability, for example) are sent back (top-down) to the lower levels of the hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pouget et al., 2013</xref>). Neuromodulators might reduce the weight of this prior data in the inference process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Friston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moran et al., 2013</xref>), thereby reducing choice biases. Another possibility is neuromodulator release might scale with uncertainty about the incoming sensory data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Friston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moran et al., 2013</xref>). Such a process could be implemented as top-down control by the cortical systems that are involved in decision-making over neuromodulatory brainstem centers. This line of reasoning is consistent with anatomical connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sara, 2009</xref>). Finally, a related conceptual model that has been proposed for phasic LC responses is that cortical regions driving the LC (e.g. ACC) continuously compute the ratio of the posterior probability of the state of the world to its (estimated) prior probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dayan and Yu, 2006</xref>). LC is then activated when neural activity ramps towards the non-default choice (against ones’ bias). The resulting LC activity might reset its cortical target circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouret and Sara, 2005</xref>) and override the default state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dayan and Yu, 2006</xref>), facilitating the transition of the cortical decision circuitry towards the non-default state. These scenarios are in line with recent insights that (LC-mediated) pupil-linked phasic arousal shapes brain-wide connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shine, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stitt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zerbi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our study showcases the value of comparative experiments in humans and non-human species. One would expect the basic functions of arousal systems (e.g. the LC-NA system) to be analogous in humans and rodents. Yet, it has been unclear whether these systems are recruited in the same way during decision-making. Computational variables such as decision uncertainty or surprise are encoded in prefrontal cortical regions (e.g. anterior cingulate or orbitofrontal cortex; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kepecs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ma and Jazayeri, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pouget et al., 2016</xref>) and conveyed to brainstem arousal systems via top-down projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Breton-Provencher and Sur, 2019</xref>). Both the cortical representations of computational variables and the top-down projections to brainstem may differ between species. More importantly, it has not been known whether key components of the decision formation process, in particular evidence accumulation, would be affected by arousal signals in the same way in different species. Only recently has it been established that rodents (rats) and humans accumulate perceptual evidence in an analogous fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>). Our results indicate that the shaping of evidence accumulation by phasic arousal is also governed by a principle that is conserved across species.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>All procedures concerning the animal experiments were carried out in accordance with Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and are described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>).

We analyzed two previously unpublished human data sets, and re-analyzed a previously published mice data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>) and two human data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergt et al., 2018</xref> have analyzed pupil responses only during the encoding phase of the picture recognition memory experiment; we here present the first analyses of pupil responses during the recognition phase.</p><p>The sample sizes (and trial numbers per individual) for the newly collected human data sets were determined on the basis of the effects observed in a previous study comparing diffusion model parameters between pupil conditions, with N = 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>). The previously published mouse data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>) consisted of data from five mice. Please note that the small number of mice was compensated by a substantial number of trials per individual, which is ideal for the detailed behavioral modeling we pursued here. We selected the data set by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergt et al., 2018</xref> for across-subject correlations of variables of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This data set had a sufficient sample size for such an analysis, as determined on the basis of the effect size obtained in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Gee et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Five mice (all males; age range, 2–4 months) and 20 human subjects (15 females; age range, 19–28 y) performed the go/no-go task. Twenty-four human subjects (of which 18 had already participated in the go/no-go task; 20 females; age range, 19–28 y) performed an additional yes/no task. Fifteen human subjects (eight females; age range, 20–28 y) performed the yes/no task with biased signal probabilities. Fifty-four human subjects (27 females; age range, 18–35 y) performed a picture recognition task, of which two were excluded from the analyses because of eye-tracking failure.</p><p>For the go/no-go task, mice performed between five and seven sessions (described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>), yielding a total of 2469–3479 trials per subject. For the go/no-go task, human participants performed 11 blocks of 60 trials each (distributed over two measurement sessions), yielding a total of 660 trials per participant. For the yes/no task, human participants performed between 11 and 13 blocks of 120 trials each (distributed over two measurement sessions), yielding a total of 1320–1560 trials per participant. For the yes/no task with biased signal probabilities, human subjects performed eight blocks of 120 trials each (distributed over two measurement sessions), yielding a total of 960 trials per participant.

Each trial was a distinct auditory noise stimulus of 1 s duration, and the inter-trial interval was 0.5 s. A weak signal tone was added to the last trial in the mini block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The number of trials, and thus the signal position in the sequence, was randomly drawn beforehand. The probability of a target signal decreased linearly with trial number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, left). Each mini block was terminated by the subject’s go response (hit or false alarm) or after a no-go error (miss). Each trial consisted of an auditory noise stimulus, or a pure tone added to one of the noise stimuli (cosine-gated 2 kHz for humans; new tone frequency each session for mice to avoid cortical reorganization across the weeks of training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>]). Noise stimuli were temporally orthogonal ripple combinations, which have spectro-temporal content that is highly dynamic, thus requiring temporal integration of the acoustic information in order to detect the stable signal tones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>). In the mouse experiments, auditory stimuli were presented at an overall intensity of 55 dB (root-mean-square [RMS] for each 1 s trial). In the human experiments, auditory stimuli were presented at an intensity of 65 dB using an IMG Stageline MD-5000DR over-ear headphone.</p><p>Mice learned to respond during the signal-plus-noise trials and to withhold responses during noise trials across training sessions. Mice responded by licking for sugar water reward. Human participants were instructed to press a button with their right index finger. Correct yes choices (hits) were followed by positive feedback: 4 μL of sugar water in the mice experiment, and a green fixation dot in the human experiment. In both mice and humans, false alarms were followed by an 8 s timeout. Humans, but not mice, also received an 8 s timeout after misses. This design difference was introduced to compensate for differences in general response bias between species that was evident in pilot experiments: mice tended to lick too frequently without a selective penalty for false alarms (i.e. liberal bias), whereas human participants exhibited a generally conservative intrinsic bias with balanced penalties for false alarms and correct rejects. Selectively penalizing false alarms would have aggravated this conservative tendency in humans, hence undermining the cross-species comparison of behavior.</p><p>The signal loudness was varied from trial to trial (−30 dB to 0 dB with respect to RMS noise in mice; −40 dB to –5 dB with respect to RMS noise in humans), while the 1-second mean RMS loudness of the noise was held constant. For the trial containing a signal tone within each mini block, signal loudness was selected randomly under the constraint that each of six (mice) or five (humans) levels would occur equally often within each session (mice) or block of 60 mini blocks (humans). The corresponding signal loudness exhibited a robust effect on mean accuracy, with the highest accuracy for the loudest signal level: F(5,20) = 23.95 (p&lt;0.001) and F(4,76) = 340.9 (p&lt;0.001), for mouse and human subjects, respectively. Human hit rates were almost at ceiling level for the loudest signal (94.7% ± 0.69% s.e.m.), and close to ceiling for the second loudest signal (92.8% ± 0.35% s.e.m.). Because so few errors are not enough to constrain the drift diffusion model sufficiently, we merged the two conditions with the loudest signals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Perceptual yes/no (forced choice) auditory tone-in-noise detection task</title><p>Each trial consisted of two consecutive intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>): (i) the baseline interval (3–4 s uniformly distributed); and (ii) the decision interval, the start of which was signaled by the onset of the auditory stimulus and which was terminated by the subject’s response (or after a maximum duration of 2.5 s). The decision interval consisted of only an auditory noise stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>), or a pure tone (2 kHz) superimposed onto the noise. In the first experiment, the signal was presented in 50% of trials. Auditory stimuli were presented at the same intensity of 65 dB using the same over-ear headphone as in the go/no-go task. In the second experiment, in order to manipulate perceptual choice bias experimentally, the signal was presented in either 30% of trials (‘rare’ blocks) or 70% of trials (‘frequent’ blocks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Auditory stimuli were presented at approximately the same signal loudness (65 dB) using a Sennheiser HD 660 s over-ear headphone, suppressing ambient noise.</p><p>Participants were instructed to report the presence or absence of the signal by pressing one of two response buttons with their left or right index finger, once they felt sufficiently certain (free response paradigm). The mapping between perceptual choice and button press (e.g., ‘yes’ → right key; ‘no’ → left key) was counterbalanced across participants. After every 40 trials, subjects were informed about their performance. In the second experiment, subjects were explicitly informed about signal probability. The order of signal probability (e.g., first 480 trials → 30%; last 480 trials → 70%) was counterbalanced across subjects.</p><p>Throughout the experiment, the target signal loudness was fixed at a level that yielded about 75% correct choices in the 50% signal probability condition. Each participant’s individual signal, loudness was determined before the main experiment using an adaptive staircase procedure (Quest). For this, we used a two-interval forced choice variant of the tone-in-noise detection yes/no task (one interval, signal-plus-noise; the other, noise), in order to minimize contamination of the staircase by individual bias (generally smaller in two-interval forced choice than in yes/no tasks). In the first experiment, the resulting threshold signal loudness produced a mean accuracy of 74.14% correct (±0.75% s.e.m.). In the second experiment, the resulting threshold signal loudness produced a mean accuracy of 84.40% correct (±1.75% s.e.m.) and 83.37% correct (±1.36% s.e.m.) in the rare and frequent conditions, respectively. This increased accuracy was expected given the subjects’ ability to incorporate prior knowledge about signal probability into their decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Memory-based (forced choice) yes/no picture recognition decision task</title><p>The full experiment consisted of a picture and word encoding task, and a 24 hr-delayed free recall and recognition test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergt et al., 2018</xref> (data available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/Reading_memory_formation_from_the_eyes/11432118">https://figshare.com/articles/Reading_memory_formation_from_the_eyes/11432118)</ext-link>. Here, we did not analyze data from the word recognition task because of a modality mismatch: auditory during encoding, visual during recognition. During encoding, 75 neutral and 75 negative grayscale pictures (modified to have the same average luminance) were randomly chosen from the picture pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergt et al., 2018</xref>) and presented in randomized order for 3 s at the center of the screen, against a gray background that was equiluminant to the pictures. Subjects were instructed to memorize the pictures (intentional encoding) and to evaluate how emotional each picture was on a 4-point scale from 0 (‘neutral’) to 3 (‘very negative’). During recognition, 24 hr post encoding, subjects saw all of the pictures that were presented on the first day and an equal number of novel neutral and negative items in randomized order. Subjects were instructed to indicate for each item whether it had been presented the previous day (‘yes – old’) or not (‘no – new’). For items that were identified as ‘old’, participants were further asked to rate on a scale from 1 (‘not certain’) to 4 (‘very certain’) how confident they were that the item was indeed ‘old’.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>The mouse pupil data acquisition is described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>).

The left eye’s pupil was tracked at 1000 Hz with an average spatial resolution of 15 to 30 min arc, using an EyeLink 1000 Long Range Mount (SR Research, Osgoode, Ontario, Canada), and it was calibrated once at the start of each block.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analysis of task-evoked pupil responses</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Preprocessing</title><p>Periods of blinks and saccades were detected using the manufacturer’s standard algorithms with default settings. The remaining data analyses were performed using custom-made Python scripts. We applied to each pupil timeseries: (i) linear interpolation of missing data due to blinks or other reasons (interpolation time window, from 150 ms before until 150 ms after missing data), (ii) low-pass filtering (third-order Butterworth, cut-off: 6 Hz), (iii) for human pupil data, removal of pupil responses to blinks and to saccades, by first estimating these responses by means of deconvolution and then removing them from the pupil time series by means of multiple linear regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knapen et al., 2016</xref>), (iv) conversion to units of modulation (percent signal change) around the mean of the pupil time series from each measurement session, and (v) down-sampling to 50 Hz. We computed the first time derivative of the pupil size, by subtracting the size from adjacent frames, and low-pass filtered the result (third-order Butterworth, cut-off: 2 Hz).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Quantification of task-evoked pupil responses</title><p>In our previous work, which we aimed to extend here, we computed pupil responses aligned to subjects’ behavioral choice (rather than stimulus onset), which was motivated by both theoretical considerations and empirical observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Gee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>). All yes/no tasks (detection and recognition) were analogous in structure to the tasks from those previous studies. Thus, for those tasks, we here again computed task-evoked pupil responses time-locked to the behavioral choice (button press). Specifically, we computed pupil responses as the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the pupil derivative time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>) in the 500 ms before button press (gray windows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>). The resulting pupil bins were associated with different overall pupil response amplitudes (with regard to pre-trial baseline pupil size) across the whole duration of the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>The auditory go/no-go task entailed several deviations from the above task structure that required a different quantification of task-evoked pupil responses. The go/no task had, by design, an imbalance of motor responses between trials ending with different decisions, with no motor response for (implicit) no choices. Thus, no response-locking was possible for no-decisions, forcing us to deviate from our standard, choice-locked analysis approach, and to use stimulus-locking instead. Because decision times were substantially shorter in the go-/no-go tasks than in all the yes/no tasks (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), behavioral correlates of pupil dilation should be less dependent on whether the pupil responses are aligned to stimulus onset or choice in the former.</p><p>In the go/no-go task, a transient drive of pupil dilation by the motor response (lick or button press) would yield larger (and potentially more rapid) pupil responses for go choices (motor movement) than for implicit no-go choices (no motor movement), even without any link between phasic arousal and decision bias. We took two approaches to minimize contamination by this motor imbalance. First, we quantified the single-trial response rate as the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the pupil derivative in an early window, ranging from the start of the period when the trial-average pupil derivative time course was significantly different from zero up to the first peak (gray windows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For the mice, this window ranged from 40 to 230 ms after trial onset; for humans, this window ranged from 230 to 500 ms after trial onset. Second, we excluded decision intervals with a motor response before the end of this window plus a 50 ms buffer (cutoff 280 ms for mice, 550 ms for humans; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In both species, the resulting pupil-derivate-defined bins were associated with different overall pupil response amplitudes across the whole duration of the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>Re-analyzing all yes/no data by time-locking the pupil responses to the stimulus onsets yielded pupil response time courses that were similar overall to the choice-aligned ones shown in the paper (Figure R1A). Yet, stimulus-locking did not yield a consistent relationship to any behavioral measure (RT, sensitivity/d′, or bias/criterion; Figure R1B-D), corroborating our use of choice-aligned pupil responses for inferring the role of phasic arousal signals in decision-making and evidence accumulation.</p><p>For analyses of the go/no-go task and the yes/no task with equal probability of signal occurrence, we used five equally populated bins of task-evoked pupil responses. As sensitivity increased with tone loudness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), there were more go-trials for louder tones (mean number of go-trials across subjects from least to most loud tones): 68, 73, 97, 122, 136 and 166 go-trials for mice and 45, 69, 89 and215 go-trials for human subjects. To ensure an equal number of tones of each loudness in each pupil bin, we binned trials by pupil response <italic>within</italic> a given loudness condition. We used three bins for the yes/no task with biased environments, because subjects performed substantially fewer trials (see '<italic>Subjects'</italic>). We used two bins for the picture recognition task, so that we could perform the individual difference analysis reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. In the picture recognition task, we ensured that each pupil bin contained an equal number of neutral and emotional stimuli. In all cases, the results are qualitatively the same when using five equally populated bins of task-evoked pupil responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis and modeling of choice behavior</title><p>In the go/no-go task, the first trial of each mini block (see '<italic>Behavioral tasks</italic>') was excluded from the analyses, because this trial served as a mini block start cue, and never included the signal (pure sine wave).

In the mice go/no-go data set, trials with RTs shorter than 280 ms were excluded from the analyses (see '<italic>Quantification of task-evoked pupillary responses'</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>); in all human data sets, trials with RTs shorter than 550 ms were excluded from the analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Signal-detection theoretic modeling (go/no-go and yes/no tasks)</title><p>The signal detection theoretic (SDT) metrics sensitivity (d′) and criterion (c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Green and Swets, 1966</xref>) were computed separately for each of the bins of pupil response size.

We estimated criterion by averaging the z-scores of hit rates and false-alarm rates and multiplying the result by −1.</p><p>In the go/no-go task, subjects could set only one decision criterion (not to be confused with the above-defined c), against which to compare sensory evidence so as to determine choice. This is because signal loudness was drawn pseudo-randomly for each trial and participants had no way of using separate criteria for different signal strengths. We reconstructed this overall decision criterion (irrespective of signal loudness) and used this as a measure of the overall choice bias, whose dependence on pupil response we then assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To this end, we used the following approach derived from SDT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Green and Swets, 1966</xref>). We computed one false alarm rate (based on the noise trials) and multiple hit rates (one per signal loudness). Based on these, we modeled one overall noise distribution (normally distributed with mean = 0, sigma = 1), and one ‘composite’ signal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which was computed as the average across a number of signal distributions separately modeled for each signal loudness (each normally distributed with mean = empirical d′ for that signal loudness, and sigma = 1).</p><p>We defined the ‘zero-bias point’ (<italic>Z</italic>) as the value for which the noise and composite signal distributions crossed:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>S</italic> and <italic>N</italic> are the composite signal and noise distributions, respectively.</p><p>The subject’s empirical ‘choice point’ (<italic>C</italic>) was computed as:<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>×</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>'</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>d<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>c<sub>i</sub></italic> were a subject’s SDT-sensitivity and SDT-criterion for a given signal loudness, ‘i’.

In all datasets, we allowed the following parameters to vary with pupil response-bins: (i) the separation between both bounds (i.e. response caution); (ii) the mean drift rate across trials; (iii) drift bias (an evidence independent constant added to the drift); and (iv) the non-decision time (sum of the latencies for sensory encoding and motor execution of the choice). In the datasets using yes/no protocols, we additionally allowed starting point to vary with pupil response bin.

We then fitted the model to the simulated data (with the G square method; see below), letting only drift bias vary with condition, and to another version of the model in which we fixed drift bias across the two conditions.

Fitting the model to RT distributions for the separate responses (termed ‘stimulus coding’ in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wiecki et al., 2013</xref>) enabled the estimation of parameters that could have induced biases towards specific choices. Bayesian MCMC generates full posterior distributions over parameter estimates, quantifying not only the most likely parameter value but also the uncertainty associated with that estimate. The hierarchical nature of the model assumes that all observers in a data set are drawn from a group, with specific group-level prior distributions that are informed by the literature. In practice, this results in more stable parameter estimates for individual subjects, who are constrained by the group-level inference. The hierarchical nature of the model also minimizes the risk of overfitting the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Katahira, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vandekerckhove et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wiecki et al., 2013</xref>).

Instead, we fitted the go/no-go data on the basis of RT quantiles, using the so-called G square method (code contributed to the master HDDM repository on Github: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hddm-devs/hddm/blob/master/hddm/examples/gonogo_demo.ipynb">https://github.com/hddm-devs/hddm/blob/master/hddm/examples/gonogo_demo.ipynb</ext-link>). The RT distributions for yes choices were represented by the 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 quantiles, and, along with the associated response proportions, contributed to G square; a single bin containing the number of no-go choices contributed to G square (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ratcliff et al., 2018</xref>). Starting point and drift rate variability were fitted but fixed across the pupil-defined bins. In addition, drift rate, drift bias and non-decision time varied with signal loudness. The same noise-only trials were re-used when fitting the model to each signal loudness.</p><p>The absence of no-responses in the go/no-go protocol required fixing one of the two bias parameters (starting point or drift bias) as a function of pupil response; leaving both parameters free to vary led to poor parameter recovery. We fixed starting point on the basis of formal model comparison between a model with pupil-dependent variation of drift bias and starting point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For simplicity, here we ignored signal loudness, but the same was true when explicitly modeling signal loudness (data not shown).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical comparisons</title><p>We used a mixed linear modeling approach implemented in the Python-package '<italic>Statsmodels'</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seabold and Perktold, 2010</xref>) to quantify the dependence of several metrics of overt behavior, or of estimated model parameters (see above), on pupil response bin.

Our approach was analogous to sequential polynomial regression analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Draper and Smith, 1998</xref>), but now performed within a mixed linear modeling framework.

For data from the go/no-go task, that meant that intercepts and signal loudness and pupil bin coefficients could vary with participant. For data from the yes/no tasks, intercepts and pupil bin coefficients could vary with participant. The mixed models were fitted through restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Each model was then sequentially tested in a serial hierarchical analysis, which was based on BIC. This analysis was performed for the complete sample at once, and it tested whether adding the next higher order model yielded a significantly better description of the response than the respective lower order model. We tested models from the first-order (constant, no effect of pupil response) up to the second-order (quadratic, non-monotonic). In the second step, we refitted the winning model through restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML).</p><p>We used paired-sample t-tests to test for significant differences between the pupil derivative time course and 0, between pupil responses for yes versus no choices, and for behavioral metrics between pupil response bins in the picture recognition experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data and code sharing</title><p>The data and analysis scripts are publicly available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jwdegee/2020_eLife_pupil_bias">https://github.com/jwdegee/2020_eLife_pupil_bias</ext-link> (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/2020_eLife_pupil_bias">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/2020_eLife_pupil_bias</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Gee, 2020</xref>). </p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Daniëlle Rijkmans, Guusje Boomgaard and Christopher David Riddell for help with the data collection for the human auditory detection tasks, Michael Beauchamp and colleagues at the Core for Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging at Baylor College of Medicine for letting us use the psychophysics lab to collect data for the human auditory detection tasks with biased environments, Anne Bergt for help with the data collection for the human picture recognition task, and all members of the Donner lab for discussion.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Phasic arousal suppresses biases in mice and humans across domains of decision-making&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marcus Grüschow (Reviewer #1); R Becket Ebitz (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study builds on a previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper (&quot;Dynamic modulation of decision biases by brainstem arousal systems&quot;) that showing that phasic pupil responses predict reduced conservative accumulation biases in humans performing perceptual tasks. Here the authors show that the biases: 1) are reduced in both directions (liberal/conservative), 2) are comparable in both mice and humans, and 3) occur in both in memory-based and perceptual decisions There was general agreement that the new work is a useful and substantial extension of the previous work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a consistent conflation of measured correlations/predictions with what seem to be much stronger claims about causality; e.g., in the title, along with many places in the text, that claim that &quot;phasic arousal suppresses…&quot; (or &quot;reduces&quot;, &quot;affected&quot;, etc). These points should be disentangled and clarified.</p><p>2) Several questions/concerns were noted regarding the DDM fits. In particular:</p><p>a) It seems that the core feature captured by the accumulation bias term in the DDM (the growing bias with longer RTs) might also be explained by a starting point bias in combination with an urgency signal (e.g., as bounds decay, the relative bias in the starting point becomes more and more important). Are the authors making a strong claim about the exact process model that they have chosen? And if so, could they rule out the alternative model above using model comparison?</p><p>b) Popular theories of arousal and decision-making argue that the role of enhanced arousal is to enhance the representation of task-relevant variables (Mather GANE), which would seem to argue for an enhanced drift rate under high arousal. It would thus be important to provide the model comparison (BIC, DIC) between the DDM provided by the authors and a model that does not contain the additive bias term, possibly with a fixed or variable starting point. To be more precise, traditionally, in the sequential sampling framework, response biases have been modeled as a shift in starting point. If one claims that response biases are implemented as a &quot;drift criterion&quot;, it would be good to explicitly show that this is a better model of the data. Mulder et al., 2012 (JoN, their Figure 2) present a qualitative distinctive test for these two models: if the choice bias is implemented as a drift rate bias, the response time patterns for validly/invalidly biased trials should be the same for correct and incorrect responses. However, if the choice bias is implemented as a starting point bias, there should be opposite effect for correct and incorrect trials: for correct trials, invalidly biased trials should be slower than validly biased trials, whereas for incorrect trials, this pattern should reverse: invalidly biased trials should be *faster* than validly biased trials. Could the authors plot the averaged (over subjects) median response times of correct/incorrect x validly/invalidly biased trials for their second experiment, where subjects are biased due to the probabilistic nature of the environment, just as in Figure 2 of Mulder et al., 2012? Furthermore, for all experiments where there are two choice options (so not the go/no-go tasks, where the DDM is under-constrained), could they formally compare (a) a model where only starting point is allowed to implement response biases, (b) a model where only drift criterion is allowed to implement the response biases, and (c) a model where both starting point and drift criterion are allowed to implement the response biases?</p><p>3) Given that phasic pupil changes are sensitive to baseline pupil diameter, it would be useful to have more information about the statement &quot;Variation in pre-trial pupil size causes floor and ceiling effects on phasic dilations, shaped by light conditions.” What exactly do the authors mean here? Where do the differential light conditions come from in auditory detection tasks? Moreover, how did you account for pre-trial spill-over effects on pupil; e.g., pre-trial-difficulty (loudness), response (yes/no), pupil dilation/derivative, tonic level, etc.</p><p>4) The choice of pupil change measure differs across tasks, due to differences in motor demands. However, every task has a stimulus onset and it does look like there were substantive differences in the stimulus-aligned pupil responses in all three experiments. It would be helpful to know if stimulus-aligned pupil responses are predictive in experiments 2 and 3. Our sense is that the attentional literature would likely predict changes in stimulus-aligned pupil responses, rather than motor aligned (and probably in stimulus-aligned dilation for auditory stimuli and stimulus-aligned constriction for visual stimuli).</p><p>Relatedly, many studies have looked at the relationship between stimulus attention and the transient pupil response to both visual and auditory stimuli, in both humans and non-human primates (in whom some mechanistic work has been done). This literature is not discussed here, which is striking given that it would seem that some of the results reported here explained by a decrease in attention paid to sensory evidence and previous studies have shown that attention can scale DDM drift.</p><p>5) We admire the combination of mice and men in this work however, the entire manuscript features only 5 mice in the first experiment. We believe it would be beneficial if the authors could justify this small sample size for other non-animal researchers.</p><p>6) It would be useful validate that the measure of bias in Figure 1 is not sensitive to the number of trials in each loudness condition, as this will clearly differ across pupil bins. We are not sure about the total number of trials in some of the loudness conditions, but we worry a bit that if there are very few trials in a given loudness condition, the measure could be misleading.</p><p>7) It would be useful to flesh out in a bit more detail why the observation of non-linear vs. linear arousal state modulation would indicate distinct functional roles for tonic vs. phasic arousal respectively. First, a linear relationship could just represent the increasing part of the inverted u-shape and secondly the original cited papers by Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005; Yerkes and Dodson, 1908, used pupil size, while I believe the current work focuses on the speed of dilation. It would be important to clarify as to how these measures are related or how they may reflect activity of distinct neuromodulators or modulatory receptors as the authors pointed out in the final paragraph of subsection “In humans and mice, phasic arousal tracks a reduction of choice bias in an auditory detection task”.</p><p>8) The authors argue that experiment 3 shows reduced sampling from memory, but the idea that mnemonic decisions are based on samples from memory is still an early theory. Further, to our knowledge we don't know that the DDM does recover information about this memory sampling process (i.e. we do not know whether DDM drift biases reflect sampling from memory, sampling from the stimulus, or some other time-varying decisional process like response competition). It would be helpful to be more circumscribed in the interpretation of these results as reflecting a change in sampling from memory.</p><p>9) What distribution was used to determine the length of mini-blocks? The Materials and methods say that miniblocks were never more than 7 trials, which suggests that the hazard rate for a signal trial was not constant across the miniblock. Also, the hazard rate for the reference trial is presumably zero, were these trials included in analysis? Elsewhere the authors note that the hazard for signal trials was kept approximately flat. How approximately? Were phasic pupil responses related to changes in hazard across miniblocks?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54014.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a consistent conflation of measured correlations/predictions with what seem to be much stronger claims about causality; e.g., in the title, along with many places in the text, that claim that &quot;phasic arousal suppresses…&quot; (or &quot;reduces&quot;, &quot;affected&quot;, etc).

Indeed, we do not intend to make “strong claims” about the particular process model used, and we took care to present the scope of our modeling efforts as well as discussing the validity of the underlying assumptions (see dedicated paragraph in the Discussion, paragraph five) in an accurate way that does not oversell the results. That said, while certainly oversimplified, the DDM is useful for the specific purpose we use it for: differentiating between two distinct, but a priori equally possible, algorithmic schemes for implementing a choice bias.</p><p>We have now addressed the impact of a potential urgency signal on our inference on the underlying biasing mechanisms through fitting a new model combining starting point bias with collapsing bounds. This model failed to capture the observed pupil-linked changes in choice bias (see new Results subsection “Changes in urgency unlikely to mediate the pupil-linked reduction of choice bias” and new Figure 5). We hope that you will now find that our modeling results provide sufficient and compelling support for our main conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Popular theories of arousal and decision-making argue that the role of enhanced arousal is to enhance the representation of task-relevant variables (Mather GANE), which would seem to argue for an enhanced drift rate under high arousal.</p></disp-quote><p>In our original work on this issue (de Gee et al., 2014, 2017), we had indeed anticipated a relationship between phasic, pupil-linked arousal and sensitivity / mean drift rate. But this was not observed; instead we found a selective effect on bias / drift criterion. In our current work, we also assessed the relationship between pupil responses with markers of sensitivity to task-relevant information: sensitivity (d’), mean RT, and drift rate (Figures 1-4 and associated figure supplements) — we again did not observe any consistent relationship here. In the Results section, we have now added a paragraph to address this point explicitly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would thus be important to provide the model comparison (BIC, DIC) between the DDM provided by the authors and a model that does not contain the additive bias term, possibly with a fixed or variable starting point. To be more precise, traditionally, in the sequential sampling framework, response biases have been modeled as a shift in starting point. If one claims that response biases are implemented as a &quot;drift criterion&quot;, it would be good to explicitly show that this is a better model of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We now added the results of formal model comparisons between “drift criterion only” and “starting point only model”, shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. In short, the drift criterion model wins in all cases. This is described in paragraph four of subsection “Pupil-linked bias reduction is associated with changes in the evidence accumulation process”.</p><p>We are unsure about which traditional work your comment refers to. But we would like to point out that our modeling of bias within the DDM, in terms of either starting point or drift bias, is in line with a substantial body of influential papers in this field (e.g. (de Gee et al., 2017; Hanks et al., 2011; Moran, 2015; Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008; Urai et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Mulder et al., 2012 (JoN, their Figure 2) present a qualitative distinctive test for these two models: if the choice bias is implemented as a drift rate bias, the response time patterns for validly/invalidly biased trials should be the same for correct and incorrect responses. However, if the choice bias is implemented as a starting point bias, there should be opposite effect for correct and incorrect trials: for correct trials, invalidly biased trials should be slower than validly biased trials, whereas for incorrect trials, this pattern should reverse: invalidly biased trials should be *faster* than validly biased trials. Could the authors plot the averaged (over subjects) median response times of correct/incorrect x validly/invalidly biased trials for their second experiment, where subjects are biased due to the probabilistic nature of the environment, just as in Figure 2 of Mulder et al., 2012?</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the benefit of showing qualitative assessments of the data to help differentiate between the starting point and drift bias models. We have now used so-called “conditional response functions&quot; (White and Poldrack, 2014) to do that (shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2). These qualitative tests are in line with our previously presented analyses, in indicating that the pupil-linked shift in choice bias is implemented by a shift in drift bias, not starting point.</p><p>Please note that our experiments did not allow for an exact replication of the analysis done by Mulder et al., 2012: This requires plotting error/correct RTs, separately for valid/neutral/invalid cues. First, they used a cuing paradigm with valid/neutral/invalid cues, which was not included in any of our tasks. Second, they define a starting point or drift bias as a shift towards the correct or incorrect choice boundary, while we have defined a starting point or drift bias as a shift towards the “yes” or “no” choice boundary, in line with the standard definition of bias within the DDM (e.g. (de Gee et al., 2017; Hanks et al., 2011; Moran, 2015; Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008; Urai et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, for all experiments where there are two choice options (so not the go/no-go tasks, where the DDM is under-constrained), could they formally compare (a) a model where only starting point is allowed to implement response biases, (b) a model where only drift criterion is allowed to implement the response biases, and (c) a model where both starting point and drift criterion are allowed to implement the response biases?</p></disp-quote><p>We now added the results of formal model comparisons between “drift criterion only” and “starting point only models”, shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1.

In this case, we have found that changes in “drift bias” with phasic arousal indeed are a better model of the data than “starting point bias”. We see our role in helping to build such evidence, and this manuscript aims to make a humble contribution to this endeavor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given that phasic pupil changes are sensitive to baseline pupil diameter, it would be useful to have more information about the statement &quot;Variation in pre-trial pupil size causes floor and ceiling effects on phasic dilations, shaped by light conditions.” What exactly do the authors mean here? Where do the differential light conditions come from in auditory detection tasks? Moreover, how did you account for pre-trial spill-over effects on pupil; e.g., pre-trial-difficulty (loudness), response (yes/no), pupil dilation/derivative, tonic level, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion. The luminance was held constant in all tasks. We have now clarified our rationale in subsection “Suppression of bias by phasic arousal is distinct from ongoing slow state fluctuations”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The choice of pupil change measure differs across tasks, due to differences in motor demands. However, every task has a stimulus onset and it does look like there were substantive differences in the stimulus-aligned pupil responses in all three experiments. It would be helpful to know if stimulus-aligned pupil responses are predictive in experiments 2 and 3. Our sense is that the attentional literature would likely predict changes in stimulus-aligned pupil responses, rather than motor aligned (and probably in stimulus-aligned dilation for auditory stimuli and stimulus-aligned constriction for visual stimuli).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the point that aligning pupil responses to stimulus onset would allow for using the exact same pupil response measure across all data sets. However, our previous work on this topic (de Gee et al., 2014, 2017), which consistently found pupil-linked bias reductions and which we are extending here, was based on choice-aligned pupil responses. This was motivated by theoretical considerations and empirical findings. First, highly influential accounts of phasic neuromodulatory (locus coeruleus) activity in decision-making (Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005; Dayan and Yu, 2006) have linked those responses to the decision process (in the case of Aston-Jones and Cohen even its termination through boundary crossing) rather than to stimulus onset; aligning pupil responses to choice allows for most directly relating our findings to these accounts. Second, our brainstem fMRI measurements (de Gee et al., 2017) showed clearer pupil-linked LC-responses when aligning both to the choice, rather than to stimulus onset. Since we are here using the pupil responses as a proxy of phasic brainstem activity, this observation also makes choice-locking more appropriate.</p><p>Now, choice-locking was obviously not possible in the go/no-go task (absence of no-choices) and the asymmetry in motor factors between the two choice conditions forced us to eliminate motor confounds as much as possible by the choice of analysis time window. These factors forced us to deviate from our standard, and generally preferred, choice-locking in the analysis of these data sets.</p><p>We have now re-analyzed all yes/no data by time-locking the pupil responses to the stimulus onsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). This shows overall very similar pupil response time courses to the choice-aligned ones shown in the paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>), confirming your expectation that there are pupil dilations for auditory stimuli and pupil constriction for the visual stimuli in the recognition task (please note that the same is evident in the choice-locked pupil responses shown in Figures 1-3). Yet, we do not find any consistent relationships to any behavioral measure (RT, sensitivity / d’, or bias / criterion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B-D</xref>), in line with the theoretical reasoning above and corroborating our use of choice-aligned pupil responses for inferring the role of phasic arousal signals in decision-making and evidence accumulation.</p><p>One may wonder why, then, we found any consistent effects in the stimulus-aligned analysis of the go/no-go data at all. One speculation is that, because decision times were substantially shorter than for all the yes/no tasks (compare Figure 1—figure supplement 1 with the corresponding supplements of Figures 2/3), any correlates of pupil dilation might be expected to be less dependent on whether the pupil responses are aligned to stimulus onset or choice.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral correlates of stimulus-locked pupil responses in yes/no tasks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Task-evoked pupil response (solid line) and response derivative (dashed line) aligned to stimulus onset in the yes/no detection datasets with equal, rare, and frequent signals and the yes/no recognition dataset, respectively.

We believe it would be beneficial if the authors could justify this small sample size for other non-animal researchers.</p></disp-quote><p>We now write on: “The previously published mice data set (McGinley et al., 2015) consisted of five mice. Please note that the small number of mice was compensated by a substantial number of trials per individual, which is ideal for the detailed behavioral modeling we pursued here.”</p><p>This data set was the first published on pupil and rodent sensory signal detection. The relatively small sample size resulted from the fact that the pupil monitoring and integration with behavior was developed from scratch, with no examples from the literature to follow. Despite the small N, the results have quite large effect sizes and high statistical significance, supporting that the N is sufficient to test our hypotheses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It would be useful validate that the measure of bias in Figure 1 is not sensitive to the number of trials in each loudness condition, as this will clearly differ across pupil bins. We are not sure about the total number of trials in some of the loudness conditions, but we worry a bit that if there are very few trials in a given loudness condition, the measure could be misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this point. We now write: “Since sensitivity increased with tone loudness (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D), there were more go-trials for louder tones (mean number of go-trials across subjects from least to most loud tones): 68, 73, 97, 122, 136, 166 and 45, 69, 89, 215 go-trials, for mice and human subjects respectively. To ensure an equal number of tones of each loudness in each pupil bin, we binned trials by pupil response within a given loudness condition.”</p><p>Thus, we don’t think the bias measure in Figure 1 is misleading. Computing SDT criterion per loudness condition, and then averaging across, gave very similar results (Figure 1—figure supplement 1H), and (ii) that loudness / difficulty was not a factor in any of the yes/no data sets, and we observed the same behavioral correlates of phasic pupil responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It would be useful to flesh out in a bit more detail why the observation of non-linear vs. linear arousal state modulation would indicate distinct functional roles for tonic vs. phasic arousal respectively. First, a linear relationship could just represent the increasing part of the inverted u-shape and secondly the original cited papers by Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005; Yerkes and Dodson, 1908, used pupil size, while I believe the current work focuses on the speed of dilation. It would be important to clarify as to how these measures are related or how they may reflect activity of distinct neuromodulators or modulatory receptors as the authors pointed out in the final paragraph of subsection “In humans and mice, phasic arousal tracks a reduction of choice bias in an auditory detection task”.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added: “Second, pupil responses exhibited a negligible (go/no-go data sets) or weak (yes/no data sets) correlation to the preceding baseline diameter (Figure 1—figure supplement 1H, Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and Figure 3—figure supplement 1C); in all cases, these correlations are substantially smaller than those for conventional baseline-corrected pupil response amplitudes (de Gee et al., 2014; Gilzenrat et al., 2010).”</p><p>We have added: “It is tempting to speculate that these differences result from different neuromodulatory systems governing tonic and phasic arousal. Indeed, rapid dilations of the pupil (phasic arousal) are more tightly associated with phasic activity in noradrenergic axons, whereas slow changes in pupil (tonic arousal) are accompanied by sustained activity in cholinergic axons (Reimer et al., 2016).”</p><p>Finally, in the mouse go/no-go data set we were able to track the complete inverted-U relationship between performance and tonic arousal (tracked by pre-trial baseline pupil size) (McGinley et al., 2015). In the same data set, we here found a linear relationship between choice bias and phasic arousal (tracked by task-evoked speed of dilation). Together, this indicates that the linear relationship observed here does not represent the increasing part of the inverted-U.</p><p>Note that mice exhibited a wider variety of tonic arousal states during task performance than human subjects, ranging from almost falling asleep, to alert and focused performance, to running on the wheel. First, mice performed the go/no-go task sessions that each lasted around 60 minutes, while human subjects performed the various tasks in blocks of 10 minutes. Second, mice could also (and did) run on the wheel during the task, while human subjects were seated. Third, humans can likely sustain their attention for longer periods than mice. Thus, the tonic arousal state in human subjects was considerably more stable than that of mice. It is likely that for this reason we did not observe the same inverted-U relationship between tonic arousal and performance in humans as found for mice (data not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors argue that experiment 3 shows reduced sampling from memory, but the idea that mnemonic decisions are based on samples from memory is still an early theory. Further, to our knowledge we don't know that the DDM does recover information about this memory sampling process (i.e. we do not know whether DDM drift biases reflect sampling from memory, sampling from the stimulus, or some other time-varying decisional process like response competition). It would be helpful to be more circumscribed in the interpretation of these results as reflecting a change in sampling from memory.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that the idea that mnemonic decisions are based on sampling from memory is an assumption, which require further experimental validation. We have now toned down the corresponding conclusions accordingly (Discussion paragraph six).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) What distribution was used to determine the length of mini-blocks? The Materials and methods say that miniblocks were never more than 7 trials, which suggests that the hazard rate for a signal trial was not constant across the miniblock.</p></disp-quote><p>We have presented the distribution that determined the length of mini-blocks in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, left.

It was partially flattened (compared to uniform probability across mini blocks).
