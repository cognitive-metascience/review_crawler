We found that the FRRUC is rapidly and transiently recruited to sites of DNA damage in a PARP1- and TIMELESS-dependent manner to promote mono-ubiquitylation of H2A at Lys119, a local decrease of H2A levels, and an increase of H2A.Z incorporation. Both the FRRUC and H2A.Z promote transcriptional repression, double strand break signaling, and homologous recombination repair (HRR). All these events require both the presence and activity of the FRRUC. Moreover, the FRRUC and its activity are required for the proper recruitment of BMI1-RNF2 and MEL18-RNF2, two other ubiquitin ligases that mono-ubiquitylate Lys119 in H2A upon genotoxic stress. Notably, whereas H2A.Z is not required for H2A mono-ubiquitylation, impairment of the latter results in the inhibition of H2A.Z incorporation. We propose that the recruitment of the FRRUC represents an early and critical regulatory step in HRR.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA damage response</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>FBXL10</kwd><kwd>RNF68</kwd><kwd>RNF2</kwd><kwd>BMI1</kwd><kwd>MEL18</kwd><kwd>H2A.Z</kwd><kwd>PARP</kwd><kwd>TIMELESS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Rosztoczy Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rona</surname><given-names>Gergely</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ACS 130304-RSG-16-241-01-DMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rothenberg</surname><given-names>Eli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01- GM057691</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rothenberg</surname><given-names>Eli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21-CA187612</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rothenberg</surname><given-names>Eli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-CA076584</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pagano</surname><given-names>Michele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM057587</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pagano</surname><given-names>Michele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pagano</surname><given-names>Michele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Upon genotoxic stress, the FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 ubiquitin ligase complex mono-ubiquitylates histone H2A and mediates H2A/H2A.Z exchange to repress transcription and ensures proper high fidelity homologous recombination repair.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polycomb group (PcG) proteins assemble into heterogeneous Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs), of which there are two main, functionally distinct classes, each with different histone modifying activities. PRC1s mediate the mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2A at Lys119 (K119) (generating H2AK119Ub1), whereas PRC2s di- and tri-methylate K27 of histone H3 (H3K27me2/3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blackledge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Di Croce and Helin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schwartz and Pirrotta, 2013</xref>).</p><p>There are six PRC1s, each defined by one of six different Polycomb group RING finger proteins (PCGF1-6), which belong to the super-family of RING finger (RNF) ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). Although PCGFs have a RING finger domain, they are unable to ubiquitylate H2A; instead, PCGFs dimerize with and activate one of two additional RNF ubiquitin ligases, RNF1 or RNF2, (also known as RING1A and RING1B, respectively), which in turn ubiquitylate H2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Napoles et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Based on the presence or absence of chromobox-containing protein (CBX) subunits, the six PRC1s are further sub-categorized into two canonical (cPRC1) and four non-canonical (ncPRC1) complexes, respectively. The best-characterized ncPRC1 is ncPRC1.1 (also known as variant PRC1.1), which contains a core ubiquitin ligase complex, the FRRUC, which comprises the PCGF protein RNF68 (also known as PCGF1 and NSPC1), RNF2, and the short isoform (which misses the JmjC domain) of the F-box protein FBXL10 (also known as FBL10, JHDM1B, KDM2B, and NDY1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gearhart et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Inagaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Oliviero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sánchez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The FRRUC mono-ubiquitylates H2A on K119, repressing genes that are important for differentiation and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Endoh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gearhart et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">He et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Mono-ubiquitylation of K119 in H2A and K120 in H2A.X has also been detected at DNA lesions such as double-strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergink et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ginjala et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kakarougkas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shanbhag et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Ui et al., 2015</xref>). The DSB-induced mono-ubiquitylation of H2A is thought to promote transcriptional repression at sites of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kakarougkas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shanbhag et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Ui et al., 2015</xref>). Two dimeric ubiquitin ligases (BMI1-RNF2 and MEL18-RNF2 also know as RNF51-RNF2 and RNF110-RNF2, respectively), which are components of two distinct cPRC1s, have been implicated in the mono-ubiquitylation of K119 and K120 in H2A and H2A.X in response to genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergink et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ginjala et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gracheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ismail et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pan et al., 2011</xref>).

We confirmed that the three proteins exist in a trimeric complex by performing sequential co-precipitation experiments in which we found that FBXL10-interacting RNF2 also interacted with RNF68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In unstressed cells, mono-ubiquitylation of K119 in H2A via the FRRUC, which serves as the core ubiquitin ligase of ncPRC1.1, is required for the recruitment of cPRC1s to maintain the mono-ubiquitylation of H2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blackledge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cooper et al., 2014</xref>). Certain cPRC1s have been shown to be recruited to DNA lesions and mono-ubiquitylate H2A and H2A.X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergink et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ginjala et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gracheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ismail et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether the FRRUC is also recruited. Local DNA damage was introduced into human U-2OS cells by 405 nm laser micro-irradiation, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altmeyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Young et al., 2015</xref>). The track of DNA damage was then visualized by γH2A.X staining. We found that endogenous FBXL10, RNF68, and RNF2 recruited to sites of DNA damage and co-localized with γH2A.X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To use a different imaging method that is especially advantageous for detecting and quantifying localization patterns and protein complexes in dense structures, such as nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ricci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yin and Rothenberg, 2016</xref>), we used dual-color single-molecule localization microscopy (direct STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy or dSTORM) to evaluate the enrichment of the FRRUC at DNA damage sites in U-2OS cells upon treatment with the radiomimetic agent, neocarzinostatin (NCS), which induces single and double stranded breaks. As a DNA marker we used XRCC5, a highly abundant protein that is rapidly recruited to DSBs since, although it has intrinsic affinity for DNA, it has even higher affinity for DNA ends. [XRCC5 is recruited very rapidly before the choice of homologous recombination repair ﻿(HHR)﻿ v. non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is made by the cell.] Because it associates with chromatin in both undamaged and damaged cells, XRCC5 is an ideal marker to evaluate cross-correlation changes with other DNA-binding proteins in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Britton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Reid et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Teixeira-Silva et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Walker et al., 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows representative overlaps between FBXL10, RNF68, or RNF2 and XRCC5 with or without NCS treatment. Since in dense images, it is possible that two species randomly overlap with each other, we analyzed all images using a cross-correlation method that probes the probability distributions across all possible pair-wise distances between two species taking in account, at the same time, the amount of each species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coltharp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Veatch et al., 2012</xref>). We observed a significant increase in cross-correlation signal between FBXL10, RNF68, or RNF2 and XRCC5, upon NCS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), showing an enrichment of the FRRUC at sites of DNA damage in agreement with the results obtained with laser micro-irradiation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38771.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FBXL10, RNF68, and RNF2 are recruited to sites of DNA damage in a PARP1- and TIMELESS- dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Super-resolution imaging was performed in U-2OS cells to analyze the colocalization between XRCC5 (magenta) and FBXL10, RNF68 and RNF2 (green), with or without 20 min of NCS treatment.

In living cells, FBXL10 was localized to the nucleoplasm with an enrichment in the nucleolus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">(Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), as previously reported both in mammalian and insect cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frescas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kavi and Birchler, 2009</xref>). Whereas RNF68 displayed a localization similar to that of FBXL10, RNF2 showed a more homogenous nuclear distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), likely due to the fact that RNF2 can participate in all six PRC1s.

When we tested the recruitment to laser-induced ‘DNA damage spots’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Young et al., 2015</xref>), we found that GFP-FBXL10, mCherry-RNF68, and GFP-tagged RNF2 were recruited within seconds to these spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

We noticed that whereas the kinetics of disappearance of FBXL10 and RNF68 were comparable, RNF2 remained at DNA lesions for longer, likely because of its presence in both cPRC1s and ncPRC1s. Notably, no recruitment of FBXL11 (also known as FBL11, JHDM1A, and KDM2A), a close paralog of FBXL10 that does not bind RNF2 and RNF68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), suggesting that FBXL10 plays a specific role in the DDR.</p><p>To test whether the recruitment of the FRRUC to sites of DNA damage depends on known DNA damage signaling enzymes, we evaluated the recruitment of the three subunits upon treatment of cells with small molecules to inhibit ATM (with KU60018), ATR (with AZ20), DNA-PK (with NU7441), and PARP (with Olaparib)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,D</xref>). Only the inhibition of PARP [Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase] with Olaparib completely abolished the recruitment of the FRRUC to sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,D</xref>). We did not observe recruitment of FBXL10 upon PARP inhibition up to 30 min after laser micro-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Importantly, inhibition of PARP with Olaparib also abolished the recruitment of endogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). PARP1 is a critical sensor of DNA damage lesions, catalyzing the production of long chains of branched poly(ADP)ribose on target proteins during the DNA damage response (DDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Li and Yu, 2015</xref>). PARylation is one of the earliest post-translational modifications in response to DNA lesions, occurring on substrates such as histones, certain DNA repair factors, and PARP1 itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rouleau et al., 2010</xref>). We, and others, have shown that TIMELESS forms a near stoichiometric complex with PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Xie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Young et al., 2015</xref>).

Using qChIP with specific primers for a region downstream to the DSBs, we observed that levels of H2AK119Ub1 were induced ~4.2 kbp from the break sites, and to a slightly lesser extent ~10.2 kbp, from the DSB sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Depletion of FBXL10, RNF2, or RNF68 (but not of XRCC6, used as a negative control) strongly reduced the amount of H2AK119Ub1 detected at the sites of DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that these proteins significantly contribute to the mono-ubiquitylation of H2A at K119.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The FRRUC promotes transcriptional repression in response to DNA damage</title><p>The H2AK119Ub1 modification has been strongly associated with transcriptional silencing at DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kakarougkas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Ui et al., 2015</xref>). Having confirmed that the FRRUC controls the mono-ubiquitylation of H2A on K119 at sites of DNA damage, we examined whether the disruption of the FRRUC affects DSB-mediated transcriptional repression.

We show here that the FRRUC is recruited to sites of DNA damage in a PARP1- and TIMELESS-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that the complex is required for efficient mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2A on K119, a decrease of H2A levels at DSBs, localization of the histone variant H2A.Z to sites of DNA damage, transcriptional repression, DSB signaling, and proper HRR (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>In response to genotoxic stress, transcriptional silencing is thought to facilitate DNA damage resolution by ensuring that the transcriptional machinery does not interfere sterically with DNA damage repair factors (e.g. by avoiding the collision of the elongating RNA Polymerase complex with DNA repair complexes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Uckelmann and Sixma, 2017</xref>). Several factors and complexes, such as NurRD, PBAF, ENL, RNF8, NELF-E, and RNF51-UBR5 have been implicated in the DNA damage-induced transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Awwad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kakarougkas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Paul and Wang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Ui et al., 2015</xref>). One of the key determinants of transcriptional repression at sites of DNA damage is the mono-ubiquitylation of H2A on K119 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kakarougkas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shanbhag et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Ui et al., 2015</xref>). We found that the mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2A on K119 is largely impaired by the depletion of the FRRUC. Similarly, the FRRUC is a major contributor to the mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2A on K119 in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rose et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Taherbhoy et al., 2015</xref>). It has been shown that RNF51-RNF2 and RNF110-RNF2 are recruited to chromatin after DNA damage to contribute to the mono-ubiquitylation of H2A on K119 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergink et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ginjala et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gracheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ismail et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>). Our results show that the FRRUC is necessary for the proper recruitment of these two cPRC1s in response to genotoxic stress. Moreover, our findings suggest that the FRRUC is the most upstream ubiquitin ligase in charge of mono-ubiquitylating histone H2A on K119 and that, subsequently, cPRC1s maintain this modification. Interestingly, a recent study measured the kinetics of recruitment of 70 DNA repair proteins to laser-induced DNA damage sites in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aleksandrov et al., 2018</xref>). Compared to the recruitment of these 70 proteins, FBXL10, RNF68, and RNF2 display a very fast recruitment, suggesting that this represent one of the most upstream events in response to genotoxic stress.</p><p>The DNA damage response frequently re-purposes the function of specific transcriptional regulators to enact DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sarcinella et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shiloh and Ziv, 2013</xref>). Our results reveal that the presence, localization, and activity of the FRRUC, in addition to mono-ubiquitylate H2A on K119 (as in unstressed cells), is also required for an efficient H2A/H2A.Z exchange at DNA lesions. Notably, whereas H2A.Z is not required for H2A mono-ubiquitylation, the FRRUC-dependent mono-ubiquitylation of H2A is required for proper H2A.Z loading. This event, in turn, contributes to transcriptional repression, the DDR, and HRR. H2A.Z has been shown to function in the early stages of DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adkins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alatwi and Downs, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gursoy-Yuzugullu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kalocsay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). H2A.Z is rapidly, yet transiently, recruited to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alatwi and Downs, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gursoy-Yuzugullu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kalocsay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kusch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nishibuchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). H2A.Z shares 56% sequence identity with H2A and the differences account for a structurally less stable interface between H2A.Z and the H3-H4 subunits of the nucleosome. In fact, H2A.Z appears to make weakened, loose nucleosomes that are easy to bend and disassemble, leading to a more accessible chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bönisch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jin and Felsenfeld, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Suto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Xu et al., 2012</xref>), which may favor recruitment of DNA repair factors. H2A.Z has been associated with both positive and negative transcriptional regulation depending on its post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Guillemette and Gaudreau, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). Mono-ubiquitylation of H2A.Z on K120 and K121 is correlated with transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Draker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sarcinella et al., 2007</xref>), whereas H2A.Z acetylation on its N-terminus is associated with transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Valdés-Mora et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, mono-ubiquitylation of H2A.Z has been attributed to RNF2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sarcinella et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the FRRUC could be involved in transcriptional silencing by several non-exclusive – and, perhaps, linked – means: (i) mono-ubiquitylating H2A, (ii) facilitating exchange of a subpopulation of H2A with H2A.Z, and (iii), mono-ubiquitylating H2A.Z. It is possible that, upon DNA damage, H2A.Z can simultaneously ‘loosen’ the chromatin to facilitate the access to DNA repair factors (this is the reason for which a subpopulation of H2A is exchanged for H2A.Z) and mediate transcriptional silencing (conceivably, by its mono-ubiquitylation). How mono-ubiquitylation of histones mechanistically controls at the molecular level downstream effects (such as nucleosome rearrangements, chromatin remodeling, transcriptional repression, <italic>etc</italic>.) remains an unsolved question in both the field of DNA damage and the field of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hauer and Gasser, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nair et al., 2017</xref>). Future investigations will be necessary to answer these fundamental questions, in general, and, more specifically, how the mono-ubiquitylation of H2A regulates its exchange with H2A.Z.</p><p>Our results indicate that the PARP1- and TIMELESS-dependent recruitment of the FRRUC to sites of DNA damage plays an early and critical regulatory role in homologous recombination repair by promoting local transcriptional inhibition both via the mono-ubiquitylation of H2A and the establishment of a chromatin structure containing H2A.Z. Accordingly, PARP1 has been implicated in H2A displacement and chromatin decondensation after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sellou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Strickfaden et al., 2016</xref>). The regulation of FBXL10, RNF68, and RNF2 by TIMELESS is unusual since the recruitment of other factors downstream of PARP, such as XRCC1 and Ligase 3 (that are required for single strand break and base excision repair), is affected by PARP1 silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Campalans et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Godon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mortusewicz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Okano et al., 2003</xref>), but not by TIMELESS depletion, suggesting a specific role of TIMELESS in controlling DSB repair.</p><p>In response to DNA damage, in addition to the mono-ubiquitylation of K119/K120, H2A and H2A.X are also ubiquitylated on both K13 and K15. This event requires two steps: first, an RNF ubiquitin ligase, namely RNF8, decorates H1 type linker histones and L3MBTL2 with K63-linked ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mandemaker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nowsheen et al., 2018</xref>). Next, these chains are recognized by RNF168, another RNF ubiquitin ligase, that mono-ubiquitylates H2A and H2A.X on K13 and K15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gatti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Leung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mattiroli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Thorslund et al., 2015</xref>). Ultimately, a K63 chain (and, possibly other kind of ubiquitin chains) is/are built on mono-ubiquitylated H2A and H2A.X, although the ubiquitin ligase involved in this elongation step is still debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Uckelmann and Sixma, 2017</xref>). These ubiquitin chains are crucial for the recruitment of DNA repair factors, an event necessary for both efficient HRR and NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schwertman et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, neither RNF8 nor RNF168 can ubiquitylate K119 and K120 of H2A/H2A.X, and, vice versa, RNF2 and its interacting PCGFs are unable to ubiquitylate K13 and K15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mattiroli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Our findings show that, similar to the ubiquitylation of K13 and K15, the ubiquitylation of K119 and K120 in H2A/H2A.X is also involved in the recruitment of DNA repair factors. Intriguingly, while the FRRUC is necessary for an efficient DDR, ATM inhibition increases the recruitment of the FRRUC. ATM might limit the spread of the FRRUC and the subsequent H2A mono-ubiquitylation to maintain the signal at DSB proximities.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that the PARP1-TIMELESS-FRRUC axis is required for the localization of H2A.Z to sites of DNA damage. This ensures the proper transcriptional silencing and chromatin composition necessary for the efficient activation of DDR and HRR.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Laser induced DNA damage and Live-Cell imaging</title><p>Laser-induced DNA damage induction and live-cell imaging were essentially performed as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Young et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, ~50,000 cells were plated per well of a four-well Lab-Tek II chambered number 1.5 borosilicate coverglass for 24 hr before imaging. RNAi silencing transfections were performed approximately 2 days prior to microscopy using two rounds of silencing. Cells were pre-sensitized with 10 μM BrdU (Merck) for 36 hr. For imaging, on the day of data collection, cells were incubated in FluoroBrite<sup>TM</sup> DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, and sodium pyruvate. Imaging was performed using a DeltaVision Elite inverted microscope system (Applied Precision), using a 60 × oil objective (numerical aperture 1.42) from Olympus. Excitation was achieved with a 7 Color Combined Insight solid state illumination system equipped with a polychroic beam splitter with filter sets to support GFP (ex.: 475/28 nm, em.: 525/50 nm) and mCherry (ex.: 575/25 nm, em.: 632/60 nm). Images were acquired using a CoolSNAP HQ2 camera. DNA damage was generated using a 405 nm, 50 mW laser at 100% power for 0.5 s. Two pre-laser images were recorded, and the number and interval of post-laser images varied in each experiment (as indicated on the kinetic plots). Recruitment intensity was analyzed using a macro written for ImageJ (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link>) that calculated the ratio of intensity of a defined laser spot <italic>A</italic> to the adjacent area <italic>B</italic> after subtraction of the background intensity of an unpopulated area of the image <italic>C</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Young et al., 2015</xref>).

The calculated correlation function was then transferred from cartesian to polar coordinates, and radially averaged through <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. It was then fitted into a 1D Gaussian function, and the amplitude was read out as the descriptive correlation strength. We note that the correlation length (distance) describes a spatial range within which the correlation between the two species becomes significant as compared to the random colocalizations. It cannot be considered as a measure of the absolute center-to-center distance between two molecules. The pair-cross-correlation was performed to robustly map the colocalization between tested samples. We note that this pair-cross-correlation collects the pairwise distances between two species and computes their probability density in the spatial frequency domain. The false positive (random) colocalization events that are caused by the sample’s dense distributions in the nucleus, therefore, only contribute as the denominator, so that the pair-cross-correlation demonstrates the relative amount of significant (true positive) colocalization events versus the overall (true positive + false positive) colocalization observations. Representatives images were smoothed, thresholded, and binarized before they were overlapped. We note that these post-imaging procedures are for display purpose. The correlation analysis was performed directly on the reconstructed raw coordinates and did not include these post-processing artifacts.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank R Greenberg, M Jasin, and J Stark for reagents; and D Durocher, R Greenberg, P Lee, J Lukas, Y Shiloh, and T Sixma for critically reading the manuscript.

Using the powerful technology of STORM, the authors first show using neocarzinostatin to generate breaks a rapid recruitment to damages and confirm this result using a known fusion construct of the Fok1 endonuclease that cleaves specifically to a lacO repeated region of a modified U2OS line. This action is specific for this complex as the FBXL11 paralog of FBXL10, which is not part of the ncPRC1.1 complex, does not recruit to the damage. Authors show that recruitment is dependent on PARylation by using the PARP1 inhibitor Olaparib and by knocking down PARP1 and TIMELESS in the cells. The reaction is accompanied by mono-ubiquitylation of H2A K119, consistent with the activity of the complex, and a reduction of H2A density that is accompanied by an increase of H2AZ. As a consequence of these changes, authors are able to show that transcription is reduced at the site of damage as determined by 5-EU global labeling of RNA as well as specific system based on a reporter containing MS2stem loop repeats to visualize transcription directly at the transcription site. Concomitantly they see a lower Ser2P RNAPII, consistent with lower transcription elongation efficiency. Analysis of the impact of depleting a number of homologous recombination and DSB-signals (RAD51, BRCA1, CHK1 phosphorylation) authors provide evidence that depletion of FBXL10-RNF2-RNF68 reduces homologous recombination. Finally the authors identify the minimal region required of four amino acids of RNF68 required for stable binding with FBXL10 and show by generating mutants like RNF68Y252D, which reduces binding to FBXL10 but not to RNF2, and mutants deleting the RING domain of RNF68, which did not affect FBXL10 binding but it did RNF2 binding, that disruption of the complex affects recruitment of recombination factors to the breaks. Recombination was assayed with the I-SceI DSB system of M. Jasin to corroborate functional meaning of the results, providing evidence that this is at least in part due to the replacement of H2A by H2AZ at the site of the DSB promoted by the FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 complex. Therefore, the manuscript provides an important regulatory step of DSB repair via homologous recombination that is controlled by the FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 complex in a PARP1 and TIMELESS-dependent manner. The study manages to integrate this specific function with a role of chromatin dynamics in transcription repression at the site of damage and recombination enhancement as a DSB repair pathway. Authors make interesting proposals in their Discussion that would certainly need to be tested with further experiments. For example, it in the future would be nice to know how the FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 complex affect DSB resection, and other aspects. However, having said this, this is manuscript seems suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript from Pagano and colleagues reports a role for a non-canonical PRC1 complex, consisting of Fbxl10, Rnf2, and Rnf68 in the DNA double strand break (DSB) response. They show by STORM imaging that the complex localizes to DSBs and that is facilitates ubiquitination of H2A on K119, although it is unclear if this ubiquitination is direct, or mediated by the recruitment of a second E3 ubiquitin ligase. Further they show that the complex represses transcription at sites of DNA damage, and that this facilitates incorporation of H2A.Z and ultimately in successful homologous recombination repair. Overall, the manuscript is well written and the data is of the highest quality.</p><p>1) STORM imaging suggests that the entire complex is localized to DNA damage repair sites in response to NCS. In previous studies these authors have shown the number of overlaps per nuclei with and without damage (PNAS 2015). They should do the same thing here to further convince readers that the overlap is real, particularly in light of the fact that this is a non-conventional way of showing these correlations that many readers will be unfamiliar with.</p><p>2) In Figure 1—figure supplement 2 the authors show GFP tagged components forming foci in response to damage (&quot;damage spots&quot;), although all of these proteins are forming foci without damage and it is unclear if these proteins would blink on and off with no treatment. How do the authors know these are sites of DNA damage? This should be addressed.</p><p>3) The authors show that ATM inhibition restores active transcription at sites of DNA damage. This result is consistent with data from Shanbhag et al. (2010) showing that ATM is required to repress transcription at sites of DNA damage. However, they also show that ATM inhibition has no effect on the localization of Fbxl10, Rnf2, and Rnf68. Thus, it is unclear how ATM inhibition is repressing transcription if the Fbxl10 complex is still localized. The authors should provide some explanation for how this might occur.</p><p>4) In Figures 5 and 6 the authors make the argument that the role of this complex is dependent on deposition of H2A.Z at sites of damage. They should again quantify the number of overlaps per cell.</p><p>5) It is unclear what the timing of H2A.Z deposition is in relation to that of Fbxl10, Rnf2, and Rnf68. The latter cycles through break sites very early (within minutes), well before the deposition of Rad51 onto single stranded DNA.</p><p>6) It is also unclear how H2A.Z is being deposited, just that it depends on Fbxl10, Rnf2, and Rnf68. Therefore, this section of the manuscript feels mis-placed and premature. While it appears that H2a.Z is implicated in the DNA damage response and HRR, it is unclear how or why, and how this is connected to Fbxl10, Rnf2, and Rnf68, just that there exists a dependency.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;PARP1-dependent recruitment of the FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 ubiquitin ligase to sites of DNA damage controls H2A.Z loading&quot; by Pagano et al., describes the role of the non-canonical PRC1 complex FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 in DNA damage response and repair via transcription repression and H2AZ exchange at sites of DNA damage. The authors report that this ncPRC1.1 complex, which is recruited in a PARP dependent manner, mediates H2AK119Ub and promotes HR repair. The experiments performed using depletion of the individual subunits of the complex suggests the involvement of these proteins in DNA damage responses. However, functional importance of this complex, for instance, a mechanistic insight of how this complex promotes H2AZ incorporation is lacking. In addition, given the published literature on the canonical PRC1 complex being involved in transcriptional repression at DNA damage sites (ex. Sanchez et al., 2016), it is critical to determine whether the reported non-canonical PRC1 complex works in the same pathway or delineate the interplay between canonical PRC1 complex activity at damage sites and this non-canonical PRC1 complex. As is, this story is rather descriptive and lacks mechanistic insights.</p><p>1) In Figure 1, it is unclear why the untreated U2OS cells (-NCS) also show high levels of XRCC5. FBXL10, RNF68, RNF2 recruitment are shown to be PARP1 and TIMELESS dependent manner but it is unclear if this complex works collectively. Given that these proteins are involved in other complexes known to be recruited to chromatin, are FBXL10, RNF68 and RNF2 DSB recruitment interdependent or independent of each other? How do these proteins affect the canonical PRC complexes? It will also be informative to check for the recruitment of FBXL10, RNF68, RNF2 in the RNF68 RING domain and Y252D mutant.</p><p>- The authors mention that RNF2 remains at DNA lesions longer likely because of its presence in canonical and ncPRC complex. RNF2 is known to interact with BMI1 that has been shown to recruit and be retained at DSBs for several hours. It would be interesting to check if depletion of BMI1 affects RNF2 recruitment kinetics in this context.</p><p>- It is reported that only PARP1 and TIMELESS completely abrogate FBXL10, RNF68 and RNF2 DSB recruitment but from Figure 1—figure supplement.2D it is clear that ATM kinase inhibition shows strong DSB recruitment and retention (RNF68 in particular). Is there an explanation for this result?</p><p>2) In Figure 2, it is shown that depletion of FBXL10, RNF68 and RNF2 reduces H2A K119Ub1 suggesting FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 as the E3 ligase complex. However it has been previously reported that H2AK119Ub1 at DNA damage site is mediated by BMI1-RNF2 that makes it unclear about the specificity of this ncPRC1 at the level of the core PRC complexes. The authors show that FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 is recruited early in the DNA damage response. On the other hand BMI1 is recruited later in the DDR. It will be interesting to check if FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 mediates the first wave of H2AK119ub1 while BMI1-RNF2 mediates subsequent H2AK119Ub1. Moreover, it will be also useful to check for H2AK119Ub1 in RNF68 RING domain and Y252D mutants.</p><p>3) It would be appropriate to show a comparison of H2A/H2AX119Ub -/+ DNA damage in Control vs. FBXL10, RNF68 and RNF2 deficient cells by western blot.</p><p>4) There is a possibility that depletion of FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 affects other histone ubiquitylation marks in DDR given that in Figure 4A-B, reduction in polyubiquitin signal (FK2) was observed. It is unclear if other such Ub marks on histones were analyzed in this study. DNA damage induced ubiquitin foci (detected by FK2) are formed mostly by RNF8 and RNF168. Do the authors suggest that FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 works upstream or negatively affects RNF8 and RNF168 or its substrates and if so how? It will be interesting to check if FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 affects RNF8 recruitment or vice versa.</p><p>5) It is important to perform cell survival assays in the context of DDR as previous reports state that RNF2 reduces cell viability and promotes cell cycle arrest.</p><p>6) It is unclear whether the demethylation activity of Fbxl10 is involved in its role in the DDR demonstrated in this article i.e., H2AK119ub1, transcriptional repression, 53BP1 and RAD51 recruitment? Demethylation of H3K4me3 has been shown to be involved in these pathways so this is worth considering.</p><p>7) It should be explained why there are phenotypical differences observed when depleting FBXL10, RNF68 and RNF2 if these form a functional complex. For example, why FBXL10 shows NHEJ defects while the other members do not? Moreover, another piece of work has previously reported that loss of H2AZ decreases Ku-loading and NHEJ but this doesn't fit well with the experimental results shown here (Price and colleagues, Mol Cell, 2012). There is no mechanistic insights for how this complex promotes H2AZ accumulation at damage sites. From the IF images, clearly most H2AZ incorporation is not affected by these proteins (see comment 9). Most studies need to be performed to understand these preliminary data.</p><p>8) Complementation studies are missing, which could significantly strengthen the data.</p><p>9) It would be appropriate to include the focal accumulation images of the DDR repair factors along with the quantification shown in Figure 4. Instead of representing the% cells with foci, the number of foci per cell would be more informative. The microscopy data presented for high resolution has some major issues. As colocalization is used, it is unclear if these proteins really accumulate at IR induced damage sites or if this is just due to the increased signal obtained by KU or phosphH2AX. If you look at just the signal of the non-canonical PRC1 proteins, it is unclear if the signals increase and/or the number of foci change. These parameters must be analyzed to ensure that this technique is not an artifact of the system and how these data are being presented. As is, these data are not convincing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38771.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This manuscript describes a series of complex and high-quality experiments using a varied combination of cell biology and molecular biology approaches to conclude that the core ubiquitin ligase subcomplex of the ncPRC1.1 Polycomb repressive complex formed by FBXL10, RNF2 and RNF68 is recruited to DNA double strand breaks in a PARP1 and TIMELESS dependent manner.

However, as now mentioned in the manuscript, in dense images, it is possible that two species randomly overlap with each other. Therefore, we analyzed all images using a cross-correlation method that probes the probability distributions across all possible pair-wise distances between two species taking in account, at the same time, the amount of each species (PMIDs: 25179006, 23717596, 22384026 and 27545293). Briefly, if two species are randomly distributed from each other, the probability should be the same at all distances (i.e., the probability should be flat if visualized as a function of the pairwise distances). In contrast, if the two species have intrinsic spatial correlation at a certain distance, the correlation function will display a significant probability distribution at such certain distance (although such correlations are not easily seen because of their stochastic and dense distributions). We have now explained in more detail in the text the benefit of using super-resolution microscopy and the way data was analyzed. Moreover, we have now also used confocal microscopy as an orthogonal method to show the enrichment of the endogenous FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 ubiquitin ligase complex (FRRUC) at sites of DNA damage (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1—figure supplement 2 the authors show GFP tagged components forming foci in response to damage (&quot;damage spots&quot;), although all of these proteins are forming foci without damage and it is unclear if these proteins would blink on and off with no treatment.

The other large spots in cells expressing FBXL10 and RNF68 are nucleoli. FBXL10 is known to predominantly localize to the nucleolus (PMIDs: 17994099 and 19852816). Our data show that RNF68 displays a similar localization, while RNF2, which is present in several protein complexes, has a more homogenous distribution. Many nucleolar proteins involved in the DNA damage response are sequestered in the nucleolus (PMIDs: 29429989, 23879289, etc.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors show that ATM inhibition restores active transcription at sites of DNA damage.

Thus, they seem to function in parallel pathways and, in fact, ATM seems to have an inhibitory role on the recruitment of the FRRUC.

Unfortunately, we were unable to show H2A.Z recruitment to laser damage, possibly because of the very dense H2A.Z staining. However, we were able to show H2A.Z recruitment by both ChIP and super-resolution microscopy (Figure 6A-C). Interestingly, a recent paper measured the kinetics of recruitment of 70 DNA repair proteins to laser-induced DNA damage sites in HeLa cells (PMID: 29547717). Compared to the recruitment of these 70 proteins, FBXL10, RNF68, and RNF2 display a very fast recruitment while RAD51’s peak of recruitment is about 18 minutes. The rapid recruitment of the FRRUC suggests that this represent one of the most upstream events in response to genotoxic stress, affecting many downstream events of which some directly and others indirectly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is also unclear how H2A.Z is being deposited, just that it depends on Fbxl10, Rnf2, and Rnf68. Therefore, this section of the manuscript feels mis-placed and premature. While it appears that H2a.Z is implicated in the DNA damage response and HRR, it is unclear how or why, and how this is connected to Fbxl10, Rnf2, and Rnf68, just that there exists a dependency.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now gained mechanistic insights into how the FRRUC promotes the recruitment of H2A.Z (new Figure 6F and new Figure 6—figure supplement 1G-I). Specifically, we now provide evidence that, whereas H2A.Z is not required for H2A mono-ubiquitylation, the latter is directly necessary for the enrichment of H2A.Z at DNA damage sites. To reach this conclusion, we utilized a strategy used by a landmark Cell paper on DNA damage-induced transcription repression (PMID: 20550933). As in this study, either wild-type H2A or H2A(K119/120R), an H2A mutant in which Lys119 and Lys120 were mutated to arginines, were overexpressed in the reporter cells expressing inducible FokI. We observed a reduction in H2A.Z loading at DSBs in cells overexpressing H2A(K119/120R) compared to cells overexpressing wild-type H2A (new Figure 6F). This is in agreement with the fact that only wild-type RNF68 (able to sustain H2A mono-ubiquitylation), but not two inactive RNF68 mutants, rescues the defect of H2A.Z loading (Figure 6E), and indicates that the FRRUC-dependent mono-ubiquitylation of H2A is required for proper H2A.Z loading. In contrast, the chaperones that contribute to H2A.Z loading (i.e., TIP48 and TIP49) are not controlled by the FRRUC (Figure 6—figure supplement 1G-H). H2A.Z loading has been previously shown to be involved in DNA repair mechanisms. We further show that H2A.Z loading depends on the FRRUC and contributes to transcriptional repression and the DDR (Figures 6 and 7). How H2A.Z recruitment is involved in transcriptional repression is currently unclear. But this is true also for modifications that are commonly accepted to be necessary for transcriptional repression. For example, H2A mono-ubiquitylation is thought to repress transcription; however, how mono-ubiquitylation of histones mechanistically controls downstream effects (such as nucleosome rearrangements and chromatin remodeling) remains a big, black box in both the field of DNA damage and the field of transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;PARP1-dependent recruitment of the FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 ubiquitin ligase to sites of DNA damage controls H2A.Z loading&quot; by Pagano et al., describes the role of the non-canonical PRC1 complex FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 in DNA damage response and repair via transcription repression and H2AZ exchange at sites of DNA damage. The authors report that this ncPRC1.1 complex, which is recruited in a PARP dependent manner, mediates H2AK119Ub and promotes HR repair. The experiments performed using depletion of the individual subunits of the complex suggests the involvement of these proteins in DNA damage responses. However, functional importance of this complex, for instance, a mechanistic insight of how this complex promotes H2AZ incorporation is lacking. In addition, given the published literature on the canonical PRC1 complex being involved in transcriptional repression at DNA damage sites (ex. Sanchez et al., 2016), it is critical to determine whether the reported non-canonical PRC1 complex works in the same pathway or delineate the interplay between canonical PRC1 complex activity at damage sites and this non-canonical PRC1 complex. As is, this story is rather descriptive and lacks mechanistic insights.</p><p>1) In Figure 1, it is unclear why the untreated U2OS cells (-NCS) also show high levels of XRCC5.</p></disp-quote><p>XRCC5 protein levels do not change after DNA damage, only its localization. XRCC5 is a highly abundant protein that is rapidly recruited to DSBs since, although it has intrinsic affinity for DNA, it has even higher affinity for DNA ends. Because it associates with chromatin in both undamaged and damaged cells (although at different locations under these two conditions), XRCC5 is an ideal marker to evaluate cross-correlation changes with other DNA-binding proteins in response to DNA damage (PMIDs: 23897892, 25941401, 29215009, 11493912).
