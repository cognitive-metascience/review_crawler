repair (MMR). MMR starts when a MutS homolog recognizes a mismatch and undergoes an ATP-dependent transformation to an elusive sliding clamp state. How this transient state promotes MutL homolog recruitment and activation of repair is unclear. Here we present a crystal structure of the MutS/MutL complex using a site-specifically crosslinked complex and examine how large conformational changes lead to activation of MutL. The structure captures MutS in the sliding clamp conformation, where tilting of the MutS subunits across each other pushes DNA into a new channel, and reorientation of the connector domain creates an interface for MutL with both MutS subunits. Our work explains how the sliding clamp promotes loading of MutL onto DNA, to activate downstream effectors. We thus elucidate a crucial mechanism that ensures that MMR is initiated only after detection of a DNA mismatch.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06744.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06744.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06744.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genetic code of DNA is written using four letters: “A”, “C”, “T”, and “G”. Molecules of DNA form a double helix in which the letters in the two opposing strands pair up in a specific manner—“A” pairs with “T”, and “C” pairs with “G”. A cell must replicate its DNA before it divides, and sometimes the wrong DNA letter can get added into the new DNA strand. If left uncorrected, these mistakes accumulate over time and can eventually harm the cell. As a result, cells have evolved several ways to identify these mistakes and correct them, including one known as “mismatch repair”.</p><p>Mismatch repair occurs via several stages. The process starts when a protein called MutS comes across a site in the DNA where the letters are mismatched (for example, where an “A” is paired with a “C”, instead of a “T”). MutS can recognize such a mismatch, bind it, and then bind to another molecule called ATP. MutS then changes shape and encircles the DNA like a clamp that can slide along the DNA. Only when it forms this “sliding clamp” state can MutS recruit another protein called MutL. This activity in turn triggers a series of further events that ultimately correct the mismatch. However, it remains poorly understood how MutS forms a clamp around DNA and how and why this state recruits MutL in order to start the repair.</p><p>To visualize this short-lived intermediate, Groothuizen et al. trapped the relevant complex in the presence of DNA containing a mismatch and then used a technique called X-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional structure of MutS bound to MutL. The structure reveals that two copies of MutS tilt across each other and open up a channel, which is large enough to accommodate the DNA. In this manner, MutS is able to form a loose ring around the DNA. The changes in the structure and the movement of the DNA to the new channel were confirmed using another technique, commonly referred to as FRET.</p><p>Groothuizen et al. observed that the movements in the MutS protein also serve to make the interfaces available that can recognize MutL. If these interfaces were disturbed, MutS and MutL were unable to associate with each other, which resulted in a failure to trigger mismatch repair. Further analysis revealed that that MutL binds to DNA only after MutS has recognised the mismatch and formed a clamp around it. This is the first time that the MutS clamp and the MutS/MutL complex have been visualized, and further work is now needed to understand how MutL triggers other events that ultimately repair the mismatched DNA.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06744.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06744.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DNA mismatch repair</kwd><kwd>Lynch syndrome</kwd><kwd>human</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>mismatch2model HEALTH-F4-2008-223545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lebbink</surname><given-names>Joyce HG</given-names></name><name><surname>Friedhoff</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Sixma</surname><given-names>Titia K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003245</institution-id><institution>Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschappen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center for Biomedical Genetics</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sixma</surname><given-names>Titia K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CW Echo 711.011.011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sixma</surname><given-names>Titia K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CW VIDI 700.58.428</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lebbink</surname><given-names>Joyce HG</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Visualization of the sliding clamp in DNA mismatch repair shows how a transient complex is activated.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To enable the correct and complete transfer of genetic information during cell division, DNA polymerases efficiently replicate the genome by pairing nucleotide bases opposite their complementary template base. However, despite the polymerase proofreading ability, incorrect nucleotides are occasionally incorporated into the new DNA strand, resulting in mutations when left uncorrected. To reduce the number of such mismatches and maintain genomic stability, replication is followed by DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in almost all cellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kunkel and Erie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jiricny, 2013</xref>). The initiation of this MMR system is evolutionarily conserved, although in eukaryotes heterodimeric homologs replace the bacterial homodimeric components. Defects in MMR result in a mutator phenotype and in humans in predisposition for cancer, known as Lynch syndrome or HNPCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lynch and de la Chapelle, 1999</xref>).</p><p>MMR is initiated when a MutS homolog binds to a mismatch. In this mismatch recognition step, the MutS dimer kinks the DNA at the site of the mismatch and stacks a phenylalanine onto the mispaired base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lamers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Obmolova et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Warren et al., 2007</xref>). Upon ATP binding MutS releases the mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Gradia et al., 1997</xref>) and travels as a ‘sliding clamp’ along the DNA helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gradia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jeong et al., 2011</xref>), and this specific state of MutS is recognized by MutL or its homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grilley et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Prolla et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drotschmann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>MutL proteins are constitutive dimers through their C-terminal domains, while the N-terminal ATPase domains reorganize and dimerize upon ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grilley et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ban and Yang, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ban et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guarné et al., 2004</xref>). Once recruited by the MutS sliding clamp, the MutL homologs activate downstream repair. This includes the nicking of the newly replicated strand by a nuclease, which is either part of the MutL C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kadyrov et al., 2006</xref>), or a separate protein such as MutH in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hall and Matson, 1999</xref>). MutL also activates UvrD in bacteria to unwind the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yamaguchi et al., 1998</xref>), after which the new DNA strand can be removed and re-replicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kunkel and Erie, 2005</xref>).</p><p>As loss of MutS homologs (MSH2, MSH3 and MSH6 in humans) or MutL homologs (MLH1 and PMS2 in humans) leads to mutator and/or cancer phenotypes, these proteins evidently have critical roles in mismatch repair and it is therefore important to understand their exact mechanism. Despite extensive studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gradia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mendillo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>), it is unclear how MutS achieves the sliding-clamp state, how this promotes MutL recognition and why this results in activation of the MutL protein.</p><p>Here, we trap the transient complex between MutS and MutL to resolve a crystal structure of the MutS sliding clamp bound to MutL. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that not only this MutS conformation but also the complex between MutS and MutL could be observed. We show how rearrangements in MutS promote interactions from both MutS subunits with a single MutL N-terminal domain, and how this domain is then positioned to load onto DNA running through a novel channel in the MutS dimer. We use biophysical methods to analyze the transient states and mechanistically understand the specificity and effect of MutL binding to MutS, and functional assays to address how this affects MMR initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of the MutS/MutL complex</title><p>To trap the <italic>E. coli</italic> MutS/MutL complex we used site-specific chemical crosslinking of single-cysteine variants of MutS and MutL, with a flexible BM(PEO)<sub>3</sub> crosslinker.

Meanwhile, the connector domains are rotated by ∼160° around a hinge at residues 265–266, which moves these domains out of the center of the molecule and packs them against the ATPase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>). The mismatch-binding domain could not be resolved in the density, probably because it is flexible in this state.

This type of ATP-induced tilting and increased packing of ATPase domains is more often observed upon ATP binding in ABC ATPases, such as ATP transporters, SMCs and RAD50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hopfner and Tainer, 2003</xref>). Based on comparison to RAD50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hopfner et al., 2000</xref>) we previously predicted a tilting motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lamers et al., 2004</xref>), and an open-to-closed transition has been supported by deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mendillo et al., 2010</xref>), but the crossing of the clamp domains of MutS and the effect that this has on DNA binding were unexpected.</p><p>The type of rearrangement of the MutS N-terminal region was similarly unexpected. In this movement the connector domains have rotated onto the so-called ‘signature helix’ (residues 670–684) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hopfner and Tainer, 2003</xref>), whose amino terminus interacts with the γ-phosphate of the ATP in the opposite subunit in ABC ATPases. Therefore the observed connector domain movement could be the result of binding of ATP in the opposing subunit.</p><p>In RAD50 this tilting or ‘closing’ motion is transmitted through a ‘signature coupling helix’ via charged interactions with the signature helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deshpande et al., 2014</xref>). This ‘coupling helix’ is found at the beginning of a long stretch (144–767) in RAD50 that includes the coiled coil region and ends in the signature helix. The equivalent region in MutS is only 10 residues long (660–669) and it is disordered in all structures. It is feasible that this 10-residue loop is critical for transmission of the ATP signal, but the details must be different, since the basic residues in the signature helix of RAD50 are not conserved in MutS.</p><p>To validate the relevance of the observed conformational changes for the MMR process, MutS proteins with a single cysteine at position 449 were site-specifically labeled with two different Alexa fluorophores and combined into heterodimers by random subunit exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). When labeled protein was bound to end-blocked DNA containing a G:T mismatch, FRET increased upon ATP addition.

To analyze this movement we combined two single-cysteine variants of MutS, labeled in the connector domain (residue 246) and the ATPase domain (residue 798) respectively, into heterodimers, and measured the FRET signal between these sites upon sliding clamp formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, after ATP addition the FRET increased, indicating that these residues come closer together. As this is measured in the absence of MutL it suggests that after mismatch binding, ATP is sufficient to induce movement of the connector domain away from the mismatch-recognition position.</p><p>Although the complex was crystallized in the presence of DNA containing a mismatch, the DNA is not visible in the structure. This could be due to smearing out of the electron density over multiple positions or the DNA may not be present in the crystal, both indicating that the mismatch has been released, as expected for the ATP-bound state of MutS.</p><p>The subunit tilting has occluded the original DNA binding site, but because the connector and mismatch-binding domains have moved, a large channel (∼35 Å wide) in MutS has become accessible, which could easily accommodate a DNA duplex (20 Å diameter). The new channel is lined by conserved lysines and arginines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which can govern nonspecific contacts with the negative backbone of DNA, as expected for the MutS sliding clamp state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, in our crystal forms these channels are aligned between symmetry mates or even within the asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This packing of MutS/MutL complexes is most likely a crystallographic artefact, as it could not occur in the presence of MutL dimers, but the alignment could reflect the path of the DNA present during crystallization. We hypothesize that the DNA is pushed down to this channel during the ATP-induced conformational changes of MutS after mismatch recognition.</p><p>To test whether DNA moves down into the new channel in solution, we analyzed FRET signals between fluorescently labeled DNA (end-blocked) and specific sites in single-cysteine MutS variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). After addition of ATP, DNA moves away from residues 449 at the DNA-clamp position (FRET/acceptor ratio reduction ∼1.5 fold), while an increase in FRET/acceptor ratio (&gt;3.6 fold) was observed when MutS was labeled at position 336. Since the connector domain moves down itself, no substantial change in FRET/acceptor ratio is observed between residue 246 and DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Combined, these FRET data are in agreement with repositioning of the DNA towards the channel created by the new conformation.</p><p>Based on these validations, we conclude that the observed MutS conformation in our crystal structure is induced by ATP after mismatch recognition. Since the new position of the DNA would allow MutS to fit as a loose ring around the DNA duplex (with a channel size similar to that of PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krishna et al., 1994</xref>)), consistent with free movement over DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2012</xref>), we propose that this is the MutS sliding clamp conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Orientation of MutL<sup>LN40</sup> on MutS</title><p>In the structure MutL<sup>LN40</sup> makes two interfaces with MutS<sup>ΔC800</sup>.

Next, MutL was injected, which could then bind to these MutS clamps.

Previous deuterium exchange experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mendillo et al., 2009</xref>) indicated that the connector domain interacts with MutL, particularly via MutS glutamines 211 and 212. Indeed in our structure these residues are buried within this ∼670 Å<sup>2</sup> interface with MutL<sup>LN40</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Interestingly, the deuterium exchange experiments identified a second region on the MutS surface that was protected upon MutL interaction in the ATPase domain (residues 673–686). These residues are located in the ‘signature helix’ of MutS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hopfner and Tainer, 2003</xref>) and in the complex structure this region is masked by the MutS<sup>ΔC800</sup> connector domain in its new position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>ATP binding is sufficient to displace the connector domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and MutL<sup>LN40</sup> interaction may stabilize the position of the connector domain that we see in the crystal structure. At the resolution of our structure, there is no clear electron density for the connecting crosslinker that we used to stabilize the complex, and the crosslinked residue 131C on MutL<sup>LN40</sup> could not be modeled. However, the distance between Cα atoms of crosslinked residue 246C in MutS<sup>ΔC800</sup> and residue 132 in MutL<sup>LN40</sup> is shorter (∼15.5 Å) than the 18 Å crosslinker (further spaced by cysteine side-chains), showing that the crosslinker can not enforce the observed position of the connector domain.</p><p>On the MutL side of interface 2, residue K52 of MutL<sup>LN40</sup> is involved in the interaction with the connector domain of MutS<sup>ΔC800</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This explains the previously reported unexpected mutator phenotype of MutL K52C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giron-Monzon et al., 2004</xref>). To confirm its role in the interface we measured the binding of MutL K52C to the MutS sliding clamp in our SPR assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

This, and interaction of the fluorophore itself with bound protein, can explain the lowered FRET. A similar straightening of DNA relative to the unbound DNA was previously observed upon ATP-dependent MutS release in SAXS experiments using DNA labelled with gold-clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hura et al., 2013a</xref>). The effect is also present to lesser extent when using a mixture of MutS<sup>ΔC800</sup> with WT MutL in this setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The result indicates that MutL<sup>LN40</sup> loading occurs after mismatch recognition and sliding clamp formation by MutS<sup>ΔC800</sup>.</p><p>Since we observed that upon sliding clamp formation, MutS loads MutL onto DNA, we wondered whether this DNA loading step is essential for MMR. Indeed we observed a correlation with the DNA binding ability of MutL for MutH activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, the DNA-binding mutants of MutL impair in vivo MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Robertson et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), indicating that loading of MutL onto DNA after mismatch recognition is essential for MMR.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Taken together, our data reveal how the large conformational changes within MutS after mismatch recognition promote MMR activation. In the mismatch and ATP activated state MutS pushes DNA into a new channel, which allows sliding of the protein over DNA. The new state with the clamps crossed over the DNA explains the stability of the MutS sliding clamp on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schofield et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lebbink et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jeong et al., 2011</xref>), as electrostatic interactions between DNA and the positive charges lining the new channel may stabilize the new clamp conformation. The conformational change pushes the connector domain away from the center and on top of the ATPase domains, to provide a second interface for the MutL protein that binds to the opposing MutS subunit, while DNA in the new MutS channel can also contribute to MutL binding. This loads the N-terminal domains of MutL onto the DNA and the MutL binding delays the sliding of MutS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). The loading step of MutL onto DNA is required for MutH activation and nicking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Junop et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Robertson et al., 2006</xref>), while UvrD loading and activation at this nick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yamaguchi et al., 1998</xref>) would follow similar validation. In this way, the requirement of the MutS conformational change for full MutL interaction is a sophisticated validation mechanism, which presumably is conserved in the eukaryotic homologs. It ensures that repair is only initiated when necessary, and due to the MMR system DNA replication can be completed with few errors incorporated in the genome.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mpg" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-06744-media2.mpg"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06744.018</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Model for initiation of DNA mismatch repair.</title><p>After MutS (cyan/blue) has recognized a mismatch in DNA (in orange; mismatch shown as pink spheres), it will bind ATP which triggers a conformational change in which the subunits tilt across each other and the connector domains move outward. This pushes the DNA to a new channel, where MutS fits as a loose ring around the DNA duplex and can behave as a sliding clamp.

First a single ATP will bind, leading to a stabilized asymmetric nucleotide state of MutS on the mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antony and Hingorani, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antony et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Monti et al., 2011</xref>), followed by binding of the second ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mazur et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hargreaves et al., 2010</xref>). Meanwhile MutS will undergo two separate ATP-induced events, the tilting of the subunits that push DNA into a new channel and the rearrangement of the connector domain (and the associated mismatch binding domain) that together generate a new MutL interface.</p><p>These two movements could potentially be uncoupled. MutS binding to a non-hydrolysable ATP analog can already cause a closed clamp-like state, (i.e. perform the tilting movement) as supported by SAXS analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hura et al., 2013b</xref>), but may possibly not change the conformation of the mismatched binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>), as consequence of the connector domain movement. This would explain how MutS with ATPγS (or with ATP for a mutant that cannot hydrolyse nucleotides [E694A] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacobs-Palmer and Hingorani, 2007</xref>]) could form a closed clamp state that can no longer be loaded onto DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gradia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacobs-Palmer and Hingorani, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cristóvão et al., 2012</xref>), but nevertheless is not sufficient to bind MutL.</p><p>Our data do not address the order of the two events, tilting and connector movement, or how they relate to the two ATP binding events. Observed conformational changes resulting in ternary complex and sliding clamp formation have previously been suggested to be independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mendillo et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed our structure does suggest that rearrangement of a single connector domain (in the subunit equivalent to the ‘MSH2’ subunit; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mendillo et al., 2009</xref>) is sufficient for the complex formation with MutLα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hess et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hargreaves et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2012</xref>). This might allow MSH6 to initially remain bound to the mismatch, consistent with models that consider transient asymmetric nucleotide states involved in mismatch verification and possibly ternary complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antony and Hingorani, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hess et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lebbink et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mazur et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hargreaves et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Monti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>). Another question that is unclear is where the loading of MutL onto DNA takes place. It could occur on or close to the mismatch itself, but it is also possible that MutS first slides before loading MutL on DNA.</p><p>Once the sliding clamp conformation is reached, the complex no longer interacts with the mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gorman et al., 2012</xref>).

This sliding clamp state of MutS bound to a MutL domain is highly informative. It corresponds to a reaction intermediate that occurs during a series of conformational changes triggered by mismatch recognition, and explains why specifically this conformation of MutS is able to recruit MutL. The presented combination of structural and biophysical methods provides a powerful approach to resolve conformational changes within large and transient protein complexes that form and act during biologically relevant processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Proteins</title><p>MutS mutants were created in the <italic>mutS</italic> gene in vector pET-3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lamers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giron-Monzon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Manelyte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Winkler et al., 2011</xref>) or vector pET15b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Manelyte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Winkler et al., 2011</xref>) (for His-tagged MutS constructs in FRET assays).

Crystal structures were solved in consecutive steps of finding domains using Phaser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>). Several search models were used, but best results were obtained with domains from chain A of PDB entry 1W7A as search models for MutS<sup>ΔC800</sup> and chain A from PDB entry 1BKN for MutL<sup>LN40</sup>, while clear density for residues 150–164 of MutL<sup>LN40</sup> allowed building as in PDB entry 1NHJ. The search process was improved by going back and forth between the different datasets to find missing domains. Initial structure solution was performed starting from crystal form 1 as follows: first, a search model consisting of residues 267–800 of chain A of PDB entry 1W7A (MutS) was searched twice using Phaser, which resulted in a solution with these chains forming a tilted MutS dimer. Next, this solution was used together with a search model consisting of chain A of 1BKN (MutL<sup>LN40</sup>), which placed this protein against the ATPase domain of one MutS subunit. Then, the second MutLLN40 was found with Phaser using a brute rotation search of 15° around the angle that would orient this MutL<sup>LN40</sup> on the other side of the MutS dimer in a similar manner as the first, and automated translation, packing and refinement steps by Phaser indeed placed the MutL<sup>LN40</sup> in the symmetrically equivalent position. One connector domain (residues 128–266 of chain A of 1W7A) was then found with Phaser, and the second connector domain was placed using similar steps as for the second MutL<sup>LN40</sup> search. Thus the search identified the equivalent dimeric counterpart three times for separate parts of the complex (the main MutS chain, MutL<sup>LN40</sup> and connector domains). The resulting MutS-MutL<sup>LN40</sup> complex structure could then be used as a search model in all crystal forms and easily identified equivalent complexes in each of those (present three times in the asymmetric units in the 6.6 Å and 7.6 Å datasets). Finally, for crystal form 1, an additional ‘half complex’ was found with Phaser using one MutS chain and one MutL<sup>LN40</sup> chain of the existing complex structure. This second complex forms a symmetry-generated dimer over a twofold axis, with similar MutS-MutL<sup>LN40</sup> interfaces, but the MutS clamp domains in this crystallographic dimer could not be modeled. This second conformer forms a more compact MutS dimer, probably due to crystal packing, but since it has identical interfaces with MutL<sup>LN40</sup> we focussed on the main conformation throughout this paper. Excellent quality of the structure solutions after molecular replacement with the complete but unrefined models is evident from the Phaser statistics: TFZ = 9.0/LLG = 996 for 4.7 Å; TFZ = 14.2/LLG = 899 for 6.6 Å; and TFZ = 13.0/LLG = 795 for the 7.6 Å dataset.</p><p>Refinement was first performed using rigid body refinement in REFMAC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murshudov et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2011</xref>), for which the following domains of MutS were defined: residues 128–266, 267–765, 766–800; and for MutL: residues 20–204, 205–331.

During refinement, clear density became visible for missing residues 150–164 of the MutL<sup>LN40</sup> subunits, which followed the conformation of PDB entry 1NHJ. Interestingly, this conformation was different from that in the MutL search model state, indicating this to be real signal, and not due to bias from the search model. Also, AMP-PNP could be placed in density in the nucleotide binding sites of MutS.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Switzerland). 100 nM of the DNA with 6 µM SYTOX Blue (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher scientific, Waltham, MA) was mixed with 200 nM MutS variants labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 in buffer F, after which ATP was added to 1 mM to induce the conformational change in MutS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vivo MMR complementation</title><p>Spontaneous mutation rates were assessed using acquired rifampicin resistance.

The experiments were performed in SPR buffer containing 25 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 0.05% TWEEN-20 and 1 mM ATP, using immobilized biotinylated 100-bp DNA (same sequence as above) with a fluorescein moiety at the other end.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>MutL-MutS binding assay</title><p>Full-length His<sub>6</sub>-MutL binding to the full-length MutS sliding clamp was assessed using a two-step SPR assay. The resulting graphs are not strictly affinity curves, as changes in MutS stability on DNA contribute to the observed response, but serve to assess the effect of mutations. The SPR buffer was supplemented with 20% glycerol to ensure MutL stability. Before every measurement, anti-fluorescein Fab fragment (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher scientific, Waltham, MA) was injected to block the fluorescein-labeled DNA (100 bp, see above) ends. MutS sliding clamps were captured on the end-blocked DNA by injecting 200 nM WT or mutant MutS protein (in buffer with 1 mM ATP) for 120 s. Then WT or mutant MutL protein (in buffer with 1 mM ATP) was injected for 120 s, followed by dissociation with buffer only. This was repeated with varying concentrations of MutL.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>DNA binding by MutL</title><p>Fluorescence polarization measurements to assess DNA-binding of MutL<sup>LN40</sup> mutants were performed in low-salt FP buffer with 25 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT and 0.05% TWEEN-20. For full length MutL, the buffer was supplemented with 10% glycerol. A concentration of 0.5 nM of 5′ labeled TAMRA-41-bp DNA (ATAGGACGCTGACACTGGTGCTTGGCAGCTTCTAATTCGAT annealed with complementary strand) was used. MutL proteins were serial diluted in black 96-well microplates (PerkinElmer Inc, Waltham, MA) in 100 μl volumes. Polarization of the TAMRA label was read out in a PHERAstar FS machine (BMG Labtech GmbH, Germany) with an 540/590 (excitation/emission) FP module.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>DNA kinking assays</title><p>Stopped-flow assays to assess DNA binding and kinking were performed in buffer containing 25 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 0.05% TWEEN-20 and 10 μM ADP, with or without 1 mM ATP.

The other syringe contained 400 nM MutS<sup>ΔC800</sup> D246C or crosslinked MutS<sup>ΔC800</sup>/MutL<sup>LN40</sup> complex. For assays with double-labeled DNA, donor fluorophores were excited at 473 nm and measured using filters 540IB + 540IK, while acceptor fluorophores were measured at the same time using an OG590 filter. For experiments with TAMRA-labeled DNA, the fluorophore was excited at 545 nm and OG540 filters were used for read-out.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and three reviewers, including Leemor Joshua-Tor (Reviewing editor), and Randy Read.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a strong paper describing a thorough study of the implications of the structure of a trapped MutS:MutL complex on the mechanism of DNA mismatch repair. The structural studies accompanied by FRET, crosslinking and binding studies show that MutS is converted to a sliding clamp conformation to load MutL onto DNA. The paper is well written and clear despite covering a lot of material. The crystal structures along with analyses resulting in many new insights provide at least two major breakthroughs: the MutS ATP bound conformation and the requirement of the MutS conformational change for functional MutL interaction: together these provide an elegant regulatory mechanism for commitment to repair. The additional analysis and testing via mutants, gels, FRET and SPR provide substantial added impact. This is likely to be one of the most important sets of structural results for the DNA mismatch repair field in the last 5 years. There are many novel insights that come directly from these structures and associated analyses, such as the ATP-bound MutS conformation and the rearrangement of the connector domain that creates a second interface with MutL to regulate pathway progression. Moreover, this work certainly advances our understanding of macromolecular machines in general.</p><p>The starting point for this study is the determination of the structure of trimmed constructs of MutS and MutL that have been trapped in a transient conformation by crosslinking Cys side chains that are sufficiently close only in the sliding clamp conformation. The process of producing enough stable MutS/MutL dimer for crystallization efforts is itself impressive. The structures are without a doubt important and interesting. Three crystal forms were obtained, and all diffract to relatively low resolution with the best being 4.7Å. At this resolution, care must be taken in structure solution and refinement to overcome the poor parameter:data ratio. The validity of the molecular replacement structure solution is pretty much beyond question, as the statistics for the placement of components are convincing and, of much greater importance, the same complex has been assembled more than once in the course of structure solution. The refinement has been carried out with care to avoid over-fitting, as indicated by the low values for <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> and the presence of unbiased features showing unmodelled loops and expected ligands. In addition, all the important conformational changes and molecular contacts inferred from the structure have been checked by FRET measurements and cross-linking experiments.</p><p>As the authors point out: “During refinement, clear density became visible for missing residues 150-164 of the MutL<sup>LN40</sup> subunits, which followed the conformation of PDB entry 1NHJ. Interestingly, this conformation was different from that in the MutL search model state, indicating this to be real signal, and not due to bias from the search model.” In analyzing the structures, the authors make several good points in relating the current results to other established data. However, as the MMR field has ongoing strong controversies regarding the sliding clamp and MutL interactions, it will be important to place this exciting new data as firmly as possible into the context of other biophysical work.</p><p>The reviewers raised several issues that should be addressed in a revised manuscript:</p><p>As mentioned, the findings in this paper are substantial and some aspects of the results did not receive a complete discussion in light of other observations in the field. The reviewers discussed the possibility of suggesting a split into two papers, however, this would slow down the process considerably. Instead, since there is no space limitation, the authors are encouraged to expand their Discussion as pointed out below.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) According to section 7 of the submission guidelines, crystal structures must be deposited and the PDB validation reports must be provided to the referees. The referees should have a chance to examine these reports before the paper is accepted, and the PDB codes should be given in the text.</p><p>2) In the Abstract, the statement about the structure being based on cysteine crosslinking could be misread as indicating that this was a hybrid structure based largely on inferred distances. It would be better to clarify in the Abstract that the desired conformation was trapped by cysteine crosslinking and that crosslinking experiments were also used to validate the molecular interactions inferred from the structure.</p><p>3) Several experiments are presented – FRET, binding, crosslinking – however, in most a control with non-mismatched DNA is missing. There are claims such as “dependent on mismatched DNA” that could not be made without these controls. Some of the FRET experiments should also be done with non-hydrolyzable ATP in addition to ATP. For the FRET experiments – the data in supplementary material should include donor and acceptor curves, rather than just final FRET differences.</p><p>4) The presentation is clear and concise, but it is disappointing that more of the paper was not devoted to describing the crystal structures plus their relationships to transient states, as together they answer many questions. For example, the packing within the crystal structure, as a potential filament on DNA, is of particular interest to many but left as supplement. An expanded discussion should address the transient states, the specificity and effect of MutL binding to MutS, and the new channel resulting from a novel conformation of MutS that reveals a rearrangement of the subunits in the MutS<sup>ΔC800</sup> dimer.</p><p>5) Importantly, this work establishes the ATP-bound conformation for MutS dimer with a greater motion than expected from prior MutS structures. In this novel MutS conformation the subunits are tilted across each other by ∼30{degree sign} which explains the stability of the MutS sliding clamp on DNA, compared to the mismatch recognition state. More detail on how this compares to the Rad50 ABC ATPAse ATP-bound conformation would be useful to readers, as the use of ABC ATPases in both mismatch and double-strand break repair has sparked considerable interest. E.g. the ABC ATPase signature helix identified from Rad50 conveys ATP-binding to Rad50 conformations, is this similar or different in the MutS changes in concert with ATP and MutL (Williams GJ et al., ABC ATPase signature helices in Rad50 link nucleotide state to Mre11 interface for DNA repair. Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2011 Apr;18(4):423-31)? Such conformational switching in Rad50 controls pathway progression and the choice between DNA end joining and excision, which may have parallels to these new MutS results or not (Deshpande RA et al., ATP-driven Rad50 conformations regulate DNA tethering, end resection, and ATM checkpoint signaling. EMBO J. 2014 33, 482-500).</p><p>6) The authors' state that the “… sliding clamp state of MutS bound to a MutL domain is highly informative.” However their point that “it corresponds to a reaction intermediate that occurs during a series of conformational changes triggered by mismatch recognition” depends upon putting this work firmly into the context of existing results. Given the novel conformation of MutS and low-resolution coupled to issues from the heavy reliance on Cys mutants, cross-linked and truncated constructs and the absent electron density for the DNA, the authors would do well to better relate this work to other recent biophysical results where feasible, e.g. Gorman J, et al., Single-molecule imaging reveals target-search mechanisms during DNA mismatch repair. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Nov 6;109(45):E3074-83 and DeRocco VC, Sass LE, Qiu R, Weninger KR, Erie DA. Dynamics of MutS-mismatched DNA complexes are predictive of their repair phenotypes. Biochemistry. 2014 Apr 1;53(12):2043-52.</p><p>7) The authors also point out that their presented combination of structural and biophysical methods provides a powerful approach to resolve conformational changes within large and transient protein complexes. Thus, it would be useful to relate this model to recent data on the comprehensive conformational states for MutS and the model for bending then straightening steps in MutS damage recognition. X-ray scattering data was interpreted to suggest that nucleotide binding drives MutSβ conformational changes (Hura GL et al., Comprehensive macromolecular conformations mapped by quantitative SAXS analyses. Nat Methods. 2013 Jun;10(6):453-4.) These new observations would seem to be in general agreement with the SAXS results, e.g. “As this is measured in the absence of MutL it suggests that after mismatch binding, ATP is sufficient to induce movement of the connector domain away from the mismatch-recognition position.”</p><p>8) For the crosslinked complex, the authors observe a two-step sequence of events, a first increase in FP simultaneous with an increase in FRET due to kinking of the DNA, then a second event increases FP even more but reduces the FRET signal to below starting value in which “… the DNA is not kinked any more but kept relatively rigid by the MutL” – these data seem to support and extend results from X-ray scattering, which showed DNA bending then straightening upon formation of MutS/MutL complexes (Hura GL et al., DNA conformations in mismatch repair probed in solution by X-ray scattering from gold nanocrystals. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Oct 22;110(43):17308-13).</p><p>9) They do not observe the DNA in these structures. They claim that either the DNA is disordered (sliding along the channel that is formed) or that it was released. Could this be experimentally examined? Though not complete verification, were the crystals examined to see whether DNA was in the crystals? In one of the crystal forms the channels of at least 3 copies are aligned – if the DNA is in there – it might show fiber scattering along that axis. Do they see this? Would the DNA be able to stack along there (due to length)? Though they may not have a 2:2:1 complex anymore.</p><p>10) In the Introduction, around the third paragraph, it would be good to help out the uninitiated reader by noting that the newly replicated strand is recognised by the lack of adenine methylation.</p><p>11) In the first paragraph of the Results, it would be good to mention the nature and length of the crosslinker. Until a clarification in the subsection “MutS sliding clamp recognition by MutL”, it could appear that the authors were referring to disulphide bridge formation.</p><p>12) In the second paragraph of the Results, the phrase “purification to obtain the protein in two successive cycles” should be clarified. Does this means that two purification steps were carried out?</p><p>13) In the second paragraph of the subsection “MutS sliding clamp recognition by MutL”, it is not really appropriate to compare the 15.5Å distance between C-alpha atoms of Cys residues with the 18Å distance (really 17.8Å according to the Pierce information) between C atoms in the maleimide ring. In the cross-linked state, there will be three additional bonds on each side (CA-CB-SG-C), giving a significantly larger maximum distance between C-alpha atoms.</p><p>14) In the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, there should be a capital “D” in the definition of the difference map coefficients, i.e. “mFo-DFc”. The authors should always indicate what types of electron density maps are presented (supplementary figures).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “MutS/MutL crystal structure reveals that the mutS sliding clamp loads MutL onto DNA” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript has been improved significantly but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, which should be expedient at that point. These are outlined below.</p><p>Overall this is an impressive and high impact manuscript on the MutS-MutL structure. The large and functionally-important conformational change seen in MutS with MutL and nucleotide binding fills a big gap in our understanding with likely broad impacts as noted below. Also for the most part, the authors have addressed the reviewers' comments. However, there are some responses where the authors should take another look. Given the importance of this work, in order to more clearly position it in the field, and improve the impact this paper would have, the authors should consider the following 5 points before publication.</p><p>1) In response to point 5 about how this new work related to the Rad50 ABC ATPase family member (specifically recent NSMB and EMBO papers), they mention that while “the signature helix itself is indeed important … and the new position of the connector domain is overlapping with the position of the coiled coil regions in Rad50 in the AMP-PNP bound state” the “detailed interactions driving conformational changes seem different” (i.e. salt-bridge switches are not conserved).</p><p>In the text they note similarities to other ABC ATPases, and mention the signature helix, although they do not cite the recent NSMB or EMBO papers that experimentally dissected the role of residues on the signature helix (they rather cite a 2003 review). And in the Discussion they don't discuss whether or not a different set of salt bridge switches may coordinate conformational changes. To be fair this may be complicated by the low-resolution nature of the structure that would mean density for residues involved in salt bridges is poorly defined. So a detailed analysis without specific testing would be beyond the scope of this work. Yet, at a minimum, there should be at least some more specific discussion of this point with recent primary references that deal with a structural element that is key to the ATP-driven conformational change in the Rad50 ABC ATPase and likely in this similar ABC ATPase. This, unfortunately, is currently unclear from the manuscript.</p><p>2) The authors' response to point 7, asking if there are similarities in the effects of ATP binding to the MutS conformations seen in Hura et al., doesn't seem to make sense. They mention that in both cases it is the nucleotide that drives the change, yet then state that these observations don't correlate. “In this instance we are discussing the nucleotide and not MutL that drives the change whereas Hura et al. discuss the nucleotide rather than DNA driving the change. Hence this doesn't seem to correlate.” However, because both experiments report on nucleotide-driven changes, they should correlate and be describable in terms of noted similarities and/or differences.</p><p>3) The MutL N-terminal domain is also an ATPase. Is MutL also bound to nucleotide in their structure? This doesn't seem to be mentioned, and needs to be. It is mentioned that MutL can dimerize upon ATP binding and that the structure of the complex would sterically allow MutL dimerization based on a previously published structure of the N-terminal domain bound to nucleotide. However, this model is buried in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1F</xref> and the ATP-binding region is not highlighted, which makes it hard to evaluate. Also, this model would suggest that the second MutL would be free to interact with an adjacent MutS dimer on DNA. While this is not seen as a stable complex in the reported gel filtration assays (only MutS-MutL heterotetramers are seen with DNA and AMPPNP), is there previously published evidence for this?</p><p>4) In the subsection “Conformation of the MutS sliding clamp” they comment that “This type of ATP-induced tilting … is more often observed upon ATP binding in ABC ATPases, such as ATP transporters, SMCs and RAD50”. And then go on to say in a subsequent sentence that “the extent of the motion and the crossing of the DNA clamp domains of MutS was unexpected”.</p><p>This is confusing as firstly it seems to imply that MutS is not an ABC ATPase when, in fact, it is. Also, it could be argued that this observation of subdomain rotations, while perhaps not predicted from earlier work on MutS, fits well with what is known from other ABC ATPases. Therefore, it is important as it bridges a previous gap in our understanding of MutS conformational changes versus other ABC ATPases. It furthermore facilitates future work to uncover a unified mechanism for how ATP drives conformational changes in ABC-ATPases. So a clearer and more unified discussion would be of considerable use to the MutS field but also to the entire ABC-ATPase superfamily. Perhaps they could provide some numbers giving the rotation angles in different systems, to quantify the size of motion they see here with respect to the other systems.</p><p>5) They see that the mismatch binding domain becomes disordered in their structure, and propose that both this and the DNA may be present in the ∼35 Angstrom channel they observe. Some quantitation should be included here. Based on the structured volume of this domain and the volume that dsDNA would take up, is the space available in the channel that they see large enough for both the disordered mismatch recognition domain and DNA?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06744.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) According to section 7 of the submission guidelines, crystal structures must be deposited and the PDB validation reports must be provided to the referees.

The authors should always indicate what types of electron density maps are presented (supplementary figures)</italic>.</p><p>We've made this change.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) In response to point 5 about how this new work related to the Rad50 ABC ATPase family member (specifically recent NSMB and EMBO papers), they mention that while</italic> “<italic>the signature helix itself is indeed important … and the new position of the connector domain is overlapping with the position of the coiled coil regions in Rad50 in the AMP-PNP bound state</italic>” <italic>the</italic> “<italic>detailed interactions driving conformational changes seem different</italic>” <italic>(i.e. salt-bridge switches are not conserved)</italic>.</p><p><italic>In the text they note similarities to other ABC ATPases, and mention the signature helix, although they do not cite the recent NSMB or EMBO papers that experimentally dissected the role of residues on the signature helix (they rather cite a 2003 review). And in the Discussion they don't discuss whether or not a different set of salt bridge switches may coordinate conformational changes. To be fair this may be complicated by the low-resolution nature of the structure that would mean density for residues involved in salt bridges is poorly defined. So a detailed analysis without specific testing would be beyond the scope of this work. Yet, at a minimum, there should be at least some more specific discussion of this point with recent primary references that deal with a structural element that is key to the ATP-driven conformational change in the Rad50 ABC ATPase and likely in this similar ABC ATPase. This, unfortunately, is currently unclear from the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>Previously, we did not address this as MutS is different from RAD50 in this particular region. Hence this discussion will remain speculative, but we agree that it may be informative to be more specific about the differences between these ABC ATPase family members. Therefore we have added the following paragraph:</p><p>“In RAD50 this tilting or ‘closing’ motion is transmitted through a ‘signature coupling helix’ via charged interactions with the signature helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deshpande et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). This ‘coupling helix’ is found at the beginning of a long stretch (144-767) in Rad50 that includes the coiled coil region and ends in the signature helix. The equivalent region in MutS is only 10 residues long (660-669) and it is disordered in all structures. It is feasible that this 10-residue loop is critical for transmission of the ATP signal, but the details must be different, since the basic residues in the signature helix are not conserved in MutS.”</p><p><italic>2) The authors' response to point 7, asking if there are similarities in the effects of ATP binding to the MutS conformations seen in Hura et al., doesn't seem to make sense. They mention that in both cases it is the nucleotide that drives the change, yet then state that these observations don't correlate.</italic> “<italic>In this instance we are discussing the nucleotide and not MutL that drives the change whereas Hura et al. discuss the nucleotide rather than DNA driving the change. Hence this doesn't seem to correlate.</italic>” <italic>However, because both experiments report on nucleotide-driven changes, they should correlate and be describable in terms of noted similarities and/or differences</italic>.</p><p>This is correct, and we've added the Hura et al. reference to further support that ATP binding in the absence of DNA may be sufficient for the formation of a closed clamp state. However, the conformational changes of the connector domain most likely don't change the overall shape of ATP-bound MutS enough to be visible in SAXS analysis. In fact, the movements of the clamps and the mismatch-binding domains may well be uncoupled. This fits with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Qiu et al. (2012)</xref> who noted differences in FRET for the mismatch binding domain of ATP-bound MutS in the presence and absence of DNA. We are discussing this now as follows:</p><p>“These two movements could potentially be uncoupled. MutS binding to ATP can already cause a closed clamp-like state, (i.e. perform the tilting movement) as shown by SAXS analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hura et al., 2013b</xref>), but may possibly not change the conformation of the mismatched binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>), as consequence of the connector domain movement. This would explain how MutS with ATPγS (or with ATP for a mutant that cannot hydrolyse nucleotides (E694A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacobs-Palmer and Hingorani, 2007</xref>)) could form a closed clamp state that can no longer be loaded onto DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cristóvão et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gradia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacobs-Palmer and Hingorani, 2007</xref>), but nevertheless is not sufficient to bind MutL.”</p><p><italic>3) The MutL N-terminal domain is also an ATPase. Is MutL also bound to nucleotide in their structure? This doesn't seem to be mentioned, and needs to be. It is mentioned that MutL can dimerize upon ATP binding and that the structure of the complex would sterically allow MutL dimerization based on a previously published structure of the N-terminal domain bound to nucleotide. However, this model is buried in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1"><italic>Figure 3–figure supplement 1F</italic></xref> <italic>and the ATP-binding region is not highlighted, which makes it hard to evaluate. Also, this model would suggest that the second MutL would be free to interact with an adjacent MutS dimer on DNA. While this is not seen as a stable complex in the reported gel filtration assays (only MutS-MutL heterotetramers are seen with DNA and AMPPNP), is there previously published evidence for this</italic>?</p><p>Indeed, we did not make the nucleotide state of MutL explicit. We have added the following sentence to the text: “Accordingly the MutL monomers have the apo-conformation of residues 80-103 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ban and Yang, 1998</xref>) and no density for a nucleotide is visible.”</p><p>To our knowledge, there is no published evidence for stable complex formation of MutS/MutL involving multiple dimers of both proteins forming ordered arrangements along DNA.</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection</italic> “<italic>Conformation of the MutS sliding clamp</italic>” <italic>they comment that</italic> “<italic>This type of ATP-induced tilting</italic> … <italic>is more often observed upon ATP binding in ABC ATPases, such as ATP transporters, SMCs and RAD50</italic>”<italic>. And then go on to say in a subsequent sentence that</italic> “<italic>the extent of the motion and the crossing of the DNA clamp domains of MutS was unexpected</italic>”.</p><p><italic>This is confusing as firstly it seems to imply that MutS is not an ABC ATPase when, in fact, it is. Also, it could be argued that this observation of subdomain rotations, while perhaps not predicted from earlier work on MutS, fits well with what is known from other ABC ATPases. Therefore, it is important as it bridges a previous gap in our understanding of MutS conformational changes versus other ABC ATPases. It furthermore facilitates future work to uncover a unified mechanism for how ATP drives conformational changes in ABC-ATPases. So a clearer and more unified discussion would be of considerable use to the MutS field but also to the entire ABC-ATPase superfamily. Perhaps they could provide some numbers giving the rotation angles in different systems, to quantify the size of motion they see here with respect to the other systems</italic>.</p><p>We've changed the phrasing to be more clear that we do see the ABC tilt, but that the effects are more dramatic than we had foreseen. We've changed the text to: “Based on comparison to RAD50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hopfner et al., 2000</xref>) we previously predicted a tilting motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lamers et al., 2004</xref>), and an open-to-closed transition has been supported by deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mendillo et al., 2010</xref>), but the crossing of the clamp domains of MutS and the effect that this has on DNA binding were unexpected.”</p><p><italic>5) They see that the mismatch binding domain becomes disordered in their structure, and propose that both this and the DNA may be present in the ∼35 Angstrom channel they observe. Some quantitation should be included here. Based on the structured volume of this domain and the volume that dsDNA would take up, is the space available in the channel that they see large enough for both the disordered mismatch recognition domain and DNA</italic>?</p><p>In our crystal structure both connector domains move away and interact with MutL, and hence the N-terminal mismatch recognition domains both move away from the channel. However the channel is indeed rather wide and we speculate that this complete movement may not be necessary in an asymmetric situation. That said, small adjustments could be necessary to accommodate possible clashes. In the absence of visible DNA there seem to be too many possibilities to model these potential states.</p></body></sub-article></article>
