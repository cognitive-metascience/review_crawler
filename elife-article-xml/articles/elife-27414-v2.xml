into a Pre-Initiation Complex (PIC). Here, we solve a structure of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Pol I-CF-DNA to 3.8 Å resolution using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The structure reveals a bipartite architecture of Core Factor and its recognition of the promoter from −27 to −16. Core Factor’s intrinsic mobility correlates well with different conformational states of the Pol I cleft, in addition to the stabilization of either Rrn7 N-terminal domain near Pol I wall or the tandem winged helix domain of A49 at a partially overlapping location. Comparison of the three states in this study with the Pol II system suggests that a ratchet motion of the Core Factor-DNA sub-complex at upstream facilitates promoter melting in an ATP-independent manner, distinct from a DNA translocase actively threading the downstream DNA in the Pol II PIC.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27414.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27414.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase I</kwd><kwd>core factor</kwd><kwd>initiation complex</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>ribosomal RNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007059</institution-id><institution>Northwestern University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cornew Innovation Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Yuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001032</institution-id><institution>Chicago Community Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Catalyst Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Yuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Institutional Research Grant IRG-15-173-21</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Yuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SUNY Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knutson</surname><given-names>Bruce A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Central New York Community Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knutson</surname><given-names>Bruce A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5K22CA184235</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knutson</surname><given-names>Bruce A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM110387</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ivanov</surname><given-names>Ivaylo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1149521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ivanov</surname><given-names>Ivaylo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001032</institution-id><institution>Chicago Community Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Chicago Biomedical Consortium Postdoctoral Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alexandrine and Alexander L.

The large ribosomal RNA precursor (pre-rRNA) is transcribed by Pol I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moss et al., 2007</xref>), accounting for up to 60% of total cellular RNA synthesis in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Warner, 1999</xref>). Transcription by Pol I is highly regulated, and its mis-regulation has been implicated in many diseases including various types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drygin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Montanaro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">White, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Pre-Initiation Complex (PIC) formation is a key regulatory step in the control of gene transcription by eukaryotic RNA polymerases. Yeast Pol I transcription initiation is regulated by four general transcription factors: the regulatory factor Rrn3, the Core Factor (CF), the TATA-box Binding Protein (TBP), and the Upstream Activation Factor (UAF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schneider, 2012</xref>). Rrn3 contains an elongated HEAT repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blattner et al., 2011</xref>), and binds Pol I via contacts with subunits A43, A190, and AC40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blattner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cavanaugh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Engel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Milkereit and Tschochner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Peyroche et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pilsl et al., 2016</xref>). Rrn3 association stabilizes Pol I in its monomeric and initiation-competent form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blattner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Engel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pilsl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Torreira et al., 2017</xref>), with which Core Factor further engages to facilitate Pre-Initiation Complex assembly and transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aprikian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Knutson and Hahn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Milkereit and Tschochner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Peyroche et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schneider, 2012</xref>). In addition to recruiting Pol I/Rrn3 to the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) promoter, Core Factor has also been implicated in transcription bubble opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kahl et al., 2000</xref>). Core Factor recruitment to the rDNA promoter in vivo requires the association of UAF with the upstream activating sequence (UAS) and TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bordi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Oakes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Steffan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vannini, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Transcription initiation by the three eukaryotic RNA RNA polymerases requires transcription factor (TF) IIB-like factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vannini, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vannini and Cramer, 2012</xref>). TFIIB binds the Pol II dock and wall domains using its N-terminal zinc ribbon (ZR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bushnell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen and Hahn, 2004</xref>) and C-terminal cyclin fold domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen and Hahn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kostrewa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sainsbury et al., 2013</xref>), respectively. The Rrn7 subunit of Core Factor is predicted to share sequence homology with TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blattner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Knutson and Hahn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Naidu et al., 2011</xref>), containing similar ZR and cyclin fold domains in addition to a helical C-terminal domain (CTD). Models for the Pol I Pre-Initiation Complex were proposed based on the similarity between TFIIB and Rrn7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blattner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Knutson et al., 2014</xref>), which have recently been challenged by the crystal structure of Core Factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Engel et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to Rrn7, Rrn6 and Rrn11 are essential subunits of Core Factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lalo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lin et al., 1996</xref>). The human ortholog of Core Factor is Selectivity Factor 1 (SL1), which comprises three evolutionarily conserved core subunits and two additional metazoan-specific subunits, TAF1D and TAF12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Denissov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gorski et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting a conserved architecture between these Pol I general transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Knutson and Hahn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schneider, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Structural approaches have elucidated the dynamic nature of Pol I, possibly reflecting potential conformational states that it can adopt during different stages of transcription. First, in the atomic structure of Pol I determined by X-ray crystallography, a dimeric configuration and an expanded DNA-binding cleft were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Engel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fernández-Tornero et al., 2013</xref>). The DNA-binding cleft is occupied by an element named the expander, mimicking a DNA molecule, while another element called the connector contributes to the dimerization interface by engaging the clamp domain of the neighboring Pol I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Engel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fernández-Tornero et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the bridge helix at the active site partially unfolds. When interacting with Rrn3, both the expander and the connector are displaced, resulting in a monomeric form of Pol I, with a more contracted cleft and a partially rewound bridge helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Engel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pilsl et al., 2016</xref>). A further contraction of the cleft and a completely folded bridge helix were observed in the elongation form of Pol I revealed by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Neyer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tafur et al., 2016</xref>). Although these studies provided intriguing hints at the mechanisms of Pol I transcription initiation and elongation, the lack of a Pre-Initiation Complex in these studies precluded a full understanding of its engagement with the promoter and its transition to an active transcribing state.</p><p>To gain insight into Core Factor’s role during Pol I transcription initiation, we obtained a Pol I Initial Transcribing Complex (ITC) and determined its structure to near-atomic resolution using cryo-EM. In particular, we describe three distinct functional states of the Pol I initiation complexes visualized at 3.8–4.3 Å resolution. Our structures reveal unexpected features of Core Factor’s binding to Pol I and promoter DNA compared to the Pol II Pre-Initiation Complex, and provide novel insight into the mechanism of Pol I promoter opening utilizing the intrinsic mobility of Core Factor in the absence of ATP hydrolysis</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Assembly and cryo-EM reconstruction of the Pol I initiation complex on promoter DNA</title><p>To gain insight into the regulation of Pol I transcription initiation, we assembled the Pol I basal transcription complex on an rDNA promoter using purified factors from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This resulted in improved density maps for both Pol I and Core Factor, with an overall resolution of 3.7 Å and 4.2 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). This procedure permitted de novo model building for Core Factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

In addition, Core Factor engages Pol I in the vicinity of the protrusion domain near the upstream entrance of the DNA binding cleft, and intimately interacts with the upstream promoter DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Although we included both Rrn3 and TBP in our assembly reactions (Materials and methods), we did not observe densities in any of the classified reconstructions that could correspond to them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, we monitored all fractions of our assembly reaction by gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Although we cannot rule out the possibility that Rrn3 is present at a substoichiometric level that is below the detection limit of silver staining, or alternatively, that Rrn3 associates with Pol I in the unbound fraction that somehow failed to engage the nucleic acid scaffold, our data suggests that Rrn3 does not stably associate with the rest of Pol I initiation machinery under our experimental conditions. Given the essential roles Rrn3 plays during Pol I transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keener et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moorefield et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schneider, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yamamoto et al., 1996</xref>) and its dissociation from Pol I after transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hirschler-Laszkiewicz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Milkereit and Tschochner, 1998</xref>), our data is consistent with the notion that Rrn3 functions at an earlier step during Pol I transcription initiation, where it stabilizes Pol I in an initiation-competent monomeric form and facilitates Pol I recruitment to rDNA promoter. In a separate study, Reeder and colleagues reported that Pol I can be recruited to the promoter in the absence of Rrn3, however this complex is inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aprikian et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that Rrn3 may also function post Pol I recruitment. This is also consistent with our structural study, as we included an RNA molecule in our bubble template, which may have resulted in bypassing the requirement for Rrn3 after the engagement of Pol I with the nucleic acid scaffold. As for TBP, we observed a band in the elution fraction that could result from TBP non-specifically binding to the DNA template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, compare lanes 9 and 12), consistent with the absence of TBP in our structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Molecular structure of Core Factor</title><p>The overall structure of DNA-bound Core Factor resembles a right hand holding the DNA molecule between the fingers and the palm, with the thumb pointing toward Pol I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

In agreement with the prediction, we can assign most of Rrn11 to helical densities, with a total of 13 helices and three long loops (H2-H3, H4-H5, and H8-H9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). The C-terminal helices from H5 to H13 resemble a classic TPR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allan and Ratajczak, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">D'Andrea and Regan, 2003</xref>) more than H1-H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, we named H5 to H13 the TPR domain of Rrn11, and H1-H4 the NTD. The NTD of Rrn11 resides in the palm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and caps the WD40 domain of Rrn6, directly contacting repeats W3 to W5; the TPR domain interacts with repeat W6 and the NTD of Rrn6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) forming the thumb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Like its counterpart TFIIB in the Pol II system, Rrn7 contains two cyclin fold domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Knutson and Hahn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Naidu et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which form the fingers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The two cyclin fold domains can be aligned with those in TFIIB individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), but a different relative orientation between them is adopted compared to their counterparts in TFIIB. One of the cyclin fold domains of TFIIB must be rotated when the other is aligned to its counterpart in Rrn7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), to achieve the more compact organization in Rrn7. This compact architecture is presumably induced by Rrn6 intimately embracing Rrn7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The N-terminal cyclin fold (CyclinN) domain is mainly composed of 5 consecutive α-helices, whereas the C-terminal cyclin fold (CyclinC) domain contains a long insertion between H3 and H4. The insertion region is composed of 5 α-helices referred to as the Insertion Helices (IH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This finding is consistent with previous sequence analyses, in which the similarity of CyclinC with TFIIB stops at H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Knutson and Hahn, 2011</xref>). The helices H2-H4 of Rrn7 IH contacts Rrn11 TPR H5, H6 and H8, bridging the fingers with the thumb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The interaction between Core Factor and Pol I in the Initial Transcribing Complex is mainly mediated by the Rrn11 TPR domain (the thumb) and the Pol I protrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Interestingly, Rrn7 IH H4 is also positioned near Rpb12 subunit of Pol I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), possibly contributing to Core Factor/Pol I interaction in the complex.

To overcome this, we assembled the Pol I/Core Factor complex using a truncated nucleic acid scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and obtained a cryo-EM reconstruction at an overall resolution of 6.9 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In this scaffold, the non-template strand was truncated to position −27 (transcription start site as +1) from the upstream, and the poly-T mismatch sequences were also removed, resulting in an 18 bp duplex sequence (from −27 to −10) in the upstream region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

This shortened density fits very well with a model of duplex DNA comprising only 18 base pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

Rrn7 mainly uses its N-terminal cyclin fold domain to interact with promoter DNA from positions −27 to −20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This interaction involves helices H3 and H5, as well as the loops H2-H3 and H4-H5, contacting mainly the backbone of the promoter DNA. In addition to these elements, we also observed the loop H2-H3 in the C-terminal cyclin fold domain reaching into the major groove of the DNA near position −27, the furthest interface between Core Factor and DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This is likely to be an important interface, because we failed to assemble the Pol I/Core Factor complex when we used a scaffold truncated to position −26 (that is, when the residue in the non-template strand at position −27 was deleted). Rrn11 contacts promoter DNA from positions −24 to −16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Like the Rrn7-DNA interaction, Rrn11 mainly contacts DNA through backbone interactions, including its NTD helices H1, H2 and H4, as well as H5 in the TPR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The extended loop between helices H8 and H9 of the Rrn11 TPR domain is sandwiched between H2 and promoter DNA, contacting the DNA backbone near base-pair −16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These Core Factor-promoter interfaces agree well with previous photo-crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bric et al., 2004</xref>) and Methidiumpropyl-EDTA·Fe(II) footprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bateman and Paule, 1988</xref>) experiments.</p><p>Pol I also contacts the upstream DNA near position −10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). At this location, the duplex DNA is sandwiched between the wall and the protrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This is distinct from Pol II Pre-Initiation Complex, in which the upstream promoter DNA is positioned above the Pol II cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murakami et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Plaschka et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, when Pol II enters the elongation state, the upstream duplex DNA shifts ~20 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernecky et al., 2016</xref>) to the same corresponding location as the upstream DNA in the Pol I Initial Transcribing Complex. This, together with the fact that upstream DNA is also stabilized by the A135 protrusion domain in Pol I Elongation Complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tafur et al., 2016</xref>), indicates that Pol I initiation complex is pre-conditioned in an elongation-competent state by Core Factor even at the initiation step.

State 1 shows a striking feature that the upstream DNA and Core Factor are rotated more toward the back of Pol I, projecting the DNA away from the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Compared to State1, the Core Factor/DNA complex is rotated ~10° toward the front of Pol I in State 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), allowing the upstream promoter to insert into the active site cleft, whereas the Core Factor/DNA complex resides at an intermediate location in State 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Because the contact point between Core Factor and Pol I is relatively small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), this degree of movement can be readily achieved. Indeed, examination of the Core Factor/Pol I interface shows that Core Factor and the upstream DNA pivot around the position where Rrn11 H8 interacts with the Pol I protrusion domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting Rrn11 H8 may be functionally important. Indeed, previous work has shown that removal of Rrn11 H7-8 results in a lethal growth phenotype, although Core Factor can still assemble, as would be expected for a Pol I interaction surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Knutson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Key structural elements in both Core Factor and Pol I are stabilized in distinct functional states. In State 2, the movement of Core Factor/DNA correlates well with the stabilization of Rrn7 zinc ribbon/linker on Pol I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This likely positions the Rrn7 linker region close to the single-stranded template DNA in the cleft, suggesting that the Rrn7 zinc ribbon/linker region might play a role similar to that of TFIIB during Pol II transcription initiation. Indeed, yeast extracts prepared from the strain lacking the zinc ribbon domain of Rrn7 (ΔZR) failed to support the open complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). In addition, the recombinant ΔZR Core Factor also failed to recover the defect in open complex formation in the ΔZR extract, whereas the wild type (WT) complex did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>). This data, together with the finding that Core Factor complex bearing the ΔZR Rrn7 can still be recruited to rDNA promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Knutson et al., 2014</xref>), indicates that the Rrn7 N-terminal region promotes transcription bubble opening, consistent with the State 2 structure. Intriguingly, in State 3, we observed strong density near the Pol I wall domain and the upstream promoter DNA corresponding to the A49 tandem winged helix (tWH) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In addition, the A49 linker connecting tWH to the A49/A34.5 dimerization domain was also resolved, which spans the active site cleft and contacts the coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Comparison of State 2 with State 3 reveals another striking feature in that there are clear clashes between the Rrn7 linker region and the A49 tandem winged helix domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This suggests that in addition to its function in transcription elongation, the A49 tandem winged helix domain could also play a role during initiation by displacing the Rrn7 zinc ribbon/linker region, thus opening the RNA exit channel and priming Pol I for promoter escape.</p><p>We also discovered a continuous movement of the Pol I clamp, which gradually closes up to 4 Å from State 1 to State 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). Importantly, the closing of the clamp correlates well with the stabilization of the A49 linker region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>) which likely leads to the stabilization of the tandem winged helix domain. This correlation suggests a role for the A49 linker in sensing the width of the active site cleft. In addition, at least three consecutive nucleotides of the non-template DNA at the downstream fork of the transcription bubble is also gradually stabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed subtle but distinct differences for the density of the template strand DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) correlated with this movement.</p><p>In summary, we observed that the position of Core Factor/DNA lobe correlates with the stabilization of key elements such as the Rrn7 zinc ribbon/linker, A49 tandem winged helix/linker, and Pol I clamp during transcription initiation, suggesting Pol I-specific initiation mechanisms which have not been observed from the Pol II system (see Discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Engagement of upstream promoter DNA with general transcription factors is an essential step during transcription initiation.

In this study, we have captured three functional states of the Pol I Initial Transcribing Complex for the first time, revealing a more dynamic picture of Pol I transcription initiation and its transition to an actively transcribing state.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Comparison between Pol I and Pol II Pre-Initiation Complexes</title><p>Comparison with the better characterized Pol II complexes suggests both shared as well as distinct mechanisms used by Pol I for transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). First, TFIIB-like factors are required for the transcription initiation of all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vannini and Cramer, 2012</xref>). Rrn7 is the Pol I-specific TFIIB-like factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Knutson and Hahn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Naidu et al., 2011</xref>). In our reconstruction of State 2, we observed the Rrn7 zinc ribbon domain residing in the RNA exit channel, similar to that of TFIIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), consistent with its functional conservation based on similarity at the level of domain architecture. However, the cyclin fold domains of Rrn7 are located at a more distal position relative to Pol I, different from that of TFIIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with this, the cyclin fold domains of Rrn7 are mainly involved in promoter DNA interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), lacking an essential interface with the polymerase compared to TFIIB. This function is somewhat replaced by the Rrn11 subunit of Core Factor. In addition, the N-terminal cyclin fold domain in TFIIB specifically recognizes the downstream BRE (TFIIB recognition element), forcing the DNA to take a completely different path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, the TFIIB-like factors play distinct roles in Pol I and Pol II systems.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27414.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Comparison of DNA trajectories among Pol I and Pol II Pre-Initiation Complex<bold>es</bold>.</title><p>Top-down views showing the DNA paths of Pol I Initial Transcribing Complex (ITC) in this study and Elongation Complex (EC) (<bold>A</bold>), Pol II Closed Complex (CC), Initial Transcribing Complex and Elongation Complex from previous studies (<bold>B</bold>), Pol I Initial Transcribing Complex and Pol II Initial Transcribing Complex in comparison (<bold>C</bold>).

Moreover, our Initial Transcribing Complex structures suggest a ratcheting movement of the upstream DNA induced by a flexible Core Factor-Pol I association. The positioning of the upstream promoter DNA in the Pol I Initial Transcribing Complex is fundamentally different from that in the Pol II Pre-Initiation Complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Although the upstream DNA in Pol II Elongation Complex occupies a similar location, it is positioned over the cleft in the Pol II Closed Complex (CC) and the Initial Transcribing Complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Transition from initiation to elongation for Pol II requires the ATP-dependent translocase activity of TFIIH to insert DNA from downstream into the active site cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fishburn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grünberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2000</xref>). However, TFIIH is not required for Pol I transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Assfalg et al., 2012</xref>), and no ATP hydrolysis activity has been associated with Pol I general transcription complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lofquist et al., 1993</xref>). Instead, we observed three functional states of the Pol I Initial Transcribing Complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which allowed us to propose a model shedding light on the mechanisms of Pol I transcription initiation in the absence of ATP-hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27414.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for Pol I transcription initiation.</title><p>Promoter bound Core Factor recruits Pol I/Rrn3, and loads DNA into the cleft of Pol I (<bold>A</bold>). At this stage, both Rrn7 N-terminal domain and A49 tandem winged helix domain are flexible. Pol I cleft is open to make room for loading of DNA. The intrinsic mobility of Core Factor upon Pol I engagement then ratchets upstream DNA against Rpb5. Promoter DNA melting occurs when Core Factor reaches a critical position where Rrn7 zinc ribbon/linker regions are stabilized on Pol I (1). This is likely a very transient state, allowing Pol I to recognize the initiation site in the template strand DNA and start synthesizing the RNA (<bold>B</bold>). Besides the well-accepted role for sensing the growing RNA length for its counterpart TFIIB in the Pol II PIC, Rrn7 likely plays an additional role in facilitating promoter opening by reaching into the RNA exit channel of Pol I and favoring the bending of DNA. During further translocation of Pol I along the promoter (2), the enzyme is acting more similarly as an elongation mode, with a more closed clamp. The gatekeeper linker helices in A49 between the dimerization and tandem winged helix domains presumably work as a ruler of the active site cleft, stabilizing upon clamp closing down while preventing escape of the downstream DNA (<bold>C</bold>). As RNA grows longer, the A49 tandem winged helix domain can also help displacing the Rrn7 zinc ribbon to clear the RNA exit channel. Subsequently, Pol I escapes the promoter and enters a processive elongation state (3). Pol I in its active, Rrn3 bound form is shown in gray, and Core Factor in green.

Our reasoning is as follows. First, we observed a gradual closing of the cleft from State 1 to State 3. This is in accordance with the findings that the Pol I cleft is in an open configuration when not bound to DNA as is observed in the apo crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Engel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fernández-Tornero et al., 2013</xref>), which contracts upon DNA engagement in Elongation Complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Neyer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tafur et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, State 1 with a slightly open cleft should correspond to the step right after the loading of the promoter DNA, whereas State 3 adopts a more closed cleft resembling the elongation mode. Second, in line with the movement of the clamp, the A49 tandem winged helix domain is only stabilized in State 3, along with the gatekeeper helices in the linker region spanning over the cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,F</xref>). Given the roles of A49 tandem winged helix domain during transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beckouet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geiger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pilsl et al., 2016</xref>), State 3 may reflect the initial transcribing state prior to promoter escape. Third, State 2 is an intermediate between State 1 and 3 in terms of clamp closing and tandem winged helix domain stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). Additionally, we observed stabilized zinc ribbon and linker regions of Rrn7, in a conformation similar to that of TFIIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, the Rrn7 zinc ribbon domain functions in transcription bubble opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, State 2 may represent the state of bubble opening, following promoter DNA insertion while preceding initial RNA synthesis. In summary, the three distinct functional states of the Pol I Initial Transcribing Complex revealed in a single sample provide a temporal view of the dynamic processes of Pol I transcription initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanisms of Pol I transcription initiation</title><p>To provide insight into the mechanisms of Pol I transcription initiation, we first generated a model for the Pol I Closed Complex. As stated above, State 1 likely represents a step immediately after promoter DNA insertion. Therefore, we modeled the Closed Complex based on our reconstruction in State 1 by extending the upstream DNA into the active site cleft of Pol I using B-form DNA. Interestingly, when the upstream DNA is extended into the cleft, no obvious clash between Pol I and DNA is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that this DNA path and position of Core Factor could represent that of a closed complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). In agreement with this, the Pol I cleft is in a slightly open configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), presumably accommodating the insertion of the promoter DNA. Thus, the promoter DNA is positioned closer to the Pol I active site than that in the Pol II Pre-Initiation Complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murakami et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Plaschka et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2015</xref>). Meanwhile, the Core Factor is brought closest to Pol I and thereby the downstream DNA is under the most tension by contacting Rpb5. Thus, the intrinsic mobility of Core Factor may constantly insert the duplex DNA toward the active site by applying a force against Rpb5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). When Core Factor reaches a critical position, the Rrn7 ZR/linker regions are stabilized on Pol I. This likely results in a spontaneous melting of DNA that is stabilized by the closing Pol I active site cleft and Rrn7 N-terminal region, followed by the stabilization of the downstream DNA by the clamp head and jaw domains of A190, the lobe domain of A135, and Rpb5, forming a stable open complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). This model is consistent with the finding that rDNA promoter opening only requires TIF-IB/CF and Pol I in <italic>Acanthamoeba castellanii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kahl et al., 2000</xref>). Next, Pol I initiates RNA synthesis, and the A49 tandem winged helix domain engages near the wall domain on Pol I, presumably stabilizing the upstream DNA. Meanwhile, the transcription bubble within the cleft can also be restricted by the A49 gatekeeper helices in the linker region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Intriguingly, the A49 tandem winged helix domain can also displace the Rrn7 zinc ribbon/linker to clear the RNA exit channel for subsequent RNA extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). When the nascent RNA extends to a certain length, Pol I escapes the promoter and enters elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Our model provides new insight into the mechanisms of promoter opening by Pol I that does not require the ATP-dependent translocase activity of TFIIH, but instead leverages the intrinsic mobility of Core Factor.</p><p>Taken together, we have determined the structure of Pol I transcription initiation complex at near-atomic resolution using single particle cryo-EM. The structure reveals the architecture of Core Factor binding to promoter DNA and that Pol I and promoter DNA are pre-conditioned in an elongation-competent form. We have also obtained three functional states of the Pol I Initial Transcribing Complex, which allows us to propose a molecular mechanism in which Pol I utilizes the intrinsic mobility of the DNA-bound Core Factor in the process of promoter opening. This model explains why TFIIH is not necessary for Pol I promoter opening, and implies that a similar mechanism could also be used by Pol III, the other TFIIH-independent RNA polymerase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Purification of yeast Pol I</title><p>Cells of yeast strain containing a 3× FLAG tag at the C-terminus of A135 were grown at 30°C in YPD (2% w/v glucose, 0.002% w/v adenine) to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0, and harvested by centrifugation.

Movie frames were aligned using MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) to correct for specimen motion. The anisotropic magnification distortion [distortion angle, 28.2°; minor axis scale factor, 0.987; major axis scale factor, 1.013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yu et al., 2016</xref>) was corrected on the average of the aligned frames using mag_distortion_correct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grant and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). The corrected average micrographs were used for data pre-processing within the Appion processing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lander et al., 2009</xref>). The CTF of each micrograph was estimated using Gctf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang, 2016</xref>). Particles were automatically selected from the aligned micrographs using the DoG particle picker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Voss et al., 2009</xref>). A total of 1,135,584 and 283,672 particles were picked for the complex assembled on the full and the truncated templates, respectively. All three-dimensional (3D) classification and refinement steps were performed within RELION 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kimanius et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>For the Initial Transcribing Complex assembled on the full template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the initial set of 1,135,584 particles was subjected to an initial 3D auto-refinement, using the negative stain reconstruction of the complex low-pass filtered to 30 Å as the initial reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Subsequently, a 3D classification was performed on the picked particles using the 3D auto-refined model low-pass filtered to 30 Å as the initial reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Two out of five classes in this classification, corresponding to 71,591 and 77,222 particles, were indicative of well-preserved complex with sharp structural features and were selected for further processing. These two classes were combined and then subjected to 3D auto-refinement and a second round of 3D classification within RELION. One out of the five classes in the second round classification was only corresponded to Pol I by itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Therefore, this class was removed and the remaining particles were further refined, resulting in a reconstruction of the Pol I Initial Transcribing Complexat an overall resolution of 3.8 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). All resolutions reported herein correspond to the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) using the 0.143 criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Henderson et al., 2012</xref>). Local resolution estimation indicated that the density for Core Factor was at lower resolution than Pol I, probably owing to conformational heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Subsequently, soft masks were applied around the Core Factor and Pol I density during further 3D refinement within RELION. This procedure resulted in an improved reconstruction of Core Factor and Pol I, with an overall resolution of 4.2 Å and 3.7 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). The reconstructions of classes 1–3 in the second round of classification showed distinct features. Therefore, they were separately refined, resulting in reconstructions at an overall resolution of 4.2 Å for State 1, 4.3 Å for State 2, and 3.9 Å for State 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>For the Pre-Initiation Complex assembled on the truncated scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), the 3D reconstruction was performed the same as above, except that only one round of 3D classification was conducted. This resulted in a reconstruction at an overall resolution of 6.9 Å after refinement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), using 43,843 particles.</p><p>The final density maps were automatically sharpened using the post-processing program within RELION and then filtered according to local resolution estimated within RELION 2.0. Volume segmentation, automatic rigid-body docking, figure and movie generation were performed using UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goddard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Cryo-EM density maps have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) under accession numbers EMD-8771 (full), EMD-8772 (Core Factor, local), EMD-8773 (Pol I, local), EMD-8774 (State 1), EMD-8775 (State 2), EMD-8776 (State 3), EMD-8777 (truncated construct). Model coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under accession numbers 5W5Y (full), 5W64 (State 1), 5W65 (State 2), 5W66 (State 3).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Model building and computational protocols</title><p>To build the structure of the Pol I Initial Transcribing Complex, we used the known crystal structures of yeast Pol I (PDB ID: 4C3I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fernández-Tornero et al., 2013</xref>) as a starting point. To model downstream DNA, the DNA-RNA hybrid structure from a previous model of the yeast Pol I Elongation Complex (PDB ID: 5M5X) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tafur et al., 2016</xref>) was fit into the density and modified to include the DNA bubble region. To model upstream DNA, we used UCSF Chimera to generate B-form DNA and rigid body fit into the density. The upstream DNA register was determined by using the density of the Pol I/Core Factor complex with a truncated DNA scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The A49 tandem winged helix domain of Pol I (PDB ID: 3NFI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geiger et al., 2010</xref>) was rigid-body fit into the EM density map corresponding to the core of Pol I (State 3). The linker between A49 tandem winged helix and A49/A34.5 dimerization domain was built based on the EM density and secondary structure prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamczak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buchan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To model the yeast Rrn6 WD40 domain, the X-ray structure for the N-terminal domain of the human proto-oncogene Nup214 (PDB ID: 2OIT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Napetschnig et al., 2007</xref>) was used as a template to construct the yeast WD40 structure. Residues 163–559, corresponding to the Rrn6 WD40, were aligned with Nup214/CAN residues 1–434 (PDB ID: 2OIT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Napetschnig et al., 2007</xref>), initially with the PROMALS3D multiple sequences and structure alignment server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pei et al., 2007</xref>), and then adjusted manually. We then employed density-guided homology modeling with RosettaCM to rebuild gaps in the sequence alignment and refine the entire structure. This approach relied on Rosetta's all-atom energy function augmented with an energy term to assess agreement to the experimental EM density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Song et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>With no known structural homologues for the Rrn6 C-terminal helical bundle (HB) domain, Rrn7 (two cyclin folds) and Rrn11 (TPR domain with N- and C-terminal unstructured regions), we employed the GeneSilico protein structure prediction server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kozlowski and Bujnicki, 2012</xref>) to predict the secondary structure and register the sequence (residues 570–777) in the density. We used Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) to construct the individual secondary-structure fragment to create a backbone only model by tracing the EM density. These secondary-structure fragments were then connected by manually extending the main-chain trace. The approximate orientations of residue side chains were built and manually inspected/corrected based on the electron density and secondary structure prediction. The N-terminal zinc ribbon domain of yeast TFIIB (PDB ID: 4BBR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sainsbury et al., 2013</xref>) was used as a template to build the N-terminal domain of Rrn7 and docked into a corresponding density region.</p><p>Subsequently, MDFF flexible fitting was applied to fit the initial model for core Pol to the density map while preserving the secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Trabuco et al., 2008</xref>). MDFF was followed up by the real-space refined against the respective maps using the Phenix package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2011</xref>). The refined models for the core Pol I and the Core Factor subunits (Rrn6, Rrn7 and Rrn11) were separately rigid-body fitted into the three states of the complexes and the models combined to assemble the full Pol I Initial Transcribing Complex models. Molecular graphics and analyses were performed with the UCSF Chimera package developed by the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco (supported by NIGMS P41-GM103311) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Jonathan Remis, Dr. Valorie Bowman, and Dr. Thomas Klose for assistance with microscope operation and data collection, Dr. Frank DiMaio and Brandon Frenz for assistance for initial model building, and Jason Pattie for computer support.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Seth A Darst (Reviewer #2); Georgios Skiniotis (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The editors and the reviewers find that there is much of value in the paper, but have also raised some serious questions that will have to be addressed before your manuscript can be considered further. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by He and colleagues reports the cryo-EM structure of yeast RNA polymerase I (Pol I) pre-initiation complex (PIC), which includes the Core Factor (CF) complex recognizing the upstream DNA promoter, at a nominal resolution of 3.8 Å. The authors also obtained a lower resolution cryo-EM reconstruction (6.9 Å) of PIC with a truncated scaffold DNA, enabling them to identify the register of the double stranded DNA in contact with CF. Further three-dimensional classification of the particle projections reveals three conformers (4.0-4.3 Å resolution) in the upstream DNA/CF region, which the authors rationalize as distinct functional states. Accordingly, the authors propose that the intrinsic mobility of CF plays a critical role in DNA melting, leading to transcription bubble opening. This model can explain why pol I, and perhaps pol III as well, do not require a TFIIH-like factor for this step. Overall the structures and potential insights are quite interesting. However, a number of important points must first be addressed regarding the precise phase of the transcription cycle that was trapped in the complexes visualized, as well as technical aspects of the structure determination.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to address the absence of Rrn3 from their structures and discuss the role of this initiation factor in binding to the open transcription bubble. The Introduction clearly outlines the requirement for Rrn3 during initiation, and the Materials and methods section states that this protein was added in 5-fold excess in the preparation of complexes for structural studies. However, there is no further mention of Rrn3 in the manuscript, with the exception of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> legend. The reconstituted complex is active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), so Rrn3 is presumably present at that point. If there is evidence that Rrn3 dissociates once the transcription bubble is opened, the authors should comment on that in the context of their structural analysis. A biochemical analysis of cross-linked samples, such as gel filtration/SDS PAGE or protein identification by mass spec., would address whether Rrn3 is present in complexes on the grid. The authors should also address the possibility that the subset of particles they used in reconstructions lacked Rrn3, where as some of the ~90% of particles that were excluded might contain Rrn3. Whatever the outcome, the role and fate of Rrn3 need to be explicitly addressed.</p><p>2) Given that the initiation factor, Rrn3, is missing and the polymerase complexes are formed on a bubble template with an RNA primer, it seems inaccurate to describe them as pre-initiation complexes (PICs). Without further justification, this raises questions about conclusions about the mechanisms of DNA unwinding. The Discussion and title should be revised to address more accurately the point in the transcription cycle captured by these structures.</p><p>3) The three conformations captured in the analysis represent a small subset of the different particles and conformations in the data set. The authors should provide evidence (either in the form of new experiments or citations of published observations, mutant studies) that support the functional relevance of these conformations.</p><p>4) Euler angle distributions of particle projections should be presented for each reconstruction.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Structural mechanism of ATP-independent transcription initiation by RNA polymerase I&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor and one reviewer.</p><p>Your manuscript is now, in principle, acceptable for publication, but the editors require one small change to be made. In subsection “Molecular structure of CF” of the revised manuscript, the following statement is made:</p><p>&quot;This highlights the strength of the cryo-EM approach in determining the structure of macromolecular assemblies as only a fraction of the material was required and yielded only slightly lower overall resolution (4.2 Å for cryo-EM versus 3.2 Å for crystallography).&quot;</p><p>This paragraph appears to have been inserted during revision. The editors find it to be misleading, since (in an objective sense) 3.2 Å is much better than 4.2 Å, because the transition from one to the other involves a critical ability to resolve molecular features. The purpose of this new paragraph, it seems, is to highlight their paper with respect to the Cramer paper. The editors do not think that this is necessary, and in any case, disagree with this statement. Just in the next paragraph or two, the authors say &quot;The resolution of our reconstruction of CF at 4.2 Å hinders us from confidently resolving the register of the upstream promoter sequence.&quot;</p><p>The paper can be accepted once this paragraph is removed. Note that this is not optional, but that no further editorial input is necessary, and editorial staff can make the decision to proceed.</p><p>The authors should also consider an issue that the editors wish to bring to their attention. The main text of the manuscript remains very difficult for the general reader (as opposed to the transcription specialist) to understand and follow. The principal reason for this is the excessive use of acronyms. Acronyms were particularly useful when journal articles were subject to severe space constraints, but <italic>eLife</italic> is not subject to such constraints. Why not say &quot;Core Factor&quot; everywhere, instead of CF? Why not say &quot;General Transcription Factors&quot; instead of GTF, or Initial Transcribing Complex instead of ITC? The latter acronym is particularly confusing. Connected to this issue is the fact that the labels associated with the structural figures are minimal. More, and clearer, labels would increase the impact of the figures. If these issues are improved, we believe the paper will be more accessible to the general reader, and possibly have more impact.</p><p>Editing the paper to address these issues of clarity is optional. The authors may wish to take a day or two to do this, or may have the PDF posted online and then edit the version of the paper that will be typeset for final publication. Either way, no further input from the editors is required. Please consult with editorial staff regarding this matter.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27414.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors need to address the absence of Rrn3 from their structures and discuss the role of this initiation factor in binding to the open transcription bubble.

Whatever the outcome, the role and fate of Rrn3 need to be explicitly addressed.</italic> </p><p>We agree that Rrn3 plays an essential role during Pol I transcription initiation as stated in the Introduction section as well as the in vitro transcription assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>. Although we included both Rrn3 and TBP in our assembly reactions, we did not observe densities in any of the classified reconstruction that could correspond to these two factors. As suggested by the reviewers, we repeated our reaction and monitored all fractions by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, which has been included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>. We observed on this gel that all of Rrn3 protein was in the unbound and the first wash fractions. In agreement with our structural studies, we did not observe a detectable band for Rrn3 on the gel in our elution fraction. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that Rrn3 was present at a substoichiometric level that is below the detection limit of silver staining. Alternatively, we cannot rule out the possibility that Rrn3 associates with Pol I in the unbound fraction that somehow failed to engage the nucleic acid template. Nevertheless, our data suggests that Rrn3 does not stably associate with the rest of Pol I initiation machinery under our experimental conditions, even though it is required for the activity of Pol I. Indeed, protocols involving incubation of Pol I over extended long period of time in the presence of excess recombinant Rrn3 have to be used in order to generate stable complex for structural studies (Blattner et al., 2011; Engel et al., 2016). Interestingly, we also observed a band that could result from TBP non-specifically binding to the DNA template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>As stated in the Introduction section, Rrn3 has been shown to disrupt the inactive dimeric form of Pol I in various reports (Blattner et al., 2011; Engel et al., 2016; Pilsl et al., 2016; Torreira et al., 2017). In addition, previous studies have also suggested that Rrn3 dissociates from Pol I after transcription initiation (Bier et al., 2004; Hirschler-Laszkiewicz et al., 2003; Milkereit and Tschochner, 1998). Paule and colleagues also reported that <italic>Acanthamoeba castellani</italic> rDNA promoter opening only requires TIF-IB (CF homolog) and Pol I (Kahl et al., 2000). Based on these published data and our observation, we speculate that Rrn3 functions at an earlier step during Pol I transcription initiation, where it stabilizes Pol I in an active monomeric form and helps recruiting Pol I to rDNA promoter. In a separate paper, Reeder and colleagues reported that Pol I can be recruited to the promoter in the absence of Rrn3, however this complex is inactive (Aprikian et al., 2001). This suggests that Rrn3 may also function post Pol I recruitment. This is also consistent with our structural study, as we included an RNA molecule in our open template, which may have resulted in bypassing the requirement for Rrn3 after the engagement of Pol I with the nucleic acid scaffold.</p><p>We have included a paragraph in the Results section describing all of the above.</p><p><italic>2) Given that the initiation factor, Rrn3, is missing and the polymerase complexes are formed on a bubble template with an RNA primer, it seems inaccurate to describe them as pre-initiation complexes (PICs). Without further justification, this raises questions about conclusions about the mechanisms of DNA unwinding. The Discussion and title should be revised to address more accurately the point in the transcription cycle captured by these structures.</italic> </p><p>We agree that our usage of PIC may be confusing to the readers, especially the nucleic acid scaffold we used contains an artificial transcription bubble. In order to more accurately reflect the nature of our complex, we have revised our title to “Structural mechanism of ATP-independent transcription initiation by RNA polymerase I”, and changed the name of our complex to “initial transcribing complex (ITC)” throughout the manuscript where appropriate. We have also deleted the “CC model” and “OC model” for State 1 and State 2 in the descriptions of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and its supplements.</p><p>We view the process of Pol I transcription initiation as a highly dynamic one. We believe that by using a bubble scaffold, we have bypassed the most dynamic process (from closed complex formation to bubble opening), while trapping the complex in a more stable ITC state. Nevertheless, the ITC structure still exhibits a high degree of flexibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In State 1, we observed that the upstream DNA trajectory was rotated the furthest away from the active site of Pol I. This also correlates with a wider cleft and the absence of the Rrn7 ZR domain or the A49 tWH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and D</xref>). We speculate that in our State 1 structure, the position of CF and upstream DNA, and the conformation of Pol I might reflect those immediately after promoter DNA loading in a closed complex (CC). In line with this hypothesis, extending the upstream DNA using a B-type duplex DNA resulted in no clash to Pol I with a wide cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we modeled the CC based on these features in our State 1 structure. To further justify this, we attempted the assembly of the complex on a closed duplex DNA scaffold, and were able to obtain a low resolution reconstruction from a negative staining dataset (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>). The overall architecture of the CC is similar to that of the ITC, even though the distinct views are more scarce and occupancy of CF is much lower. This is presumably due to the flexibility of the closed complex. Alternatively, because we cannot see DNA molecule in the negative stain reconstruction, we cannot rule out the possibility that the reconstructed complex is actually an open complex, similar to what has been observed for the yeast Pol II CC, in which the closed DNA template was melted spontaneously by engaging the initiation complex (Plaschka et al., 2016). Nevertheless, this new piece of data highlights the flexible nature of the Pol I initiation complex on a closed DNA template, and supports our modeling of the CC based on the State 1 structure.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27414.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27414.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27414.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27414-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>In State 2, the upstream DNA trajectory was rotated closest to the active site of Pol I among the three states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Meanwhile, we also observed the stabilization of the Rrn7 ZR and linker regions. In addition, we performed an open complex assay, in which we demonstrated that Rrn7 ZR clearly functions in transcription bubble opening (see response to Comment #3 for details). This new data, together with our structural analysis, gives us more confidence that our State 2 structure truly mimics an open complex (OC). In State 3, we observed the stabilization of the A49 tWH domain and the gatekeeper helices spanning over the closed Pol I cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and F</xref>). Given the role A49 tWH domain plays in transcription elongation (Beckouet et al., 2008; Geiger et al., 2010; Pilsl et al., 2016), as well as the observation that the active site cleft is in a closed state similar to that in the elongation complex, we believe that the State 3 structure reflects the bona fide initial transcribing state, prior to promoter escape.</p><p><italic>3) The three conformations captured in the analysis represent a small subset of the different particles and conformations in the data set. The authors should provide evidence (either in the form of new experiments or citations of published observations, mutant studies) that support the functional relevance of these conformations.</italic> </p><p>We agree that additional experiments in support of our structural analysis will significantly improve this manuscript. To further test the hypothesis that the Rrn7 ZR domain potentially functions in promoter opening, we performed an open complex assay. We have included this data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, updated the corresponding text in the Results section (subsection “Three functional states reveal conformational changes in Pol I ITC during transcription initiation “paragraph three), and inserted the experimental procedure in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Open complex assays”). Here, we will only briefly describe our finding. We used potassium permanganate to probe for the formation of transcription bubbles around the transcription start site. In one set of experiments, extract prepared from yeast strains bearing mutation in the Rrn7 N-terminus (deletion of the ZR domain) failed to form a transcription bubble. In another set of reactions, WT recombinant CF rescued the defect in the ZR deletion extract, whereas recombinant CF complexes with ZR deleted Rrn7 failed to do so. This data, together with previous finding that ZR deleted Rrn7 can still be recruited to rDNA promoter (Knutson et al., 2014), suggests that the Rrn7 N-terminal region promotes transcription bubble opening, in support of our State 2 as a OC mimic.</p><p><italic>4) Euler angle distributions of particle projections should be presented for each reconstruction.</italic> </p><p>We have included the figures for the Euler angle distribution for each reconstruction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> as suggested.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Your manuscript is now, in principle, acceptable for publication, but the editors require one small change to be made.
