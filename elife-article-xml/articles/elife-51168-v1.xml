body height and dementia and explored the impact of intelligence level, educational attainment, early life environment and familial factors. A total of 666,333 men, 70,608 brothers, and 7388 twin brothers born 1939–1959 and examined at the conscript board were followed in Danish nationwide registers (1969–2016). Cox regression models were applied to analyze the association between body height and dementia. Within-brothers and within-twin pair analyses were conducted to explore the role of shared familial factors including partly shared genetics. In total, 10,599 men were diagnosed with dementia. The association between one z-score difference in body height and dementia (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.89;0.90) was inverse and weakened slightly after adjustment for intelligence test scores and educational level. The associations persisted in within-brother analysis and revealed a stronger, but less precise, point estimate than the cohort analysis of brothers. The twin analysis showed similar, but imprecise estimates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dementia</kwd><kwd>body height</kwd><kwd>cognitive reserve</kwd><kwd>cohort study</kwd><kwd>sibling design</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008392</institution-id><institution>Danish Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>09-063599</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Osler</surname><given-names>Merere</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007214</institution-id><institution>Velux Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christensen</surname><given-names>Kaare</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010809</institution-id><institution>Jascha Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okholm</surname><given-names>Gunhild Tidemann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008269</institution-id><institution>Læge Sophus Carl Emil Friis og hustru Olga Doris Friis' Legat</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Osler</surname><given-names>Merere</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004785</institution-id><institution>NordForsk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The Social Inequality in Ageing project (74637)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jørgensen</surname><given-names>Terese Sara Høj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008392</institution-id><institution>Danish Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>09-069151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Osler</surname><given-names>Merere</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000724</institution-id><institution>Health Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17-B-0033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Osler</surname><given-names>Merere</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Taller body height in young adulthood, as marker of early-life environment, is associated with lower risk of dementia diagnosis independently of cognitive reserve and family factors shared among brothers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dementia poses substantial challenges for individuals and societies worldwide. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Livingston et al., 2017</xref>) This has motivated studies of potential predictors and risk factors for dementia in recent years. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Livingston et al., 2017</xref>) Development of dementia may be a result of both genetics and environmental exposures operating throughout the life course. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borenstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bird, 2005</xref>) A newly published meta-analysis and systematic review showed that the risk of dementia may already be established early in life. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) Body height has a strong genetic component and is at the same time influenced by environmental factors such as childhood diseases and nutrition. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jelenkovic et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jelenkovic et al., 2016b</xref>) Short height has been linked to development of dementia in a number of smaller studies (N = 203–3,734) and to dementia as cause of death in a large study pooling 18 prospective cohorts (N = 181,800). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Russ et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Petot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gatz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beeri et al., 2005</xref>) Body growth may be related to dementia as an indicator of brain and cognitive reserve and corresponding individual differences in the brain structure, which could imply differences in individual resilience toward development of dementia. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) Another possible explanation of the height-dementia association is the correlation between body height and level of growth hormone that through hippocampal function and cognition has been linked to the risk of developing dementia. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borenstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beeri et al., 2005</xref>) Thus, rather than being a risk factor in itself, short body height is likely an indicator of harmful exposures early in life. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Russ et al., 2014</xref>) However, large scale high-quality longitudinal studies exploring the impact of early environmental factors and genetics to explain the link between body height and dementia are needed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borenstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Russ et al., 2014</xref>) Previous studies question whether body height and dementia are solely linked by brain and cognitive reserve measured by intelligence and socioeconomic factors, or by shared underlying familial factors including genetics that may influence both body height and dementia. In this study, we examined whether body height in young adult men is associated with diagnosis of dementia while exploring whether intelligence test score, educational level, and underlying environmental and genetic factors shared by brothers explain the relationship.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> presents the selection of the three study populations; 1) men (N = 666,333), 2) brothers (N = 70,608), and 3) twins (N = 7,388).

The relationship attenuated, but persisted after adjustments for educational level and intelligence test scores. Within-brother analysis confirmed the findings of a relationship between taller body height and lower risk of dementia diagnosis, and even revealed a stronger, but less precise, point estimate of the association than the cohort analysis of brothers. The findings from the within-twin analyses were in the same direction, but with more uncertainty. These findings support that the relationship between body height and dementia is not explained by shared genetics and exposures to other familial factors shared between brothers.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study has a number of strengths. It is based on a very large unselected population followed from early adulthood until a maximum age of 57–77 years for dementia diagnoses. This study design is very important as previous findings may have underestimated the relationship due to selection of the healthiest part of the population, who are willing to participate, and have survived into this age. It is also a great advantage that we were able to investigate associations between body height and dementia adjusted for intelligence test scores and educational level. Intelligence together with educational level have been shown to be strong markers of cognitive reserve, which are hypothesized to be highly predictive of the age at which dementia is manifested and diagnosed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borenstein et al., 2006</xref>) We further included objective measures of body height rather than self-reported height with its implicit reporting errors. In the same line, this study included measures of body height from early adulthood, whereas previous studies have used measures from mid- and late-life. This could imply a bias because declining height since young adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cline et al., 1989</xref>) has been found to be more pronounced in socioeconomic dis-advantaged groups and those with lower later-life cognitive function. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2013</xref>) Further, underdiagnoses of dementia has in some countries been shown to be greater in socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lang et al., 2017</xref>) A final strength is that we were able to investigate the impact of familial factors, including various degrees of shared genetics and environmental factors, by conducting within-brother and twin-pair analyses.</p><p>We acknowledge the limitations of the study. A potential concern is that even though dementia diagnoses in the Danish National Patient Register is likely to be correct, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Phung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Salem et al., 2013</xref>) under-diagnosis is possible. The registers and identifications to define dementia change over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and this difference in coverage could lead to differences in diagnostic validity and completeness at different time points during follow-up. However, we believe this is a minor issue as a previous study of data from the the Danish Conscription Database (DCD), which investigated the relationship between cognitive ability and dementia, only found small differences in risk estimates when using international classification of disease (ICD) version eight and ICD10 codes, respectively, to identify dementia. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Osler et al., 2017</xref>) Furthermore, the introduction of the Danish Prescription Registry on January 1<sup>st</sup>1995 has enabled identification of dementia patients who are not in contact with the secondary healthcare system for their dementia diagnosis, but who receive medication through their general practitioner. This has most likely improved the sensitivity of the dementia diagnoses from 1995. Our sensitivity analyses showed comparable findings of the relationship between body height and dementia before and after the introduction, yet the comparison of these results were limited by including men in different age-groups (&lt;1995: maximum age of 36–56 and ≥1995: maximum age of 57–77). Another issue is that the recorded diagnosis of dementia has been shown to be less valid in younger populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Phung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Salem et al., 2013</xref>) and our model tests indicated that the HRs were slightly less pronounced at higher ages. We therefore conducted analyses where follow-up time was split at age less than 60 years and 60 years and older. The analyses of both age-groups showed associations between taller body height and lower risk of dementia, but the point estimate was slightly stronger in the younger population. This may partly be explained by the less valid symptom profile in these patients and misdiagnoses of psychiatric or neurological conditions for dementia. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Salem et al., 2013</xref>) Also, the findings may not be generalizable to men aged above 77 years as the study population only reached a maximum age of 57–77 years during the follow-up period. Furthermore, the role of familial factors were not fully explored. The analyses of brothers were incomplete by 73.5% of the population being from the birth cohorts 1953–59 and by being restricted to brothers with known shared mothers, implying a mixture of twin brothers, full non-twin brothers and maternal half-brothers, but without paternal half-brothers. The specific contribution of genetic factors, independent of environmental factors, cannot be assessed by twin-pair analyses without distinction between mono- and dizygotic twins. Finally, the generalizability of the findings to women is questionable. Previous findings on potential gender differences in the relationship between body height and dementia or poor cognition in old age are inconclusive, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Petot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">West et al., 2015</xref>) but the incidence and prevalence of dementia are found to be lower in men than in women. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Matthews et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Findings in light of previous studies</title><p>The findings of this current study provide substantial support to previous evidence of a link between body height and dementia.

Intelligence level has been suggested to be a stronger marker of brain and cognitive reserve than educational level. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borenstein et al., 2006</xref>) Intelligence level is furthermore correlated with body height (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christensen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beauchamp et al., 2011</xref>) and by itself associated with dementia. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Osler et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to previous studies, we also investigated the impact of other potential early-life familial factors including genetics and socioeconomic resources in the family that may influence both body height and later risk of dementia. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) Body height has been shown to have a strong genetic component with around 80% of the variation in populations being explained by genetic differences between individuals. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jelenkovic et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lango Allen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">McEvoy and Visscher, 2009</xref>) The genetic component of height has furthermore been found to be consistent across countries independent of living standards. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jelenkovic et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we found that the estimate for the relationship between body height and dementia was stronger in the within-pair analysis than in the cohort analysis of brothers. The genetic and environmental variation influencing body height, but not risk of dementia, is smaller within brothers than between men in general, which may weaken the association between body height and dementia in the latter compared to the former group. Through this mechanism, the finding of a stronger association within brothers may be explained by less dilution of the effects of different harmful exposures early in life influencing both body growth and risk of dementia. These findings furthermore suggests that genetics has a minor role in the association of body height and dementia. However, it is important to acknowledge that the within-brother analysis was subject to greater uncertainty shown by a wider confidence interval. One previous Swedish study applied a twin design including 106 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for dementia, which indicated that the twin with the shortest height also more often was the one who developed dementia, supporting our interpretation, but the association provided insignificant estimates. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gatz et al., 2006</xref>) Two of the previous studies, which had adjusted for APOE genotype, being the strongest single genetic marker related to development of dementia, also supported that conclusion. In more detail, one of the studies detected an association between body height and dementia, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Petot et al., 2007</xref>) and the other study, examining length of extremities and dementia, found an association to arm length in both women and men, but only an association to knee height (i.e. distance from foot sole to the anterior surface of the thigh of the lower leg) in women. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, taller body height at the entry to adulthood, supposed to be a marker of early-life environment, is associated with lower risk of dementia diagnosis later in life. The association persisted when adjusted for educational level and intelligence test scores in young adulthood, suggesting that height is not just acting as an indicator of cognitive reserve. Within-brother analysis confirms the findings of a relationship between taller height and lower risk of dementia diagnosis, and suggest that the association may have common roots in early life environmental exposures that are not related to family factors shared among brothers. This is supported in within-twin analysis, although the finding was imprecisely estimated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was based on the DCD, which, in brief, holds information registered at mandatory Danish conscription examinations in the years 1957 to 1984 for men born from 1939 through 1959 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christensen et al., 2015</xref>). All Danish men are requested by law to appear before the conscript board for a physical and mental examination between the ages of 18 and 26 years. We linked the data with the Danish Twin Register, the Danish Civil Registration System, the Danish National Patient Registry, the Danish Psychiatric Central Register, and the Danish National Prescription Register.

Brothers and twins were identified by two different approaches. Brothers were identified from the population through maternal linkage in the Danish Civil Registration System and 73.5% were from the birth-cohorts 1953–1959, where the linkage between mothers and offspring is complete in the register. The coverage vary between birth cohorts because the linkage between parents and offspring was based on shared residency in 1968 where the Danish Civil Registration System was established. After 1968, the linkage was carried out at the time of birth. Please see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> for number of brother included from each birth cohort (1939–1959). Brothers were defined broadly by including all men with the same identified mother that is full-brothers, half-brothers, adopted brothers, and twins, triplets etc. Thus, the sample of brothers also include twins from these birth cohorts as they are registered with the same mother. However, for the twin population, twin pairs in all the birth cohorts 1939–1959 were identified by linking the DCD to the Danish Twin Register. The project was evaluated and approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency: Jr nr 2014-41-2911. According to Danish law, ethical approval is not required for purely register-based studies.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Main variables</title><p>Body height at entry to adulthood was included as the main exposure in this study.

The z-scores were investigated as a continuous variable.</p><p>Dementia diagnosis was measured by in- and out-patient contacts with ICD8 and ICD10 codes (ICD8: 290.00–290.99 and ICD10: F00.0-F03.9; G30.0-G30.9) in the Danish Psychiatric Central Register, since 1969, and in the Danish National Patient Registry since 1977. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mors et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lynge et al., 2011</xref>) Dementia diagnosis was furthermore identified by redeemed prescriptions of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor registered by Anatomic Therapeutical Chemical (ATC) codes (N06D) in the Danish National Prescription Registry since 1995.

The dementia diagnoses in the Danish hospital registers have been shown to have a positive predictive value of 70% and 83% in two different randomly selected populations of 200 individual with dementia recorded in the register. The values vary between the two studies because of age differences in the study populations, the lowest positive predictive value was detected for the population with the youngest age group.

For men with a conscript board examination date before January 1<sup>st</sup> 1969, age at this date was used as baseline. In contrast, men examined after January 1<sup>st</sup> 1969 had baseline at the age of their conscript board examination. The mean age was 22.1 years at baseline due to the delayed entry for some of the men. Men were included in the statistical analyses at baseline and followed until diagnosis of dementia, emigration, death, or end of follow-up (April 30<sup>th</sup> 2016) that is to a maximum age of 57–77 years. Age was the underlying time scale of the model. Model assumptions of time-constant HRs were tested by Schoenfeld residuals for continuous variables and log-minus-log curves for categorical variables. The model assumption was fulfilled for all variables. However, there was a tendency that the association between body height and dementia was stronger in the younger age groups, thus, a supplementary analyses with follow-up split at 1) age &lt;60 years and 2) age ≥60 years were conducted to quantify this potential difference in the association between body height and dementia diagnosis before and after age 60 years. Sensitivity analysis of the association 1) before 1995 (dementia diagnosis identified by ICD8 codes) and 2) 1995 and thereafter (dementia diagnosis identified by ATC codes and ICD10 codes) was performed.</p><p>To investigate the impact of adjustments for intelligence test scores and educational level as important explanatory factors, the analyses of the total population of men were conducted in four steps by Model 1 adjusted for conscript board examination district, Model 2a-b further adjusted for either educational level or intelligence test scores and finally, Model 3 further adjusted for both educational level and intelligence test scores. All the analyses were stratified by birth cohort to account for potential birth cohort effects and included a cluster term to account for the interdependence of observations between brothers. Finally, all models were by default adjusted for age as the underlying scale of the statistical models. Body height was also explored as restricted cubic splines with four knots equally distributed over the range of the z-score variable. The knots were identified at z-scores of −1.63,–0.40, 0.36 and 1.65 with 0 as the reference.</p><p>To explore the role of shared familial factors including environmental factors and partly shared genetics for the association between body height and dementia diagnosis, sibling populations (brothers and twins) were analyzed in a Model 3 standard cohort analyses and within-brother/twin pair analyses. In the cohort analyses each brother and twin was treated as an individual and a cluster term was included to account for the interdependence of observations. The within-pair analyses were stratified by a variable identifying the brother/twin pair cluster to make comparisons within groups of brothers and twin pairs.

In the current study, the authors explore the association between body height and dementia. They use Danish national registers to obtain data from the conscript board, including height, intelligence, and educational attainment, matched with data from health registers to identify those with dementia diagnoses or who were taking medication typically prescribed for Alzheimer's disease. Their results showed that taller body height was associated with significantly lower rate of dementia after adjusting for a series of confounders. In addition, they attempted to distinguish this protective effect of body height from confounding by genetics – a strong determinant of height – through analysis of within siblings and within twin differences. This study represents a potentially valuable contribution to the literature on early life risk factors for dementia. However, there are a few substantive concerns.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors underplay the importance of the analyses of siblings and twins. If height is a risk factor in intrapair analyses of siblings and twins, and comparable in magnitude to a standard cohort analysis, then it is strong evidence that the explanation for the association between height and dementia is something other than shared genes or shared rearing environment. Indeed, one of the main concerns raised by the reviewers is the adjustment for genetics with the within-twin pair analyses. The point estimate for within-twin pairs is similar to the point estimate for unrelated individuals. In the larger sample of unrelated individuals (Table 1), the confidence intervals (CI) are below 1.0, whereas the CI include 1.0 in both the cohort analysis and the twin analysis in Table 3. This likely is a reflection of the smaller N. This may, moreover, suggest that adjusting for genetics does not explain the association between body height and dementia. The authors don't reach this conclusion. In the Discussion, they state &quot;These findings support a relationship between body height and dementia independent of the genetic relationship and of exposures to other shared early-life familial factors.&quot; The authors should elaborate on this interpretation, revisiting their reasoning so as to clarify the argument.</p><p>A second issue of concern raised is the definition of what constitutes tall height. The reviewers were concerned with the meaningful clinical interpretation of the results. They should be wary of the ability of a large study such as this to detect differences, which may not be meaningful. Even without considering the role of genetics, and taking at face value the results of the 'fully adjusted' model (Model 3) that shows a 10% reduction in dementia risk for every one z-score increase in height, how clinically meaningful is this reduction? Since your z-score is defined as how far you are from the average in a group, in the real-world, how tall should a person be to start getting any 'meaningful' protective effect from what is being reported? Clinical pertinence should be considered.</p><p>The authors discuss the limitations of obtaining dementia diagnoses from patient registers. However, they do not address the introduction of the national prescription register in 1995 and how that might affect sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in identifying dementia cases.</p><p>The authors include birth cohort in the analyses and compare results dividing at age 60. They do not, however, address the fact that participants were aged 57 to 77 at the latest date for register dementia diagnoses, so that a large proportion are younger than average age of onset for dementia. Prevalence of dementia is quite low, which likely reflects both cases missed by registers and the age structure of the study population.</p><p>Not until the detailed methods is it learned that brothers were from 1953-1959 birth cohorts, making them age 57 – 63 as of the latest date of matching to dementia diagnoses. (The text states that the brothers were &quot;mainly&quot; from 1953-1959, so it's a bit ambiguous.) If the brothers are from 1953-1959 birth cohorts, it is not surprising that rate of dementia cases is lower for brothers than for the full population or for the twins. It seems possible that the difference in age structure might also contribute to the observation that the point estimate for the association between body height and dementia is greater in the twin pair analyses than in the analyses of brothers. It would also make the observation less interesting. This difference in birth cohorts is essential to note because, otherwise, the assumption would be that the sample of brothers contains all twin pairs in the sample of twins, since twins are also siblings.</p><p>It would be of interest to describe the mean and distribution of intrapair difference in height in centimeters (cm).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51168.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors underplay the importance of the analyses of siblings and twins.

We furthermore agree that the brother analyses indicate that genetics and shared environment between brothers do not explain the relationship between body height and dementia and that the findings from the twin analyses may be subject to power issues causing imprecise estimates with wider confidence intervals including 1.0 (reference value).</p><p>In the following, we have included the paragraphs from the manuscript where we elaborate on the results from the brother and twin analyses. We have rewritten some of these paragraphs from the previous version of the manuscript to emphasize the importance of these findings:</p><p>In the Abstract: “The associations persisted in within-brother analysis and revealed a stronger, but less precise, point estimate than the cohort analysis of brothers. The twin analysis showed similar, but imprecise estimates.”</p><p>In the Results: “The analyses of Model 3 showed that the within-pair analysis of brothers revealed a stronger, but less precise, point estimate than the cohort analysis of brothers (Table 3). For twins, the comparison of the cohort analysis of twins and the within-pair analysis of twins revealed a pattern similar to that found for brothers. Yet, the pattern was less clear and the HRs were imprecisely estimated possibly due to a lower number of individuals in these analyses (N=7,388) (Table 3).”</p><p>In the Discussion:</p><p>· “Within-brother analysis confirmed the findings of a relationship between taller body height and lower risk of dementia diagnosis, and even revealed a stronger, but less precise, point estimate of the association than the cohort analyses of brothers. The findings from the within-twin analyses were in the same direction, but with more uncertainty. These findings support that the relationship between body height and dementia is not explained by shared genetics and exposures to other familial factors shared between brothers.”</p><p>· “A final strength is that we were able to investigate the impact of familial factors, including various degrees of shared genetic and environmental factors, by conducting within-brother and twin-pair analyses.”</p><p>· “Interestingly, we found that the estimate for the relationship between body height and dementia was stronger in the within-pair analysis than in the cohort analysis of brothers. The genetic and environmental variation influencing body height, but not risk of dementia, is smaller within brothers than between men in general, which may weaken the association between body height and dementia in the latter compared to the former group. Through this mechanism, the finding of a stronger association within brothers may be explained by less dilution of the effects of different harmful exposures early in life influencing both body growth and risk of dementia. These findings furthermore suggests that genetics has a minor role in the association of body height and dementia.”</p><p>· “Within-brother analysis confirms the findings of a relationship between taller height and lower risk of dementia diagnosis, and suggest that the association may have common roots in early life environmental exposures that are not related to family factors shared among brothers. This is supported in within-twin analysis, although the finding was imprecisely estimated.”</p><p>However, we believe it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the brother and twin analyses. We have therefor kept the following paragraphs in the manuscript:</p><p>In the Discussion:</p><p>· “Furthermore, the role of familial factors were not fully explored. The analyses of brothers were incomplete by 73.5% of the population being from the birth cohorts 1953-59 and by being restricted to men with known shared mothers, implying a mixture of twin brothers, full non-twin brothers and maternal half-brothers, but without paternal half-brothers. The specific contribution of genetic factors, independent of environmental factors, cannot be assessed by twin-pair analyses without distinction between mono- and dizygotic twins.”</p><p>· “…However, it is important to acknowledge that the within-brother analysis was subject to greater uncertainty shown by a wider confidence interval”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second issue of concern raised is the definition of what constitutes tall height.

To be subject to a 10% lower dementia risk, a man born in 1939 should be 6.5 cm (one z-score) taller than the mean height of 175.0 cm, i.e. 181.5 cm. For the birth cohort 1959, the corresponding values are 6.5 cm (one z-score) taller than mean height of 179.1 cm, i.e. 185.6 cm.</p><p>We have provided these calculations in the Results section: “Supplementary file 2 shows that the mean heights range from 174.5 to 179.1 cm and the z-scores range from 6.4 to 6.6 cm for the birth cohorts in the total population without any clear patterns of change over time. The finding of 10% lower HR with one z-score higher body height suggests that men born in 1939 with a body height of 181.5 cm (equal to one z-score taller than the mean) can expect a 10% lower dementia risk compared with men with the mean body height (175.0 cm). The corresponding body height for the latest birth cohort (1959) is 185.6 cm compared to the mean body height of 179.1 cm.”</p><p>To make these calculations transparent, we have included the mean body heights in addition to the z-scores for each birth cohort in Supplementary file 2 for the full population, brothers and twins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors discuss the limitations of obtaining dementia diagnoses from patient registers. However, they do not address the introduction of the national prescription register in 1995 and how that might affect sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in identifying dementia cases.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for making us aware of this. We have now explored the relationship between body height and dementia before and after the introduction of the National Prescription Register that enabled identification of dementia diagnoses with ATC codes from January 1<sup>st</sup> 1995. This is described in the following paragraphs in the manuscript:</p><p>In the Materials and methods section: “Sensitivity analysis of the association 1) before 1995 (dementia diagnosis identified by ICD-8 codes) and 2) 1995 and thereafter (dementia diagnosis identified by ATC codes and ICD-10 codes) was performed.”</p><p>In the Results section: “Analyses of Model 3 with the follow-up period divided in 1) prior to 1995 and 2) 1995 and thereafter showed that the association between one z-score taller body height and dementia was comparable between the two periods (Supplementary file 4).”</p><p>In the Discussion: “Furthermore, the introduction of the Danish Prescription Registry on January 1<sup>st</sup> 1995 has enabled identification of dementia patients who are not in contact with the secondary healthcare system for their dementia diagnosis, but who receive medication through their general practitioner. This has most likely improved the sensitivity of the dementia diagnoses from 1995. Our sensitivity analyses showed comparable findings of the relationship between body height and dementia before and after the introduction, yet the comparison of these results were limited by including men in different age-groups (&lt;1995: maximum age of 36-56 and ≥1995: maximum age of 57-77).”</p><p>Finally, we want to acknowledge that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ATC: N06D) may be used for patients with Parkinson’s disease, but the treatment is only indicated if the patients have comorbid dementia. Thus, this should not influence the specificity of the diagnosis. This information has been included as a foot note in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors include birth cohort in the analyses and compare results dividing at age 60. They do not, however, address the fact that participants were aged 57 to 77 at the latest date for register dementia diagnoses, so that a large proportion are younger than average age of onset for dementia. Prevalence of dementia is quite low, which likely reflects both cases missed by registers and the age structure of the study population.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have included the following statement in the strength and limitation section of the manuscript: “Also, the findings may not be generalizable to men aged above 77 years as the study population only reached a maximum age of 57-77 years during the follow-up period.”</p><p>We also agree that the low frequency of dementia in our cohort could be due to the particular age structure of the cohort, which implies that the data cannot be used to estimate prevalence, only incidence of dementia through this age range.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Not until the detailed methods is it learned that brothers were from 1953-1959 birth cohorts, making them age 57 – 63 as of the latest date of matching to dementia diagnoses.

We have rewritten and provided more information of the birth cohorts where brothers were identified in the materials and methods section: “Brothers were identified from the population through maternal linkage in the Danish Civil Registration System and 73.5% were included from the birth-cohorts 1953-1959, where the linkage between mothers and offspring is complete in the register. The coverage vary between birth cohorts because the linkage between parents and offspring was based on shared residency in 1968 where the Danish Civil Registration System was established. After 1968, the linkage was carried out at the time of birth. Please see Supplementary file 1 for number of individuals included from each birth cohort (1939-1959).”</p><p>We want to highlight that even though 73.5% of brothers were included from the birth cohorts 1953-1959, 26.5% were included from the prior birth cohorts (1939-1952). As described in the paragraph above, this information is now available in the manuscript and Supplementary file 1.</p><p>Also, we want to clarify that the results from the within-brother and within-twin analyses, respectively, are compared to cohort analyses of the population of brothers and twins, respectively. Thus, the interpretation of these results is based on comparisons of results based on the same population: brothers and twins, respectively, and thereby identical age structures. It is thereby not possible that difference in age distribution can explain the difference identified in the within-brother/twin analyses from the cohort analyses of brothers/twins. We have clarified this in the Results section in the manuscript: “The analyses of Model 3 showed that the within-pair analysis of brothers revealed a stronger, but less precise, point estimate than the cohort analysis of brothers (Table 3). For twins, the comparison of the cohort analysis of twins and the within-pair analysis of twins revealed a pattern similar to that found for brothers. Yet, the pattern was less clear and the HRs were imprecisely estimated possible due to a lower number of individuals in these analyses (N=7,388) (Table 3)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be of interest to describe the mean and distribution of intrapair difference in height in centimeters (cm).</p></disp-quote><p>The numeric mean and SE difference in body height between brothers and twins, respectively, as well as the distribution of these estimates are now provided in the Results section of the manuscript: “The numeric mean (SE) body height difference was 5.1 (0.02) cm between brothers and 3.5 (0.06) cm between twins (See Figure 2—figure supplement 1 for distribution of the numeric difference in body height for brothers (A) and twins (B)).”</p><p>Please note that brothers could include more than just two. In cases where there were more than two brothers with a shared mother, the difference in body height between all brothers were included e.g. for a groups of three brothers, the differences between brother one and two, brother one and three, and brother two and three, respectively, were included. This information is provided as a foot note in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
