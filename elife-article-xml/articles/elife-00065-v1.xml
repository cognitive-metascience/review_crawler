factor-21 (FGF21) is a hormone secreted by the liver during fasting that elicits diverse aspects of the adaptive starvation response. Among its effects, FGF21 induces hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, increases insulin sensitivity, blocks somatic growth and causes bone loss. Here we show that transgenic overexpression of FGF21 markedly extends lifespan in mice without reducing food intake or affecting markers of NAD+ metabolism or AMP kinase and mTOR signaling. Transcriptomic analysis suggests that FGF21 acts primarily by blunting the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathway in liver. These findings raise the possibility that FGF21 can be used to extend lifespan in other species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00065.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00065.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00065.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In 1934, in a famous experiment at Cornell University, it was discovered that laboratory mice could live twice as long as expected if they were fed a low-calorie diet that included enough nutrients to avoid malnutrition. This phenomenon has since been observed in species ranging from worms to primates, but not in humans. Reducing calorie intake leads to longer lives by modifying a number of the biochemical pathways that sense nutrients, including pathways that involve insulin and various other biomolecules. Chemical and genetic methods can also increase longevity by modifying these pathways, which suggests that it might be possible to develop drugs that can increase lifespan without reducing calorie intake.</p><p>Mice, humans and other creatures respond to prolonged fasting through a number of adaptive changes that include mobilizing and burning fatty acids. The liver has an important role in this response, secreting a hormone called fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) that coordinates these processes among tissues. Previous experiments on transgenic mice with high levels of this hormone have shown that it suppresses the activity of growth hormone and reduces the production of insulin-like growth factor, which prevents growth and can lead to hibernation-like behavior.</p><p>Here Zhang et al. compare groups of wild-type mice and transgenic mice with high levels of FGF21. They find that the transgenic mice have a longer median survival time than wild-type mice (38 months vs 28 months), and that the transgenic female mice on average live for 4 months longer than their male counterparts. However, unlike in other examples of increased longevity, they find that decreased food intake is not required. Instead, they find that transgenic mice eat more food than wild-type mice, yet remain profoundly insulin-sensitive. The results suggest that the longer survival times are caused by a reduction in the production of insulin-like growth factor, but they also suggest that the mechanism responsible for the increased longevity is independent of the three pathways that are usually associated with such increases. Further research is needed to understand this mechanism in greater detail and could, perhaps, pave the way for the use of FGF21-based hormone therapy to extend lifespan without the need for a low-calorie diet.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00065.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00065.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

means of inhibiting aging in species ranging from worms to nonhuman primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Masoro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop and Guarente, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kenyon, 2010</xref>). The effect of caloric restriction on longevity appears to be mediated by multiple nutrient-sensing pathways including those involving insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), target of rapamycin (TOR), AMP kinase and sirtuins. Pharmacologic and/or genetic manipulation of these pathways increases longevity to varying degrees, suggesting the feasibility of drugs that increase lifespan in the absence of caloric restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop and Guarente, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kenyon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barzilai et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) is an atypical FGF that functions as an endocrine hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Potthoff et al., 2012</xref>). In mice, FGF21 is strongly induced in liver in response to prolonged fasts through a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î±-dependent mechanism. FGF21 in turn elicits diverse aspects of the adaptive starvation response. Among these, FGF21 increases insulin sensitivity and causes a corresponding decrease in basal insulin concentrations; FGF21 increases hepatic fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis; and, FGF21 sensitizes mice to torpor, a hibernation-like state of reduced body temperature and physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Potthoff et al., 2012</xref>). FGF21 also blocks somatic growth by causing GH resistance, a phenomenon associated with starvation. Transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing FGF21 are markedly smaller than wild-type mice and have a corresponding decrease in circulating IGF-1 concentrations despite having elevated growth hormone (GH) levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inagaki et al., 2008</xref>). Conversely, FGF21-knockout mice grow more than wild-type mice under conditions of nutrient deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kubicky et al., 2012</xref>). In liver, FGF21 inhibits the GH signaling pathway by blocking JAK2-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, STAT5. This suppresses the transcription of <italic>Igf1</italic> and other GH/STAT5-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inagaki, et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, FGF21-mediated repression of the GH/IGF-1 axis provides a mechanism for blocking growth and conserving energy under starvation conditions.</p><p>Dwarf mice, including the pituitary loss-of-function Ames and Snell strains and GH receptor/GH binding protein-knockout mice, are the longest living mouse mutants discovered to date, living up to â¼70% longer than their wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartke and Brown-Borg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown-Borg and Bartke, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, FGF21-Tg mice share a number of phenotypes with these long-lived mice including small size, enhanced insulin sensitivity and a blunted GH/IGF-1 signaling axis. In this report, using FGF21-Tg mice, we examine the consequences of chronic FGF21 exposure on lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We previously described FGF21-Tg mice in which the FGF21 transgene is selectively expressed in hepatocytes under the control of the apoE promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inagaki et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2008</xref>). Circulating concentrations of FGF21 are â¼5â10-fold higher in the FGF21-Tg mice than under fasted conditions. Younger FGF21-Tg mice (&lt;8-month-old) have significant decreases in serum insulin, IGF-1, glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol and in hepatic triglyceride levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inagaki et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2008</xref>). Similar effects on insulin, glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol levels were seen in FGF21-Tg mice in which the FGF21 transgene was under the control of the albumin promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kharitonenkov et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We examined whether these and additional metabolic parameters were altered in groups of older (26â27-month-old) wild-type and FGF21-Tg mice. There were no differences in food intake, physical activity, oxygen consumption or respiratory exchange ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâD</xref>). Although both male and female FGF21-Tg mice weighed less than their wild-type littermates, there were no differences in their percent fat and lean mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Accordingly, plasma leptin levels were not significantly changed in FGF21-Tg mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Plasma adiponectin concentrations were significantly higher in male FGF21-Tg mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), with increases in both the monomeric and more active oligomeric forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). There was no significant change in either the total amount or the different forms of adiponectin in females (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Plasma ketone body levels were significantly higher in female but not male FGF21-Tg mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Hepatic triglyeride concentrations were lower in female but not male FGF21-Tg mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Plasma and hepatic cholesterol concentrations were unchanged in FGF21-Tg mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wei et al., 2012</xref>), FGF21-Tg mice had reduced bone mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00065.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Metabolic parameters in aging wild-type and FGF21-transgenic mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Food intake, (<bold>B</bold>) physical activity, including total horizontal and ambulatory activity, (<bold>C</bold>) respiratory exchange ratio (VCO<sub>2</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub>) and (<bold>D</bold>) oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) data for 30-month-old male wild-type (WT) and FGF21-transgenic (Tg) mice (n=6/group) housed singly in metabolic cages.

Comprehensive transcriptome analysis was performed by microarray using RNA from liver, gastrocnemius muscle and epididymal white adipose tissue of wild-type and FGF21-Tg mice and mice subjected to either caloric restriction or a 24 hr fast. Using a false discovery rate &lt;0.10 and fold change &gt;2 as criteria, we found that expression of 33, 8 and 22 genes was changed in liver, muscle and adipose of FGF21-Tg mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

To begin to assess whether these pathways are affected by FGF21, we measured phosphorylated and total levels of AMP kinase and the mTOR targets S6 and 4E-BP1in liver, muscle and adipose tissue of male and female wild-type and FGF21-Tg mice. We also determined mitochondrial DNA content in liver as a downstream measure of AMP kinase activity.

The increase in lifespan extension is comparable to that achieved by caloric restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Turturro et al., 1999</xref>). While the FGF21-mediated increase in longevity is less than the 50â70% increase seen in pituitary loss-of-function Ames mice and GH receptor/GH binding protein-knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown-Borg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coschigano et al., 2000</xref>), it is similar to that seen in other loss-of-function dwarf models including hypopituitary Snell mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flurkey et al., 2002</xref>) and mice lacking pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), a protease that increases IGF-1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conover et al., 2010</xref>). The FGF21-Tg mice share other phenotypic similarities with long-lived dwarf mice including small size, reduced circulating insulin and IGF-1 concentrations, increased circulating adiponectin levels and female infertility. Like the Ames and Snell dwarf mice, female FGF21-Tg mice live longer than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown-Borg and Bartke, 2012</xref>). These similarities together with our previous finding that FGF21-Tg mice are GH resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inagaki et al., 2008</xref>) suggest that FGF21 may increase lifespan by inhibiting the GH/IGF-1 signaling pathway. Because FGF21 also regulates other pathways that impact metabolism, it is not surprising that some of the effects that are seen in dwarf mice, such as increased adiposity in GH receptor-knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Masternak et al., 2012</xref>), are not recapitulated in FGF21-Tg mice.</p><p>In microarray studies, FGF21 modulated more genes in liver than in either muscle or adipose. Interestingly, nearly all of these hepatic genes (30 of 33) were similarly regulated by caloric restriction, a proven method of extending lifespan in mice and other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Masoro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop and Guarente, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kenyon, 2010</xref>). In contrast, there was little or no overlap in the genes regulated by FGF21 and caloric restriction in muscle or adipose. A remarkable result of our studies is that FGF21 increased longevity to a similar extent as caloric restriction while regulating a much smaller set of genes in liver. These data suggest that FGF21 may extend lifespan by acting as a selective caloric restriction mimetic in liver. An important caveat, however, is that there may be changes in other tissues or post-transcriptional changes that were missed in this analysis. We note that caloric restriction did not increase circulating FGF21 levels, indicating that endogenous FGF21 does not mediate the longevity effects of caloric restriction.</p><p>Using microarray analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Swindell (2007)</xref> previously defined a set of 43 candidate longevity genes based upon their similar regulation in different dwarf mouse strains or between dwarf strains and caloric restriction. Eight of these genes (<italic>Fmo3</italic>, <italic>Igfals</italic>, <italic>Hes6</italic>, <italic>Alas2</italic>, <italic>Cyp4a12b</italic>, <italic>Mup4</italic>, <italic>Serpina12</italic>, <italic>Hsd3b5</italic>) are among those co-regulated by FGF21 and caloric restriction in liver in our current study, and four others (<italic>Igf1</italic>, <italic>Igfbp1</italic>, <italic>Socs2</italic> and <italic>Mup3</italic>) were previously shown by more sensitive quantitative real-time PCR to be regulated in liver of FGF21-Tg mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inagaki et al., 2008</xref>). Strikingly, 26 of the 33 genes regulated by FGF21 in liver were previously shown to be regulated in a similar manner in mice lacking STAT5 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barclay et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, FGF21 may increase longevity by suppressing the GH signaling axis in liver in a manner similar to that of caloric restriction. Interestingly, GH induces FGF21 in liver through a STAT5-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barclay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). This regulatory relationship between GH and FGF21 is likely to be important in controlling GH activity and coordinating energy homeostasis during starvation.</p><p>The ability to increase lifespan adds to a growing list of other beneficial effects that pharmacologic administration of FGF21 has in mammals, including insulin sensitization, normalization of glycemia, and reduced body weight in obese animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Potthoff et al., 2012</xref>). These attributes have made FGF21 an intriguing therapeutic target. In contrast to these positive effects, however, we previously showed that younger (&lt;8-month-old) FGF21-Tg mice and adult mice administered recombinant FGF21 for 14 days have reduced bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wei et al., 2012</xref>). In our current study, similar reductions in bone mass were seen in older mice. The FGF21-dependent decrease in bone mass is caused in part by an increase in the differentiation of marrow adipocytes and corresponding decrease in osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wei et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, FGF21 inhibits GH action directly at the growth plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wu et al., 2012</xref>), and long-lived PAPP-A-knockout mice have a decrease in bone mineral density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tanner et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that changes in GH/IGF-1 signaling are also likely to be involved in FGF21-induced decreases in bone mass. While it remains to be determined whether FGF21 causes bone loss in humans, it is likely that this adverse effect will have to be overcome if FGF21 is to be used clinically to combat aging.</p><p>In summary, we show that chronic exposure to FGF21, a naturally-occurring hormone and potent insulin sensitizer, markedly extends lifespan in mice through a mechanism that may involve suppression of the GH/IGF-1 signaling axis in liver. Regarding other hormones that influence lifespan, we note that the extracellular domain of Klotho, a membrane protein that regulates phosphate metabolism and serves as a co-receptor for FGF23 but not FGF21, can be cleaved to yield a circulating peptide that blocks insulin and IGF-1 signaling. This hormonal activity may contribute to Klothoâs lifespan-extending effect in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kurosu et al., 2005</xref>). However, unlike FGF21, Klotho causes insulin resistance, which may limit its utility as a therapeutic agent. We conclude that FGF21 could potentially be used as a hormone therapy to extend lifespan in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal experiments</title><p>FGF21-Tg mice and wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inagaki et al., 2007</xref>) were maintained on C57Bl/6J background in a specific-pathogen-free facility with 12:12 light:dark cycle, and fed 2916 global diet (Harlan).

Insulin tolerance tests were performed on mice after a 4 hr fast. 0.75 U/kg of human insulin (Sigma) was intraperitoneally injected into mice. At 0, 20, 40, 60, and 90 min after injection, tail vein blood was drawn and glucose levels measured using a One Touch Ultra glucometer (Life Scan).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp analysis</title><p>Insulin sensitivity was evaluated in 6- to 8-month-old male WT and FGF21-Tg mice (n=6/group) by performing hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp experiments as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayala et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berglund et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, 5 days prior to the clamp studies, infusion catheters were implanted in the right jugular vein under isofluorane anesthesia, tunneled subcutaneously, and exteriorized at the back of the neck. On the morning of the experiment, mice were transferred to sterile cages with bedding and water to begin a 4 hr fast. At t=â90 min, water was removed and a primed continuous infusion of HPLC-purified [3-<sup>3</sup>H]glucose (5 Î¼Ci bolus + 0.05 Î¼Ci/min) was started for the assessment of glucose turnover. Blood samples were obtained from the cut tail at t=â15 and â5 min for the measurement of basal blood glucose (AlphaTRAK glucometer, Abbott, Chicago, IL). At t=0 min, a primed continuous infusion of insulin (6 mU + 2.0mU/kg/min; Humulin) was started to induce hyperinsulinemia, and the [3-<sup>3</sup>H]glucose infusion rate was doubled (0.1 Î¼Ci/min) to minimize alterations in specific activity. Blood glucose was measured every 10 min thereafter, while 50% dextrose was infused at a variable rate to maintain target glycemic levels at 120 mg/dL. Glucose turnover was calculated during the basal (t=â15 to â5 min) and steady-state (t=110â150 min) periods of the clamp using Steele's steady-state equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Steele et al., 1956</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Liver lipid measurements</title><p>Liver triglyceride and cholesterol were extracted from 0.1 g of liver tissue by the Folch method as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalaany et al., 2005</xref>).

The membrane was then hybridized with antibodies against total AMPK, phospho-AMPK (T172), total S6 and phospho-S6 (S240/244) (Cell Signaling) and total and phospho-4E-BP1 (T70) (Cell Signaling).
