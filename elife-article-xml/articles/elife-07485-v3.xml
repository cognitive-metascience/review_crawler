excessive storage is a feature of common metabolic disorders. CIDEA is a lipid droplet (LD)-protein enriched in brown adipocytes promoting the enlargement of LDs, which are dynamic, ubiquitous organelles specialized for storing neutral lipids. We demonstrate an essential role in this process for an amphipathic helix in CIDEA, which facilitates embedding in the LD phospholipid monolayer and binds phosphatidic acid (PA). LD pairs are docked by CIDEA trans-complexes through contributions of the N-terminal domain and a C-terminal dimerization region. These complexes, enriched at the LDâLD contact site, interact with the cone-shaped phospholipid PA and likely increase phospholipid barrier permeability, promoting LD fusion by transference of lipids. This physiological process is essential in adipocyte differentiation as well as serving to facilitate the tight coupling of lipolysis and lipogenesis in activated brown fat.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07485.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07485.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07485.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>If other energy sources become unavailable, cells fall back on stores of fatty molecules called lipids. These are held in membrane-enclosed compartments in the cell called lipid droplets, which in mammals are particularly abundant in fat cells called adipocytes. There are two main types of adipocytes: white adipocytes have a single giant lipid droplet, whereas brown adipocytes contain many smaller droplets.</p><p>Proteins embedded in the membrane that surrounds a lipid droplet help to control the dropletâs growth and when it releases lipids. For example, a protein called CIDEA, which is only found in brown adipocytes, helps lipid droplets to grow by enabling one droplet to transfer its contents to another droplet. However, little is known about how this occurs.</p><p>By combining cell biology, biophysical and computer modelling approaches, Barneda et al. investigated how normal and mutant forms of CIDEA affect the growth of lipid droplets. These experiments identified a helix in the structure of CIDEA that embeds it in the membrane, from where it can then interact with CIDEA proteins on other lipid droplets to hold the droplets together. In addition, the helix interacts with a molecule in the lipid droplet membrane called phosphatidic acid. Barneda et al. suggest that this interaction helps to transfer the contents of one droplet to another by making it easier for lipids to move through the dropletsâ membranes.</p><p>The next challenge is to characterize the mechanisms that control CIDEA activity to influence the formation of the multiple lipid droplets that distinguish brown and BRITE (brown-in-white) adipocytes from white adipocytes. The lipid droplets in brown adipocytes are an important target for research to combat obesity, due to the 'burning' rather than storing of lipids that occurs in these cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07485.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07485.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>lipid droplet</kwd><kwd>phospholipid</kwd><kwd>brown adipose tissue</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/H020233/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barneda</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Christian</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DIABAT (HEALTH-F2-2011-278373)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christian</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM- 19629</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>Susan A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Genesis Research Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christian</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM028140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carman</surname><given-names>George M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An interaction between the brown fat protein CIDEA and the phospholipid phosphatidic acid is vital for the expansion of intracellular lipid droplets for energy storage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Evolutionary pressures for survival in fluctuating environments that expose organisms to times of both feast and famine have selected for the ability to efficiently store and release energy in the form of triacylglycerol (TAG). However, excessive or defective lipid storage is a key feature of common diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenberg et al., 2011</xref>). The organelles that are essential for storing and mobilizing intracellular fat are lipid droplets (LDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Walther and Farese, 2012</xref>). They constitute a unique cellular structure where a core of neutral lipids is stabilized in the hydrophilic cytosol by a phospholipid monolayer embedding LDÂ proteins. While most mammalian cells present small LDs (&lt;1 Î¼m) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>), white (unilocular) adipocytes contain a single giant LD that occupies most of their cell volume. In contrast, brown (multilocular) adipocytes hold multiple LDs of smaller size that increase the LD surface/volume ratio, which facilitates the rapid consumption of lipids for adaptive thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cinti, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The exploration of new approaches for the treatment of metabolic disorders has been stimulated by the rediscovery of active brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Virtanen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cypess and Kahn, 2010</xref>) and by the induction of multilocular brown-like cells in white adipose tissue (WAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harms and Seale, 2013</xref>). The multilocular morphology of brown adipocytes is a defining characteristic of these cells along with expression of genes such as Ucp1. The acquisition of a unilocular or multilocular phenotype is likely to be controlled by the regulation of LD growth. Two related proteins, CIDEA and CIDEC, promote LD enlargement in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Puri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2008</xref>), with CIDEA being specifically found in BAT. Together with CIDEB, they form the CIDE (cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector) family of LDÂ proteins, which have emerged as important metabolic regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Different mechanisms have been proposed for LD enlargement, including in situ neutral lipid synthesis, lipid uptake, and LDâLD coalescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuerschner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilfling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">BostrÃ¶m et al., 2007</xref>). The study of CIDE proteins has revealed a critical role in the LD fusion process in which a donor LD progressively transfers its content to an acceptor LD until it is completely absorbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gong et al., 2011</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism by which CIDEC and CIDEA facilitate the interchange of TAG molecules between LDs is not understood. In the present study, we have obtained a detailed picture of the different steps driving this LD enlargement process, which involves the stabilization of LD pairs, phospholipid binding, and the permeabilization of the LD monolayer to allow the transference of lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CIDEA expression mimics the LD dynamics observed during the differentiation of brown adipocytes</title><p>To examine the processes controlling LD enlargement in brown adipocytes, we followed LD dynamics using time-lapse microscopy. During differentiation of immortalized brown pre-adipocytes, large LDs were formed by the fusion of pre-existing LDs (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). This fusion process was characterized by a slow and progressive reduction in the volume of a donor LD until it was completely absorbed by an acceptor LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is characteristic of CIDE activity. As CIDEA is selectively expressed in brown adipocytes and could have a prominent role in the acquisition of their multilocular morphology, we explored the effects of its expression in undifferentiated pre-adipocytes. After inducing CIDEA, LDs in pre-adipocytes showed an equivalent dynamic pattern to that observed in differentiating brown cells, with the progressive fusion of the initial LDs until a few large LDs remained in the cell (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). LD fusion was achieved by the slow transference of lipids between LDs, and was preceded by the formation of small clusters of interacting LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Given the importance of this process in adipocyte dynamics, we decided to undertake a comprehensive molecular analysis.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-07485-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07485.003</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Lipid droplet (LD) enlargement in differentiating immortalized brown adipose tissue (imBAT) cells.</title><p>Immortalized brown pre-adipocytes were induced to differentiate by incubation for 48 hr + 6âhr with the described differentiation cocktails.

Control cells, which lacked expression of CIDEA, did not show LD enlargement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As many proteins are constructed of domains, which are conserved across families and serve as their main structural and functional units, we assessed the conserved regions within the CIDE proteins. By comparing the 217 amino acid (aa) sequence of CIDEA with that of CIDEB and CIDEC, four highly conserved regions could be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The N-terminal (N-term) domain of CIDEA is composed of a basic region (2â72 aa) followed by an acidic sequence (73â110 aa). These distinctly differently charged regions are indicated by protein crystallography studies to be important for the dimerization of CIDE domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lugovskoy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). The CIDEA C-terminal (C-term) is rich in basic aas and contains a highly conserved region (126â155 aa) and a basic and hydrophobic sequence (162â197 aa). Based on this sequence analysis, we created an extensive collection of v5-tagged CIDE point and deletion mutants to test their effects on LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, certain mutations such as R171E/R175E promoted the aggregation of the cellular LDs in a few 'bunch of grapes'-like LD clusters, but were unable to induce the transference of lipids between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In other cases, as with the expression of CIDEA-(116â217)-v5, the LDs remained small and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm despite the protein being normally localized at their surface. Finally, some versions of CIDEA, such as CIDEA-(1â118)-v5, showed no LD localization and did not affect their size, number, or distribution. Together with the time-lapse results, this indicates that the molecular mechanism of CIDEA is composed of three discrete phases: LD targeting, LDâLD docking, and LD growth.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07485.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mapping the functional domains of CIDEA.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) Amino acid (aa) sequence of murine CIDEA highlighting the residues conserved in either CIDEB or CIDEC (grey underline), or in both proteins (black underline).

In some mutants, the large LDs remained attached to many small LDs, indicating that lipid transfer was inefficient or inactive for some LDs (Type II). When CIDEA alterations blocked the lipid transfer process, the LDs remained small and grouped in a few large clusters (Type III). If this was accompanied by inefficient LDâLD docking, the cells contained a number of small LD clusters combined with isolated LDs (Type IV). The CIDEA forms that could not stabilize LDâLD interactions displayed a phenotype similar to the mock transfected cells, with most of the LDs dispersed through the cytoplasm (Type V). Finally, some CIDEA constructs were unable to target the LDs, indicating an alteration of the LD-binding domain (Type VI).

Although it is known that the C-term domain of CIDE proteins is essential for LD localization and enlargement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christianson et al., 2010</xref>), only the structure of the N-term domain has been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lugovskoy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). The CIDE-N domain (Pfam reference PF02017) has been determined in members of the CIDE family (PBD Codes: 2eel (hCIDEA), 1D4B (hCIDEB), 4MAC (mCIDEC), 4ikg (mCIDEC)) to aas 40â117, 34â100, and 41â118 in hCIDEA, hCIDEB, and mCIDEC, respectively. Thus, the sequence 163â180 that we found essential for LDÂ targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) lacks direct structural information to date. We therefore predicted its structure using in silico approaches.

While HA-(1â120)-CIDEA showed no LD localization and had no effect on LD distribution or size, HA-CIDEA-(1â117)-(163â180) was partially localized on the LD surface and promoted LD clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Furthermore, the deletion of this C-term sequence in CIDEA-â³(163â179)-v5 completely eliminated LD localization in most of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), confirming its role in LD targeting. However, partial LD localization could be observed in a small percentage of cells, together with the presence of LD clusters. This was also observed in CIDEA-â³(162â197)-v5 and was particularly frequent in CIDEA-(N172X)-v5, which contains a deletion in the middle of the helix. In contrast, no LDÂ targeting could be observed for the N-term fragment alone (1â118Â aa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This may indicate that other regions in C-term may contribute to LD localization either by directly binding the LD membrane or by interacting with other LD proteins. Similarly, LD targeting was compromised when the amphipathic character of the helix was disrupted in CIDEA-(F166R/V169R/L170R)-v5 by introducing cationic aas in its hydrophobic face. Although LD localization was only lost in a small percentage of cells, in the remaining cells the LD staining was accompanied by a predominantly cytosolic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>). In contrast, the predominant LD localization of wild type (wt) CIDEA was maintained in CIDEA-(K167E/R171E/R175E)-v5, which presents a charge inversion of the helix but maintains its amphipathic properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The amphipathic helix is essential for LD enlargement</title><p>In addition to its role in LD targeting, our data indicate that the cationic amphipathic helix in the C-term participates in the TAG transference step of CIDEA activity, as the charge inversion (K167E/R171E/R175E) did not affect LD targeting but completely blocked LD enlargement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Despite not being essential for LD targeting, the cationic aas in the helix are highly conserved in vertebrates <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>. K167 is 100% conserved across all vertebrate species examined. R171 was conserved across vertebrates including birds, snakes, lizards, crocodiles, turtles, marsupials, placental mammals, and monotremes, although not in fish. R175 is also highly conserved, with only birds, dolphins, and the Nile Tilapia (a fish) lacking this residue. Remarkably, an amphipathic helix is predicted in CIDEA of all the vertebrate species examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>The absence of negative charges in the helix appeared to be an essential condition to permit TAG transference, as a single inverted charge mutation such as R171E or R175E was sufficient to block LD enlargement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, conservative substitutions such as R171K or K167R did not affect CIDEA activity, and even the substitution of the three basic aas with histidine in (K167H/R171H/R175H)-CIDEA-v5 was compatible with the formation of large LDs, strongly supporting the conclusion from sequence comparison that positive charges are required at these positions. As histidine has a lower pKa value than arginine and lysine, it can carry a positive charge depending on the pH and local environment, which could explain the activity retained by this protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>LDâLD docking is induced by the formation of CIDEA complexes</title><p>Deletions in the N-term domain of CIDEA impaired LDâLD docking, as shown by the increase in cells displaying isolated LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, LD clustering could be induced by forcing the LD localization of the N-term fragment through conjugation with the 18-aa amphipathic helix (HA-CIDEA-(1â117)-(162â180)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>As the N-term of CIDEA forms a highly polarized structure that is prone to dimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lugovskoy et al., 1999</xref>), we hypothesized that LDâLD docking was induced by the N-termâN-term interaction of CIDEA molecules in adjacent LDs (trans complexes). However, the C-term fragment (116â217) retained some degree of LDâLD docking activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">FigureÂ 2C</xref>), indicating that an additional interaction site could be present in this region. In fact, a complete blocking of LD clustering was only observed with the shorter fragment 152â217, which lacks the N-term and a section of the C-term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>The formation of CIDEAâCIDEA complexes was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of CIDEA-v5 with CIDEA-HA. Surprisingly, co-IP was observed with CIDEA-(116â217)-v5 but not CIDEA-(1â118)-v5, indicating that the C-term was responsible for that interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, a similar percentage of the input was co-immunoprecipitated for constructs producing highly clustered LDs (CIDEA-(R171E/R175E)-v5) and constructs showing few LDâLD contacts (CIDEA-v5 or CIDEA-(116â217)-v5). Hence, this C-term interaction is largely independent of the presence of LDâLD contacts, indicating that it may also occur in cis.</p><p>Within the C-term region, the deletion of the 162â197 sequence did not affect the co-IP whereas the signal was largely reduced in CIDEA-â³(126â155)-v5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that this conserved region was involved in the C-term interaction. However, the residual interaction still detectable by co-IP could sustain the LD-docking activity, as cells expressing this construct displayed normal LD clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). CIDEA-(152â217)-v5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>), which showed no LD clustering and lacked both the 126â155 interaction site and the N-term domain, displayed a further reduction on the co-IP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Therefore, trans complexes through N-term dimerization would be responsible for the LD clusters and weak co-IP signal observed in CIDEA-(126â155)-v5. The lack of co-IP between the N-term fragment and the full-length CIDEA could be due to conformational and positional factors favouring the interaction between the HA-tagged full-length proteins in the LD or between the cytosolic v5-tagged N-term fragments. In fact, co-IP between N-term fragments of CIDEC was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). This interaction could be disrupted with the point mutations E87Q/D88N or R55E as predicted by the crystal structure of the N-term fragment, which reveals the formation of homodimers in which the positively charged R46, R55, and R56 in one molecule interact with negative residues in the other (E87 and D88) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the equivalent mutations in CIDEA (E79Q/D80N and R47E) impaired LD docking, while R47Q and R47A, which would not create repulsions between the interacting domains, did not affect CIDEA activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that both the C-term dimerization site (126â155) and the N-term domain of CIDEA can contribute to LDâLD docking by forming complexes with its counterparts on the adjacent LD.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>CIDEC differs from CIDEA in its dependence on the N-term domain</title><p>The differential expression of CIDEA and CIDEC in BAT and WAT could be related to the acquisition of multilocular or unilocular morphologies in brown and white adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barneda et al., 2013</xref>). While the ectopic expression of both CIDEA and CIDEC produce LD enlargement in a similar manner, specific differences in their activity and regulation could achieve discrete outcomes. In fact, whereas deletion of the N-term domain of CIDEA blocks LD enlargement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), it has been described that the C-term fragment of CIDEC retains its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jambunathan et al., 2011</xref>). Here we show that similar to CIDEA, the N-term of CIDEC is involved in LDâLD docking, as its deletion increases the fraction of cells displaying isolated LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, in the cells where the C-term of CIDEC could effectively induce LDâLD docking, large LDs were observed instead of LD clusters, showing that although its docking efficiency is reduced, this region of CIDEC is sufficient for docking and enlarging the LDs. This differs from CIDEA, in which the C-term fragment cannot induce LD enlargement despite retaining a partial LD docking activity. In addition to the intrinsic differences between CIDEC and CIDEA, their activity could be affected by the interaction with additional proteins. While PLIN1 interacts with CIDEC, but not CIDEA, and potentiates its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grahn et al., 2013</xref>), we have observed that CIDEA interacts with PLIN5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which is rich in BAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harms and Seale, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to PLIN5, CIDEA showed high affinity for both CIDEB and CIDEC, while it did not co-IP with DFF40 or DFF45, which share homology with the N-term domain of CIDE proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As BAT cells express high levels of both CIDEA and CIDEC, the formation of CIDE heterocomplexes could be involved in the regulation of LD enlargement to retain the multilocular state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>CIDEA interacts with phosphatidic acid</title><p>To further characterize the interaction of CIDEA with the LD membrane, we utilized lipid strips to investigate the affinity of CIDEA for different lipids present in mammalian cell membranes and found that it selectively bound a set of anionic phospholipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The interaction with phosphatidic acid (PA) was of particular interest, as increased levels of this phospholipid have been linked with LD fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fei et al., 2011</xref>) and the identification of enzymes such as AGPAT3 and LIPIN-1Î³ in LDs supports the existence of in situ generation and consumption of PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilfling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).

Although the N-term fragment showed some residual affinity, the main PA-binding site of CIDEA was in the C-term region containing the amphipathic helix (163â180) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Fitting of the CD data suggested a low (~5%) helical content for the wt peptide when analysed in phosphate buffer alone, and indicated a predominantly sheet/coil structure in the absence of detergent or liposomes. The presence of DLPC liposomes stabilized a sharp increase in Î±-helical structure (up to 40%) and an equivalent reduction of sheet content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>), yielding higher helical content than that observed in n-dodecyl-Î²-D-maltopyranoside micelles (~25%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, the induction of helix formation by DLPC was not observed in a mutant peptide carrying the substitutions impairing LDÂ targeting in CIDEA-(F166R/V169R/L170R)-v5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This mutant peptide remained predominantly random coil in the absence and presence of DLPC liposomes. Interestingly, fitting of the CD data indicated significant helical content for both the wt and mutant peptides in the presence of DLPC:DLPA (9:1) vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that the interaction with the negatively charged phospholipid PA can compensate for the excess of positive charges in CIDEA-(F166R/V169R/L170R)-v5.</p><p>To obtain more detailed insight into the interaction of the amphipathic helix with phospholipids and the role of PA in this process, the interaction of the amphipathic helixÂ with LDs was modelled using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5FâH</xref>). CG-MD simulations are well established for lipid-containing systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marrink et al., 2007</xref>), including LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohammadyani et al., 2014</xref>), and have the advantage over full atomistic simulations in that the time scales required are much smaller allowing us to compare different LD compositions and helix mutants in the large multimolecular LD system. The wt (163â180) helix (CTSFKAVLRNLLRFMSYA) diffused towards the LD containing 400 palmitoyl-oleoyl-glycero-phosphocholine (POPC) and 200 TAG molecules where it interacted at its full length with the LD surface and penetrated into the hydrophobic region of the phospholipid monolayer covering the TAG core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F, G</xref>). A similar behaviour was observed by the charge-inverted mutant K167E/R171E/R175E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>), supporting the experimental result that these mutations do not affect LD localization in CIDEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>). In contrast, no interaction with the LD was observed with the non-amphipathic F166R/L169R/V169R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), which also impairs LD binding in CIDEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>) and which was unable to attain stable secondary structure as evidenced by CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Similarly, a non-amphipathic Î±-helix in N-term (SSLQELISKTLDVLVITT) also showed no interaction with the LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p>To study the effect of PA on LD structure and interaction with the CIDEA helix, we replaced 10% of the PC molecules with PA. The equilibration of the system resulted in a slight deformation of the spherical shape of the LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The wt helix made a stable complex with this LD at even earlier simulation times than with the PC-only containing LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The triple-E replacement mutant was also able to bind this LD, and even the F166R/L169R/V169R mutant was now able to interact with the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This result fits well with the CD results where the addition of PA also rescued the helix induction in this mutant peptide through interaction with the liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Interestingly, while the presence of PA permitted the accommodation of the F166R/L169R/V169R helix in the LD monolayer, it could not penetrate as deep towards the TAG core as the wt or helix. The average distance of the peptide to the centre of the LD ( Â± SEM) was 5.6 Â± 0.04 nm and 5.7 Â± 0.03 nm for wt and K167E/R171E/R175E, respectively. In the presence of PA, the distance was 5.6 Â± 0.02 nm, 5.7 Â± 0.02 nm, and 6.1 Â± 0.02 for wt, K167E/R171E/R175E, and F166R/L169R/V169R, respectively (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, H</xref>). This result confirms that the presence of the hydrophobic face was necessary for proper helix insertion in the LD monolayer.</p><p>The CG-MD simulations not only shed light on the interaction between the helix and the LD, but also provided an indication of the mechanism by which this process could lead to LD enlargement by TAG transference. We observed that TAG molecules were able to escape the LD core and were integrated in the hydrophobic section of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). This TAG infiltration was increased after the docking of the wt helix in the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that CIDEA could promote the migration of TAG into the membrane as an intermediate state prior to the transference to the acceptor LD. To complete the transference, the hydrophobic TAG molecules should overcome the energy barrier constituted by the phospholipid polar heads and water molecules in the LDâLD interface. Interestingly, we observed that the wt helix could attract PA molecules in its vicinity by the interaction of its cationic residues with the negatively charged polar head of PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). A direct interaction of the amphipathic helix with PA was also indicated by molecular docking using Autodock Vina, which supported the role of the K167, R171, and R175 residues in the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Remarkably, CG-MD simulations showed that whereas the non-amphipathic cationic helix F166R/L169R/V169R also interacted with PA molecules from its superficial docking position in the LD membrane, the anionic amphipathic mutant K167E/R171E/R175E was docked in a PA-depleted area and avoided the PA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Although TAG infiltration was also observed in this simulation and the helix was well embedded in the membrane, its inability to attract PA molecules could be responsible for the lack of TAG transference activity in CIDEA-(K167E/R171E/R175)-v5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that CIDEA binds the LD by embedding a cationic amphipathic helix into the LD monolayer and that once there, it can interact with PA molecules, which could facilitate TAG transference.</p><p>We found that PAÂ binding was a feature common to all three members of the CIDE protein family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Intriguingly, we determined that an inactive CIDEC identified in a patient with lipodystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rubio-Cabezas et al., 2009</xref>) contained a truncation (E186X) in the predicted PA-binding site. Although hCIDEC-(E186X)-v5 and the equivalent mCIDEA-(N172X)-v5 were localized in LDs in a high percentage of cells, they were completely unable to induce LD enlargement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5I</xref>). LD clustering activity and its ability to interact with CIDE proteins was not altered in hCIDEC-(E186X)-v5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I, J</xref>), but it showed no affinity for PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Thus, PAÂ binding could be involved in the lipid transfer phase of CIDE activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>PA is required for LD enlargement</title><p>To confirm the requirement of PA binding, we examined the effect of PA depletion on CIDEA activity.

Yeast cells expressing wt CIDEA, but not the inactive R171E/R175E mutant, contained fewer and larger LDs than the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6DâF</xref>), indicating that murine CIDEA was functional in these cells. By measuring the frequency of supersized LDs (diameter above 0.5 Î¼m) and the total number of LDs in strains with altered lipid metabolism, we could determine the yeast strains in which CIDEA was able to induce LD enlargement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, F</xref>). CIDEA was inactive in cells defective in phospholipase D (pld1â³) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rose et al., 1995</xref>), which catalyzes the production of PA from PC. CIDEA activity was also abrogated in cells expressing a hyperactive form of the PA phosphohydrolase (PAH1-7A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2012</xref>).

As evidence indicated a key role in the LD biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hallberg et al., 2008</xref>), we have characterized the mechanism by which CIDEA promotes LD enlargement, which involves the targeting of LDs, the docking of LD pairs, and the transference of lipids between them. The lipid transfer step requires the interaction of CIDEA and PA through a cationic amphipathic helix. Independently of PAÂ binding, this helix is also responsible for anchoring CIDEA in the LD membrane. Finally, we demonstrate that the docking of LD pairs is driven by the formation of CIDEA complexes involving the N-term domain and a C-term interaction site.</p><p>CIDE proteins appeared during vertebrate evolution by the combination of an ancestor N-term domain and a LD-binding C-term domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). In spite of this, the full process of LD enlargement can be induced in yeast by the sole exogenous expression of CIDEA, indicating that in contrast to SNARE-triggered vesicle fusion, LD fusion by lipid transference does not require the coordination of multiple specific proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012</xref>). While vesicle fusion implies an intricate restructuring of the phospholipid bilayers, LD fusion is a spontaneous process that the cell has to prevent by tightly controlling their phospholipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krahmer et al., 2011</xref>). However, although phospholipid-modifying enzymes have been linked with the biogenesis of LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gubern et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2006</xref>), the implication of phospholipids in physiologic LD fusion processes has not been previously described.</p><p>Complete LD fusion by lipid transfer can last several hours, during which the participating LDs remain in contact. Our results indicate that both the N-term domain and a C-term dimerization site (aa 126â155) independently participate in the docking of LD pairs by forming trans interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Certain mutations in the dimerization sites that do not eliminate the interaction result in a decrease of the TAG transference efficiency, reflected by the presence of small LDs docked to enlarged LDs. This suggests that in addition to stabilizing the LDâLD interaction, the correct conformation of the CIDEA complexes is necessary for optimal TAG transfer. Furthermore, the formation of stable LD pairs is not sufficient to trigger LD fusion by lipid transfer. In fact, although LDs can be tightly packed in cultured adipocytes, no TAG transference across neighbour LDs is observed in the absence of CIDE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gong et al., 2011</xref>), showing that the phospholipid monolayer acts as a barrier impermeable to TAG. Our CG-MD simulations indicate that certain TAG molecules can escape the neutral lipid core of the LD and be integrated within the aliphatic chains of the phospholipid monolayer. This could be a transition state prior to the TAG transference, and our data indicate that the docking of the amphipathic helix in the LD membrane could facilitate this process. However, the infiltrated TAGs in LD membranes in the presence of mutant helices, or even in the absence of docking, suggests that this is not enough to complete the TAG transference.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07485.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed molecular mechanism.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) CIDEA targets the LD through its C-term amphipathic helix and once diffused to the LD surface, it forms cis CIDEA complexes by interacting through the C-term (126â155) region. When two CIDEA-containing LDs make contact, trans interactions between CIDEA molecules in each droplet can be established, which will facilitate the docking of the LDs. Both the N-term and the C-term would contribute by dimerizing with their counterparts of the neighbour LD. This trans interaction will anchor the CIDEA complexes in the LDâLD contact site, promoting a local enrichment of CIDEA. The monolayers of the two LDs will be maintained at short distance by the CIDEA complex. The amphipathic helices, embedded in the hydrophobic region of the membrane, will interact with the cone-shaped PA, creating a local perturbation in the phospholipid barrier that will increase its permeability to TAG. (<bold><bold>B</bold></bold>) The docking of the amphipathic helix to the membrane could facilitate the integration of TAG molecules within the phospholipid hydrophobic tails. Although the helix will be stabilized with its cationic residues pointing outwards, it will interact with PA molecules in its vicinity, which could be pulled out of the monolayer by the helix molecular dynamics. This could create a transitory discontinuity in the polar barrier that will reduce the energy required to transfer the TAG molecules present in the membrane. This alteration, together with the microenvironment created by the CIDEA complex, will reduce the energy barrier necessary to transfer TAG molecules between LDs, allowing the LD growth by lipid transference.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07485.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07485.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07485-fig7-v3.tif"/></fig></p><p>To be transferred to the adjacent LD, the TAGs integrated in the hydrophobic region of the LD membrane should cross the energy barrier defined by the phospholipid polar heads, and the interaction of CIDEA with PA could play a role in this process, as suggested by the disruption of LD enlargement by the mutations preventing PAÂ binding (K167E/R171E/R175E) and the inhibition of CIDEA after PA depletion. The minor effects observed with more conservative substitutions in the helix suggest that the presence of positive charges is sufficient to induce TAG transference by attracting anionic phospholipids present in the LD membrane. PA, whose requirement is indicated by our PA-depletion experiments, is a cone-shaped anionic phospholipid that could locally destabilize the LD monolayer by favouring a negative membrane curvature that is incompatible with the spherical LD morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kooijman et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, while the zwitterion PC, the main component of the monolayer, stabilizes the LD structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krahmer et al., 2011</xref>), the negatively charged PA promotes their coalescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fei et al., 2011</xref>). This is supported by our CG-MD results which resulted in a deformation of the LD shape by the addition of PA. We propose a model in which the C-term amphipathic helix positions itself in the LD monolayer and interacts with PA molecules in its vicinity, which might include trans interactions with PA in the adjacent LD. The interaction with PA disturbs the integrity of the phospholipid barrier at the LDâLD interface, allowing the LD to LD transference of TAG molecules integrated in the LD membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Additional alterations in the LD composition could facilitate TAG transference, as differentiating adipocytes experience a reduction in saturated fatty acids in the LD phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arisawa et al., 2013</xref>), and in their PC/PE ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">HÃ¶rl et al., 2011</xref>), which could increase the permeability of the LD membranes; we previously observed that a change in the molecular structures of TAG results in an altered migration pattern to the LD surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohammadyani et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>During LD fusion by lipid transfer, the pressure gradient experienced by LDs favours TAG flux from small to large LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gong et al., 2011</xref>). However, the implication of PA, a minor component of the LD membrane, could represent a control mechanism, as it is plausible that the cell could actively influence the TAG flux direction by differently regulating the levels of PA in large and small LDs, which could be controlled by the activity of enzymes such as AGPAT3 and LIPIN-1Î³ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilfling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). This is a remarkable possibility, as a switch in the favoured TAG flux direction could promote the acquisition of a multilocular phenotype and facilitate the browning of WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barneda et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, Cidea mRNA is the LD protein-encoding transcript that experiences the greatest increase during the cold-induced process by which multilocular BAT-like cells appear in WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barneda et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, in BAT, cold exposure instigates a profound increase in CIDEA protein levels that is independent of transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). The profound increase in CIDEA is coincident with elevated lipolysis and de novo lipogenesis that occurs in both brown and white adipose tissues after Î²-adrenergic receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mottillo et al., 2014</xref>). It is likely that CIDEA has a central role in coupling these processes to package newly synthesized TAG in LDs for subsequent lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Importantly, BAT displays high levels of glycerol kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertin, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertin et al., 1984</xref>) that facilitates glycerol recycling rather than release into the blood stream, following induction of lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Portet et al., 1974</xref>), which occurs in WAT. Hence, the reported elevated glycerol released from cells depleted of CIDEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>) is likely to be a result of decoupling lipolysis from the ability to efficiently store the products of lipogenesis in LDs, therefore producing a net increase in detected extracellular glycerol. This important role of CIDEA is supported by the marked depletion of TAG in the BAT of Cidea-null mice following overnight exposure to a temperature of 4Â°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>) and by our finding that CIDEA-dependent LD enlargement is maintained in a lipase-negative yeast strain.</p><p>Cidea and the genes that are required to facilitate high rates of lipolysis and lipogenesis are associated with the 'browning' of white fat either following cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosell et al., 2014</xref>) or in genetic models such as RIP140 knockout WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kiskinis et al., 2014</xref>). The induction of a brown-like phenotype in WAT has potential benefits in the treatment and prevention of metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Whittle et al., 2013</xref>). Differences in the activity and regulation of CIDEC and CIDEA could also be responsible for the adoption of unilocular or multilocular phenotypes. In addition to their differential interaction with PLIN1 and 5, we have observed that CIDEC is more resilient to the deletion of the N-term than CIDEA, indicating that it may be less sensitive to regulatory post-translational modifications of this domain. This robustness of CIDEC activity together with its potentiation by PLIN1 could facilitate the continuity of the LD enlargement in white adipocytes until the unilocular phenotype is achieved. In contrast, in brown adipocytes expressing CIDEA the process would be stopped at the multilocular stage, for example, due to post-translational modifications that modulate the function or stability of the protein or alteration of the PA levels in LDs.</p><p>Further work will be required to characterize the physiological differences between CIDEC and CIDEA, and determine the influence of their interacting partners and the role of proteins that are able to alter the LD PA levels, such as Lipin-1Î³. Abnormal accumulation of large LDs have also been observed in non-adipocyte cells under other pathological conditions such as liver steatosis and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krahmer and Walther, 2013</xref>). As enhanced expression of CIDE proteins have been linked to these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matsusue et al., 2008</xref>), the modulation of CIDE-triggered LD enlargement represents a potential therapeutic strategy that requires the elucidation of its molecular mechanism.</p><p>In summary, we found that during LD fusion by lipid transference, CIDEA ensures the close proximity of the LD membranes by forming trans complexes through its N-term and C-term dimerization sites. This protein complex will be anchored in the LDâLD interface, forming the molecular environment necessary for TAG transport across the membrane. Finally, the amphipathic helix embedded in the LD membrane interacts with the cone-shaped phospholipid PA, generating a local perturbation of the monolayer integrity that would increase its permeability to TAG and enable its exportation to the acceptor LD. The new mechanistic insight into the molecular events underpinning LD dynamics revealed by this study highlights CIDEA and PA production as targets for therapeutic modulation of LD accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and antibodies</title><p>The coding region of murine Cidea, Cideb, Cidec, Dff40, and Dff45 were cloned into the vector pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) to obtain the v5-tagged versions of the proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hallberg et al., 2008</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. All the reviewers were experts in lipid-binding proteins, and two were experts in the structural biology of protein-lipid interactions.</p><p>All three reviewers thought that this manuscript was interesting and that it contained novel and important information governing the biology of lipid droplets in adipocytes. The authors propose that the growth of lipid droplets involves the binding of an amphipathic helix in CIDEA to phosphatidic acid (PA), and that LD pairs are docked by CIDEA trans complexes through contributions of the N-terminal domain and a C-terminal dimerization region. All three reviewers had substantial concerns about the function of the amphipathic helix in CIDEA. Their concerns are listed below and should be addressed. Specifically:</p><p>1) The authors should provide more information regarding the function of this domain, particularly the specificity of the interaction with phosphatidic acid. Many criticisms center on this issue.</p><p>2) The reviewers were uncertain about the validity of the experimental systems that were used in this paper. All three reviewers wanted to see experiments that would directly assess the binding of the amphipathic helix (as well as mutant amphipathic helices) to a lipid monolayer at an aqueous interface. The authors should either use liposomes of defined composition or use a variety of oil-water interface systems that have been used to study the biophysical properties of amphipathic helices in other proteins, for example plasma apolipoproteins. These additional studies are important.</p><p>3) The manuscript has a very large amount of information, reflecting considerable work. Many of the figures are impressive. However, it would be helpful to specify how many times each experiment was repeated.</p><p>4) Also, with respect to the western blots, most of them showed only &quot;cut-out&quot; bands, and it was not clear whether those bands were taken from the same experiment and the same western blot. Please clarify. And if the bands were taken from different experiments, please discuss how the studies were interpreted.</p><p>5) Also, as noted by the reviewers, several of the experiments contained an insufficient number of controls.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>CIDEA is a lipid droplet (LD)-protein enriched in brown adipocytes promoting the enlargement of LDs which are dynamic, ubiquitous organelles specialized for storing neutral lipids. The authors propose that this process involves phosphatidic acid (PA) binding to an amphipathic helix in CIDEA, and that LD pairs are docked by CIDEA trans complexes through contributions of the N-terminal domain and a C-terminal dimerization region.</p><p>Overall, this is an excellent to outstanding paper, which reveals new mechanisms in the formation of lipid droplets in adipocytes. The notion that the CIDEA amphipathic helix interacts avidly and specifically to phosphatidic acid is critical for this paper. I believe that the authors should make an attempt to document that the binding of CIDEA to a phospholipid-water interface (with or without triolein) interface and document changes in surface pressure, with the goal of documenting the specificity of the interaction with PA.</p><p>Some of the experiments need additional controls. For example, I would like the authors to better document the CD spectra of the mutant helix containing the Glu mutations. How about showing data for the mutant helix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F and 2G</xref>?</p><p>Also, this reviewer would like to know more information about the specificity of the amphipathic helix interactions with PA. Would the interaction occur if the Arg residues were replaced with Lys or His, and if the Lys residue were replaced with Arg or His?

The authors propose that the growth of lipid droplets involves the binding of an amphipathic helix in CIDEA to phosphatidic acid (PA), and that LD pairs are docked by CIDEA trans complexes through contributions of the N-terminal domain and a C-terminal dimerization region. All three reviewers had substantial concerns about the function of the amphipathic helix in CIDEA. Their concerns are listed below and should be addressed. Specifically:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors should provide more information regarding the function of this domain, particularly the specificity of the interaction with phosphatidic acid. Many criticisms center on this issue.</italic> </p><p>The identification and functional characterization of the amphipathic helix in CIDEA C-term is one of the major strengths of our manuscript and in this revised form we provide substantial new data to further clarify its role in LD targeting and LD enlargement.</p><p>The role of the amphipathic helix controlling the LD localization of CIDEA has been further explored using complementary approaches following the reviewersâ suggestions: i) By CD spectroscopy we have determined the stabilization of the helical structure through interaction with liposomes of different composition. ii) We have extended our CG-MD simulations by analysing a range of mutant peptides with LDs containing or lacking PA, showing a remarkable concordance with our in vitro and cellular data. iii) We have demonstrated that the conjugation with the 18-amino acid sequence is sufficient to target the soluble N-term fragment of CIDEA into LDs and induce their clustering.</p><p>Whereas specific protein-lipid interactions can control the selective membrane translocation of soluble proteins to certain organelles, we do not claim that the interaction of CIDEA and the LD membrane is mediated by PA-binding. In fact, our data clearly indicate that LD-targeting is independent of PA binding. Firstly, we found that some mutants that are incapable of binding PA and promoting LD enlargement can efficiently target the LDs. Secondly, the depletion of PA in LDs by LIPIN-1Î³ prevents CIDEA-induced LD enlargement but does not affect the LD localization of CIDEA. Thirdly, our CD analysis and GC-MD simulations reveal that interaction with liposomes or modelled LDs does not require the presence of PA.</p><p>In addition to its role in LD-targeting, we demonstrate that the amphipathic helix is essential for the LD enlargement step and that this process depends on the interaction of CIDEA with PA through this domain. It is important to emphasise that we are not claiming that CIDEA only binds PA as in this paper we show that it can interact with other phospholipids such as cardiolipin or phosphatidylinositol phosphates. We have focused on PA due to its suggested role in modulating membrane dynamics to facilitate LD enlargement and the recent identification in LDs of enzymes that generate and consume PA (AGPAT3 and LIPIN-1Î³). Importantly, our data unequivocally demonstrate that CIDEA can interact with PA and that the presence of PA is necessary for CIDEA activity. PA depletion in yeast and mammalian cell models prevents LD enlargement without affecting the LD localization of CIDEA, and we demonstrate that the amphipathic helix is essential for PA-binding and LD enlargement, as its disruption by truncation of the protein or amino acid substitutions results in the prevention of both processes. Finally, the additional CG-MD simulations of the PA-helix interaction in the context of the LD membrane have been utilized to clarify the potential role of PA in the molecular mechanism of CIDEA action (detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The reviewers were uncertain about the validity of the experimental systems that were used in this paper. All three reviewers wanted to see experiments that would directly assess the binding of the amphipathic helix (as well as mutant amphipathic helices) to a lipid monolayer at an aqueous interface. The authors should either use liposomes of defined composition or use a variety of oil-water interface systems that have been used to study the biophysical properties of amphipathic helices in other proteins, for example plasma apolipoproteins. These additional studies are important.</italic> </p><p>We have instigated successful new biophysical investigations of interactions between CIDEA and lipids. For this we have undertaken analysis of CD spectra of the CIDEA amphipathic helix and a non-amphipathic mutant in aqueous solution and then in the presence of liposomes of different compositions.</p><p>In addition we have substantially increased our range of CG-MD simulations, modelling the interaction of wild type and mutant helices with LDs composed of PC:TAG (400:200) and PC:PA:TAG (364:36:200). The different dynamics observed remarkably fit the results of our CD analysis of the peptide interaction with liposomes and the cellular phenotype induced by the different CIDEA mutants, confirming the validity of these simulations for the study of CIDE activity. This has offered novel insights on the nature of CIDEA interaction with PA, complementing our model for the mechanism of action of CIDEA.</p><p><italic>3) The manuscript has a very large amount of information, reflecting considerable work. Many of the figures are impressive. However, it would be helpful to specify how many times each experiment was repeated.</italic> </p><p>We have amended the legends and Methods section in the revised manuscript to clarify the number of times and replicates that were performed for each experiment. We have also clearly stated the number of transfected cells assessed for lipid droplet morphology by confocal microscopy per plasmid. The phenotypic distribution was performed in a minimum of three independent experiments for every construct (n &gt; 50 cells). Although the selection of microscopy images representative of the main phenotype of transfected cells is a common and valid practice in cell biology, we believe our approach, based on the quantification of the different phenotypes observed, has proved more reliable and informative. Together with the analysis of a large number of mutants this has permitted the identification and fine mapping of the different phases of CIDEA activity, providing novel insights for each of these processes:</p><p>LD targeting: we demonstrate that CIDEA is docked to the LD membranes by the insertion of an amphipathic helix.</p><p>LD-LD docking: by optimising our cellular model to minimize LD clustering independent of CIDEA-CIDEA interactions we have been able to functionally demonstrate the role of the N-term and C-term dimerization sites previously identified in CIDE proteins.</p><p>LD enlargement: we demonstrate that independently of its role in LD targeting, the amphipathic helix controls LD enlargement in a process that requires its interaction with PA.</p><p><italic>4) Also, with respect to the western blots, most of them showed only &quot;cut-out&quot; bands, and it was not clear whether those bands were taken from the same experiment and the same western blot. Please clarify. And if the bands were taken from different experiments, please discuss how the studies were interpreted.</italic> </p><p>The Western Blots referred to by the reviewers addressed protein interactions of wild type and proteins with truncations or amino acid substitutions. Separate Western blots were performed for the different expressed proteins. Our Western Blot analysis is completely valid for assessing protein interactions as each individual protein was always analysed on the same blot as the input of the same protein. The input protein confirms that the exogenously expressed protein was both successfully expressed and detected by Western Blotting and thus, we can definitively determine if there was a direct protein-protein interaction or not. Importantly, for the Co-IPs, where a positive interaction is shown, we have included negative controls, namely IPs from transfected cells in which the epitope-tagged protein targeted by the antibody has been replaced by an empty vector. As no protein was IPed with these controls, it shows that the protein not targeted by the antibody was not capable of being pulled down in the absence of its interacting partner. Therefore, the Co-IPed proteins are only pulled down and detected by Western Blot when a true interaction is present.</p><p><italic>5) Also, as noted by the reviewers, several of the experiments contained an insufficient number of controls.</italic> </p><p>In addition to developing a new assay for CIDEA CD spectrometry we have included the additional control of the peptide with substitutions F166R/V169R/L170R which was designed to disrupt its amphipathic nature. Our new data showed that the WT CIDEA amphipathic helix folded in the presence of DLPC liposomes whereas the peptide with amino acid substitutions under the same conditions was not capable of folding to an alpha-helix.</p><p>More controls were also requested to demonstrate the specificity of the protein interaction with PA. However, we have clearly shown a physical interaction between CIDEA and PA as well as a functional requirement for the interaction. Furthermore, additional investigations of binding specificity are not a requirement of our mechanistic model and we actually show that CIDEA can interact with other anionic phospholipids. As claimed in the text:</p><p>âWe utilized lipid strips to investigate the affinity of CIDEA for different lipids present in mammalian cell membranes, finding that it selectively bound a set of anionic phospholipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>)â.</p><p>Due to its relevance in LDs, the interaction with PA was further analysed using agarose-PA beads, a method that was validated by comparison with agarose-Protein A beads and by competition with soluble PC and PA. Once demonstrated its reliability, the assay was extended to additional CIDE constructs. The functional requirement of PA for CIDEA action was demonstrated in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>For the CG-MD simulations, we agree that additional controls were necessary. In addition to studying the effect of PA and eliminating the peptide terminal charges, we have included simulations with mutant and N-term helices to measure their behaviour in relation to that observed for the wild type.</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p><italic>[â¦] Overall, this is an excellent to outstanding paper, which reveals new mechanisms in the formation of lipid droplets in adipocytes. The notion that the CIDEA amphipathic helix interacts avidly and specifically to phosphatidic acid is critical for this paper. I believe that the authors should make an attempt to document that the binding of CIDEA to a phospholipid-water interface (with or without triolein) interface and document changes in surface pressure, with the goal of documenting the specificity of the interaction with PA.</italic> </p><p>We would like to clarify that we have identified that the LD-enlarging function of CIDEA is dependent on the binding of PA to an amphipathic helix. However, we show that CIDEA can interact with a range of other phospholipids and our proposed mechanism does not exclude that other negatively charged lipids present in LD membranes could contribute to CIDEA activity. However, the key role of PA is clearly demonstrated in the PA depletion experiments, which reveal the functional dependence of CIDEA on PA levels. Further details in our response to the role PA interaction in CIDEA function are outlined in our response to the editorâs comments (comment 1).</p><p>The measurement of changes in surface pressure in a phospholipid-water interface will help the characterization of the LD-binding process but is beyond the scope of this paper. However, with our new CD assays in the presence or absence of liposomes, we offer alternative biophysical evidence of the interaction between the amphipathic helix and phospholipid membranes. As expected, in line with our previous results showing that LD-targeting and PA-binding are independent processes, the presence of PA in the liposomes was not required for the stabilization of the peptideâs helical structure.</p><p><italic>Some of the experiments need additional controls. For example, I would like the authors to better document the CD spectra of the mutant helix containing the Glu mutations. How about showing data for the mutant helix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F and 2G</xref>?</italic></p><p>We considered that the Glu mutations (K167E/R171E/R175E) would not offer an ideal control for the CD experiments. Whereas these mutations prevent LD enlargement and PA-binding, they do not influence the ability of CIDEA to target the LD membranes. In addition, as we did not observe significant differences in the CD profile of the wt helix by the addition of a 10% PA to the PC liposomes, we considered that the analysis of this PA-binding defective mutant would not offer additional information, other to confirm its unaffected folding and interaction with membranes. In contrast, as the CD assay proved a useful tool to analyse the interaction of the amphipathic helix with membranes (regardless of the presence of PA), we decided to analyse the effect of amino acid substitutions impairing LD targeting. In view of the previous results with CIDEA-(L169R/V170R)-v5, we added CIDEA-(F166R/L169R/V170R)-v5 to the LD phenotype analysis, observing impaired LD binding. These amino acid substitutions eliminate the amphipathic nature of the helix, by introducing positive charges in its hydrophobic face. Therefore, we chose the (F166R/V169R/L170R) peptide as a control for our new CD analysis. The new data represent a significant addition to the previous analysis by demonstrating that in the presence of DLPC liposomes, the wild type peptide shows enhanced alpha helical folding whereas the mutated version remains largely unaffected. The new data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>We acknowledged that the Glu mutant would be a valuable addition to the CG-MD simulations represented in the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F and 2G</xref>. The new simulations were performed with different peptides in LDs containing or lacking PA. In line with our previous results with the full length proteins, we observed that both the wt and the (K167E/R171E/R175E) peptides could be embedded in the different LDs, but only the wt could directly interact with the PA molecules. These data are presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p><italic>Also, this reviewer would like to know more information about the specificity of the amphipathic helix interactions with PA. Would the interaction occur if the Arg residues were replaced with Lys or His, and if the Lys residue were replaced with Arg or His? Please report the conservation of all residues within the helix in vertebrate evolution.</italic> </p><p>We have generated additional mutants to address this comment. The new data has been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We have included the following text in the Results section to describe the results of the relevant substitutions:</p><p>âThe absence of negative charges in the helix appeared as essential condition to permit TAG transference [â¦] it can carry a positive charge depending on the pH and local environment which could explain the activity retained by this protein.â</p><p>We have amended the manuscript to include a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>) reporting the conservation of the amphipathic helix across vertebrate species.

R171 was conserved across vertebrates including birds, snakes, lizards, crocodiles, turtles, marsupials, placental mammals, monotremes, although not in fish. R175 is also highly conserved with only birds, dolphin and Nile Tilapia (a fish) lacking this residue. Remarkably, an amphipathic helix is predicted in CIDEA of all the vertebrate species examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).â</p><p><italic>Much of the data in the paper appears to be bands cut out of a western.

In these experiments we are addressing whether there is a protein-protein interaction. Therefore, it is necessary to compare the immunoprecipitated protein with the input into the co-IP.

Furthermore, in this assay we show interactions with other anionic phospholipids. We selected PA for further study and demonstrate the functional requirement of PA for the enlargement of LDs by CIDEA in both yeast and mammalian cells. We are not claiming that the CIDEA only binds PA, but demonstrating that binding occurs and this is required for the function of CIDEA. Although we agree that alternative lipid-beads or competition assays with alternative phospholipids could be done to test which other species could bind CIDEA, CIDEC and LIPIN-1Î³, or if the Glu mutations selectively interfere with the binding of a subset of them, we consider that this information extends beyond the remit of this paper.</p><p>The specificity of the CIDEA interaction with PA in our assays with agarose-PA-beads was verified by the total lack of interaction with agarose-Protein A-beads. The strength of the assay was further validated with competition assays with soluble PA and PC.

These data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and described in the modified results section of the manuscript.

What does 4% b-sheet mean in context of an 18-residue peptide?</italic> </p><p>We have revisited the CD spectrum data. The concentration of the protein was measured by absorbance spectroscopy and the fit recalculated as we found the concentration lower than previously calculated based on the weight of the peptide alone. The re-analysed data has been re-plotted with units âÎµ (L mol<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>) and is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> with the fit estimates included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>. The peptides used in the CD study were 28 residues rather than 18 as stated in the Methods and thus also included non-helical flanking regions. The presence of b-sheet may indicate some degree of aggregation in the peptide solutions. Furthermore, peptides taken out of context of their full-length structures usually display a high degree of flexibility and thus display more random coil contributions than predicted based on sequence analysis.</p><p>In addition to re-plotting our CD analysis of the CIDEA amphipathic helix in detergent micelles, we also included new analysis of the wild type helix and helix with amino acids substitutions (F166R/V169R/L170R) in the presence or absence of liposomes. The addition of liposomes clearly induces the formation of helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

This is because the circular dichroism experiments were conducted with a larger peptide that included flanking residues and there was no evidence that this would give rise to a larger helix. Also, the secondary structure predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) do not indicate helix at the N-terminal side, and the C-terminal side only predicts a helical segment again after a break of 4 amino acids. Thus, given that there is no direct structural information that justifies the length of the helix, we only modelled the 18 amino acids that are strongly predicted to be helix. The reviewer is correct in noting the charges, and these have been omitted in the new simulations. Although the overall conclusions are not affected and the helix still binds to the lipid droplet, binding is now improved when PA was added to the system, in line with the experimental results.</p><p><italic>Paragraph two, subheading âA cationic amphipathic helix in C-term drives LD targetingâ: The in-silico studies show a representation of the process that the helix diffuses into the micelles (assuming that the helix is already formed in the aqueous phase). However, since models were used I would be extremely careful making quantitative statements as &quot;high affinity&quot; or &quot;quickly diffused&quot; since they are not associated with quantitative numbers. These conclusions would require much more calculations as presented in this paper. Does an arbitrary 'control' helix e.g. from the N-terminal domain which is not involved in LD targeting not diffuse into the micelle or at a significantly lower pace?</italic> </p><p>We have performed additional simulations with different helices to assess their relative affinity for the LD. In concordance with our cellular assays, we have confirmed that both the wild type and the K167E/R171E/R175E form a stable interaction with the LD and are embedded in the phospholipid monolayer. In contrast no LD binding was observed with the non-amphipathic mutants F166R/V169R/L170R. As suggested, we have included a control N-term helix, which did not interact with the LD. In concordance with the CD analysis in liposomes, the addition of 10% PA to the modelled LD rescues the impaired LD-targeting of F166R/V169R/170R, although it displays a superficial docking, confirming the importance of the helix amphipathic nature for its insertion in the LD membrane. The confirmation of the predicted behaviour of the different helices strongly supports the validity of this experimental approach to study the mechanism of action of CIDEA at the molecular level. We have not used quantitative statements such as âhigh affinityâ or âquickly diffusedâ in our description of the new CG-MD data.</p><p><italic>Subheading âLD-LD docking is induced by the formation of CIDEA complexesâ: The entire section puts forward very strong conclusions based on just one type of experiments. I suggest that other techniques could be used to test the protein-protein interaction.</italic> </p><p>We have based our conclusions on two complementary approaches, namely Co-IP and confocal microscopy to determine LD-LD docking. The Co-IP is a reliable assay for determination of protein-protein interactions. Other assays such as GST pulldowns would not reveal additional mechanistic insight into the protein-protein interactions we have demonstrated. The dimerization of the N-term fragments of CIDE proteins had been previously characterized by NMR, X-ray crystallography, co-IP, and gel filtration assays, as referenced in the manuscript. The novelty of our approach is the combination of the co-IP data, to test the existence of interactions with the LD-LD docking analysis. This has provided the functional demonstration of the hypothesized role of CIDEA-CIDEA interactions in LD-LD docking, and has revealed that both the N-term and C-term dimerization sites can contribute to this process. To achieve this goal, our cell culture model was optimized to reduce the presence of spontaneous LD clusters to facilitate the study of CIDEA-induced LD clustering by the identification of LD-LD docking defective mutants. Numerous endogenous LD clusters are observed in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells, which have been previously used for functional studies on CIDE proteins. In contrast, our Hela cells contained few LDs in basal conditions, and LD formation was induced by BSA-oleate treatment 24 hours after transfection. The newly formed LDs were dispersed thorough the cytoplasm and were targeted by the different CIDEA constructs already present, which could promote their docking and enlargement during a short period of time before fixation (18 hours). This experimental setting largely prevented the LD-LD docking activity by endogenous LD proteins, allowing the disclosure of LD-LD docking defective CIDEA mutants.</p><p>Our new studies with HA-(1-117)-(163-180) offer additional evidence on the role of the N-term domain in LD-LD docking, showing the appearance of LD clusters when the soluble N-term fragment is directed to the LD membranes by the amphipathic helix.</p><p><italic>Paragraph three of the aforementioned subsection: I do not see the CoIP of CIDEA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</italic> </p><p>This data has been included in the revised manuscript (now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p><italic>Single point mutants in the N-terminal domain (R47E, E79Q/D80N) also show major phenotypic effects and should be discussed in more detail, especially in light that 3D structures with high sequence identify in these region are available.

We have undertaken new CD analysis of CIDEA peptides in aqueous buffer in the absence and presence of liposomes. These data show that helicity of the CIDEA AH is enhanced in the presence of liposomes. Significantly, we show that amino acid substitutions that eliminate the amphipathic nature of the helix reduce helical folding even in the presence of liposomes (DLPC).</p><p><italic>2) Show that interactions with TAG emulsions increase (or otherwise modified) with addition of PA to surface monolayers.</italic></p><p>We were indeed able to show that with CD analysis while DLPC liposomes were unable to promote folding of the CIDEA helix with amino acids substitutions F166R/V169R/L170R (designed to eliminate the amphipathic nature due to additional charge of R compared to the hydrophobic residues in the WT), DLPA:DLPC (1:9) liposomes were able to facilitate helical folding.</p><p>Using CG-MD simulations to model the molecular dynamics of the helix-LD interaction we have observed that PA is not required for LD targeting, confirming our previous observations separating PA-binding from LD-targeting. However we have observed a faster interaction of the wt helix with LDs containing PA. Remarkably we have observed the direct interaction of PA with the polar residues of the wt helix, whereas the inactive K167E/R171E/R175E avoids the PA molecules. This has offered further evidence to support our molecular model for the activity of CIDEA.</p></body></sub-article></article>
