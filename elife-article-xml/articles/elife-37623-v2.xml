Thus, individual differences in redox status can give rise to distinct sub-populations even among cells with identical genetic backgrounds. Here, we have created a novel methodology to track redox status at single cell resolution using the redox-sensitive probe Grx1-roGFP2. Our method allows identification and sorting of sub-populations with different oxidation levels in either the cytosol, mitochondria or peroxisomes. Using this approach, we defined a redox-dependent heterogeneity of yeast cells and characterized growth, as well as proteomic and transcriptomic profiles of distinctive redox subpopulations. We report that, starting in late logarithmic growth, cells of the same age have a bi-modal distribution of oxidation status. A comparative proteomic analysis between these populations identified three key proteins, Hsp30, Dhh1, and Pnc1, which affect basal oxidation levels and may serve as first line of defense proteins in redox homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>redox sensors</kwd><kwd>redox biology</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>roGFP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003483</institution-id><institution>Hebrew University of Jerusalem</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Joint Berlin-Jerusalem postdoc fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ilyas</surname><given-names>Sidra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007537</institution-id><institution>Freie Universität Berlin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Joint Berlin-Jerusalem postdoc fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ilyas</surname><given-names>Sidra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1765/13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reichmann</surname><given-names>Dana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDA00064/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reichmann</surname><given-names>Dana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reichmann</surname><given-names>Dana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001742</institution-id><institution>United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reichmann</surname><given-names>Dana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie Curie Career Integration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>618806</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reichmann</surname><given-names>Dana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of aging yeast cells using the in-vivo roGFP2-based probe reveals redox-dependent heterogeneity, reflected in a bi-modal distribution of the oxidation status, differential growth and replication, as well as distinct proteomic and transcriptomic profiles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular redox status has long been known to play a role in aging and cell functions, with increasing evidence linking aging-related diseases to changes in oxidation levels in a variety of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Niedzielska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Paiva and Bozza, 2014</xref>). Oxidative stress has been found to correlate with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein aggregation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Madeo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Squier, 2001</xref>), as well as a number of other physiological changes that ultimately occur in a heterogenic manner.</p><p>A series of useful probes developed in recent years have enabled assessment of redox changes within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banach-Latapy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lukyanov and Belousov, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meyer and Dick, 2010</xref>). These are applicable in multiple organisms and can be targeted to sub-cellular compartments to report changes within specific organelles. While some of the probes are non-optical or luminescence-based, the majority are fluorescence-based, meant to identify changes in either signaling and regulatory oxidants, or redox homeostasis related redox couples such as glutathione (GSH/GSSG). One prominent redox sensor is the redox-sensitive GFP variant (roGFP) fused to human Glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1) known as Grx1-roGFP2 which senses the glutathione redox potential, with additional variants targeting it to organelles such as the mitochondria or peroxisome. Other roGFP-based sensors specifically monitor changes in hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) levels, through use of thioredoxin peroxidases fused to roGFP molecules. These and other similar probes have been used to conduct real-time measurements of redox potentials in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van der Heijden and Finlay, 2015</xref>), <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braeckman et al., 2016</xref>), plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meyer et al., 2007</xref>), and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dooley et al., 2004</xref>), by monitoring differences in oxidative status under a range of diverse conditions.</p><p>Detection of roGFP redox-dependent fluorescence has generally been based either on imaging individual cells by microscopy, or by measuring the total fluorescence signals of cells in suspension by using plate readers. However, neither approach enables high spatiotemporal resolution in widescale tracking of cell to cell diversity, nor subsequent isolation of cells based on their redox status.</p><p>Over the last decade, numerous studies have pointed to the fact that populations of genetically identical cells are heterogeneous in their protein and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maamar et al., 2007</xref>), exhibiting an array of differences in cellular behavior and in varying abilities to respond to changing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschuler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avery, 2006</xref>). This cell-to-cell variability is considered to be one of the crucial features in the evolution of new survival strategies in fluctuating environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschuler et al., 2010</xref>), antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gefen and Balaban, 2009</xref>), pathogen progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avraham et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lieberman et al., 2014</xref>) and other processes. However, the cell-to-cell heterogeneity of redox status within a population of synchronized cells (i.e. cells that have a shared chronological age) with an identical genetic background has not yet been explored.</p><p>Here, we developed a highly sensitive methodology based on the Grx1-fused roGFP2 redox sensor that uses flow cytometry to measure the redox state of individual cells within a heterogeneous <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (henceforth referred to as yeast) population during chronological aging. Sorting of the yeast cells based on their oxidation status allows us to define the phenotypic, proteomic and transcriptomic profiles associated with the redox state of genetically identical cells of similar chronological age. We show that the proteomic and transcriptomic profiles of reduced and oxidized cells differ within a yeast population, in addition to corresponding changes in growth and cellular division. Comparative proteomic analysis identified three key proteins: the chaperone Hsp30, the helicase Dhh1, and the nicotinamidase Pnc1, which affect basal oxidation levels and might serve as first line of defense proteins in glutathione-dependent redox homeostasis.</p><p>We also demonstrate that although the ratio between the oxidized and reduced yeast subpopulations changes during chronological aging, the major features, including the transcriptome and proteome, remain linked to the redox status through 72 hr. By using cell imaging, we further show that there is a threshold of oxidation, above which the cell cannot maintain redox homeostasis (according to the glutathione-based probe). Finally, microscopic observations of budding cells show that once a mother cell is close to or above this threshold, it passes the oxidized state onto the daughter cell, which starts its life from a high, inherited oxidation level.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Flow cytometry based methodology provides a highly accurate way to monitor the subcellular redox status of individual yeast cells</title><p>Cellular redox status has been suggested to be correlated with cell function and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reverter-Branchat et al., 2004</xref>).

First, we determined the degree of probe oxidation expressed in cells by measuring the differential Grx1-roGFP2 fluorescence under oxidative and reducing conditions (15 min treatment with 8 mM Diamide and 40 mM DTT, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), noting that the alternating peak pattern at 405 and 488 nm reflects a modestly different ratio than that identified using a plate reader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) rooted in the differences between the instruments (i.e. sensitivity), mode of measurement and live-cell diversity. To focus on living cells within a wild type (BY4741), untreated population, we gated out the dead cells and identified Grx1-roGFP2 negative cells, leaving only cells that had a fluorescence intensity at both 405 and 488 nm. The advantage of using the ratiometric approach is that the outcome does not depend on probe expression, which can vary with age and/or treatments. The 405/488 nm ratios of reduced and oxidized cells were significantly different and could be characterized using linear fits with a slope of 3.57 for oxidized and 0.6 for reduced cells (the correlation coefficients (R<sup>2</sup>) were 0.99 and 0.97 for oxidized and reduced cells, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). This approach enabled us to quantitatively determine a normalized value (OxD) which ranges from 0 (reduced) to 1 (oxidized), as described in the Materials and methods section, and to apply it to the quantification of the relative redox status of the cells.</p><p>The discrete difference between the oxidized and reduced states enabled us to create gates for oxidized and reduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), such that we could sort and characterize yeast subpopulations according to their redox status. This approach was also applied to organelle-specific redox sensors, such as the mitochondrial Grx1-roGFP2-Su9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kojer et al., 2012</xref>) and the peroxisomal Grx1-roGFP2-SKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elbaz-Alon et al., 2014</xref>), revealing a similar redox sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Defining redox-dependent heterogeneity in a chronologically aging population</title><p>The association between chronological aging and cellular oxidation has been explored in previous studies, with research indicating that older cells in a culture undergo changes in their cellular redox status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandes et al., 2013</xref>).

When we examined the distribution of the fluorescence intensity ratios of Grx1-roGFP2 (at 405 and 488 nm) over four days of growth under chronological aging conditions (24, 48, 72, 96 hr), we found a clear bi-modal distribution of reduced and oxidized subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As the culture aged, the fraction of reduced cells decreased while the fraction of oxidized cells increased. This fraction comprised of higher 405/488 nm ratios as compared to the distribution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, reflecting the natural, average signal in an untreated cell which largely corresponds with the ‘oxidized’ gate, yet has a unique expression pattern. Notably, the largest shift from reduction to oxidation occurs after 48 hr of growth. Thus, we were able to monitor the time-dependent shift from reduced to oxidized subpopulations as the yeast cells aged. However, we noted that a majority of cells remained reduced over time, suggesting that despite the culture being in the stationary phase, some cells nonetheless undergo replication and produce reduced cells.</p><p>It is important to note that while the average OxD serves as a useful metric by which to analyze yeast populations by flow cytometry, its value diminishes somewhat on an individual, cell-to-cell scale. Unlike whole population averages or microscopy-based individual-cell assessments, the OxD value is not as sensitive to smaller deviations for individual cells within a population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is largely due to the difficulty in normalization of individual cells using fluorescence values derived from an average oxidized/reduced population, rather than comparison to a single cell (which would not be mathematically representative). As a result, this normalization masks cell-to-cell variability, resulting in inflated scales (e.g., 150% oxidation). Despite the limitations of using OxD normalization for individual cells of this kind, the distribution shape remains constant.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Growth differences between the reduced and oxidized subpopulations</title><p>Our original expectation, based on the current consensus, was of a gradual increase in the cellular oxidation status of all cells, thus we were intrigued by the observed bi-modal distribution. We decided to characterize in greater detail the reduced and oxidized subpopulations of aging cells, utilizing the previously described predefined flow cytometry gates to isolate these subpopulations by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). The sorted cell subpopulations (reduced and oxidized) were divided into three samples, in order to: monitor growth rate, quantify division events, and conduct proteomic and transcriptomic analyses. This process was repeated at least three times in order to provide biological replicates. Due to the low number of oxidized cells obtained after 24 hr growth, we focused on cultures aged 48, 72 and 96 hr.</p><p>The subpopulations of the same chronological age (i.e. cultures grown for 48 or 72 hr before sorting), displayed characteristic differences in their recovery growth rate, whereas the reduced cells exhibited a significantly faster minimal doubling time (MDT) at 48 and 72 hr relative to the oxidized population of the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These differences are indicative of an apparent impairment in the oxidized population’s ability to rapidly divide and grow as a culture, rather than any inherent inability to enter the logarithmic growth stage (as evidenced by the similar lag phase lengths, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). After 96 hr, both subpopulations had ostensibly similar doubling times following longer lag phases than younger cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), consistent with the fact that these were relatively old cells with decreased vitality, particularly among the oxidized cells.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37623.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Growth and division of reduced and oxidized subpopulations of yeast cells after sorting by FACS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Differences in minimal doubling time between the sorted oxidized and reduced subpopulations at different time points (48, 72, and 96 hr) measured by OD<sub>600</sub> in a plate reader.

Among the GFP-positive cells the subpopulation of cells with a lower bud scar count has a ratio that closely resembles early growth under standard conditions as described earlier, with a strong peak distributed around reduced ratios, and a very minor subpopulation in the oxidized range (6.5% in the representative figure) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The high bud scar subpopulation, meanwhile, clearly falls into the oxidized range (87.8% in the representative figure), with distribution of the corresponding 405/488 nm ratios indicating a wide peak around ratios higher than 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). However, a small minority of the subpopulation is nonetheless reduced, despite having undergone multiple divisions. Note, that a small group of cells fall slightly beyond the definitions of the defined gates, or has no GFP signal, hence percentages presented in the figures do not sum to exactly 100%.</p><p>During late growth (after 72 hr incubation), a marked shift occurs towards cells with an increased number of bud scars (p1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), with a smaller subpopulation of cells remaining with fewer scars (p3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) (i.e., cells that have divided fewer times during growth). Similar to early growth, the subpopulation that has undergone multiple divisions is overwhelmingly oxidized (87.6%), with a very small group of reduced cells (3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This latter group is of particular interest, as it represents cells that have undergone multiple divisions and replicative events, yet have maintained a reduced environment.</p><p>Interestingly, among the subpopulation with a lower bud scar count, we detect two distinct populations of cells with reduced and oxidized ratios. Unlike the early growth sample, a larger fraction of young mothers underwent oxidation (36.4 vs 6.5%), suggesting a transition from the largely reduced population at early growth to the highly oxidized population at late growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, cellular oxidation is not embedded solely in number of divisions, but also in the duration of the stationary phase (chronological aging).</p><p>Together, these results strengthen the correlation described earlier between the cellular redox state and cell divisions, here identifying a link between cells that have undergone multiple divisions and a strong tendency towards oxidation, though not an exclusive one. We observe that despite undergoing many replications, a small subpopulation of the mother cells remains ‘eternally reduced’, while there is a complementary subpopulation of cells that have divided relatively few times that begin life in an oxidized state. This suggests a strong, though not absolute, correlation between replicative aging and redox state. However, it is worth noting that these exceptionally rare cells (in both cases) are representative of the replicative aging model, rather than a chronologically aged culture, in which there appears to be greater turnover in terms of daughter cells and constant replication (including during the stationary phase).</p><p>Furthermore, we observe a shift in the redox ratio between the subpopulation of highly divided cells at early growth as compared to late growth, while the degree of cell divisions itself (as identified by Texas Red-X intensity) does not change. This points to additional redox changes unrelated to division and replicative events, correlated instead with chronological aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Comparison of proteome profiles of the reduced and oxidized subpopulations</title><p>In order to further characterize the oxidized and reduced subpopulations of cells, we utilized mass spectrometry to profile the proteome of these subpopulations after 48 and 72 hr of growth.

We identified a subset of 199 proteins showing statistically significant different expression profiles between the reduced and oxidized populations after 48 hr growth and 149 proteins after 72 hr growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary files 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>).

We hypothesized that clustered proteins might belong to a common pathway which would be significantly up- or down-regulated in a redox-dependent manner. Hence, to identify potential protein-protein interactions within the subset of differentially expressed proteins, we used the STRING protein interaction database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Szklarczyk et al., 2017</xref>) to characterize the possible interaction networks between these proteins.

Interestingly, the oxidized cells displayed an upregulated expression of ribosomal proteins, in which we identified 21 proteins belonging to 40 and 60S ribosomal subunits, suggesting relatively elevated levels of ribosomes under oxidizing conditions. Conversely, the reduced cells had high levels of proteins related to protein biosynthesis, tRNA-associated proteins, folding factors and chaperones. Hence we speculate that the oxidized cells may accumulate ‘non-functional’ ribosomes whereas the reduced cells were in the process of protein biosynthesis and energy production.</p><p>Moreover, elevated levels of cytosolic catalase T (Ctt1) and mitochondrial glutaredoxin (Grx2) were detected in the reduced subpopulation, likely preserving the reduced state of these cells. We also identified the upregulation of several proteins that have been linked to increased longevity, such as Dld1 and Gut2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Easlon et al., 2008</xref>), implying that the redox-dependent expression of these proteins may play an active role in cellular lifespans. Intriguingly, the reduced cells showed increased expression levels of proteins associated with stress granules and stress response, such as stress-induced heat shock proteins: Hsp30, Hsp70-type chaperone Ssb1, its ATP exchange factor, Sse2, disaggregase Hsp78, as well as the RNA metabolism proteins: DEAD-box helicase Dhh1, pre-mRNA cleavage protein Hrp1, translational factor Prt1, exonuclease Xrn1 and others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary files 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>).

However, future investigations should be done in order to understand the origin of this phenomenon.</p><p>As shown previously, Hsp30 is a potential ‘redox keeper’; its deletion leads to a bimodal redox distribution in cells, correlating with high protein levels in the reduced subpopulation.

To define the OxD* values we measured the fluorescence of fully reduced and fully oxidized cells at 405 and 488 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), as previously described. These measurements were conducted using diluted, unsorted populations of young cells during the early log phase, during which some cells had either lost their plasmid expression or were otherwise Grx1-roGFP2-negative throughout the 12 hr of growth as measured using confocal microscopy. Nonetheless, we successfully monitored specific OxD* changes in over 30 unique cells across 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–F</xref>), and clustered their oxidation trajectories during this time. Interestingly, a subset of these cells maintained their newly reduced state for over 12 hr (the length of the measurement), indicating a strong mechanism for maintaining a reduced environment within the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). An additional portion of these cells lost their GFP signal without an increase in the oxidation-related fluorescence profile. The majority of the reduced cells were able to ‘self-correct’ their oxidative status for relatively prolonged periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>) or for a shorter time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>) before undergoing oxidation. Surprisingly, this self-correction process existed only below a clear oxidation threshold, at an OxD* of approximately 0.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–E</xref>). Cells were able to reach OxD*s as high as 0.65 before returning to more reduced values as low as 0.4, at which state they could remain for several hours before crossing the threshold and undergoing rapid oxidation. However, we observed that once cells crossed the oxidation threshold, they were unable to correct their oxidative status and maintained high OxD* values until their eventual cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

To test the suggestion that some division-dependent aging factor was somehow capable of being transferred to the daughter cells, we looked at cases of OxD* changes in budding mother cells. We measured the mother cells OxD* during and immediately after division, as well as an hour after division. These cells were chosen on the basis of their clear Grx1-roGFP2 signals, as well as the ability to track changes over a long period of time without overlap or extreme movement. Remarkably, we observed that mother and daughter cells had identical OxD* values throughout division and immediately following separation, regardless of the length of division or the mother’s initial OxD* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A–C</xref>), thus demonstrating that daughter cells inherited even a relatively highly oxidized environment during budding. Moreover, some daughter cells were able to self-correct their inherited OxD* levels once the budding process was completed and were able to reach a more reduced state within less than an hour, even as the mothers crossed the oxidation threshold or maintained their original OxD* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>).

Studies in bacteria and yeast have revealed that cell-to-cell variation is encoded in the stochasticity of gene and protein expression in a normal or changing environment. Diverse mechanisms have been suggested, ranging from promoter activation and deactivation, the rate of mRNA and protein production, protein and gene modifications, and even metabolic exchange between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campbell et al., 2016</xref>). The typical readout of these processes is diversity in protein expression leading to differential growth under standard or stress conditions.</p><p>Here, we identified a new type of glutathione-dependent heterogeneity, originating in the redox status of cells, by focusing on cytoplasmic oxidation alongside chronological and replicative aging. Using a self-established, non-laborious methodology to quantify and isolate cells with different oxidation levels, we suggest that the redox status (up to 72 hr growth in standard medium) is a contributing factor in cellular growth and division properties. Clearly, other parameters, such as energy and glucose levels, will affect age-dependent oxidation. An interesting example of this may be seen in Knieß and Mayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knieß and Mayer, 2016</xref>), in which they find a distinction between fermenting and respiratory conditions on glutathione reduction. Here, they showed an increase in reducing glutathione potential during fermentation, while respiratory cultures have a higher oxidation during replicative aging. This distinction is interesting in comparison with our results regarding replicative aging under aerobic conditions, opening the door to future exploration. Nevertheless, on the basis of our monitoring the time-line of cellular oxidation in aging cells in culture, it is tempting to speculate that the transition from reduced to oxidized status is a threshold-based phenomenon that leads to the emergence of at least two distinct cell subpopulations with different growth potential and biochemical profiles.</p><p>Our detection of the redox status of aging yeast cells was based on the cytosolic redox-dependent fluorescent probe, Grx1-roGFP2, which depends on GSH/GSSG levels. The roGFP probes are well-established indicators of in-vivo redox potentials in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van der Heijden and Finlay, 2015</xref>), <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braeckman et al., 2016</xref>), yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>), plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meyer et al., 2007</xref>), and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dooley et al., 2004</xref>), monitoring differences in oxidative stress under a range of diverse conditions. Measurements of roGFP fluorescence are generally based on microscopy imaging, quantifying the OxD values for each independently or, conversely, deriving an average OxD value for the entire population of suspended cells. While the first approach is able to evaluate cell-to-cell variability, it is time-consuming and arduous. In the latter approach, direct fluorescence measurement of a population is fast but not sensitive enough to detect natural variations within a defined population. Our utilization of FACS combines the advantages of fluorescence measurement at the level of the individual cell with a high throughput ability to isolate living cells according to their redox-related properties. Due to the robustness of the Grx1-roGFP2 sensor, the parameters used to define the oxidation gates to quantify the redox levels in the cytosol, mitochondria and peroxisome were very similar. The discrimination between reduced and oxidized cells was clear-cut, enabling rapid and convenient measurements of biologically different samples collected at different days and conditions. These oxidation gates can be applied to any population of yeast cells expressing the roGFP2 variants to define the contribution of a specific gene or condition on cytosolic redox status or in organelles. Measurements of this sort may thus be conducted on a larger scale using knockout-library arrays, ultimately scanning a wide range of mutations and their redox impact across several days. This may contribute to identifying key proteins serving as regulators of redox-dependent heterogeneity or as ‘redox switches’, defining the ability to respond to various forms of oxidative and environmental stress as well. More generally, this approach is not restricted to yeast and may be used in any cell type - from bacteria to mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Identification of potential positive and negative glutathione-dependent modulators of redox homeostasis: Hsp30, Dhh1, and Pnc1</title><p>In this study, we identified three proteins that had a significant impact on the redox status of yeast at early and late stages of chronological aging: two negative regulators, Hsp30 and Dhh1 that maintain a reducing environment, and one negative regulator, Pnc1, deletion of which decreases cellular oxidation.</p><p>Hsp30 is a plasma membrane heat shock protein which is induced by different stress conditions, including heat shock, exposure to ethanol, glucose limitation, oxidation and entry into the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Piper et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seymour and Piper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thakur and Chakrabarti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2006</xref>) During heat shock, deletion of Hsp30 leads to inhibition of the Pma1H+ -ATPase, preserving cellular ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Panaretou and Piper, 1992</xref>). Moreover, deletion of Hsp30 is correlated with a decrease in superoxide dismutase (<italic>sod1</italic>) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thakur and Chakrabarti, 2010</xref>), which might correspond with elevated cellular oxidation. Interestingly, our transcriptomic and proteomic analysis revealed an opposite regulation profile of Hsp30, pointing to an upregulation of gene expression under an oxidizing environment after 48 and 72 hr of growth, alongside downregulation at the protein level at the same time. Moreover, deletion of Hsp30 led to a significant increase in cellular oxidation, suggesting that indeed high Hsp30 protein levels keep the cells reduced. The proteomics analysis showed that upregulation of Hsp30 in the reduced cells was coupled with its native partners, all of which were upregulated in the reduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>: Dhh1, catalase Ctt1, chaperones Hsp78 and Sse2, Hxt5, and Yro2). Interestingly, an orthologue of Hsp30, Yro2, had a similar protein-transcript anti-correlation; however, deletion of Yro2 had a lesser impact on the redox status than Hsp30.</p><p>An antagonistic abundance in the RNA and protein levels suggests a potential impairment of Hsp30 protein turnover in oxidized cells. Most probably, gene expression is induced upon oxidation but protein translation is not efficient enough to sustain levels of Hsp30 that would maintain the reducing environment. This correlates with the downregulation of protein biogenesis and energy production, along with increased proteasome activity in the oxidized cells. Thus, enhanced protein turnover (either due to low translation rates or high proteolysis rates) may push the transcriptional machinery to produce high levels of Hsp30 mRNA without reaching critical protein concentration that serves as a ‘redox keeper’ of yeast cells.</p><p>Furthermore, analysis of the cellular oxidation (405/488 nm fluorescence intensities) pointed to a unique bi-modular distribution of distinct reduced and oxidized populations of cells that are preserved during chronological aging. This suggests that Hsp30 enhances redox heterogeneity, and represents a fascinating role for Hsp30 that may be investigated further in the future.</p><p>In addition to Hsp30, we identified another potential ‘redox keeper’, a highly conserved RNA DEAD-box helicase Dhh1, whose protein levels are upregulated in the reduced cells and whose deletion leads to elevated oxidation from early stages of cell growth. Dhh1 is a stress granule-associated helicase, involved in mRNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Swisher and Parker, 2010</xref>). In contrast to Hsp30, deletion of the <italic>dhh1</italic> gene led to a global cellular collapse, altering growth, morphology, and possibly inducing high rates of apoptosis. Therefore, changes in cellular oxidation might be a secondary effect accompanying growth arrest. Interestingly, other stress granule-associated proteins were upregulated in the reduced cells, including mRNA cleavage factor Hrp1, the translation initiation factor eIF-4B, Tif3, 5'−3' exonuclease, Xrn1, and the eIF3b subunit of the eIF3 translation initiation factor, Prt. This might suggest that downregulation of these proteins leads to a collapse in redox status and migration of these proteins to p-bodies for mRNA decay and transcription inhibition. Interestingly, transcripts of all these proteins, except Hrp1, did not show significant change, suggesting that protein turnover or translation rate might play a significant role in the redox homeostasis, rather than gene expression.</p><p>In contrast to the positive effect of Dhh1 and Hsp30, the nicotinamidase Pnc1 was found to be upregulated in the oxidized cells. The null mutant had lower OxD levels than the wild type, suggesting that Pnc1 deficiency in cells with normal redox status might lead to reducing stress, while in oxidized cells its upregulation might have a different effect. Previous studies have shown that deletion of Pnc1 increases nicotinamide levels, which inhibit the histone deacetylase Sir2 and lead to apoptosis or a decrease in life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belenky et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gallo et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, we propose that Pnc1 might serve as a link between increased reduced stress, nicotinase accumulation, and a decrease in cell viability.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Threshold-based mechanism and mother-daughter inheritance underline cellular oxidation</title><p>Until now it was believed that most oxidative stress comes from age-dependent damage or genetic alterations. However, an intriguing observation of our study is that there were cells with increased OxD values but no division scars in a genetically identical population. To understand the source of oxidation of these ‘newly born’ oxidized cells, we decided to monitor changes in the cellular oxidation utilizing real-time imaging over 12 hr. When examining the distribution of oxidation levels across 12 hr, as expected, we found a clear decrease in the number of reduced cells over time, with the peak shifting towards oxidized, Grx1-roGFP2-negative and damaged cells. Notably, the redox status of cells fluctuated with time, suggesting the activity of a self-repair mechanism until a specific threshold is reached, approximately 70% of maximal oxidation; above this threshold, cells remain permanently oxidized. Analysis of the daughter cells revealed that their oxidation level was identical to that of their mother cells, lasting for several hours ‘after birth’. Since the oxidized state received by the daughter cells from the mother is maintained for several hours, and thus exceeds their duplication time, we suspect it is a regulated mechanism and not simple diffusion of the Grx1-roGFP2 sensor with predefined oxidation.</p><p>In the future, it would be interesting to characterize modulators of this intrinsic property of cells to maintain their redox status until the observed threshold, as well as to bequeath its redox profile to the daughter cells. For this, advanced technology should be developed enabling sorting cells based on their redox profile monitored during defined period of time. We believe that the methodology described here can be a basis for development of more advanced technology in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, growth conditions and Grx1-roGFP2 probes</title><p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study was the haploid wild-type (BY4741; <italic>MATα, leu2Δ3 his3Δ1 met15Δ0 ura3-0</italic>),as well as BY4741 deletion strains made using the pFA6 KO plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Longtine et al., 1998</xref>) provided by the Schuldiner laboratory.

The pellet was resuspended in synthetic media without uracil, supplemented with 2% glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simpkins et al., 2016</xref>), and transferred into an eight welled Seahorse XFp Flux Analyzer Miniplates (Seahorse Bioscience) coated previously with Concanavalin A (Sigma-Aldrich). Each well was loaded with 3*10<sup>6</sup> cells and miniplates were centrifuged at 50 g for 1 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>); the plates were then incubated in 30°C for 20 min without CO<sub>2</sub>. The Seahorse XFp Extracellular Flux Cartridge was incubated with the XF calibrant overnight at 30°C per manufacturers instruction and was used to calibrate the Seahorse XFp Analyzer. The miniplates were then analyzed with measurement of the basal oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidifications rates (ECAR) that correlate to oxidative - phosphorylation and glycolysis, using the following parameters: initial time 12 min, to allow equilibration of the samples, mixing 3 min, measuring 3 min, the temperature was set to 30°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Scar counting and budding</title><p>Samples were collected after sorting by centrifuging at 3,700 g for 5 min; the pellet was resuspended with 500 μl of PBS. After transferring liquid to Eppendorfs, samples were centrifuged at max speed for 1 min and the pellet was resuspended with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated 10 min. Paraformaldehyde was washed with PBS. The pellet was resuspended with 20 μl of PBS and 2 μl of Calcofluor (18909 SIGMA-ALDRICH) and incubated at room temp for 10 min. Samples were washed with PBS before placing on glass slides. Images were taken by confocal microscopy (Olympus FV-1200) and kept at 30<sup>c</sup> throughout the process. Scars and buds were analyzed using the ImageJ software and manually counted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Mother enrichment program system and scar count assessment</title><p>Cells were labeled with Sulfo-N-Hydroxysuccinimide-LC Biotin (Sulfo-NHS-LC Biotin) at a concentration of 2 × 10<sup>4</sup>/mL and stored on glycerol at −80°C until resuspension in filtered minimal modified casein amino acid medium containing 1 μM estradiol. The estradiol is necessary to induce elimination of the daughter cells, according to the Mother Enrichment Program. These samples were incubated for various time periods (0–72 hr) and harvested together. Cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation, followed by treatment with Texas Red-X conjugate of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) lectin (W21405, ThermoFisher Scientific) at a concentration of 0.02 mg/mL, which preferentially binds to bud scars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen and Contreras, 2004</xref>). Cells were then analyzed using flow cytometry with excitation at 405, 488, and 561 nm (as described earlier). Unlike earlier analysis, bud scar assessment was approximated into two groups, ‘high scar count’ and ‘low scar count’. Due to the expanded size of cells following increased division, the range of analyzed cells was enlarged accordingly to more accurately represent the new population. Similarly, detection of the oxidized and reduced subpopulations shifted slightly with the increased size and the corresponding gates were very moderately adjusted.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are extremely grateful to the director of the confocal unit, Naomi Melamed-Book for assistance and running of the cell imaging assays.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Temporal profiling of redox-dependent heterogeneity in single cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Agnieszka Chacinska (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michel B Toledano (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. As you will see from the individual comments, the reviewers appreciated the interesting question and a rich set of high quality data. However, in the current form the manuscript seems to be at the stage that is not sufficiently mature to invite well-defined additions and comments. Summarizing the reviewer’s comments, the paper requires some major shaping based on the three points, to 1) streamline and focus the story, 2) expand some parts experimentally and 3) apply more rigor when drawing the conclusions.</p><p>Ad. 1) as suggested in the individual reviews some part may be either omitted or better linked to the rest of the paper, including some additional analyses if required.</p><p>Ad. 2) several important issues have been raised. The manuscript definitely requires the clarification in terms of replicative vs. chronological aging, and clarification of the respiratory status of the cells. Furthermore, some of the other aspects should be addressed, e. g. specifying the role of the redox-changing proteins identified in this study. In case, if experimental clarification goes beyond the scope or is technically too challenging, the authors should carefully phrase the conclusions in reference to the point 3).</p><p>Given the high potential of the story seen by the reviewers, we would like to encourage the resubmission of the manuscript. To have high chances in <italic>eLife</italic>, the manuscript must be properly revised in terms of all three points mentioned above, including new experimental data. The revised version of the manuscript will likely be evaluated by the same reviewers who are willing to have another look.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting resource paper that identifies a phenotypic variability in the yeast population in terms of the cellular redox state of glutathione. The authors used an in vivo redox sensor to isolate different populations of cells being with a more oxidized or more reduced status. The populations have been characterized for their fitness and systematically analyzed to identify the differences in the abundance of proteins and in transcriptomics.</p><p>The paper is rich in data centered around a really interesting question. It gives a first systemic glance on the molecular changes underlying the phenomenon of variability in redox states of the cells and their dynamics in time and during cell division. The data are slightly descriptive, but this is a resource paper.</p><p>The following points should be taken under considerations to revise the work:</p><p>- The three proteins identified in the study based on their enrichment in the reduced or oxidized state were functionally examined and concluded to take part in dynamic processes that shape the redox potential of the cell. Hsp30 was in fact implicated earlier. Having established such exciting technology the authors are able to ask more precise questions on which stage these proteins act. Does their absence modify the dynamics of cellular redox changes in the entire population by changing the redox state values of both population groups? Do they affect a bimodal behavior observed in the cell population, i.e. by modifying the number of reduced vs oxidized cells? Does their absence change the ability to enter into the irreversible phase of the oxidized state, or perhaps the daughters of old oxidized mothers are less efficiently recovering into a reduced state?</p><p>- There are plenty of examples, in this study and literature, that the transcriptomics and proteomics frequently do not agree perfectly well. It would interesting to undertake more systematic analyses to see the extent of correlations.</p><p>- This is somewhat not surprising that the daughter cell inherits the redox status, also the oxidized status, from the mother. An interesting and surprising thing is however that some daughter cells may retain the ability to recover as briefly mentioned at the end of the Results section. This part is somehow slightly underdeveloped in the manuscript. Could the authors develop this part further?</p><p>- The authors should avoid bold statements. As already mentioned, the results are largely of correlative nature, and causes and consequences are unclear. For example, I do not see the basis for the following statement: &quot;…we suggest that the redox status, rather than cell age, is a critical determinant of cellular growth and division properties&quot;. The text should be carefully evaluated to avoid the statements that do not have a source in literature or in the authors data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, Reichmann and colleagues measured the redox state of the GSH redox probe Grx1-roGFP2 in the cytosol of yeast cells during chronological aging, and found that the probe oxidized overtime. They could then distinguish two subpopulations, one that remained reduced, but diminished during aging, and the other more oxidized that increased. They sorted these two populations by FACS, and inspected their growth phenotype, their transcriptome and proteome. They identified 4 proteins that are differently expressed in the two subpopulations, and tested their influence on the redox state of roGFP2 by the effect of the corresponding gene deletions. They conclude on the presence of a redox heterogeneity within the same cell population that can be transmitted to daughter cells.</p><p>This is an interesting paper that addresses a wild unexplored question of possible redox heterogeneity within a yeast population, and provides an intriguing answer to as the basis of the observed heterogeneity, and possible role of a few selected protein in redox control/aging. The enormous amount of work presented appears very rigorously performed.</p><p>There is, however, a concern regarding the interpretation of the data of Figure 4, on which the paper's conclusion is built up. Authors distinguished within a yeast population undergoing chronological aging two subpopulations with a different roGFP2 redox state. Upon inspection of these populations, they found that the reduced one had very few bud scars (&lt; 1), and the oxidized one 3-4.5 more scars: the question is whether the two subpopulations differ by their replicative aging status, with those remaining reduced being newly born daughter cells, and those that oxidize being mother cells, which already underwent a few division, which would be consistent with their growth phenotype, and with the notion that cells oxidize Grx1-roGFP2 during replicative aging, when grown in a respiratory medium (Kniess and Mayer, 2016)? If this the case would collapse the authors' claim that the differences of the two subpopulations are redox, intrinsically, and not age-dependent.</p><p>There are a few other points that must be addressed, as described below.</p><p>1) Authors must evaluate the possible difference in replicative aging status between the two cells subpopulations: At best, they could sort old and young cells, based on the number of budscars, as done by Kniess and Mayer, and evaluate the redox state of their cytosol during chronological aging, or simultaneously sort cells according to their redox state and budscar status.</p><p>2) Table 1 indicate the presence of 30% of reduced cell undergoing budding: It would seem however that chronological aging is the survival of a post-replicative stationary culture: please comment.</p><p>3) The mitochondrial status (respiration) should also be established within the two subpopulations.</p><p>4) Figure 3C: it is surprising to see that the increase in oxidation during aging gives oxidation values (ratio 405/488) higher than the one measured with diamide (Figure 1D). Please, comment. At best, data should be displayed here using OxD, rather than ratios of fluorescence.</p><p>5) The values of OxD measured in the cytosol are much higher than published ones using the same probe (Kojer et al., 2012): 0.3 in Wt cytosol (Figure 2A) vs. 0.1. These values are also different in the different figures, which makes the comparison with mutants difficult. In Figure 6E and 7D values in Wt are &lt; 0.1 and those of mutant similar to Wt in 2A. The total probe oxidation of ddh1D at 96 h is very surprising: are these cells dying? Please comment.</p><p>6) The first figures of the paper do not appear really informative and might distract/confuse the reader: Figure 1 displays published data (Kojer et al., 2012). Figure 2 does not provide any data that fit the current story, and use of Glr1 in 3 is not informative because it is known that Glr has a dominant function in reducing glutathione.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In their manuscript &quot;Temporal profiling of redox-dependent heterogeneity in single cells&quot; Radzinski et al. present a method to track the redox state of individual cells using a combination of genetically encoded fluorescent redox probes and FACS. Using this methodology, they discover a bi-modal distribution of reduced and oxidized yeast cells in a chronologically aging population. They then proceed to analyze these 2 subpopulations using proteomics and transcriptomics and follow up on some of their findings, identifying Hsp30, Dhh1 and Pnc1 as potential regulators of the cellular redox homeostasis.</p><p>The authors present an impressive amount of data and overall, their results suggest that current assumptions about the redox state in aging cells are too simplistic and need to be revised. A model that assumes a simultaneous and uniform decrease in the redox state in all cells of an aging population must be dismissed. And even when considering reproductive aging, the authors could show that daughters can &quot;inherit&quot; the oxidation state of their mothers.</p><p>However, some of their data analyses do not seem very productive, in particular some of the STRING-based interaction networks and the functional enrichment. A removal of parts of these analyses would probably not affect their overall conclusions. Should they decide to keep these analyses, they need to justify them and describe these analyses in more detail: What were the criteria chosen by the authors to identify an interaction in the interaction networks? What does it e.g. mean if &quot;Hsp30 is connected to Dhh1&quot;? Is it justified to have proteins that were up-regulated in both reduced and oxidized sub-populations in the very same interaction network? What does it mean, if proteins that &quot;interact&quot; are upregulated under diametrically opposed conditions? How were functions defined for the functional enrichment analyses?</p><p>The authors should also submit their proteomics and transcriptomics data to appropriate repositories (e.g. the EMBL PRIDE archive, ArrayExpress, or GEO).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Temporal profiling of redox-dependent heterogeneity in single cells&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the author did a great job. The reviewers were in fact impressed by the amount and quality of the majority of data. Overall the manuscript is rich in interesting and valuable conclusions. However, there are still some questions raised that require text clarification and discussion. These points are appended below and should be carefully and fully addressed and some shortcomings and limitations should be acknowledged.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to the issue of the oxidation data (the point 2 of reviewer 2). These data should be provided in a full version, and not only as ratios.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>1) The heterogeneity in probe oxidation the authors saw during chronologic aging might have been the result of differences in replicative aging, and not just of cellular heterogeneity; in other words, roGFP oxidation distinguished within an asynchronous chronologically aging cell culture old mother from young daughter cells.</p><p>Authors did a terrific job in isolating old mother cells, by genetic enrichment that select against young daughter cells, and now can establish correlations between replicative, chronologic life span and probe oxidation (Figure 5).</p><p>The 24 h data clearly indicates that roGFP oxidation follows RLS. Of the 72-h data, there is a superposition of RLS and CLS: since only mother cells are selected, those that still have a sufficient replicative potential, will therefore inexorably age replicatively, which is what shows Figure 5E, and therefore oxidize (according to the 24 h data). The oxidation shift observed in old cells at 72 h, relative to 24 h might be a consequence of CLS of old, already oxidized cells. Probe oxidation during chronologic aging is anyhow nicely shown in Figure 2.</p><p>In conclusion, the redox heterogeneity of a bulk cell culture must be, at least in a large part, contributed to by differences in replicative aging, a conclusion which should be applied to the all study: it is indeed delusive to consider that the 3% reduced cells within 72 h grown old mother cells (Figure 5E) to be representative of the initial reduced and oxidized population used for proteomics and transcriptomics: this might require a bit of reorganization of the paper. Another issue raised by these new data: they are surprisingly totally discrepant with those of Kniess and Mayer (2016), who found a reduction of roGFP2-Grx1 during replicative aging in fermentative medium): authors should definitely address this discrepancy.</p><p>2) In the previous evaluation, I asked: &quot;Figure 3C: it is surprising to see that the increase in oxidation during aging gives oxidation values (ratio 405/488) higher than the one measured with diamide (Figure 1D). Please, comment. At best, data should be displayed here using OxD, rather than ratios of fluorescence&quot;. Authors nicely introduced OxD values, which is understood as not fitting analyses of heterogeneous cell populations. However, they did not answer the first question: at best, in Figure 2C (former 3C), authors should show the abundance/405/488 ratio graphs for the control DTT and diamide, since they must have been done to calculate the OxDs of Figure 2A.</p><p>Another concern I had: &quot;The total probe oxidation of ddh1D at 96 h is very surprising: are these cells dying? Please comment&quot;. This tremendous oxidation, equal to the one seen with the diamide control, is extremely surprising. Accordingly, to convince readers, and also avoid any experimental caveats, it seems appropriate to directly measure the levels of GSH and GSSG in whole cells by enzymatic assay, in the same conditions as those of figure 2A (at least time 0 and 72 h) and Figure 7A. It should be acknowledged that this is not the best control, but the only available: whole cells monitoring of GSH and GSSG is biased by the sequestration of GSSG in the vacuole, therefore giving higher levels of GSSG than those actually present in the cytosol (Morgan et al., 2013).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37623.048</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>Prompted by the comments and suggestions we received, we included additional experimental studies moving beyond the previously described findings, and have significantly expanded our manuscript. Briefly, our revised manuscript addresses all of the points raised by the editors and the reviewers with new data, modified analyses and rephrased text, as is listed below:</p><p>The major revisions in the manuscript include:</p><p>1) Streamline and focus of the story. Based on all the reviewers’ comments, we have thoroughly reviewed, revised, and expanded figures, figure legends, the supplementary material, and the manuscript. Specifically, in response to Reviewer #2’s suggestions, we have removed the entirety of Figure 2, in order to better focus the current story, while also narrowing the scope of Figure 3 (now Figure 2) in order to increase the clarity of our findings. Additionally, in response to Reviewer #3’s comments, we have extensively adjusted our figures and manuscript to demonstrate the relations between different differentially regulated proteins in the oxidized and reduced subpopulations, moving significant portions to the supplementary material. Moreover, we more carefully rephrased the conclusion, as suggested by the reviewers to focus the story and avoid bold statements.</p><p>2) Clarification and distinction between replicative and chronological aging. In response to Reviewer #2’s remarks, we conducted replicative aging experiments (using the Mother Enrichment Program) (Figure 5). Moreover, we linked chronological and replicative aging by comparing the redox status of cells that have undergone multiple replication events with those that have undergone fewer events, at two chronological time points. While there were differences between the two time-points, the highly-divided cells nonetheless displayed a significantly stronger enrichment for oxidation at both time points. From this, we were able to conclude that there is a strong correlation between replication and redox status, though not an exclusive one, while chronological growth also impacts oxidation to a moderate degree. Importantly, we observed that despite undergoing many replications, a small subpopulation of the mother cells remains “eternally reduced”, with a complementary subpopulation of cells that have divided relatively few times that begin life in an oxidized state. This suggests a strong, though not absolute, correlation between replicative aging and redox state. Furthermore, we observe a shift in the redox ratio between the subpopulation of highly divided cells at early growth as compared to late growth, while the degree of cell divisions itself does not change. This points to additional redox changes unrelated to division and replicative events, correlated instead with chronological aging.</p><p>This potential heterogeneity was also observed in imaging of dividing cells during 24 hours. Some cells divided several times and maintained a reduced environment, while others underwent oxidation after a lower number of divisions.</p><p>We have modified the text and introduced a new figure accordingly (Figure 5). We thank Reviewer #2 for this suggestion as it clarifies a necessary component of the cells under examination.</p><p>3) Respiration status of subpopulations. In response to Reviewer #2’s additional comments, we addressed the question regarding the respiratory status of the oxidized subpopulation as compared with the reduced subpopulation. We found that the oxidized subpopulation has a lower respiration rate than the reduced subpopulation (Figure 4), which correlates nicely with growth, as well as with proteomic and transcriptomic profiles. We modified the text and introduced a new figure accordingly (Figure 4).</p><p>4) Expansion of analysis of the proteins identified in the proteomic study (Hsp30, Dhh1 and Pnc1). In response to Reviewer #1’s comments, we expanded our analysis of the proteins identified based on their enrichment in the oxidized or reduced subpopulations (Figure 7, Figure S7-S9). We compared the distribution of the 405nm and 488nm ratios for each strain, observing that the distributions largely tracked with the average OxD. Moreover, we used organelle specific sensors, to examine a potential crosstalk between changes in cytosolic oxidation and redox homeostasis in mitochondria and peroxisome. We found that <italic>∆hsp30</italic> displays a unique bi-modal distribution (in the cytosol and mitochondria) at all time-points, with little change in response to chronological aging. On the other hand, the <italic>∆dhh1</italic> strain showed a global change in oxidation (in the cytosol and peroxisome).</p><p>Unfortunately, mitochondrial oxidation in the <italic>∆dhh1</italic> was impossible to quantify due to a low fluorescence signal in this strain. We further sought to clarify the differences in their growth by tracking each of these strains under confocal microscopy (Figure 7B), identifying unique growth patterns in accordance with their average characteristics. Interestingly, these two strains showed differences in their morphology, division and growth. While <italic>∆hsp30</italic> has wild-type-like growth and morphology, along with a higher number of oxidized cells than in wild type population, ∆dhh1 led to a more severe phenotype, including slow growth and an enlarged vacuole. Therefore, the effect of these genes is markedly different, with <italic>∆hsp30</italic> affecting the redox-related heterogeneity of cells, shifting cells to more oxidized without influencing their survival. In contrast, deletion of <italic>Dhh1</italic> results in a general collapse of different systems, including redox homeostasis. We thank Reviewer #1 for this helpful suggestion, and we will extend these finding in the future. The text was modified and new figures and videos were included in the manuscript and the supplementary material.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The following points should be taken under considerations to revise the work:</p><p>- The three proteins identified in the study based on their enrichment in the reduced or oxidized state were functionally examined and concluded to take part in dynamic processes that shape the redox potential of the cell.

We extended our analysis of the knockout variants and analyzed the distribution of the cytosolic (Figure 7), mitochondrial and peroxisomal (Figure 7—figure supplement 3, Figure 7—figure supplement 4) oxidation levels within the cell population during chronological aging, while also evaluating the effect of gene deletion on growth (Figure 7—figure supplement 2, Videos 1-4) and cellular morphology (Figure 7B). Moreover, as suggested, we monitored the redox status of the daughter cells of these mutants, with no changes observed relative to wild type cells. Similar to the wild type cells, the daughter cells inherited their mother’s oxidative status. However, a deeper analysis should be done in order to accurately quantify the recovery rate of different knockout strains. For this, we would need to develop a more efficient microscopy-based technology, enabling imaging of a large number of cells, originating from different mutants and detection of the redox status of these cells in either a semi-manual or automatic way.</p><p>Results of this analysis are described in the manuscript and summarized below:</p><p>“We found <italic>∆dhh1</italic> to be under considerable stress from the onset, with a weaker fluorescent expression and a significantly higher rate of apoptosis as compared to the other strains.

To address this issue, we conducted a correlation analysis of the mRNA and protein expression levels, plotting and identifying significantly differentially regulated proteins/transcripts across both groups (Figure 8C, Figure 8—figure supplement 2). These plots show that the overwhelming majority of proteins and transcripts are not significantly uncoupled in correlation between transcripts and proteins. However, we do note that the fraction of coupled versus uncoupled transcripts/proteins remains largely the same, suggesting unique regulatory mechanisms for certain transcripts/proteins.</p><p>Moreover, we modified the text accordingly:</p><p>“In examining the general correlation between the transcriptomic and proteomic analysis at 48h and 72h (Figure 8C, Figure 8—figure supplement 2), we find that while there is a global correlation in the trend (Figure 8C, Figure 8—figure supplement 2), there are several examples of uncoupling in significantly differential protein and mRNA expression (Figure 8C, Figure 8—figure supplement 2, dark red and purple bold circles). While protein expression typically corresponds with mRNA expression, expression of transcripts involved in regulatory roles (Marek and Korona (2013) and aging (Tseng-Rogenski et al. (2003); Chan and Marshall (2014)) have been found to partially decouple.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- This is somewhat not surprising that the daughter cell inherits the redox status, also the oxidized status, from the mother.

For this, we would need to develop a methodology that will be able to image (using confocal microscopy) and sort cells based on ability to recover, i.e. reduce oxidation levels in real time. This methodology should be able to deal with relatively large number of cells enabling biochemical or genetic analysis. Until now, we have manually followed dozens of cells and quantified their OxD levels AFTER the imaging experiment has been completed, leaving a majority of cells unsorted, with distinct oxidation status. Analysis of the wild type cells took an enormous amount of manual work, and resulted in a relatively small subset of data.</p><p>We completely agree that this is a very interesting finding, and therefore, decided to include it in the paper, even in its undeveloped stage.

The text should be carefully evaluated to avoid the statements that do not have a source in literature or in the authors data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have attempted to reduce the number of bold statements to more accurately reflect our results and conclusions.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] <italic>There is, however, a concern regarding the interpretation of the data of Figure 4, on which the paper's conclusion is built up. Authors distinguished within a yeast population undergoing chronological aging two subpopulations with a different roGFP2 redox state. Upon inspection of these populations, they found that the reduced one had very few bud scars (&lt; 1), and the oxidized one 3-4.5 more scars: the question is whether the two subpopulations differ by their replicative aging status, with those remaining reduced being newly born daughter cells, and those that oxidize being mother cells, which already underwent a few division, which would be consistent with their growth phenotype, and with the notion that cells oxidize Grx1-roGFP2 during replicative aging, when grown in a respiratory medium (Kniess and Mayer, 2016)? If this the case would collapse the authors' claim that the differences of the two subpopulations are redox, intrinsically, and not age-dependent.</italic> </p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are a few other points that must be addressed, as described below.</p><p>1) Authors must evaluate the possible difference in replicative aging status between the two cells subpopulations: At best, they could sort old and young cells, based on the number of budscars, as done by Kniess and Mayer, and evaluate the redox state of their cytosol during chronological aging, or simultaneously sort cells according to their redox state and budscar status.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and suggestion. We agree that correlation between oxidation and number of division raises a possibility that a reduced environment is an intrinsic and restricted property of newly born cells, that becomes oxidized during replicative aging. We followed the suggestion of the reviewer and established a replicative aging assay using the mother enrichment program. We were unable to use the method described in the Kniess and Mayer paper, instead utilizing a methodology which is based on enrichment of mother cells using selection against daughter cells. We applied sorting to isolate “young” (low number of bud scars) and “old” mother cells (large number of bud scars) at two different periods of stationary phase: early phase (24 hours of growth) and a prolonged stationary state (72 hours). The rationale behind this assay was that if reduction is indeed a property of newly born cells, we will have a similar, increased oxidation in young and old mother cells, without any dependence on duration of the stationary phase. As seen in Figure 5, the outcomes of this experiment strengthen the correlation described earlier between the cellular redox state and cell divisions, identifying a link between cells that have undergone multiple divisions and a strong tendency towards oxidation, though not an exclusive one. We observe that despite undergoing many replications, a small subpopulation of the mother cells remains “eternally reduced”, while there is a complementary subpopulation of cells that have divided relatively few times that begins life in an oxidized state. This suggests a strong, though not absolute, correlation between replicative aging and redox state.</p><p>Furthermore, we observe a shift in the redox ratio between the subpopulation of highly divided cells at early growth as compared to late growth, while the degree of cell divisions itself does not change. This points to additional redox changes unrelated to division and replicative events, correlated instead with chronological aging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Table 1 indicate the presence of 30% of reduced cell undergoing budding: It would seem however that chronological aging is the survival of a post-replicative stationary culture: please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the useful comment. To the best of our knowledge, and with agreement with other studies, chronological life span is defined as a period of time that nondividing yeast cells can survive. It is typically defined after entrance to the postdiauxic phase, which starts ~24 hours after initial inoculation, depending on medium and prolongs for few days depending on the growth conditions. During this stage, we and others had observed slow but detectable growth, which might result in these budding events shown in Table 1.</p><p>Therefore, in order to correlate more precisely between replication events and oxidation, we utilized an alternative model for aging, the replicative aging model, as described previously. It is important to note, that using the mother enrichment method we clearly detect replication at 48 and 72 hours of growth after the initial inoculation, suggesting that our finding in Table 1 are valid, though this may follow the significantly more diluted sample. We agree that this is not pure “post-replicative stationary phase”, therefore, having an alternative aging model in this study has prominent value, and we thank the reviewer for his suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The mitochondrial status (respiration) should also be established within the two subpopulations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Respiration was analyzed and presented in Figure 4. Here we found that oxygen consumption rate of the oxidized cells was consistently 1.8-2 fold lower than the reduced population. Decreased oxygen consumption is strongly correlated with reduced cell growth of the oxidized subpopulation vs reduced ones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3C: it is surprising to see that the increase in oxidation during aging gives oxidation values (ratio 405/488) higher than the one measured with diamide (Figure 1D). Please, comment. At best, data should be displayed here using OxD, rather than ratios of fluorescence.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. The ratios undergo a shift following natural oxidation of the cells, with all metrics suggesting that these changes lead to higher oxidation ratios than under diamide treatment. This would appear to be a unique expression pattern as a result of endogenous oxidation, clearly separate from the reduced ratios. Furthermore, due to the nature of OxD normalization and changes over time in expression, the distinction between the oxidized and reduced subpopulations would become more difficult to ascertain. Due to the lack of normalization in the 405/488 ratio, we believe this to be the more accurate metric. A clarification regarding this distinction has been added to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The values of OxD measured in the cytosol are much higher than published ones using the same probe (Kojer et al., 2012): 0.3 in Wt cytosol (Figure 2A) vs. 0.1. These values are also different in the different figures, which makes the comparison with mutants difficult. In Figure 6E and 7D values in Wt are &lt; 0.1 and those of mutant similar to Wt in 2A. The total probe oxidation of ddh1D at 96 h is very surprising: are these cells dying? Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have observed across numerous experiments with the roGFP probes (using these and other strains) a moderate variance in OxD values expressly depending on the culture/colony itself. Due to the fact that the plasmid is easily rejected by cells, we replace the colonies very frequently, and different transformations have subsequently led to different outright expression patterns. Furthermore, because OxD requires new diamide and DTT treatment for every experiment, the normalization is not always identical due to slight variations in treatment duration (between 5-20 minutes). For these reasons, we compared the deletion strains to a new wt colony transformed with them – all colonies from that batch displayed relatively lower OxD values due to some degree to normalization, though their redox ratios remained similar (shown in Figure 7C-F). Regarding the Dhh1 deletion strain, the high oxidation does indeed emerge alongside a high rate of death within the culture; this clarification has been added to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The first figures of the paper do not appear really informative and might distract/confuse the reader: Figure 1 displays published data (Kojer et al., 2012). Figure 2 does not provide any data that fit the current story, and use of Glr1 in 3 is not informative because it is known that Glr has a dominant function in reducing glutathione.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being clear regarding the rationale in providing Figures 1-3.</p><p>Figure 1 describes our strains expressing the Grx1-roGFP2 sensor, made specifically for this study. The rationale behind presenting this figure was to verify that we obtain similar fluorescence intensity spectrum as in the Kojer et al., 2012 paper as well as to explain the reasoning behind using the 405 and 488nm wavelengths. Therefore, we present here our own data, not published previously. The text was modified to clarify this point.</p><p>Regarding Figures 2 and 3, we agree that in the previous version these figures in part did not provide valuable data to fit the story. In the current version, we have removed the original Figure 2, as well as use of Glr1 in the original Figure 3 (now Figure 2). However, we have also decided to use the peroxisomal sensor in order to explore the potential crosstalk between oxidation in the cytosol, mitochondria and peroxisome upon deletion of proteins such as Hsp30 and Dhh1 (Figure 7—figure supplement 4).</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] However, some of their data analyses do not seem very productive, in particular some of the STRING-based interaction networks and the functional enrichment. A removal of parts of these analyses would probably not affect their overall conclusions. Should they decide to keep these analyses, they need to justify them and describe these analyses in more detail: What were the criteria chosen by the authors to identify an interaction in the interaction networks? What does it e.g. mean if &quot;Hsp30 is connected to Dhh1&quot;? Is it justified to have proteins that were up-regulated in both reduced and oxidized sub-populations in the very same interaction network? What does it mean, if proteins that &quot;interact&quot; are upregulated under diametrically opposed conditions? How were functions defined for the functional enrichment analyses?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion. We have accordingly removed several of the STRING-based analyses, while transferring the remaining figures to the supplementary material. The criteria for the STRING analysis in each case has been added to the supplementary figure legend and the text has been updated accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also submit their proteomics and transcriptomics data to appropriate repositories (e.g. the EMBL PRIDE archive, ArrayExpress, or GEO).</p></disp-quote><p>The proteomic and transcriptomic data have been uploaded to the PRIDE archive and GEO database respectively.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] We would like to draw your attention to the issue of the oxidation data (the point 2 of reviewer 2). These data should be provided in a full version, and not only as ratios.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The heterogeneity in probe oxidation the authors saw during chronologic aging might have been the result of differences in replicative aging, and not just of cellular heterogeneity; in other words, roGFP oxidation distinguished within an asynchronous chronologically aging cell culture old mother from young daughter cells.</p><p>Authors did a terrific job in isolating old mother cells, by genetic enrichment that select against young daughter cells, and now can establish correlations between replicative, chronologic life span and probe oxidation (Figure 5).</p><p>The 24 h data clearly indicates that roGFP oxidation follows RLS. Of the 72-h data, there is a superposition of RLS and CLS: since only mother cells are selected, those that still have a sufficient replicative potential, will therefore inexorably age replicatively, which is what shows Figure 5E, and therefore oxidize (according to the 24 h data). The oxidation shift observed in old cells at 72 h, relative to 24 h might be a consequence of CLS of old, already oxidized cells. Probe oxidation during chronologic aging is anyhow nicely shown in Figure 2.</p><p>In conclusion, the redox heterogeneity of a bulk cell culture must be, at least in a large part, contributed to by differences in replicative aging, a conclusion which should be applied to the all study: it is indeed delusive to consider that the 3% reduced cells within 72 h grown old mother cells (Figure 5E) to be representative of the initial reduced and oxidized population used for proteomics and transcriptomics: this might require a bit of reorganization of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the comment that the small subpopulation of reduced cells in mother enriched populations do not necessarily represent the reduced population sorted during chronological aging, in which the reduced cells are a majority. As previously suggested by the reviewer, there is constant division during the stationary phase which contributes to the reduced subpopulation pool. Therefore, it would be interesting, in the future, to use the replicative model for proteomic analysis to understand the origin of the reduced cells in aged mother cells, as well as the oxidized cells in the young mother population. In the meantime, we have modified the manuscript to address this point: “However, it is worth noting that these exceptionally rare cells (in both cases) are representative of the replicative aging model, rather than a chronologically aged culture, in which there appears to be greater turnover in terms of daughter cells and constant replication (including during the stationary phase).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue raised by these new data: they are surprisingly totally discrepant with those of Kniess and Mayer (2016), who found a reduction of roGFP2-Grx1 during replicative aging in fermentative medium): authors should definitely address this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>It is indeed a very interesting paper in which the authors compared the glutathione potential during respiration and fermentation growth, showing that during respiration the aged cells become more oxidized while during fermentation the opposite occurs. Nicely, we also see the same phenomenon in our cells, as grown under aerobic conditions. To emphasize this distinction, we have included the following:</p><p>“An interesting example of this may be seen in Knieß and Mayer (Kniess and Mayer, 2016), in which they find a distinction between fermenting and respiratory conditions on glutathione reduction. […] This distinction is interesting in comparison with our results regarding replicative aging under aerobic conditions, opening the door to future exploration.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the previous evaluation, I asked: &quot;Figure 3C: it is surprising to see that the increase in oxidation during aging gives oxidation values (ratio 405/488) higher than the one measured with diamide (Figure 1D). Please, comment. At best, data should be displayed here using OxD, rather than ratios of fluorescence&quot;. Authors nicely introduced OxD values, which is understood as not fitting analyses of heterogeneous cell populations. However, they did not answer the first question: at best, in Figure 2C (former 3C), authors should show the abundance/405/488 ratio graphs for the control DTT and diamide, since they must have been done to calculate the OxDs of Figure 2A.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the necessary distinction between the 405/488 nm ratios and OxD. Accordingly, we have included an additional figure presenting the distribution of the OxD values during chronological aging (“Figure 2—figure supplement 3) related to the data shown in Figure 2, alongside the existing Figure 1D, which shows the distribution pattern of the DTT and diamide treated cells.</p><p>We examined the data extensively in the previous and current versions, to define the best and most mathematically accurate representation of the data. While the OxD is the often-used metric, the necessary averaging of the fluorescence intensity of each cell within the population (for normalization limits) leads to an inaccurate scale and to expanded distributions. While the general trend is preserved, the actual OxD values are not representative (e.g., 150% oxidation).</p><p>Moreover, the sorting is done based on the ratio defined gates and not OxD. Therefore, we believe that it is more accurate and intuitive to use the ratio approach than OxD while analyzing cellular variability. In other cases, such as evaluation of the average redox status of a specific population or individual cells under the microscope, the OxD approach is more reflective and clear.</p><p>We modified the text accordingly to clarify this point:</p><p>“It is important to note that while the average OxD serves as a useful metric by which to analyze yeast populations by flow cytometry, its value diminishes somewhat on an individual, cell-to-cell scale. […] Despite the limitations of using OxD normalization for individual cells of this kind, the distribution shape remains constant.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another concern I had: &quot;The total probe oxidation of ddh1D at 96 h is very surprising: are these cells dying? Please comment&quot;. This tremendous oxidation, equal to the one seen with the diamide control, is extremely surprising. Accordingly, to convince readers, and also avoid any experimental caveats, it seems appropriate to directly measure the levels of GSH and GSSG in whole cells by enzymatic assay, in the same conditions as those of figure 2A (at least time 0 and 72 h) and Figure 7A. It should be acknowledged that this is not the best control, but the only available: whole cells monitoring of GSH and GSSG is biased by the sequestration of GSSG in the vacuole, therefore giving higher levels of GSSG than those actually present in the cytosol (Morgan et al., 2013).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the comment and addressed it within the text:</p><p>“Further investigation regarding their GSSG/GSH levels, particularly in <italic>∆dhh1</italic> with its enlarged vacuoles (40), would provide greater insight into the mechanism of oxidation/reduction within each strain.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
