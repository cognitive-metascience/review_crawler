at TA target sites. A crystal structure of the mariner transposase Mos1 (derived from <italic>Drosophila mauritiana</italic>), in complex with transposon ends covalently joined to target DNA, portrays the transposition machinery after DNA integration. It reveals severe distortion of target DNA and flipping of the target adenines into extra-helical positions. Fluorescence experiments confirm dynamic base flipping in solution. Transposase residues W159, R186, F187 and K190 stabilise the target DNA distortions and are required for efficient transposon integration and transposition in vitro. Transposase recognises the flipped target adenines via base-specific interactions with backbone atoms, offering a molecular basis for TA target sequence selection. Our results will provide a template for re-designing mariner/Tc1 transposases with modified target specificities.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15537.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15537.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15537.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The complete set of DNA in a cell is referred to as its genome. Most genomes contain short fragments of DNA called transposons that can jump from one place to another. Transposons carry sections of DNA with them when they move, which creates diversity and can influence the evolution of a species. Transposons are also being exploited to develop tools for biotechnology and medical applications. One family of transposons – the Mariner/Tc1 family – has proved particularly useful in these endeavours because it is widespread in nature and can jump around the genomes of a broad range of species, including mammals.</p><p>DNA transposons are cut out of their position and then pasted at a new site by an enzyme called transposase, which is encoded by some of the DNA within the transposon. DNA is made up of strings of molecules called bases and Mariner/Tc1-family transposons can only insert into a new position in the genome at sites that have a specific sequence of two bases. However, it was not known how this target sequence is chosen and how the transposon inserts into it.</p><p>Morris et al. have now used a technique called X-ray crystallography to build a three-dimensional model of a Mariner/Tc1-family transposon as it inserts into a new position. The model shows that, as the transposon is pasted into its new site, the surrounding DNA bends. This causes two DNA bases in the surrounding DNA to flip out from their normal position in the DNA molecule, which enables them to be recognised by the transposase. Further experiments showed that this base-flipping is dynamic, that is, the two bases continuously flip in and out of position. Furthermore, Morris et al. identified which parts of the transposase enzyme are required for the transposon to be efficiently pasted into the genome.</p><p>Together these findings may help researchers to alter the transposase so that it can insert the transposon into different locations in a genome. This will hopefully lead to new tools for biotechnology and medical applications.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15537.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15537.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>transposition</kwd><kwd>DNA integration</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>base flipping</kwd><kwd>time-resolved fluorescence</kwd><kwd>base analogues</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BJ000884</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>Julia M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>085176/Z/08/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>Julia M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and biochemical analyses of a eukaryotic DNA transpososome in the integration step reveal how mariner/Tc1 transposons are selectively integrated into a TA target sequence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transposable elements are ubiquitous in most genomes and promote evolution by generating genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biémont and Vieira, 2006</xref>). Invading transposons can alter genes, affect gene expression or spread drug resistance in bacteria. As shuffling of DNA by transposition can be deleterious, transposons often become inactivated or transcriptionally silenced. Conversely, transposons can give rise to new, useful cell functions. For example, domestication of a Transib-type DNA transposon led to V(D)J recombination and adaptive immunity in jawed vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kapitonov and Jurka, 2005</xref>). Similarly, the Cas1 integrase component of prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas systems of adaptive immunity originated from DNA transposons named Casposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krupovic et al., 2014</xref>). Integration of spacer sequences into the CRISPR locus by the Cas1-Cas2 complex has similarities with transposon and retroviral DNA integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nuñez et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>DNA transposons move from one genomic location to another using transposon-encoded recombinases, often by a DNA cut-and-paste mechanism. Many DNA transposases (e.g. Mos1, Tn5 and bacteriophage MuA) share a conserved RNase H-like catalytic domain, along with retroviral integrases (e.g. HIV-1) and RAG recombinases. These DDE/D enzymes use common active site chemistry to perform similar DNA cleavage and DNA integration reactions. By contrast, there is wide diversity in their preferred target integration sites. Most DDE/D recombinases show only limited preference for a consensus target DNA sequence, which is usually palindromic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goryshin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Halling and Kleckner, 1982</xref>). The number of base pairs separating the integration sites on complementary DNA strands also varies, from 2 to 9. Some retroviral integrases (e.g. prototype foamy virus (PFV) and HIV-1) preferentially insert their viral genome into nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pruss et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maskell et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, some transposases (e.g. Tn10) favour bent target DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pribil and Haniford, 2003</xref>). In other transposition systems (e.g. IS<italic>21,</italic> Mu), an element-encoded accessory ATPase facilitates strand transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arias-Palomo and Berger, 2015</xref>); and can prevent self-destructive insertion of the transposon into its own sequence (target immunity), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuno et al., 2013</xref>). Despite this biochemical knowledge, the molecular and structural origins for transposon target specificities remain unknown.</p><p>Mariner/Tc1/IS630 family transposases are unusual as they integrate their transposons, with a 2 bp stagger, strictly at TA target sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tellier et al., 2015</xref>). They are widespread in nature and are used as tools for genome engineering and therapeutic applications. For example, the reconstructed Tc1 transposase Sleeping Beauty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ivics et al., 1997</xref>) is being used in human clinical trials to treat B-cell lymphoma by genetic engineering of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maiti et al., 2013</xref>) and in pre-clinical studies to reduce age-related macular degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnen et al., 2012</xref>). Up to 45 kb of DNA can be inserted into the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome using a transposition system engineered from the <italic>mariner</italic> transposon Mos1 from <italic>Drosophila mauritiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frøkjær-Jensen et al., 2014</xref>). The ability to pre-select specific sites for integration, beyond the requisite TA, may be desirable for certain genome engineering applications, e.g. controlled genomic integration of a therapeutic gene. Such targeted transposition has been achieved for the bacterial transposase ISY100 using a C-terminal Zif268 DNA-binding domain fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2010</xref>); and for Sleeping Beauty transposase either by fusing it with a targeting domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yant et al., 2007</xref>) or by exploiting interactions with a targeting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ivics et al., 2007</xref>). Conversely, it may be useful to randomise <italic>mariner/Tc1</italic> integrations; for example in whole genome sequencing applications as an alternative to Tn5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amini et al., 2014</xref>). Understanding in molecular detail how <italic>mariner/Tc1</italic> transposons are integrated at TA target sites will aid development of these elements as genome engineering tools.</p><p>The wealth of structural and biochemical data for the naturally active, eukaryotic transposon <italic>Mos1</italic> offers a paradigm for determining the molecular mechanism of <italic>mariner/Tc1</italic> transposon integration. The 1286 bp transposon is framed by 28 bp imperfect inverted repeats (IR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jacobson et al., 1986</xref>) and encodes a 345 amino acid transposase that can perform cut-and-paste DNA transposition in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lampe et al., 1996</xref>), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>. The Mos1 transposase homodimer binds to the IR at one transposon end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cuypers et al., 2013</xref>) and then captures the other IR, forming a paired-end complex (PEC). The <italic>trans</italic> architecture of the PEC regulates coordinated excision of the transposon ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Richardson et al., 2009</xref>) and cross-talk between transposase sub-units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouuaert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dornan et al., 2015</xref>). After excision, the Mos1 transpososome locates a TA target integration site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pflieger et al., 2014</xref>) and, upon binding, forms a target capture complex (TCC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Attack by the 3'-OH at each transposon end on the phosphodiester 5' of the TA dinucleotide joins the excised transposon to the target site, in the DNA strand transfer reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). The DNA product of transposition, which contains a gap at each transposon end, is bound to the transposase in a strand transfer complex (STC).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15537.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mos1 transposition.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of pathway and complexes formed. Each transposon end has a 28 bp IR sequence (triangle) flanked by the TA target site duplication. First and second strand cleavages (scissors) are staggered by three bp and generate a 5' phosphate (filled circle) on the non-transferred strand (NTS), 3 bases within the IR, and a 3'OH (arrow) at the transferred strand (TS) end, respectively. After target DNA capture, the transposon 3' ends integrate at a symmetrical TA sequence, resulting in a 5 nt gap. Gap repair duplicates the TA. (<bold>b</bold>) Mos1 strand transfer.

In this snapshot of the transposition machinery after DNA transposon integration, the target DNA is distorted from B-form and the target adenines are flipped into extra-helical positions. Base-flipping is confirmed in solution by time-resolved fluorescence of strand transfer complexes in which the target adenines are substituted by 2-aminopurine. Adenine-specific interactions, between the flipped adenine bases and transposase backbone atoms, provide a molecular basis for recognition of the TA target sequence. Interactions with Mos1 transposase residues W159, R186, F187 and K190, which are essential for transposon integration in vitro, stabilise distortions in the target DNA. Conservation of key residues involved in stabilising the target DNA distortions suggests this mechanism may also occur with other <italic>mariner/Tc1</italic> family transposons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crystallisation of the Mos1 strand transfer complex</title><p>To assemble the Mos1 STC, full length T216A Mos1 transposase was combined, in a 1:1 molar ratio, with DNA representing the product of transposon integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

The strand transfer reaction creates a nick in both target DNA strands 5' of the target thymine T<sub>0</sub>, which likely relieves steric constraints and allows the extreme bend across the TA di-nucleotide.

The phosphate backbone atoms of A<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> are rotated by ~180°, with respect to the adjacent nucleotides, so that the A<sub>1</sub> bases cannot pair with their complementary T<sub>0</sub>. Instead each unpaired A<sub>1</sub> is wedged against the ribose face of the complementary target strand, at an oblique angle to bases G<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The aromatic ring of each F187 occupies the space vacated by a flipped A<sub>1</sub>, forming a π–π stack with the adjacent G<sub>2</sub> nucleobase, stabilising this conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).</p><p>To confirm A<sub>1</sub> flipping in solution, and to investigate the extent and dynamics of this distortion, we performed fluorescence experiments with DNA containing the adenine analogue 2-aminopurine (2AP). 2AP is an exquisitely sensitive probe of chemical environment: its fluorescence is highly quenched by stacking with the DNA bases and, hence, is sensitive to local duplex structure and enzyme-induced distortion of that structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones and Neely, 2015</xref>).</p><p>We designed three DNA duplexes, each mimicking the strand transfer product: TA1, an unlabelled control analogous to the oligonucleotide used for STC crystallisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>); TP13, a labelled control, with 2AP in place of A<sub>13</sub> on the top target strand (black, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), where it is base-paired and stacked in duplex DNA; TP1, with 2AP in place of A<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), where the unpaired 2AP is stacked with the adjacent T<sub>0</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> bases. Upon addition of Mos1 transposase to TA1, we observed complete formation of a nucleoprotein complex by gel-filtration chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). When Mos1 transposase was added to TP13, there was no measurable change in the (very low) steady-state fluorescence intensity at 367 nm (inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), consistent with no change in the 2AP environment upon STC formation. In contrast, there was a ten fold increase in fluorescence intensity when Mos1 transposase was added to TP1 (inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), consistent with 2AP at the target site becoming unstacked by flipping into an unquenched, extra-helical environment in the Mos1 STC.</p><p>A dynamic picture of DNA conformations in solution can be gained from the interpretation of the fluorescence decay of 2AP, measured by time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. In duplex DNA the exponential decay of 2AP fluorescence is typically described by four lifetime components, each reporting on different quenching environments that 2AP experiences as a result of the conformational dynamics of the duplex. The lifetime indicates the degree of quenching (stacking) in a particular conformation and the corresponding A–factor indicates the fractional occupancy of that conformation. The shortest lifetime (τ<sub>1</sub> ≅ 50 ps) is due to a highly stacked conformation, which typically accounts for &gt;70% of the population. The longest lifetime (τ<sub>4</sub> ≅ 9–10 ns) corresponds to an unstacked conformation in which 2AP is extra-helical and solvent-exposed; this conformation is typically &lt;5% of the population. The intermediate lifetimes (τ<sub>2</sub> ≅ 500 ps and τ<sub>3</sub>≅ 2 ns) are due to conformations in which 2AP is intra-helical but imperfectly or partially stacked.</p><p>We measured the fluorescence decays of the 2AP-containing DNA duplexes TP13 and TP1 in the absence and presence of Mos1 transposase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>). In the absence of transposase, 90% of the 2AP population of TP13 has the shortest lifetime (τ<sub>1</sub>=30ps), indicating a tightly stacked duplex structure. Upon addition of Mos1 transposase, the decay parameters are essentially unchanged showing that the local duplex structure is unaffected, confirming the steady-state fluorescence results. TP1 fluorescence decay, in the absence of protein, is also dominated by the shortest lifetime, stacked component (76%, τ<sub>1</sub>= 50 ps, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), with only 6% of the population in the unstacked state (τ<sub>4</sub> = 7.5 ns). (The differences in the decay parameters between TP13 and TP1 are consistent with a less tightly stacked environment in the latter, where 2AP is unpaired). However, upon addition of transposase to TP1, the decay parameters change markedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Most notably, there is a large transfer of population from the highly stacked state (τ<sub>1</sub> = 80 ps) to the unstacked, unquenched state (τ<sub>4</sub> 9.7 ns); the population of the former falls to 38% and that of the latter increases concomitantly to 31%. This clearly confirms that, in solution, 2AP at the position of the target adenine A<sub>1</sub> in the Mos1 STC experiences base-flipping into an extra-helical environment. Moreover, flipping of this 2AP is dynamic: a number of conformational states are sampled, including base-flipped and base-stacked environments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Transposase residues stabilise the distorted target DNA backbone</title><p>Base flipping of each A<sub>1</sub> severely distorts the surrounding target DNA.

The arrangement of H-bond donors differs between adenine and 2AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). Therefore, by replacing each A<sub>1</sub> with 2AP we expect to lose the H-bond between the A<sub>1</sub> 6-amino and V214 CO, and introduce a steric clash between the 2-amino of 2AP and T213 C<sub>α</sub>. Since 2AP, like adenine, can make two hydrogen bonds in a base pair with thymine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>), replacing A<sub>1</sub> with 2AP is unlikely to alter the stability and bendability of duplex target DNA.</p><p>We found that replacing both A<sub>1</sub>s with 2AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c,d</xref>) resulted in a dramatic loss of specific integration at each T<sub>0</sub> 5' of the 2AP, consistent with the predicted loss of adenine-specific hydrogen-bonds with transposase. Our fluorescence experiments show that 2AP at position 1 in target DNA undergoes dynamic base flipping in the Mos1 STC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), whereas our crystallographic snapshot with adenine at the equivalent position suggests a static flipped conformation. This may reflect different experimental conditions: the fluorescence experiments were performed in solution at room temperature, whereas the crystal structure was obtained at cryogenic temperatures. However, it is also consistent with a lack of specific interactions between 2AP and transposase, leading to an inability to trap the flipped 2AP conformation. We conclude that Mos1 integration at TA requires adenine-specific interactions with transposase to trap the flipped A<sub>1</sub> conformation.</p><p>Next we asked which A<sub>1</sub> of the symmetrical TA sequence is essential for integration at T<sub>0</sub>: the adjacent A<sub>1</sub> on the same strand or the complementary A<sub>1</sub>. We replaced each A<sub>1</sub> individually with 2AP, and efficient Mos1 integration occurred at a T<sub>0</sub>–A<sub>1</sub> step when the T<sub>0</sub> was base-pairedwith 2AP, but was reduced at a T<sub>0</sub>–2AP<sub>1</sub> step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c,d</xref>). We conclude that specific Mos1 integration at a T<sub>0</sub> requires trapping of the flipped A<sub>1</sub> adjacent to it on the same strand.</p><p>Finally we asked if the lower stability of a T:A base-pair, compared to G:C, favours <italic>mariner/Tc1</italic> transposon integration at TA sites. We predicted that A<sub>1</sub> flipping, and therefore strand transfer, would be hindered if the T:A base-pairing was strengthened by a third hydrogen bond, but enhanced with weakened base pairs. We replaced both A<sub>1</sub>s with 2,6-diaminopurine (2-amino-dA, or D), which forms three hydrogen bonds with dT (thereby increasing base-pair stability) but only one hydrogen bond when paired with 2-thio-dT (or S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kutyavin et al., 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). 2-amino-dA can form the adenine-specific interactions with V214 seen in the Mos1 STC structure, however the 2-amino group adds a potential clash with transposase that could lead to reduced specificity.</p><p>We compared Mos1 strand transfer into TA and the altered target sequences TD and SD, with strengthened and weakened base pairing respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>, lanes 10 and 11). We measured 6.99% integration into TA, but only 0.24% integration into the TD sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c,d</xref>) and 0.86% integration into SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>); in the latter experiment many other, non-specific integration products were also observed. Thus, the weakness of the T:A base pair promotes integration at the TA sequence, and the pattern of H-bond donors and acceptors on the Watson-Crick face of adenine is important for specificity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The Mos1 STC structure provides a snapshot of Mos1 transposition in the post-integration state.

The Tc1-family transposases, including Sleeping Beauty, also display sequence conservation in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting similar recognition mechanisms exist in that closely-related family. Structures of Sleeping Beauty transposition intermediates will reveal if this is the case.</p><p>Target DNA bending is a recurring theme in DNA transposition by DDE/D recombinases. The severe target DNA bend (~147°) observed in our Mos1 STC structure is similar to the ~140° target DNA distortion in the bacterial MuA transpososome, which was proposed to drive the isoenergetic strand transfer reaction forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Montaño et al., 2012</xref>). Mu employs a helper protein (MuB) in its transposition, which may facilitate target DNA bending by forming helical filaments on DNA, prior to capture by the MuA transpososome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuno et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, the bacterial insertion sequence IS<italic>21</italic> requires IstB for efficient transposition. In the presence of ATP, IstB self-assembles into decamers that can bend ~50 bp DNA by 180° (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arias-Palomo and Berger, 2015</xref>). In the PFV integrase target capture and strand transfer complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maertens et al., 2010</xref>) naked target DNA is bent by 55°.

Drops contained 2 μL of STC (25 μM) and 1 μL of well solution comprising 30% (v/v) MPD, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.5 and 0.2 M magnesium acetate tetrahydrate. The crystals were cooled in liquid nitrogen for X-ray diffraction experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>X-ray crystal structure determination and refinement</title><p>X-ray diffraction data were collected on beam line I02 at the Diamond Light Source. Crystals displayed C-centred (<italic>C</italic>121) symmetry and diffracted X-rays to a maximum resolution of 3.3 Å. The X-ray diffraction data were processed with iMosflm, scaled and merged with AIMLESS and the statistics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement, using our structure of the Mos1 PEC (PDB ID: 3HOS, chains A to F, comprising the transposase dimer and two cleaved IR DNA molecules) as the search model in PHASER. The difference electron density after molecular replacement is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. The remaining structure was built manually. Restrained refinement was performed with Refmac and Coot and included automatic non-crystallographic symmetry restraints on the protein and DNA chains. The refinement statistics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A bend, flip and trap mechanism for transposon integration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan as the Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>By using a combination of structural biology, time-resolved fluorescence experiments and transposition assays, Richardson and colleagues reveal new mechanistic insight into the DNA integration mechanism of the Mos1 transposon. Transposable elements make up a large proportion of most genomes, and their movement from place to place generates genome diversity and contributes to genome instability. This work addresses how Mos1 insertion into new sites in DNA is faithfully achieved. A crystal structure of Mos1 transposase complexed to transposon ends covalently joined to target DNA reveals severe distortion of target DNA and flipping of the target adenines into extra-helical positions. The molecular recognition by transposase of these flipped residues provides a molecular basis for target site selection. Transposase residues that stabilise the DNA distortion are required for efficient transposition.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Below the comments that you need to take into account in your revision are listed. Also note that <italic>eLife</italic> expects papers to refer to the organism system in either the title or Abstract so I would propose you add a clause in the Abstract stating briefly that Mos1 is derived from <italic>Drosophila mauritiana</italic>. I should add that all reviewers were enthusiastic about this work, and their view is encapsulated by the statement of one reviewer: 'This paper by Dr. Richardson and co-workers is impressive overall, as it provides novel and substantial insights to Mos1 and target DNA interactions. The experimental strategy to obtain crystals is clever and clearly worked out very nicely. I found the biochemical work, including the fluorescence spectroscopy, persuasive. When taken together, the correlation of the structural results with the solution biochemical data brings this work to a very high standard'.</p><p>1) It would help to show how similar the STC is to the previously published transpososome (PEC) structures. A superposition (and/or rmsd values) would be very useful.</p><p>Importantly, the molecular replacement was solved with the PEC complex, 3HOS, as the search model; one reviewer recalls that 3HOS has a peculiar packing that was proposed to mimic target DNA. Whether this proposal is still valid or not, the reviewer assumes that the TS strand must have been built in with some kind of difference electron density after molecular replacement found the orientation and the position of the complex. This difference electron density (before any model building) should be shown (at the very least as a supplementary figure) as it is crucial for everything in the paper-this should be explicitly shown. Furthermore, as the resolution is moderate, possible model bias is a concern. The reviewer believes that the electron densities shown are inappropriate, as they are the 2Fo-Fc kind, and therefore subject of the modeling assumptions. In the reviewer's opinion, all the electron density figures should be replaced with simulated annealed omit maps (easily and rapidly computed with the freely available Phenix suite of programs). Considering the similarities of the STC to the previously published PEC structures it is hard to imagine that target DNA would bend <italic>after</italic> strand transfer. Would a straight target DNA fit between active sites of the Mos1 transpososome?</p><p>2) Discussion, seventh paragraph: Contrary to the oft-repeated dogma, the ability/propensity of retroviruses to integrate into nucleosomes is not due to the &quot;pre-bent&quot; nature of nucleosomal DNA (which is relatively smooth), but more likely due to complex interactions of the intasome with both gyres of nucleosomal DNA and the histone octamer. The interactions collectively offset the energetic penalty associated with the much more severe bending of the nucleosomal DNA between active sites of the intasome. Related: the second paragraph of the Introduction seems to suggest that nucleosomal DNA is not B-form.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> and associated text: should base D not pair with base S via two H-bonds? (compare bottom left and bottom right base pair configurations). If there indeed is a single H-bond, an explanation and a reference are in order.</p><p>4) Discussion: This could do with some revision and made shorter and 'crisper', so that it is not largely a restatement of results. Do substantive insights emerge after carefully examining the structural changes alluded to below? For example, there may be a missed opportunity to compare the current structure with 4U7B, that is a pre-NTS-cleavage state (Dornan et al., 2015, NAR 43, 2424). I think readers would be interested in how the protein conformation has changed to accommodate what is now the target strand. While I understand that visualization of conformational changes using static images is hard to do well, I can imagine that a morphing movie could be informative. This can be easily done in these days, as a variety of tools are available to accomplish this. I think it would be good to point out for the less initiated that the NTS used is the authentic product of the first cleavage. It would be also good to define the T<sub>0</sub> phosphate as the scissile phosphate (which I believe it is).</p><p>The authors might also have commented on [and cited] the bacterial IS630 family of elements that superficially have a related transposition and integration site selection mechanism.</p><p>Furthermore, the implications of the results for transposition/integration in the context of chromatin could be discussed in more detail. Mos1 is a eukaryotic transposon and has to deal with nucleosomes in some way, and recent evidence indicates that Tc1/mariner transposition avoids nucleosomes (see PubMed-ID 26755332). This ties up beautifully with the current data: a 150° kink would be incompatible with nucleosomal structure. Indeed, even in the case of PFV intasome, which induces a 60° bend in target DNA, engagement of a nucleosome requires peeling of the DNA from the histone octamer (Maskell et al., 2015). The last sentences of the Discussion are rather contrived and weak; something more insightful could be stated, or perhaps deleted [they do nothing to enhance the otherwise excellent presentation].</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15537.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>Below the comments that you need to take into account in your revision are listed.

We have clarified this in the Materials and methods.

This now reads:</p><p>“In the PFV integrase target capture and strand transfer complexes (Maertens et al., 2010) naked target DNA is bent by 55°. Nucleosomal DNA is peeled from the histone octamer and similarly deformed by interactions with the PFV intasome, providing a structural basis for retroviral integration at nucleosomes (Maskell et al., 2015).”</p><p>Similarly the Introduction now reads:</p><p>“Some retroviral integrases (e.g. prototype foamy virus (PFV) and HIV-1) preferentially insert their viral genome into nucleosomal DNA (Pruss et al., 1994, Maskell et al., 2015).”</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> and associated text: should base D not pair with base S via two H-bonds? (compare bottom left and bottom right base pair configurations). If there indeed is a single H-bond, an explanation and a reference are in order.</italic></p><p>The modified base D is proposed to pair with S via one H-bond, between the 6-amino group of di-amino purine and the carbonyl oxygen of 2-thiothymine. This was described by IV Kutyavin et al. in Biochemistry (1996), 35, pp 11170-11176 and we have added this reference. They stated that the base pair acts like a mismatch; a steric clash between the 2-thio group of S and the 2-amino group of D tilts the bases relative to each other, precluding formation of the expected second H-bond. We have amended <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> accordingly, and added this explanation to the figure legend.</p><p><italic>4) Discussion: This could do with some revision and made shorter and 'crisper', so that it is not largely a restatement of results.</italic></p><p>We have revised the Discussion significantly. We have removed much of the restatement of results, added a comparison of the STC with previous structures and included discussion of the implications for transposon integration in the context of chromatin. As a result, the Discussion is now slightly shorter.</p><p><italic>Do substantive insights emerge after carefully examining the structural changes alluded to below?

Differences in the orientation and position of T<sub>0</sub> in the Mos1 STC compared to the thymine (T<sub>57</sub>) of the flanking target site duplication in 4U7B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) support deformation of target DNA upon capture. By contrast, T<sub>0</sub> closely aligns with T<sub>54</sub> of the additional DNA duplex in 3HOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), which may represent the target strand before integration. Changes in the transposase structure are subtle and involve movement of the catalytic domains towards each other and the target DNA. We have made morphing movies showing how the Mos1 transposase conformation changes between the <italic>pre</italic>-TS cleavage PEC (4U7B) or the post-cleavage PEC (3HOS) and the strand transfer complex.
