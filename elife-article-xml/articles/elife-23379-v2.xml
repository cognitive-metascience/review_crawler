Additionally, the advent of next-generation genome editing tools is enabling researchers to efficiently target virtually any genomic locus of interest for inactivation or precision alteration. These technologies, combined with prior large-scale mutagenesis screens, have created rapidly growing publicly available collections of zebrafish mutant lines that are in need of detailed characterization. However, rigorously characterizing 1000s of lines quantitatively and in detail remains impractical with current approaches. As a result, phenotyping in large studies is often non-quantitative and restricted to features easily observed by eye. For example, the ZMP characterizes all alleles for ~20 gross structural and behavioral phenotypes (e.g. axis length, movement, etc.) at 5 days post fertilization (dpf) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dooley et al., 2013</xref>). Although useful for preliminary screening, these criteria are too general to provide mechanistic insight into alleles that produce obvious defects and completely overlook those with interesting but subtle phenotypes.</p><p>Detailed phenotyping, particularly of complex organs like the brain, requires careful characterization of mutant lines using panels of well-established cell- and tissue-specific markers. This can be accomplished either by whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) using riboprobes or by whole mount immunohistochemistry using antibodies. Most steps of WISH, including probe synthesis and all staining steps, can easily be scaled up and automated using multiwell plates and/or robotic hybridization platforms. However, even in sophisticated large-scale in situ screens, the final crucial steps of documenting and analyzing gene expression patterns are often limited to manual annotation of 2D images acquired from a few standard views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Quiring et al., 2004</xref>). This is due to the challenges of rapidly imaging complex gene expression patterns in 3D at high-resolution, accurately registering numerous markers across thousands (or more) of samples, and detecting and quantifying alterations in mutants. Standard 3D imaging modalities [e.g. confocal, two-photon (2P), and selective plane illumination microscopy] require expensive hardware and are restricted to fluorescent readouts. However, gene expression patterns in zebrafish and other model organisms are most commonly studied using WISH protocols employing chromogenic rather than fluorescent readouts. Once 3D images have been acquired, novel computational approaches to phenotyping are essential, since manual analysis suffers from human error (e.g. user fatigue, variation in training and experience) and can only produce semi-quantitative results at best.</p><p>To address all of these challenges, we report the first automated scalable phenotyping platform capable of high-resolution isotropic 3D imaging of chromogenic WISH-stained samples along with algorithms for precision registration and quantification of the resultant 3D gene expression patterns. Image acquisition is accomplished using optical projection tomography (OPT), a 3D imaging technique operating on the same principle as X-ray computed tomography but utilizing visible radiation instead of X-rays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reynaud, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharpe et al., 2002</xref>). OPT is capable of imaging both absorption of transmitted light and emitted fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang and Wang, 2007</xref>), making it ideal for deep-phenotyping of chromogenic WISH. Compared to fluorescence imaging techniques, acquisition times for OPT are extremely short when high-contrast stains are used, a crucial requirement for large-scale analysis. We have previously described a high-throughput OPT system to quantify craniofacial skeletons in zebrafish embryos using the Alcian blue histological stain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pardo-Martin et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2013</xref>). In the present paper, we adapt our OPT platform to WISH-stained samples and develop a suite of algorithms that automatically registers expression patterns to a common reference frame with a high level of precision. This enables us to detect statistically significant alterations between wild-type and mutant embryos on a voxel-by-voxel basis using automated correlation analysis and map these defects to an anatomical atlas. Applying this analysis to a diverse library of brain-specific riboprobes allows us to detect and quantify even subtle deficits in mutant embryos in an unbiased manner. Additionally, because all 3D patterns are registered to a common frame, our platform allows any desired co-expression pattern to be easily visualized without the need for double- or triple-labeling experiments. For a 20-probe WISH library, this means that all unique 3-probe combinations can be analyzed by performing just 20 single-label in situ hybridizations rather than 1140 triple-label hybridizations. Our new high-throughput OPT system can be assembled inexpensively using off-the-shelf components and enables 3D imaging of non-embedded WISH-stained samples at cellular resolution in less time than conventional 2D imaging, resulting in an orders-of-magnitude increase in data from standard in situ experiments.</p><p>To demonstrate the ability of automated 3D phenotyping to detect important but easily overlooked defects, we analyzed zebrafish embryos containing a previously characterized mutation in <italic>fez family zinc finger 2</italic> (<italic>fezf2</italic>; OMIM *607414). <italic>Fezf2</italic> is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor that plays critical roles in neurogenesis and cell fate specification in organisms ranging from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eckler and Chen, 2014</xref>). In mice, <italic>Fezf2</italic> is expressed in forebrain neural progenitors and postmitotic glutamatergic projection neurons in layers 5 and 6 of the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inoue et al., 2004</xref>). Knockout mice show a striking loss of corticospinal motor neurons and other closely related subcerebral projection neurons in cortical layer 5, which are replaced by callosal projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Molyneaux et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2008</xref>). Although developmental expression of <italic>Fezf2</italic> is similar in fish and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berberoglu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blechman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levkowitz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Molyneaux et al., 2005</xref>), previously reported loss-of-function phenotypes differ in important aspects. The function of <italic>fezf2</italic> in zebrafish has been extensively studied using the <italic>fezf2<sup>m808</sup></italic> mutant (also known as <italic>too few</italic>), which is thought to be a hypomorphic loss-of-function allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeong et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast to knockout mice, where <italic>fezf2</italic> defects are seen in the glutamatergic projection neurons of the telencephalon-derived neocortex, early developmental deficits in zebrafish embryos have only been reported in diencephalon, particularly in dopaminergic (DA), serotonergic (5-HT), oxytocinergic-like, and GABAergic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blechman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rink and Guo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levkowitz et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>These differences raise the possibility that <italic>fezf2</italic> function has diverged substantially over time, particularly in regions of the telencephalon giving rise to the mammalian neocortex. Alternatively, important but subtle aspects of the <italic>fezf2</italic> phenotype may have been overlooked during zebrafish development. Support for the latter possibility comes from the finding that adult <italic>fezf2</italic> mutant zebrafish have significantly smaller telencephalons, in spite of the fact that early developmental defects are reported in the diencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berberoglu et al., 2014</xref>). Although the telencephalon appears grossly normal at two weeks post fertilization, we speculated that deep-phenotyping might uncover earlier abnormalities. We therefore analyzed <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants at two and three days post fertilization (dpf) using a diverse in situ riboprobe library to detect progenitor populations, differentiated neuron subtypes, and brain regions. Our custom image analysis algorithms allowed us to automatically detect and quantify areas of significantly altered gene expression throughout the entire brain. In addition to previously reported defects in the ventral diencephalon, we found a second phenotypic hotspot in the telencephalon. Detailed analysis shows that <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants exhibit a variety of novel forebrain abnormalities as early as 2 dpf. Notably, we report for the first time that mutants display a dramatic loss of glutamatergic neurons in the pallium of the telencephalon, although telencephalic DA and GABAergic populations appear to be relatively normal. This phenotype is accompanied by a reduction in telencephalon volume. Our findings show that the zebrafish <italic>fezf2</italic> phenotype corresponds much more closely to mammalian deficits than previously assumed. Our data suggest a model in which <italic>fezf2</italic> controls two distinct developmental programs in the zebrafish brain: (1) a glutamatergic program in the telencephalon with similarities to mammalian <italic>Fezf2</italic> function, and (2) a broader neurogenic program in the diencephalon.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High-resolution 3D imaging of gene expression patterns using high-throughput OPT</title><p>We have previously demonstrated a high-throughput OPT platform for rapid 3D imaging of non-embedded zebrafish embryos at micrometer resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pardo-Martin et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2010</xref>). Because formaldehyde fixation renders normally transparent zebrafish embryos optically dense, high-resolution OPT requires tissue clearing techniques to reduce light scattering and maximize transparency. In our previous publication, clearing was achieved using a trypsin solution on embryos stained with the histological dye Alcian blue. Since Alcian blue is limited to detecting cartilage, we sought to make OPT applicable to all anatomical structures or genes of interest by adapting our platform to embryos stained using chromogenic WISH. This required an alternative tissue clearing technique, as trypsin is ineffective on WISH-stained samples. Immersion in a mixture of benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate (BABB) is a simple and rapid solvent-based clearing technique. BABB’s hydrophobicity and high refractive index (RI; 1.559) render samples optically transparent, making deeper structures accessible for high-resolution 3D imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 2012</xref>). The switch to BABB necessitated several changes to our OPT platform. In order to match the RI of BABB, we load samples into an aluminosilicate glass capillary (RI = 1.538) instead of a borosilicate capillary (RI = 1.474), which is immersed in a BABB-filled glass cuvette to achieve RI matching between the inside and outside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; details in Materials and methods). We also developed a process for fabricating a tapered transparent insert from RI-matched optical adhesive within the capillary to accommodate embryos from multiple developmental stages and ensure stability during high-speed rotational imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>; details in Materials and methods). The capillary is mounted vertically within the imaging chamber, allowing rapid loading and unloading through a single fluidic port at the top and further enhancing stability during rotation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23379.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Automated OPT platform for automated 3D in situ phenotyping.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) From left to right, the optical projection tomography platform consists of the following components: (1) a post-mountable broadband emission quartz tungsten-halogen light source, (2) a ground glass diffuser, (3) an imaging chamber and glass capillary capable of rotating the specimen 360°, (4) a telephoto zoom lens, and (5) a programmable progressive scan CCD camera (one megapixel, 120 fps).

Automated algorithms for global registration of 3D fluorescent images from zebrafish have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Randlett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ronneberger et al., 2012</xref>), however these are unsuitable for tomographic reconstructions from chromogenic WISH as they require imaging two stains in separate fluorescence channels: (1) a detailed marker of internal morphology, which is used to stain all fish and guides deformable registration to the common reference frame and (2) the specific expression pattern of interest. We therefore devised a novel approach using MATLAB’s Image Processing Toolbox and the open source registration toolbox elastix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ibanez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shamonin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klein et al., 2010</xref>). Our registration strategy is described in detail in Materials and methods and utilizes both the dark blue chromogenic in situ stain (which can be clearly visualized in the red or green channels of an RGB image and highlights internal morphology) and a faint red SYTOX Green counterstain (which can be visualized in the blue or green channels and highlights surface features that are common to all embryos). We begin by creating an average 3D unstained reference fish (URF) for each developmental stage to serve as a common reference frame for global registration. This is done using iterative shape averaging (ISA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rohlfing et al., 2001</xref>) in the green channel on multiple embryos that have been processed using the standard WISH protocol with the riboprobe omitted. All WISH-stained embryos are then aligned to the appropriate age-specific URF as detailed in Materials and methods. Briefly: for each probe a single stained embryo is selected as a Probe Reference Fish (PRF). The PRF (blue channel) is registered to the URF (green channel) using the SYTOX stain and all other embryos stained with the same probe are registered to the PRF using both the SYTOX stain and the 3D gene expression pattern (green channel). Registrations are done with a non-deformable registration followed by a deformable registration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>; details in Materials and methods). Following registration, users can view either 3D reconstructions of single embryos or averaged 3D expression patterns from multiple embryos stained with the same probe. The latter option compensates for biological variation and is particularly attractive for probes with diffuse or punctate expression patterns [e.g. <italic>tyrosine hydroxylase</italic> (<italic>th</italic>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>]. We have therefore used it for all subsequent experiments unless noted.</p><p>We quantified the accuracy of our registration algorithms using <italic>tryptophan hydroxylase 2</italic> (<italic>tph2</italic>). This probe labels discrete expression domains in the epiphysis and the raphe serotonergic neurons and shows relatively little embryo-to-embryo variation in size or shape, making it an ideal landmark for assessing alignment accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We stained 26 wild-type embryos from the same clutch, randomly divided them into three groups, and independently registered each group using our algorithms. Both <italic>tph2</italic> expression domains were then segmented in all embryos (see Materials and methods). In order to quantify misalignment, we measure how much the location of each domain deviates between pairs of aligned embryos using a border distance measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsai et al., 2003</xref>). This is done by calculating the minimum distance from each border voxel of the domain segmentation in the first embryo to the border of the same domain segmentation in the second embryo. The final border voxel distance for an embryo pair is the average of all minimum distances. We then compare border voxel distances from all pairs within the same registration group (intra-group) and from all pairs in different registration groups (inter-group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Our algorithms produce alignments that are accurate to sub-cellular scales for both the raphe expression domain (intra-group registration accuracy = 3.5 µm; inter-group accuracy = 4.0 µm) and the epiphysis expression domain (intra-group accuracy = 2.3 µm; inter-group accuracy = 2.5 µm). To further validate alignment accuracy, we examined genes with well-characterized co-expression in zebrafish. <italic>Vesicular monoamine transporter 2</italic> (<italic>vmat2</italic>), <italic>th</italic>, and <italic>tph2</italic> are expressed in monoaminergic, catecholaminergic, and 5-HT neurons respectively. In zebrafish, <italic>th</italic> is expressed in DA neurons of the telencephalon and diencephalon and noradrenergic (NA) neurons of the locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rink and Wullimann, 2002</xref>). <italic>Vmat2</italic> is expressed in DA neurons of the telencephalon and diencephalon, NA neurons of the locus coeruleus, and 5-HT neurons of the raphe nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wen et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Tph2</italic> is expressed in 5-HT neurons of the epiphysis and the raphe nuclei(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Teraoka et al., 2004</xref>).

Atlases were developed from 3D images generated by 2P excitation microscopy using embryos stained with green fluorescent Nissl stain. This histological stain is widely used to study neuromorphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nissl, 1894</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kádár et al., 2009</xref>) and provides a convenient way to visualize general brain anatomy. Embryos were counterstained with red fluorescent nucleic acid stain, giving uniform background labeling and enabling registration to age-specific URFs. To achieve the best match between anatomical atlases and OPT reconstructions, embryos were processed using the WISH protocol without a riboprobe and immersed in BABB during 2P microscopy. Anatomical segmentation was done manually following established zebrafish brain nomenclature and with the aid of the Atlas of Early Zebrafish Brain Development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mueller and Wullimann, 2015</xref>) and the Virtual Brain explorer 3D (ViBE-Z) atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ronneberger et al., 2012</xref>).

To demonstrate the power of this approach, we performed deep-phenotyping on a loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>fezf2</italic> transcription factor, which is essential for neurogenesis in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 1999</xref>). Phenotyping was done using a diverse library of brain-specific riboprobes to visualize a range of progenitor and postmitotic populations throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For each probe, we imaged 8+ wild-type and mutant embryos at 2 and 3 dpf. In order to automatically detect regional differences in expression, we developed an Automated Correlation Analysis framework based on an approach used for group comparisons in brain network studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simpson et al., 2013</xref>). Following registration, we calculate a Pearson correlation coefficient between each wild-type and mutant embryo for every probe within all brain regions based on the intensities of corresponding voxels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goshtasby, 2012</xref>). For each brain region, a correlation matrix is generated containing intra-group correlations for wild-types and mutants and inter-group correlations between wild-types and mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right). If there is a phenotypic difference, the intra-group correlation is expected to be significantly higher than the inter-group correlation. We used false discovery rate (FDR) estimation, a technique for assessing false positives when conducting multiple comparisons, to set an appropriate <italic>p</italic>-value threshold for automated phenotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noble, 2009</xref>). To estimate FDR, we compare our experimental data set (correlation between wild-type and <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants) with a null data set consisting of negative control embryos (i.e. embryos that are either genetically wild-type or heterozygous for the <italic>fezf2</italic> mutation) that have been randomly divided into two separate groups following in situ staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Since negative control embryos lack the <italic>fezf2</italic> phenotype, any differences that are detected between the two null groups are presumed to be false positives. Based on this analysis, we have set our <italic>p</italic>-value threshold at p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>, which gives a FDR of 0.043. In addition to significance testing, we calculate the effect size (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>) to measure the magnitude of the difference in correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sullivan and Feinn, 2012</xref>). In the null data set, the mean effect size is less than 1.0 for all significance thresholds evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This suggests that small effect sizes are indicative of minor changes most likely arising from differences in background staining or biological variation, while larger values indicate true alterations in gene expression. Therefore, we included an effect size requirement (<italic>d</italic> &gt; 1.0) for Automated Correlation Analysis, further reducing the FDR at our selected <italic>p</italic>-value threshold from 0.043 to 0.020 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These criteria (p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>, <italic>d</italic> &gt; 1.0) are used to create an Automated Correlation Analysis table depicting changes in all probes across all brain regions at 2 and 3 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23379.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Automated detection and statistical quantification of <italic>fezf2</italic> mutant deficits.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Right: alterations in the expression of individual probes can be detected using a correlation-significance analysis approach.

Aggregated difference images clearly show two phenotypic hotspots in <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants: one in the ventral diencephalon and one in the telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). To visualize whether expression is increased, decreased, or altered in more complex ways, we perform a Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test to compare corresponding voxels in wild-types and mutants for each probe within each brain region that shows alterations in Automated Correlation Analysis. This allows us to determine if there is a significant increase or decrease in expression on a voxel-by-voxel basis. As with Automated Correlation Analysis, we use FDR estimation and our null data set to select an appropriate <italic>p</italic>-value threshold for voxelwise analysis and to verify the accuracy of our approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). In order to visualize significant alterations, we utilize maximum intensity projections (MIPs) color coded to highlight regions in which expression is significantly reduced (cyan) or increased (magenta) in mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-23379-media2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23379.014</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>3D visualization of aggregate difference imaging at 2 days post fertilization.</title><p>Voxel intensity difference is calculated between wild-types and <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants for each probe within each affected brain region.

For example, although <italic>otpb</italic> (a homeodomain protein essential for specification of subsets of neuroendocrine cells and DA neurons) is lost in the ventral posterior tuberculum and posterior hypothalamus, it remains largely unchanged in the anterior hypothalamus and other regions of the diencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D,G,H</xref>). Similarly, <italic>th</italic> expression is significantly reduced in the DA clusters of the ventral posterior tuberculum and hypothalamus, with posterior clusters appearing to be more strongly affected than anterior clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These subdomain-specific defects in <italic>otpb</italic> and <italic>th</italic> have been characterized in detail in <italic>fezf2<sup>m808</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rink and Guo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blechman et al., 2007</xref>), providing validation for our approach to automated phenotyping.</p><p>In addition to detecting previously reported diencephalic phenotypes, we uncovered several overlooked yet highly significant deficits in <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants. The early developmental expression pattern of <italic>fezf2</italic> has been reported to be normal in <italic>fezf2<sup>m808 </sup></italic>mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levkowitz et al., 2003</xref>), but our analysis shows significant alterations in the ventral diencephalon and other regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Visualization of <italic>fezf2</italic> using MIPs reveals that virtually all expression domains are altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). No other probe in our library shows such widespread disruption (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), suggesting <italic>fezf2</italic> plays a critical role in regulating its own expression either directly or via feedback from downstream transcriptional targets. To better understand this phenotype, we examined virtual 2D slices in wild-type and mutant embryos. In the posterior hypothalamus of wild-type embryos, <italic>fezf2</italic> is expressed in a T-shaped pattern running along the midline and spreading into the lateral hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). When <italic>otpb</italic> and <italic>th</italic> are virtually co-registered with <italic>fezf2</italic>, they are located in an anterior/lateral position relative to <italic>fezf2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This distinctive arrangement of <italic>fezf2</italic> and <italic>otpb</italic> in the posterior hypothalamus has been described previously using two-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wolf and Ryu, 2013</xref>). In <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants, <italic>fezf2</italic> expression is lost along the midline while simultaneously expanding laterally and anteriorly into regions normally expressing <italic>otpb</italic> and <italic>th</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Previous work shows that <italic>fezf2</italic> is required for expression of <italic>otpb</italic> and the closely related <italic>otpa. Otp</italic> genes in turn act as negative regulators of <italic>fezf2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wolf and Ryu, 2013</xref>). Taken together with our observations, this suggests <italic>fezf2</italic> could be transiently expressed in anterior/lateral regions of the hypothalamus that eventually become <italic>otp</italic> positive and <italic>fezf2</italic> negative. In wild-type embryos, negative feedback from <italic>otp</italic> may be required to turn off <italic>fezf2</italic> transcription in these regions and create distinct non-overlapping expression domains. In mutants, the non-functional Fezf2 protein would be unable to initiate <italic>otp</italic> expression, allowing <italic>fezf2</italic> expression to persist. Since <italic>otp</italic> genes are essential for development of DA neurons in the diencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernandes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryu et al., 2007</xref>), it is not surprising that <italic>th</italic> expression is lost in this region of <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants.</p><p>Automated phenotyping also shows that somatostatin-expressing neurons (<italic>sst1.1</italic>) are lost in the ventral diencephalon. Although distinct clusters of <italic>sst1.1</italic> neurons are present in many regions, deficits in <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants are limited to a small bilateral cluster located between the hypothalamus and the ventral thalamus/ventral posterior tuberculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>). Virtual co-expression analysis shows that affected <italic>sst1.1</italic> clusters partially overlap with <italic>optb</italic> in the hypothalamus and are either intermingled with or located just lateral to DA clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). The observation that <italic>sst1.1</italic> deficits are associated with loss of <italic>otpb</italic> suggests a potential mechanism. As previously noted, <italic>fezf2</italic> is required for <italic>otp</italic> expression in the ventral diencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blechman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wolf and Ryu, 2013</xref>) and—at least in the context of the zebrafish hindbrain—<italic>otp</italic> is required for the development of <italic>sst1.1</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernandes et al., 2013</xref>). Although a previous publication found no <italic>sst1.1</italic> defects in <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blechman et al., 2007</xref>), this conclusion was likely based on the strongly-expressing <italic>sst1.1</italic> clusters in the anterior hypothalamus, which appear normal in our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). Changes in the highly punctate <italic>sst1.1</italic> expression domains may be easier to detect when using averaged 3D reconstructions from multiple embryos, as opposed to viewing individual embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title><italic>Fezf2</italic> is required for glutamatergic development in the zebrafish telencephalon</title><p>The second phenotypic hotspot in <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants is the telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Surprisingly, previous studies of <italic>fezf2</italic> phenotypes report that morphology and patterning of the telencephalon is normal during early development. In contrast to the diencephalon, the size and number of <italic>th</italic>-expressing DA cells in the telencephalon is normal in mutants during the first 2 weeks of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levkowitz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rink and Guo, 2004</xref>), although TH immunoreactive processes in the subpallium are reduced at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rink and Guo, 2004</xref>). Similarly, telencephalic expression of the GABAergic marker <italic>gad1b</italic> is reported to be normal in <italic>fezf2</italic> deficient embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with these studies, our Automated Correlation Analysis shows DA markers (<italic>th</italic>, <italic>otpb</italic>, <italic>vmat2</italic>) in the telencephalon are essentially normal, although there may be small changes in <italic>th</italic> expression at 3 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, GABAergic markers (<italic>dlx5a</italic>, <italic>gad1b</italic>) and glutamatergic markers [<italic>vesicular glutamate transporter 1</italic> (<italic>vglut1</italic>), <italic>vglut2.2</italic>] show reduced correlation in the telencephalon. MIPs confirm that GABAergic and glutamatergic markers show areas of significant difference in the telencephalon, while DA markers remain unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Glutamatergic neurons exhibit a striking reduction in the telencephalon at 2 and 3 dpf while the GABAergic phenotype is more complex and appears to encompass both areas of reduced and increased expression.</p><p>Detailed examination of 2D slices and 3D segmentations within the telencephalon confirms our automated phenotyping results and provides additional details about the <italic>fezf2</italic> phenotype. DA markers, expressed in bilateral domains in the telencephalon, are largely unaltered in <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). Defects in GABAergic markers (<italic>dlx5a</italic>, <italic>gad1b</italic>) are subtle and appear to be driven by alterations in 3D shape rather than by a change in volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This impression is confirmed by quantifying 3D segmentations from <italic>dlx5a</italic>-stained embryos. Volume measurements show no significant difference in spite of clear changes in overall shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). 2D sections through the pallium show that GABAergic markers exhibit a small lateral shift away from the midline ventricle in mutants at 2 and 3 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). <italic>Gad1b</italic> also appears to be slightly reduced in the posterior region of the pallium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast to the GABAergic phenotype, glutamatergic defects in the telencephalon are highly pronounced when examined in slices and 3D segmentations and clearly reflect a substantial decrease in volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). <italic>Vglut1</italic> expression is primarily restricted to the pallium, while <italic>vglut2.2</italic> is more broadly expressed throughout the pallium, subpallium, and olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). 2D slices and volume measurements from 3D segmentations confirm that both markers are significantly reduced in <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants, with loss of the pallial glutamatergic population being particularly dramatic. In addition to deficits in <italic>vglut</italic> genes—which mark mature glutamatergic populations—mutants show a reduction in telencephalic <italic>tbr1b</italic>, a T-box transcription factor that plays an essential role in specifying glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in the mammalian neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Englund et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hevner et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>).

As in the diencephalon, the <italic>fezf2</italic> expression domain itself is highly disorganized in mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). Closer examination reveals several common features associated with telencephalic deficits. Many markers are compressed along the dorsoventral axis of the telencephalon in mutants, a change that is sometimes accompanied by reduced volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; note reduction in <italic>emx3</italic> and <italic>eomesa</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). Dorsoventral compression is most evident in markers with strong midline ventricle expression such as <italic>ascl1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). When loss of expression occurs it is particularly pronounced in the pallium, as seen when markers broadly expressed in the pallium and subpallium (<italic>emx3</italic>, <italic>tbr1b</italic>) are co-registered with markers that are more restricted to the subpallium (<italic>dlx5a</italic>, <italic>gad1b</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Lastly, many diencephalic expression domains located in close proximity to the telencephalon undergo an anterior/ventral shift. When mutant and wild-type expression patterns (labeled in magenta and green, respectively) are overlaid, this shift shows up as a narrow band of magenta running along the anterior/ventral edge of the expression domain. This shift is evident in <italic>gad1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>), <italic>dlx5a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), <italic>ascl1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), and <italic>neurog1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest the size of the telencephalon (particularly the pallium) may be reduced in <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants, resulting in a concomitant anterior/ventral shift in neighboring diencephalic domains when embryos are co-registered. To verify a physical reduction in the telencephalon, we performed 2P excitation microscopy on Nissl-stained wild-type and mutant embryos at 2 dpf. Using Nissl staining to visualize brain morphology, we generated manual 3D segmentations of the telencephalon based exclusively on physical landmarks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Volume measurements showed a highly significant reduction in overall telencephalic size in <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Additionally, the brain ventricle of the dorsal telencephalon is noticeably larger in mutants based on sections through Nissl-stained images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We present a platform and algorithms for rapid 3D deep-phenotyping of zebrafish embryos using chromogenic WISH. Automated quantitative phenotyping approaches like this will be invaluable for characterizing the numerous new lines being developed using advanced genome editing techniques. 3D datasets are essential for understanding developmental patterning and for systems-level analysis of gene regulatory networks and neural circuits. Published techniques for automated 3D analysis of gene expression in zebrafish are limited to fluorescent readouts and optical sectioning approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ronneberger et al., 2012</xref>). Although spectrally distinct fluorescent probes offer the advantage of simultaneously visualizing three or more genes per sample, they also require expensive hardware for 3D imaging, suffer from photobleaching, anisotropic resolution, have low signal intensity relative to bright-field labels, and undergo quenching under common tissue clearing protocols. Additionally, even fluorescent probes require registration to a common reference frame for simultaneous analysis of more than a few genes or for comparisons between experimental groups. Chromogenic WISH staining offers a complementary approach to 3D phenotyping. Photobleaching and quenching are not a concern, stains are extremely high-contrast (allowing for higher-throughput imaging) and stable for years, and protocols are well-established, robust, inexpensive, and have been fully automated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hauptmann, 2015</xref>). Quantitative deep-phenotyping of chromogenic WISH-stained embryos requires: (1) hardware for rapidly imaging cleared non-embedded samples, (2) algorithms for aligning reconstructions to a common reference frame, and (3) robust analysis tools to correlate gene expression between experimental groups. Our automated WISH OPT platform addresses all of these requirements.</p><p>Using deep phenotyping to analyze zebrafish <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants, we have detected several overlooked deficits. We show for the first time that mutants exhibit defects in glutamatergic neurogenesis in the telencephalon and that this phenotype is already present at 2 dpf. These data reveal unsuspected commonalities between <italic>fezf2</italic> function in fish and mammals and suggest an evolutionarily conserved role in glutamatergic development, particularly in the dorsal telencephalon. Our findings help to resolve a paradox: although developmental expression of <italic>fezf2</italic> in the brain is highly conserved across species, reported loss- and gain-of-function phenotypes in zebrafish and rodents differ considerably. Zebrafish mutants are characterized by diencephalic deficits in DA, 5-HT, and GABAergic populations, while knockout mice display telencephalic deficits in cortical glutamatergic projection neurons. In mice, ectopic expression of <italic>Fezf2</italic> in neural progenitor populations that normally give rise to GABAergic neurons redirects them to a glutamatergic fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rouaux and Arlotta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zuccotti et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this, <italic>Fezf2</italic> has been shown to promote glutamatergic corticospinal motor neuron identity and repress GABAergic identity in mammalian cells by activating <italic>Vglut1</italic> and repressing <italic>Gad1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lodato et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of <italic>fezf2</italic> during early zebrafish development results in increased DA neurons in the ventral diencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Until now, no <italic>fezf2</italic> glutamatergic defects have been described in zebrafish, raising the possibility that <italic>fezf2</italic> has assumed novel functions in the mammalian telencephalon. Based on our findings, it seems likely <italic>fezf2</italic> actually has a longstanding role in telencephalic glutamatergic differentiation predating the divergence of teleosts and tetraopods. Significantly, glutamatergic populations are most strongly affected in the pallium of <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants, the same region of the telencephalon from which the mammalian neocortex is derived.</p><p>In addition to revealing a common role for <italic>fezf2</italic> in glutamatergic neurogenesis, our findings bring <italic>fezf2</italic> defects during early zebrafish development into closer agreement with phenotypes described in adult fish. Recently it has been reported that adult <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants have strikingly smaller telencephalons, although gross morphological changes are not apparent even at 2 weeks post fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berberoglu et al., 2014</xref>). Telencephalic reduction is accompanied by distortions in <italic>fezf2</italic> expression and enlargement of the dorsal telencephalon ventricle. Reduced telencephalic size, altered <italic>fezf2</italic> expression, and ventricular enlargement is the same constellation of phenotypes we detect at 2 dpf using deep-phenotyping, although all deficits are far less pronounced at this early stage and would be difficult to detect without quantitative 3D approaches. Previous studies have also reported decreased neurite complexity and increased numbers of neural stem cells in the dorsal telencephalon of adult <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants, suggesting a failure of maturation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berberoglu et al., 2014</xref>). This interpretation is supported by our finding that pluripotent progenitor markers (<italic>ascl1a</italic>, <italic>ascl1b</italic>, <italic>neurog1</italic>) are not significantly reduced in the <italic>fezf2</italic> mutant pallium, while markers of some postmitotic subtypes (<italic>tbr1b</italic>, <italic>vglut1</italic>, <italic>vglut2.2</italic>) undergo a substantial reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Maintenance of fish, embryo collection, and genotyping</title><p>Zebrafish were maintained under standard laboratory conditions and staged as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Westerfield, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimmel et al., 2001</xref>).

A broadband Tungsten-Halogen lamp (#QTH10; Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) is used for illumination. The light from the lamp passes through a 5 mm thick ground glass diffuser before entering the imaging chamber containing the WISH-stained sample and is then collected by a telephoto zoom lens (EF 70–300 mm f/4–5.6 L IS USM; Canon, Tokyo, Japan). Alternatively, a 4X microscope objective (along with a tube lens and 5 mm aperture) may be used in place of the telephoto lens. We have tested a Plan Fluor 4X/0.13 NA objective (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and obtain 3D reconstructions of comparable quality and resolution to those produced by a telephoto lens. A high-speed CCD camera (Prosilica GX 1050C; Allied Vision Technologies, Stadtroda, Germany) is used for acquisition. The imaging chamber includes a stepping motor (AH1K-S543, Autonics, Busan, South Korea) run by 5-phase microstepping drivers (MD5-HF14, Autonics), which holds and rotates the aluminosilicate glass capillary (#A150-100-10, ID = 1 mm; Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) during image acquisition. The lower part of the capillary that holds the embryo is immersed in BABB, which is contained within a transparent glass cuvette (#C-G-F-20, The Science Outlet, Keota, OK), to ensure refractive index (RI) matching between the inside and outside of the capillary. All components are mounted to an optical table or breadboard and the light source, imaging chamber, lens, and camera are aligned. To ensure precise positioning of embryos of different sizes from various developmental stages and to increase embryo stability during rotational imaging, a tapered insertion is synthesized from index-matching optical adhesive at the bottom end of the capillary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; details below). Individual zebrafish embryos are loaded through the single upper fluidic port, enter the vertically configured glass capillary, and are stopped when they reach the RI-matched tapered insertion, which is precisely aligned with the telephoto zoom lens. The stepping motor then automatically rotates the capillary through a complete revolution in ~12 s as images are acquired. Following image acquisition the sample is unloaded through the same upper fluidic port and the next sample is introduced. Loading and unloading is achieved by pumping or withdrawing BABB from the fluidic port using a polypropylene syringe. Average handling time per embryo is 55.0 ± 2.9 s when loading and unloading is done manually (embryo loading: 19.4 ± 2.1s; image acquisition and data transfer: 18.0 ± 0.7s; embryo unloading: 17.6 ± 3.0).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fabrication of index-matching capillary insertions</title><p>The aluminosilicate glass capillary is first cleaned by immersion in NanoStrip (KMG, Pueblo, CO) for 30 min and then thoroughly rinsed in DI water. Once dry, the distal end of the capillary is dipped into index-matching optical adhesive (#NOA 61; Norland Products, Cranbury, NJ) and held in place until the capillary draws up ~5 mm of the liquid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The tapering is then formed through a two-step UV curing procedure. In the first step, the capillary filled with uncured adhesive is rotated using a miniature DC electric motor (#EL292-0015S, Ajax Scientific, Scarborough ON) under a 254 nm short wavelength UV source (Spectrolinker XL-1000, Spectroline, Westbury, NY) for ~240 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). During this step, the capillary is positioned ~15 cm from the light source, resulting in an estimated irradiance of ~6 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> at the surface. Because the UV 254 wavelength has a poor optical transmission rate in the adhesive, it is only cured in a thin cylindrical outer shell immediately adjacent to the capillary wall. An opaque mask is used to shield the proximal half of the adhesive from the UV source during the first curing step. In the second step, air is pumped through the capillary from the proximal end using a 60 mL syringe at a rate of 20 mL per second, causing the uncured adhesive to form a tapering surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As air is being passed through the capillary, a 365 nm long wavelength 100-watt UV lamp (Blak-Ray B-100A, UVP, Upland, CA) is used to rapidly cure the adhesive into the desired shape. During this step, the capillary is positioned ~10 cm from the UV lamp, resulting in an estimated irradiance of ~10 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> at the surface. Once the adhesive has begun to solidify, the distal end of the capillary is connected to a vacuum line and allowed to cure for an additional 10 min under long wavelength UV. Finally, the capillary is incubated at 50°C for 12 hr to enhance the solvent-resistance of the adhesive.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image acquisition</title><p>During image acquisition, a custom-made MATLAB program controls the stepping motor and CCD camera as the capillary rotates through 360° and 360 images of the embryo are continuously acquired at a frame rate of 30 fps. Each image is 1024 × 1024 pixels (~1540 × 1540 µm field of view) and provides sufficient resolution to visualize WISH stains that label individual cells (e.g. <italic>th</italic>, which labels discrete cells in the retina). CCD cameras often have minor variation in the pixel response, which can result in image artifacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To correct for this, we illuminated the camera using the OPT light source with the imaging chamber removed from the light path to achieve uniform illumination and calculated the average pixel response for each pixel over time. Dividing the average individual pixel response by the average value for all pixels provides an estimation of the deviation from the average. For all acquired images, each pixel is divided by its estimated deviation value, thereby eliminating artifacts arising from pixel sensitivity variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walls et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Image reconstruction</title><p>The orientation of the embryo in the capillary (head-first vs. tail-first) is automatically detected as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2012</xref>). Movements of the capillary that occur during rotation and image acquisition need to be corrected to ensure high-resolution reconstructions. All frames are aligned based on methods we developed previously for non-embedded OPT imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pardo-Martin et al., 2013</xref>). We correct for sideways movements of the capillary by detecting the sharp boundaries at the edges of the capillary. The upper and lower boundaries are used to align all rotational images and to stretch or shrink the image to achieve an equal capillary diameter across all images. The addition of a tapered capillary insertion, in combination with the vertical orientation of our imaging chamber, eliminates artifacts arising from longitudinal movements of the embryo along the capillary axis. The precise center of rotation (COR) is determined by generating multiple 2D reconstructions through the embryos using different estimated CORs. The COR whose reconstruction has the lowest entropy (i.e. the sharpest boundaries) is then used for the subsequent 3D reconstruction of the entire embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pardo-Martin et al., 2013</xref>). Correction for non-uniform illumination across the cross-section of the capillary is done by first determining the maximum value for all pixels in all rotational frames. Regions containing the embryo are then masked out and an interpolation is done in the masked out region to create a blank background image. This background image is used as a baseline to equalize the illumination. After the alignment, all color channels are independently reconstructed with a GPU implemented Filtered Back Projection algorithm provided in the Astra toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Aarle et al., 2015</xref>). Each of the three color channels contains slightly different information. The dark blue chromogenic in situ stain is most easily distinguished from the background in the red channel. In the blue channel the in situ stain is faint and the SYTOX Green counterstain dominates, while in the green channel both SYTOX and in situ stains can be clearly seen <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–I</xref>). The alignment and reconstruction takes ~11 min per embryo to run on a 2.6 GHz hexa-core processor standard workstation and the reconstructed image has a size of 512x512 × 512 voxels. Both alignment and reconstruction are fully automated and can therefore be run offline without any user intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Image registration</title><p>All registrations discussed below are done with the toolbox elastix (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_009619">SCR_009619</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shamonin et al., 2013</xref>) and MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox (Release R2015b; MathWorks, Natick, MA). There are four types of transforms used for registration in this paper: rigid, similarity, affine, and B-spline. A rigid transform consists of only translation and rotation. The similarity transform consists of translation, rotation, and isotropic scaling. The affine transformation consists of translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing. The B-spline transform is a deformable transform where a deformation field is modelled using B-splines. The deformation is achieved by moving the control points in a sparse regular grid. The deformation at any point is obtained by using a B-spline interpolation kernel. A regularizer is used to constrain the deformation of the B-spline from deforming too much. We use a local rigidity penalty term developed for medical image registration in all deformable registrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Staring et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The measure of similarity used in all registrations is normalized correlation, which is computed using elastix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shamonin et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, all registrations are done on gradient magnitude images to emphasize edges. In addition, all registrations are done with a multi-resolution approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lester and Arridge, 1999</xref>). The registration starts with a low resolution image (downsampled 6× or 8×), providing a coarse registration. The registration continues progressively through to higher resolutions. The final registration is done on a 2× downsampled or full-size image. This registration scheme makes the optimization less likely to get stuck in a local minimum and also decreases the time to reach the global minima.</p><p>Our basic registration workflow consists of three steps: initial, coarse, and fine alignment. The initial alignment is a rigid registration with the aim of positioning all embryos in a roughly similar position to the reference image. Eight different initial positions are tested for the moving image. This step is done on an 8× downsampled image. The position that provides the best match based on the similarity measure is further aligned in the next step. After the initial alignment, we perform a coarse registration with a similarity and/or an affine transform. This step is done with an 8×, 4×, and 2× downsampled image. This provides a good registration without adding any deformation to the sample. The fine registration is the last step of the process (and is omitted in certain instances as noted) and consists of a deformable registration. This step is done an 8×, 6×, and 3× downsampled image and performs a non-linear deformation to the sample. We used a grid spacing of 60 voxels in order to limit the deformation to larger deformations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Unstained reference fish</title><p>Before individual reconstructions of WISH-stained embryos can be compared, they must first be brought into alignment through registration to an appropriate reference embryo that is compatible with all probes in the library. In order to generate a suitable reference, we first perform tomographic reconstructions on 5–7 wild-type fish that have been taken through the WISH protocol without a riboprobe, ensuring that registration will be driven by morphology rather than features unique to any given gene expression pattern. An average unstained reference fish (URF) is then created using the registration workflow outlined above in combination with Iterative Shape Averaging (ISA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rohlfing et al., 2001</xref>). The initial alignment of all unstained embryos is done using a rigid transform. An average fish is then created from the aligned images. In the next round of registration, all embryos are aligned to the average using a similarity transform. A new average is then created from the aligned images and the process is repeated with an affine transform and finally a deformable transform to produce the final average URF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). An age-specific URF is created for each developmental stage of interest (i.e. 2 and 3 dpf in the present paper). All registration steps for the URF are done on the green channel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>In situ pattern alignment</title><p>When viewed in bright field (blue or green channels), SYTOX Green labels all tissues with a more or less uniform faint red counterstain. This has the effect of highlighting surface features and a few prominent morphological landmarks (such as brain ventricles), but does not delineate internal brain structure sufficiently to allow for precise deformable registration of internal points. In contrast, the gene expression patterns visible in in situ stained embryos (red or green channels) provide prominent internal reference points to guide deformable registration. Indeed, the use of deformable transforms is essential to precisely align complex 3D expression patterns and minimize the possibility of incorrectly detecting alterations where none exist during subsequent automated statistical analysis. To overcome these challenges and align WISH-stained embryos as closely as possible to one another and to the common reference frame, we begin by a selecting a probe-specific reference for each probe in the library. Probe reference fish (PRFs) are chosen using a variation of the strategy used to create URFs. All 8+ individual wild-type embryos for a given probe at a given developmental stage are first registered together as previously described using ISA in the green channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). At the end of this process, the individual embryo that is most similar to the final average wild-type (based on the correlation value from the last iteration of ISA) is chosen as the PRF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The goal of this process is to select the embryo with the most representative overall morphology and staining pattern as the reference image, rather than to randomly select an embryo that might represent an outlier. The selected PRF is then aligned to URF with a rigid and affine registration in the blue channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3B</xref>). The blue channel is used in order to minimize the influence of the in situ pattern on the registration to the unstained reference. All wild-type and mutant embryos stained with the same probe are then aligned to the PRF. This is done in the green channel to make use of probe-specific landmarks and is performed using our standard registration workflow: rigid, similarity, affine and finally deformable registration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3C</xref>). During alignment, the relative volume of all embryos is estimated from the affine registration to the PRF (which corresponds to the size of the URF). Occasionally, an embryo is detected that differs substantially in size from both wild-type and mutant age-matched clutchmates. Typically, these outliers are smaller in volume, suggesting sporadic developmental defects linked to embryo health or genetic background. Therefore, to avoid phenotyping artifacts, embryos that deviate by more than 50% from the volume of the URF are excluded from further analysis. Once all embryos have been registered with each other, a new average wild-type is created by calculating the average intensity of each aligned voxel in the wild-type group. This average is aligned to the URF in the blue channel with an affine transform. The transformation from this final step is then applied to all wild-type and mutant embryos for that probe, ensuring they are aligned as closely as possible to the common reference frame. Alignment takes 11 min per sample on a 2.6 GHz hexa-core processor standard workstation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Brain atlas</title><p>In order to create a custom 3D anatomical reference atlas for mapping brain-specific WISH staining patterns, we imaged Nissl-stained zebrafish embryos at 2 and 3 dpf using two-photon (2P) excitation microscopy. To ensure the best possible match between 3D atlases and OPT reconstructions, embryos were processed using our standard WISH protocol (without a riboprobe). Following WISH, embryos were stained with NeuroTrace 500/525 Green Fluorescent Nissl Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1:100 in PBS. Staining was carried out for 10 hr at 4°C and embryos were rinsed several times in PBS. To provide a uniform counterstain and enable registration of 2P images with URFs, the embryos were further stained with SYTO 64 Red Fluorescent Nucleic Acid Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1:2000 in PBS. Staining was carried out overnight at 4°C, and embryos were washed twice in PBS. Stained embryos were embedded in 0.7 mm thick disk-shaped 1% low gelling temperature agarose blocks (Sigma-Aldrich). The embedded samples were thoroughly dehydrated in methanol and then immersed in BABB for 15 min. The agarose disks were sandwiched between two thin glass slides during 2P imaging. The images were taken using a 2P workstation with Zeiss 20 × 1.0 NA DIC (UV) VIS-R objective. The excitation wavelength was set to 900 nm, the pixel resolution was set to 1.169 μm, and the step size along z-axis was 1 μm.</p><p>Manual segmentation of the brain regions was done using the software TurtleSeg 1.3 (Oxipita, Vancouver, Canada; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002605">SCR_002605</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Top et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Top et al., 2010</xref>).

In order to align our anatomical atlases (which based on 2P imaging) with our OPT reference frame, the SYTO red fluorescent image was aligned to the age-appropriate URF in the green channel with a rigid followed by an affine transform. Our 2 and 3 dpf 3D anatomical brain atlases comprise 22 different brain regions located within the telencephalon, diencephalon, midbrain, and hindbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Automated detection and quantification of alterations in gene expression</title><p>Automated Correlation Analysis and other automated phenotyping steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>) are carried out on results from the final deformable registration step. Analysis is done in MATLAB on 2× downsampled data from the red channel, where the WISH signal is strongest. For Automated Correlation Analysis, a Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated for every probe within all brain regions based on the intensities of corresponding voxels between each wild-type and mutant embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goshtasby, 2012</xref>). The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test is used to assess if intra-group correlations (wild-type vs. wild-type and mutant vs. mutant) are significantly larger than inter-group (wild-type vs. mutant) correlations (p&lt;1×10<sup>−5</sup>). The effect size (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>) is also calculated to measure the magnitude of the difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sullivan and Feinn, 2012</xref>).

Both <italic>p</italic>-value and Cohen's <italic>d</italic> are combined to create an Automated Correlation Analysis table depicting changes in all probes across all brain regions at 2 and 3 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left).</p><p>The voxelwise p-value test, shown together with the maximum intensity projection (MIP) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>, are generated by performing a Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test to compare corresponding voxels in wild-types and mutants for each probe.

The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test is only performed within brain regions that show alterations in the Automated Correlation Analysis for that particular probe. For all significant voxels the average wildtype is subtracted from the average mutant. Separate color coded MIPs are generated for all areas of positive difference (significant decrease in expression; cyan) and negative difference (significant increase in expression; magenta) and added to a composite MIP of the average expression pattern for the probe in both wild-types and mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Virtual 2D slicing and 3D segmentation</title><p>Because the first goal of automated phenotyping is to make an unbiased determination as to whether or not actual differences exist between wild-type and mutant embryos, it is essential to begin any analysis by treating both groups identically. This is why both wild-types and mutants are initially registered to a single wild-type PRF during Automated Correlation Analysis and other automated phenotyping steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Using a common reference fish for both groups ensures that detected differences are due to actual alterations in gene expression rather than registration artifacts arising from the use of separate mutant and wild-type reference fish in the context of deformable (non-linear) transforms. Once it has been verified that significant differences exist, it becomes desirable to modify the registration workflow slightly prior to detailed 2D and 3D analysis, such that the final deformable step is done using separate references for mutants and wild-types. This is necessary to prevent the deformable registration algorithm from artificially minimizing actual phenotypic differences by deforming the mutant expression pattern to match the wild-type. We carry out all linear transforms (rigid, similarity, and affine) as described, and then generate an average wild-type and an average mutant embryo from the final affine step for each probe. The final non-linear B-spline transform is then done by registering all wild-types to the average wild-type reference and all mutants to the average mutant reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). This ensures that morphological differences will be better preserved during subsequent analysis. For 2D slice visualization, we use custom made VTK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schroeder et al., 2004</xref>) scripts to section through 3D reconstructions from the red channel and present the results in false color (green and magenta for two color overlays; cyan, magenta, and yellow for three color overlays). The 2P Nissl stain from the aligned 3D brain atlas is used to show the slice position.</p><p>3D segmentation of gene expression patterns is implemented using adaptive thresholding on a background-reduced image. The background stain is estimated by eroding the reconstructed 3D image in the red channel, and the result is subtracted from the original reconstruction to get an image that mostly shows only the in situ signal. We then apply adaptive thresholding to segment the signal. The threshold is set using the larger value of (1) the global average plus three times the standard deviation of the pixel values of the background-reduced image, and (2) 2/3 of the maximum intensity value in the 10 μm diameter neighborhood. Results are examined and the threshold is fine-tuned if necessary to achieve an optimal segmentation. Any obvious segmentation artifacts arising from background noise are removed manually. In order to visualize an average segmentation from features that have been independently segmented in multiple embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) we use an algorithm that compares collections of segmentations and computes a probabilistic estimate of the true segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Warfield et al., 2004</xref>). In other cases, 3D segmentations are created directly from averaged tomographic reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Source code</title><p>Core source code for image reconstruction and registration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/aallalou/OPT-InSitu-Toolbox">https://github.com/aallalou/OPT-InSitu-Toolbox</ext-link>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/OPT-InSitu-Toolbox">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/OPT-InSitu-Toolbox</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allalou, 2017</xref>), along with brain atlases (Source code 1, see below) and sample data files (Source code 2, see below), are available online.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Automated deep-phenotyping of the vertebrate brain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Allalou et al. describe a platform that they have developed for high throughput characterisation of gene expression patterns and how they are altered in mutant zebrafish embryos and larvae. They have optimised a chromogenic in situ hybridisation protocol for optical projection tomography and developed a pipeline to register mutant and wild-type volumetric datasets to common reference brains, with anatomical annotations. The method is rigorously validated using the <italic>fezf</italic> mutant, reproducing both previously reported defects, anticipated changes that were previously overlooked (such as the loss of <italic>sst1.1</italic> within the <italic>otp</italic> domain) and novel defects due to a change in telencephalon size. Such changes would be difficult to identify using traditional methods for mutant characterization. Methods are for the most part well described, especially the detailed protocol describing modifications to WISH. This is a powerful new method for quantitative phenotypic characterization.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the statistical technique used for automated correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) is robust, the voxel-wise procedure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> is not very rigorous. This is not a deal-breaker because the procedure is in any case only applied within regions already found positive using the Pearson+Whitney method. Nevertheless, strictly, the voxel-wise method used is really a sort of cluster-based technique, using arbitrary thresholds for voxel-wise significance, and cluster-size threshold. Similar methods are known to be dangerously prone to false positives (see Eklund PNAS 2016). More statistically rigorous voxel-wise analysis should be presented.</p><p>2) In several steps of the analysis, a large number of statistical tests are required to compare voxel data for numerous genes and brain regions. What was the basis for setting p value thresholds for so many comparisons?</p><p>3) Please provide more detail in support of the statement &quot;The ability to rapidly image and align thousands of WISH-stained embryos in 3D […]&quot;. Although timings for some individual steps appears in the Methods, it would be useful to summarise in the results text the rate at which lines can be processed, imaged and registered.</p><p>4) The authors state that the registration algorithms used in other studies (e.g. CMTK, used in Randlett, 2016) are unsuitable for their WISH data. It would be informative if they could briefly comment on why this is the case.</p><p>Please make sure to submit the code and brain atlases so that they are available for download by the readers.</p><p>Also, please consider whether you would like your article to appear as a 'Tools and Resources' article or a regular one.</p><p>Suggested revisions:</p><p>The authors should offer more detailed rationale for several steps in the registration procedure; additional information in the manuscript will help inform future work by other groups. Two specific questions:</p><p>1) For each probe, one embryo (the PRF) is selected via strongest correlation to the probe-specific iterative shape average. This embryo is then registered to the URF using a rigid+affine registration (no elastic step) for the sytox channel, then other embryos registered to the PRF using deformable registration using the green channel. But with this procedure, any inaccuracy in the PRF alignment will be transmitted to all other embryos for that probe. Because initial PRF alignment is rigid+affine and not elastic, accuracy will be limited. So why is elastic registration not used for the PRF? The final registration step (subsection “Image registration”, second paragraph) is not well explained – is this rigid+affine only? How is the average wildtype created (ISA?)</p><p>2) Using the WISH pattern to drive registration to a selected wildtype embryo means all the resulting images will have low variability, but actually mask real biological variability in individual WISH patterns. The authors acknowledge this concern at the end of the manuscript – because mutant patterns are elastically aligned to a wildtype WISH pattern differences in the mutant are minimized. My understanding is that the alternate procedure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, that avoids this problem, is only for the 2D visualization overlays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, because it is obviously not suitable for statistical comparison. The more obvious procedure would be to independently align each wildtype and mutant embryo to the URF using its sytox channel, apply the transformation to the WISH channel and then perform statistical comparisons. Why was this method not used?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23379.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Although the statistical technique used for automated correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) is robust, the voxel-wise procedure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> is not very rigorous.

Similar methods are known to be dangerously prone to false positives (see Eklund PNAS 2016). More statistically rigorous voxel-wise analysis should be presented.</italic> </p><p>The paper cited by the reviewer (Eklund et al., &quot;Cluster failure: Why fMRI inferences for spatial extent have inflated false-positive rates&quot; PNAS, 113:7900-5, 2016) uses a large real-world null data set to compute empirical false positive rates for three widely-used fMRI software packages. The authors conclude: &quot;[…] all three packages have conservative voxelwise inference and invalid clusterwise inference, for both one- and two-sample t tests. Alarmingly, the parametric methods can give a very high degree of false positives (up to 70%, compared with the nominal 5%) for clusterwise inference.&quot; Unlike the software packages evaluated in Eklund et al., our voxelwise analysis method uses a non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test) and should not be affected by the large errors that the paper is discussing. However, to more directly address the reviewer's concerns, we have now also incorporated false discovery rate (FDR) estimations into our revised manuscript. FDR estimation is a commonly used approach for determining appropriate <italic>p</italic>-value thresholds in multiple testing settings. To estimate our FDR, we utilize a null data set consisting of 16+ negative control embryos (i.e. embryos that are either genetically wild-type or heterozygous for the <italic>fezf2</italic> mutation) for each of the 19 <italic>in situ</italic> probes in our library. Following in situ staining, negative controls are randomly divided into two separate groups. Since these embryos lack the <italic>fezf2</italic> phenotype, any differences that are detected between the two groups are presumably false positives. We then evaluate significance thresholds (<italic>t</italic>) over a range of <italic>p</italic>-values by counting the number of experimental scores (<italic>s<sub>exp</sub></italic>; i.e. wild-type embryos vs. <italic>fezf2</italic> mutants) ≥ <italic>t</italic> and the number of null scores (<italic>s<sub>null</sub></italic>; i.e. negative control group 1 vs. negative control group 2) ≥ <italic>t</italic> and calculating the FDR (<italic>s<sub>null</sub>/s<sub>exp</sub></italic>). We have performed FDR analysis for both automated correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and voxelwise analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, respectively.</p><p>Our analysis shows that we have a very small number of false positives in our negative control data and, consequently, a very low FDR. For automated correlation analysis, our FDR at the chosen <italic>p</italic>-value threshold (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup>) is 0.043. Additionally, since the mean effect size (ES; Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>) is &lt; 1.0 in the null data set for all significance thresholds evaluated, we include an additional requirement that ES must be &gt; 1.0 for automated correlation analysis, further reducing the FDR from 0.043 to 0.020. For voxelwise analysis, our FDR at the chosen <italic>p</italic>-value threshold (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.5x10<sup>-3</sup>) is 0.004. We have substantially revised the &quot;Automated deep-phenotyping of entire brains in zebrafish mutants&quot; portion of the Results section to reflect these changes and to more clearly explain how <italic>p</italic>-value and Cohen's <italic>d</italic> are combined:</p><p>&quot;We used false discovery rate (FDR) estimation, a technique for assessing false positives when conducting multiple comparisons, to set an appropriate <italic>p</italic>-value threshold for automated phenotyping (Noble, 2009). […] Therefore, we included an effect size requirement (<italic>d</italic> &gt; 1.0) for Automated Correlation Analysis, further reducing the FDR at our selected <italic>p</italic>-value threshold from 0.043 to 0.020 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>).&quot; These criteria (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup>, <italic>d</italic> &gt; 1.0) are used to create an Automated Correlation Analysis table depicting changes in all probes across all brain regions at 2 and 3 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left).&quot;</p><p>Lastly, we have removed the cluster size threshold entirely for voxelwise analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>. This change is motivated in part by papers such as Eklund et al., which report that cluster-based <italic>p</italic>-values tend to be more sensitive to statistical assumptions. Eliminating the cluster size threshold may in fact make voxelwise analysis slightly easier to visualize in our images and, in any event, has no impact on our overall analysis or conclusions.</p><p><italic>2) In several steps of the analysis, a large number of statistical tests are required to compare voxel data for numerous genes and brain regions. What was the basis for setting p value thresholds for so many comparisons?</italic> </p><p>As noted in our response to the previous comment, we have now included false discovery rate (FDR) estimations for both automated correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) and voxelwise analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These FDR estimations provide one basis for determining <italic>p</italic>-value thresholds; for both types of analysis, we have chosen a threshold that results in a FDR &lt; 0.05. Additionally, in the case of voxelwise analysis, the main reason for generating color coded maximum intensity projections is to give readers a clear visual overview of where each gene expression pattern is increased or decreased in the <italic>fezf2</italic> mutant. For this purpose, it is desirable to have a FDR that is much lower than 0.05 in order to reduce background noise from false positive voxels. This can be seen in the negative control images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>, where a p-value of 0.005 gives a FDR of 0.046 but still results in maximum intensity projections with visible false positives. We have therefore used the maximum intensity projections from negative control embryos to assist us in choosing the most appropriate <italic>p</italic>-value threshold for voxelwise analysis (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.5x10<sup>-3</sup>; FDR=0.004).</p><p><italic>3) Please provide more detail in support of the statement &quot;The ability to rapidly image and align thousands of WISH-stained embryos in 3D […]&quot;. Although timings for some individual steps appears in the Methods, it would be useful to summarise in the results text the rate at which lines can be processed, imaged and registered.</italic> </p><p>We have added experimentally recorded times for all sample processing steps to the &quot;High-throughput optical projection tomography platform&quot; portion of the Methods section:</p><p>&quot;Average handling time per embryo is 55.0 ± 2.9 seconds when loading and unloading is done manually (embryo loading: 19.4 ± 2.1s; image acquisition and data transfer: 18.0 ± 0.7s; embryo unloading: 17.6 ± 3.0).&quot;</p><p>We have also clarified that alignment and reconstruction steps can be run offline (e.g. overnight, weekends, etc.) without user intervention:</p><p>&quot;The alignment and reconstruction takes ~11 minutes per embryo to run on a 2.6 GHz hexa-core processor standard workstation and the reconstructed image has a size of 512x512x512 voxels. Both alignment and reconstruction are fully automated and can therefore be run offline without any user intervention.&quot;</p><p><italic>4) The authors state that the registration algorithms used in other studies (e.g. CMTK, used in Randlett, 2016) are unsuitable for their WISH data. It would be informative if they could briefly comment on why this is the case.</italic> </p><p>Both ViBE-Z (Ronneberger et al., Nat Methods, 2012, 9:735-42) and Randlett et al. (Nat Methods, 2015, 12:1039-46) employ fluorescent confocal microscopy and use one fluorescent channel to image a background marker that clearly delineates internal morphology and a second fluorescent channel to image the expression pattern(s) of interest. In the case of ViBE-Z, the background marker is a nuclear stain, while in Randlett et al. it is anti-tERK. Both of these background stains provide sufficient internal details to allow for direct elastic registration of experimental samples to a common reference sample using the &quot;background stain&quot; channel. This transformation is then applied to the stain of interest in the second channel. In contrast, finding a background reference stain that highlights sufficient internal morphology to enable elastic registration, while simultaneously allowing the stain of interest to be imaged accurately and at high resolution using optical projection tomography on non-fluorescent chromogenic labels, is far more challenging. While there are various double-staining chromogenic WISH protocols that might in theory allow for a similar approach (for example: NBT/BCIP produces a dark blue stain and INT/BCIP produces a magenta stain), there are numerous practical challenges. Unlike fluorescent labels, which can be easily separated using appropriate excitation and emission filters, perfectly separating chromogenic stains of different colors into discrete channels based the transmission of visible light through a sample is much more difficult. Failure to achieve adequate separation of the two stains means that the specific gene expression pattern of interest will be partially contaminated/obscured by the background reference stain (and vice versa). Additionally, double staining chromogenic WISH protocols tend to be less robust, more time consuming, and more expensive than standard single color NBT/BCIP staining. For these reasons, existing registration algorithms and workflows are no suitable for analyzing chromogenic WISH via OPT (or at a minimum, doing so would require substantial modification and optimization of both the underlying algorithms and the WISH protocol). Finally, it should be noted that the high temperatures and stringent wash conditions characteristic of WISH protocols result in considerable change to the starting size and shape of fixed samples. These changes are relatively uniform from embryo-to-embryo, so expression patterns can still be easily aligned and compared between in situstained embryos, but aligning in situ stained embryos to an anatomical atlas or common reference frame developed from non-WISH stained embryos is more challenging and requires much greater deformation. Both ViBE-Z and Randlett et al. utilize common reference frames that are based on whole mount immunohistochemistry rather than <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, introducing yet another incompatibility with chromogenic WISH stains. We have slightly modified the &quot;registration and alignment of 3D gene expression datasets&quot; portion of the Results section in an attempt to draw attention to these issues:</p><p>&quot;Automated algorithms for global registration of 3D fluorescent images from zebrafish have been described (Randlett et al., 2015, Ronneberger et al., 2012), however these are unsuitable for tomographic reconstructions from chromogenic WISH as they require imaging two stains in separate fluorescence channels: 1) a detailed marker of internal morphology, which is used to stain all fish and guides deformable registration to the common reference frame and 2) the specific expression pattern of interest. […] The PRF (blue channel) is registered to the URF (green channel) using the SYTOX stain and all other embryos stained with the same probe are registered to the PRF using both the SYTOX stain and the 3D gene expression pattern (green channel).&quot;</p><p>In addition, we have added the following details to the &quot;in situpattern alignment&quot; portion of the Methods section:</p><p>&quot;When viewed in bright field (blue or green channels), SYTOX Green labels all tissues with a more or less uniform faint red counterstain. […] To overcome these challenges and align WISH-stained embryos as closely as possible to one another and to the common reference frame, we begin by a selecting a probe-specific reference for each probe in the library.&quot;</p><p><italic>Please make sure to submit the code and brain atlases so that they are available for download by the readers.</italic> </p><p>We have made our source code available online at GitHub and added a &quot;Source code&quot; section to Methods with links:</p><p>&quot;Core source code for image reconstruction and registration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/aallalou/OPT-InSitu-Toolbox">https://github.com/aallalou/OPT-InSitu-Toolbox</ext-link>), along with brain atlases (Source code 1) and sample data files (Source code 2), are available online.

Two specific questions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) For each probe, one embryo (the PRF) is selected via strongest correlation to the probe-specific iterative shape average. This embryo is then registered to the URF using a rigid+affine registration (no elastic step) for the sytox channel, then other embryos registered to the PRF using deformable registration using the green channel. But with this procedure, any inaccuracy in the PRF alignment will be transmitted to all other embryos for that probe. Because initial PRF alignment is rigid+affine and not elastic, accuracy will be limited. So why is elastic registration not used for the PRF? The final registration step (subsection “Image registration”, second paragraph) is not well explained – is this rigid+affine only? How is the average wildtype created (ISA?)</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is correct that any minor inaccuracies in alignment of the PRF to the URF will be transmitted to all other fish stained with that in situ probe. However, this will only affect the alignment to the URF and the brain atlas. The alignment accuracy for embryos stained with the same probe (which serves as the basis for detecting alterations in gene expression) will not be affected, as they are all registered to the PRF using rigid, affine, and deformable steps. The reason for not including a deformable step when initially registering the PRF to the URF is similar to considerations we have discussed previously under “Essential revisions.” Unlike the PRF, URF does not possess any prominent internal features that can be used to guide deformable image registration; therefore, using a deformable step will not substantially improve registration accuracy. Indeed, based on our experience, using a deformable step when aligning the PRF and URF risks moving internal structures in the PRF more than desired since there are few internal features in the URF. To avoid these issues, we instead use the selection strategy described in the manuscript to identify a PRF for each in situ probe that most closely matches the &quot;average&quot; wild-type for that probe, under the assumption that this will give the best match to the URF (which is an average of multiple wild-type fish).</p><p>The final registration step is done using an affine transform and ensures that all embryos are aligned as correctly as possible to the common reference frame. The average wild-type used in this final step is created by calculating the average intensity of each aligned voxel in the wild-type embryos. We have clarified both of these points in the manuscript as follows:</p><p>&quot;Once all embryos have been registered with each other, a new average wild-type is created by calculating the average intensity of each aligned voxel in the wild-type group. This average is aligned to the URF in the blue channel with an affine transform. The transformation from this final step is then applied to all wild-type and mutant embryos for that probe, ensuring they are aligned as closely as possible to the common reference frame.&quot;</p><p><italic>2) Using the WISH pattern to drive registration to a selected wildtype embryo means all the resulting images will have low variability, but actually mask real biological variability in individual WISH patterns. The authors acknowledge this concern at the end of the manuscript – because mutant patterns are elastically aligned to a wildtype WISH pattern differences in the mutant are minimized. My understanding is that the alternate procedure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, that avoids this problem, is only for the 2D visualization overlays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, because it is obviously not suitable for statistical comparison. The more obvious procedure would be to independently align each wildtype and mutant embryo to the URF using its sytox channel, apply the transformation to the WISH channel and then perform statistical comparisons. Why was this method not used?</italic> </p><p>This relates to previous answers regarding the SYTOX counterstain (blue or green channels). When viewed in bright field, SYTOX labels all tissues with a more or less uniform faint red counterstain. This has the effect of highlighting surface features and a few prominent morphological landmarks (such as brain ventricles), but does not show internal brain structures in sufficient detail to allow for precise deformable registration of internal points. In contrast, the gene expression patterns in in situ stained embryos (red or green channels) provide prominent internal reference points to guide deformable registration. Therefore, independently aligning all wild-type and mutant embryos to the URF using the SYTOX (blue) channel would result in an overall decrease in alignment accuracy between embryos stained with the same probe. For the initial statistical analysis of the mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), our goal was to maximize alignment precision and therefore minimize the possibility of detecting alterations in gene expression where none actually exist (false positives), even at the risk of overlooking some real biological variability (false negatives). By using the alternative alignment procedure outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> – which avoids elastically aligning mutants to wild-types but is unsuitable for statistical comparisons – for subsequent 2D visualization steps, we attempt to ensure that follow-up examination of regions/probes identified by Automated Correlation Analysis will not overlook any real alterations. As noted previously, we have discussed the issues related to deformable registration of internal points based on SYTOX in greater detail in the &quot;in situpattern alignment&quot; portion of the Methods section:</p><p>&quot;When viewed in bright field (blue or green channels), SYTOX Green labels all tissues with a more or less uniform faint red counterstain. […] To overcome these challenges and align WISH-stained embryos as closely as possible to one another and to the common reference frame, we begin by a selecting a probe-specific reference for each probe in the library.&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
