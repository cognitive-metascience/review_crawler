without cortical invasion. However, many important brain areas are located deeper than this. Here, we used an 1100 nm laser that underfilled the back aperture of the objective together with red genetically encoded calcium indicators to establish two-photon calcium imaging of the intact mouse brain and detect neural activity up to 1200 μm from the cortical surface. This imaging was obtained from the medial prefrontal cortex (the prelimbic area) and the hippocampal CA1 region. We found that neural activity before water delivery repeated at a constant interval was higher in the prelimbic area than in layer 2/3 of the secondary motor area. Reducing the invasiveness of imaging is an important strategy to reveal the intact brain processes active in cognition and memory.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26839.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Microscopes can now reveal what individual cells are doing inside a living brain. In a technique called two-photon microscopy, light-sensitive proteins are introduced into the brain cells. A laser then shines light of a specific wavelength into the brain. Whenever one of the proteins in an active brain cell absorbs some light from the laser, it gives off light that a sensor can detect.</p><p>Yet, a two-photon microscope could only &quot;see&quot; up to about 900 micrometers from the brain’s surface. This is because light scatters as it travels through brain tissue. Shorter wavelengths scatter the most; so two-photon microscopes use infrared lasers, which have a longer wavelength than visible light. Even so, structures deeper within the brain like the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex remained out of range. The only way to see these structures – which are involved in memory and planning – was to damage the brain by inserting a lens or by removing the overlying tissue. But such damage may also change brain activity.</p><p>Kondo et al. have now found a way to image brain cells up to 1,200 micrometers below the surface of an intact mouse brain. The new approach uses an optimized microscope and a laser that generates even longer wavelength light. It also makes use of proteins that give off red light, rather than yellow or green. These changes made it possible to view activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The brain cells showed no signs of damage after about 30 minutes of viewing. This suggests that the approach does not cause overheating or kill cells.</p><p>Many questions remain about what happens deep within an active brain. By allowing neuroscientists to follow the activity of brain cells over months, for example as an animal learns a task, these improvements to two-photon microscopy could lead to new insights into the processes of learning and decision-making. Kondo et al. hope that other researchers will find more ways to use the refined technique in their own experiments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Two-photon imaging</kwd><kwd>Prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>Hippocampus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (15H01455)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuzaki</surname><given-names>Masanori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (17H06309)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuzaki</surname><given-names>Masanori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research (A) (15H02350)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuzaki</surname><given-names>Masanori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuzaki</surname><given-names>Masanori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The Strategic Research Program for Brain Sciences</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuzaki</surname><given-names>Masanori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The program for Brain Mapping by Integrated Neurotechnologies for Disease Studies (Brain/MINDS)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuzaki</surname><given-names>Masanori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Establishment of two-photon imaging with a 1100-nm laser, which underfills the objective's back aperture, detects activity of multiple neurons in the prelimbic area and hippocampal CA1 region of the intact mouse brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Two-photon calcium imaging reveals the in vivo activity of multiple neurons at cellular and subcellular resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ohki et al., 2005</xref>). Recent work demonstrates that by exciting red-fluorescent calcium indicators with a laser at wavelengths of 1000–1100 nm through a cranial window, it is possible to image neural activity in the mouse sensory cortex at depths of 800–900 µm from the cortical surface (corresponding to layers 5 and 6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tischbirek et al., 2015</xref>). However, for functional imaging of deeper regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia, invasive penetration is unavoidable; it is necessary to insert a microlens or a microprism into the cortical tissue, or to remove the cortical tissue above the target region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attardo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dombeck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Low et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pilz et al., 2016</xref>). The difficulty of deep imaging is mainly caused by refractive index mismatch and light scattering within the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Helmchen and Denk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tung et al., 2004</xref>). These can be weakened when objectives with low numerical aperture (NA) are used because the angle of light emitted from the objective is smaller and the light-path length within the tissue is shorter than when high NA objectives are used. However, when low NA objectives are used, the spatial resolution and collection efficiency of emitted fluorescent signals are worse than when high NA objectives are used. If a high NA objective is used in conjunction with underfilling of the back aperture by the excitation laser, the collection efficiency of the fluorescent signal remains high. If the effective NA for the excitation light is small but sufficient to resolve single neurons (10–15 μm along the Z axis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lecoq et al., 2014</xref>), this technique may increase the maximal depth for two-photon calcium imaging of neuronal somata. Although this technique has been theoretically predicted and partially demonstrated in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Helmchen and Denk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tung et al., 2004</xref>), it has not been applied to deep imaging of neural activity in behaving animals. In addition, long-wavelength excitation light and red-fluorescent genetically encoded calcium indicators (red GECIs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Inoue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ohkura et al., 2012</xref>) are suitable for deep imaging because light scattering is weaker at longer wavelengths. Here, we demonstrate that by underfilling high NA objectives to reduce the effective NA for excitation to approximately 0.5 and exciting red GECIs with an 1100-nm laser, we could detect the activity of multiple neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (the prelimbic [PL] area) and the hippocampal CA1 region at depths of 1.0–1.2 mm in behaving mice without the need for invasive penetration or removal of cortical tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To reduce the effective NA, the back aperture of a high NA (1.00) objective was underfilled with a diameter-narrowed 1100 nm laser beam (1/e<sup>2</sup>-width was 7.2 mm, compared with the back aperture of 14.4 mm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matsuzaki et al., 2008</xref>). The effective NA was calculated to be roughly 0.5 (see Materials and methods). To examine the effect of underfilling the objective on spatial resolution, 2-μm-diameter fluorescent beads embedded in 2% agarose were imaged through the same glass window used for in vivo GECI imaging (approximately 0.77 mm total thickness). When the objective was underfilled, the full-widths at half-maximum (FWHMs) were 2.28 ± 0.05 μm (mean ± s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 5 beads) laterally and 6.95 ± 0.13 μm (<italic>n</italic> = 5 beads) axially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bi</xref>).

Immunostaining intensity was quantified under five conditions: without imaging (as a negative control), after 15-min imaging at 800–900 µm depths, after 30-min imaging at 900–1100 µm depths, after 30-min imaging at 300–400 µm depths (as a positive control), and after 30-min imaging at 200–300 µm depths, using an objective overfilled with a 200 mW, 920 nm laser and a slow scanning mode (as a strong positive control). The immunoreactivity after 15- or 30-min imaging at 800–1100 µm depths was not different from that in negative control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). By contrast, imaging at 300–400 µm depths with an 1100 nm laser caused significantly higher anti-GFAP and anti-Iba1 immunoreactivity than deep imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

These results indicate that our immunostaining assays are sensitive enough to detect laser-induced tissue damage and are consistent with a study reporting that heat-induced cell responses occur when two-photon imaging is performed at a 250 µm depth with ≥~300 mW laser power at 920 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Podgorski and Ranganathan, 2016</xref>).

In a 25-min continuous imaging session at 900–1100 µm depths in awake mice, we compared the activity of imaged neurons in the first 5-min period with that in the last 5-min period. There was no difference in the mean inferred activities (by a constrained non-negative matrix factorization algorithm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016</xref>) between the two periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This indicates that two-photon imaging of the deep area with ~180 mW laser power did not appear to alter neural excitability.</p><p>To demonstrate the utility of this method for identifying neural functions in deep areas in the intact brain, we examined neural activity in the mFrC over ~1 mm depth during simple conditioning. Head-restrained mice were conditioned to the delivery of a drop of water with an inter-delivery interval of 20 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As each session progressed (one session per day), the licking response rate to water delivery increased and licking became faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). From the fourth–fifth sessions onwards, we performed two-photon calcium imaging of the mFrC at cortical depths of 100–1200 µm (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). The imaging fields were classified into three areas according to depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paxinos and Franklin, 2007</xref>): the superficial area (100–300 µm, corresponding to layer 2/3 in the secondary motor area, M2), the middle area (300–800 µm, corresponding to layer 5 in M2), and the deep area (800–1200 µm, roughly corresponding to layer 6 in M2 and the PL area). In all three areas, approximately 50% of neurons showed a peak in the mean (trial-averaged) activity during the 5 s after water delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which was presumably related to licking and water acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Additionally, approximately 30% of neurons in all three areas showed a peak in the mean activity during the 10 s before water delivery (pre-reward period; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The sequential distribution of the times of peak activity was not an artifact of ordering the neurons according to the time of peak activity, as the ratio of the mean activity around the peak activity to the baseline activity (ridge-to-background ratio; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>) was significantly higher than that of shuffled data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). Additionally, the sequential distribution of neurons with peak activity during the pre-reward period was not an artifact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). As the mFrC demonstrates strong activity before movement starts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Friedman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pinto and Dan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sul et al., 2011</xref>), we focused on the activity during the pre-reward period. When 5 s windows were chosen from the pre-reward period, the ridge-to-background ratios of deep area neurons with peak activity during each 5 s window were frequently higher than those in the shuffled data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). To determine whether the activity pattern across trials was stable for individual neurons with peak activity during the pre-reward period, we calculated the correlation coefficient between the times of peak activity of two randomly separated groups of trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>; see details in Materials and methods section) and found that it was higher in the deep area than in the superficial area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>).

This may be due not only to reduced light scattering but also to the high fluorescent signal in the underfilled configuration; fluorescence is integrated over a larger focal volume in the underfilled configuration than in the overfilled configuration. Deep imaging of neural activity required a relatively high-power laser. However, we confirmed that 15- and 30-min imaging did not produce any apparent morphological or functional damage to the brain tissue. This might be because the excitation (or density of photons) at the focal center is lower in the underfilled configuration than in the overfilled configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Helmchen and Denk, 2005</xref>) and the heat derived from the 1100 nm photon absorbance is relatively low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hale and Querry, 1973</xref>).</p><p>We could not image the infralimbic area at &gt;1200 µm depths or the hippocampus in adult mice. Adult hippocampus is difficult to image because, as the mouse becomes older, the myelination of the white matter increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bockhorst et al., 2008</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that three-photon calcium imaging with a 1300 nm laser with a high power per pulse (~60 nJ) can access adult hippocampal CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ouzounov et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that light at around 1100 nm may also penetrate the highly myelinated white matter if a laser with higher average power or higher power per pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kawakami et al., 2015</xref>) is used (the power per pulse in this study was 2.3 nJ). In addition, reduction of the effective NA to ~0.35 (corresponding to an axial resolution of ~10 µm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lecoq et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stirman et al., 2016</xref>), introduction of adaptive optics to compensate for light scattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ji et al., 2010</xref>), and further improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio of red GECIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Inoue et al., 2015</xref>) will certainly be helpful for imaging multicellular activity in the infralimbic area and the hippocampus in adult intact mice. The major disadvantage of reducing the effective NA is a decrease in spatial resolution. In this study, the axial resolution was approximately 7 µm, which is sufficient to resolve single neurons and is unlikely to cause cross-talk between neurons closely located along the Z axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lecoq et al., 2014</xref>). However, if dendritic branches and spines, and axonal branches and boutons, are the imaging target, then the spatial resolution may not be sufficient. When adaptive optics are used, YFP-expressing dendritic spines can be resolved at a depth of 600 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, for deep imaging of subcellular activity, a slightly underfilled objective (with an effective NA of ~0.7) combined with adaptive optics may be useful.</p><p>We found that neural activity during the pre-reward period was more robust in the deep area (the PL area) than in the superficial area of the mFrC (M2). The PL area is strongly related to the processing of motivation-, attention-, and reward-related information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Friedman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Otis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pinto and Dan, 2015</xref>), whereas M2 is strongly related to action selection and motor planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sul et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, PL activity during the pre-reward period might reflect the expectation of reward delivery, including motivation, reward prediction, or attention to the timing of the water delivery. However, the conditioning in this study did not require any change in mouse brain state before water delivery. Conducting deep imaging during decision-making tasks will help us to understand the hierarchical and/or parallel processing occurring across the PL and M2 areas during decision-making and action.</p><p>In the intact brain, it is easy to change the field of view parallel to the cortical surface. An 8-mm-wide glass window can be used for long-term imaging of the whole dorsal neocortex in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2016a</xref>). Objectives with wide fields of view (&gt;3 mm) developed for two-photon imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sofroniew et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stirman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>) can cover the mFrC and the neocortex lying above the hippocampus. The hippocampus connects the mFrC through the thalamus and the entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jin and Maren, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Varela et al., 2014</xref>) and is thought to associate spatial, temporal, and reward information, which are required for goal-directed decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wikenheiser and Schoenbaum, 2016</xref>). Here, the pre-reward activity in hippocampal CA1 neurons was not stable, likely because the conditioning period in the young mice was not sufficient to form such activity. If the adult hippocampus can be imaged through a wide-field cranial window and objective, the neural activity in both areas could be imaged simultaneously. Deep and wide-field two-photon calcium imaging of the intact brain will substantially aid our understanding of the brain circuits that integrate multimodal information in decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The University of Tokyo, Japan (Medicine-P16-012).

Body temperature was maintained at 36–37°C with a heating pad. After the exposed skull was cleaned, a head-plate (Tsukasa Giken, Shizuoka, Japan; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hira et al., 2013</xref>) was attached to the skull using dental cement (Fuji lute BC; GC, Tokyo, Japan, and Bistite II; Tokuyama Dental, Tokyo, Japan). The surface of the intact skull was coated with dental adhesive resin cement (Super bond; Sun Medical, Shiga, Japan) to prevent drying.

Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3–4% for induction and ~1% during surgery) inhalation and placed on a stereotaxic frame (SR-5M; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). Before virus injection, a pulled glass pipette (broken and beveled to an outer diameter of 25–30 μm; Sutter Instruments, CA, USA) and a 5 μl Hamilton syringe were back-filled with mineral oil (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and front-loaded with virus solution. The virus solution was then injected into the mFrC (2.7–2.8 mm anterior and 0.4 mm left of the bregma, 800–1200 µm dorsal from the cortical surface) through a craniotomy with a small diameter of &lt;0.5 mm. To minimize background fluorescence from solution backflow through the space made by the glass capillary insertion, the axis of the glass capillary was angled 30–40° from the horizontal plane. From 100 to 200 nl of AAV solution was injected via a syringe pump at a rate of 15–20 nl/min (KDS310; KD Scientific, MA, USA). The capillary was maintained in place for more than 10 min after the injection before being slowly withdrawn. The craniotomy was then covered with silicon elastomer (quick cast, World Precision Instruments, FL, USA) and dental adhesive (Super bond). At least 3 weeks after the viral injection, the craniotomy (2 mm square for tdTomato imaging or 1.5 mm circle for GECI imaging) was conducted at the area of interest and dura mater was removed. The craniotomies for the virus injection and for the imaging window did not overlap. With an intact dura, GECI fluorescence was not detected at depths of &gt;1000 µm in the mFrC in our system. A glass window was placed over the craniotomy and the edge was sealed with cyanoacrylate adhesive (Vetbond, 3M, MN, USA), dental resin cement, and dental adhesive.

Two weeks after injection, the mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (74 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), the head-plate was attached, and the imaging window was implanted.

During the behavioral conditioning, mice were set within a body chamber and head-fixed with custom-designed apparatus (O’Hara, Tokyo, Japan; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hira et al., 2013</xref>). A spout was set in front of their mouth, and a 4 μl drop of water was delivered from the spout at a time interval of 20 s. The mice were allowed to lick at any time, and licking behavior was monitored by an infrared LED sensor. The rate of water delivery that incurred at least one lick during 2 s after the delivery was defined as the responsive rate. The duration of the daily conditioning sessions was 40–60 min. At the end of each session, the mice were allowed to freely gain water drops (total water consumption was ~1 ml per session). On rest days (typically weekends), the mice had free access to a 3% agarose block (1.2 g per day) in the cage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Two-photon calcium imaging</title><p>Two-photon imaging was conducted using an FVMPE-RS system (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 25 × water immersion objective (for imaging of the mFrC: XLPLN25XSVMP, numerical aperture: 1.00, working distance: 4 mm, Olympus; for imaging of the hippocampus: XLPLN25XWMP2, numerical aperture: 1.05, working distance: 2 mm, Olympus) and a broadly tunable laser with a pulse width of 120 fs and a repetition rate of 80 MHz (Insight DS +Dual, Spectra Physics, CA, USA), set at a wavelength of 1100 nm. Fluorescence emissions were collected using a GaAsP photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan). To shorten the light-path length within the tissue, the back aperture of the objective was underfilled with the diameter-shortened (7.2 mm, in comparison with that of the back aperture of 14.4 mm or 15.1 mm) laser beam. When the objective (XLPLN25XSVMP) was underfilled, the effective NA was calculated to be roughly 0.5 (i.e., 1.00 × 7.2/14.4). When scanning the center of the glass window at a depth of 1.2 mm from the cortical surface, the laser was assumed to be not clipped by the glass window (0.5 &lt; 1.33 sin (tan<sup>−1</sup> [0.75/1.2])=0.70).</p><p>During the imaging experiments, the mouse head was fixed and the body was constrained within a body chamber under the microscope (OPR-GST, O’Hara; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Masamizu et al., 2014</xref>). Before the first imaging session began for each mouse, the angle of the stage on which the mouse chamber was placed was finely adjusted to set the glass window perpendicular to the optical axis. This was accomplished by the imaging of microbeads on the surface of the glass window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kawakami et al., 2015</xref>). The frame acquisition rate was 30 frames/s, with a resonant scanning mirror for the X axis and a galvanometric scanning mirror for the Y axis, the pixel dwell time was 0.067 µs, and the size of the imaging fields was generally 512 × 512 pixels (0.994 µm/pixel) or 512 × 160 pixels, with three-frame averaging to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. For the strong control condition in the immunostaining experiment, the laser wavelength was tuned to 920 nm, galvanometric scanning mirrors were used for the horizontal and vertical axes, and the pixel dwell time was 200 µs. The collection collar of the objective was adjusted so that the imaging plane was well resolved. For XYZ imaging, the collar was adjusted so that deep planes were well resolved. The laser power was gradually increased from the cortical surface to the deep imaging plane. XYZ image stacks were acquired with a resonant scanner and 16–frame averaging per XY-plane. The step size was 2.5 µm unless otherwise noted. In the comparative experiments using underfilled and overfilled objectives, the laser power at the front aperture of the objective was measured in both objective configurations, and adjusted such that it was equal at each depth of imaging in the same anesthetized mice. The transmission ratio of the overfilled objective to the underfilled objective was approximately 1.5. The depth of the functional imaging plane was up to 1200 µm from the cortical surface (<italic>n</italic> = 62 planes in the mFrC from 11 mice expressing R-CaMP1.07, <italic>n</italic> = 6 in the hippocampus from three mice expressing jRGECO1a).

To remove the effects of different sample sizes across the three mFrC areas and the hippocampus, 50 neurons were randomly chosen from all imaging fields in each area. The time of peak activity in one group was plotted against that in the other, and the Pearson’s correlation coefficient was determined. Thus, if the timing of the peak activity of each neuron was constant across trials, the correlation coefficient should be 1. This procedure was repeated 1000 times, and the 95% confidence interval was determined for each of the areas. When the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was above zero, it was concluded that the time of peak activity was not random across trials. To estimate the difference in the trial-by-trial stability of the time of peak activity between pairs of the three areas in the mFrC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>), the mean correlation coefficients were compared using a permutation test. For each pair from the superficial, middle, and deep areas, all neurons with peak activity during the pre-reward period were randomly reassigned to one of the two areas. For each area with reassigned neurons, the correlation coefficient between the times of peak activity of the two randomly separated groups of trials was calculated, and the absolute difference of the correlation coefficients between the two areas was estimated. This procedure was repeated 10,000 times, and the distribution of the absolute differences between the two areas was determined. Following this, the statistical significance was determined according to whether or not the absolute difference in the mean correlation coefficients between the two areas with original neurons assigned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>) was above the 95th percentile of the resampled distribution corrected using the Bonferroni method. The difference in the distribution of the correlation coefficients was not due to differences in animal behavior because the mean response rate and reaction time during imaging experiments were not different among the three areas (response rate, 98.98 ± 0.72% in the superficial area, 98.63 ± 0.39% in the middle area, and 98.88 ± 0.58% in the deep area (mean ± s.e.m.), p=0.88, one-way ANOVA; reaction time, 224.08 ± 40.66 ms in the superficial area, 235.46 ± 31.44 ms in the middle area, and 272.89 ± 49.28 ms in the deep area (mean ± s.e.m.), p=0.77, one-way ANOVA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Histology</title><p>The mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine (74 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 40 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 40 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Wako, Osaka, Japan) 16–24 hr after the last in vivo imaging session. In the experiment to assess deep-imaging-induced damage to brain tissue, mice were perfused approximately 1 month (for imaging with 920 nm laser) or 5–10 days (under other conditions) after cranial window implantation. The brains were removed and postfixed with the same fixative at 4°C for longer than 12 hr. For immunostaining, the brains were cut into coronal sections with a thickness of 50–100 µm. Slices were washed in PBS-X (0.5% triton-X in PBS) containing 10% normal goat serum, and then incubated with one of the primary antibodies (1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-GFAP, G9269, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_477035">AB_477035</ext-link>; 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-Iba1, 019–19741, Wako, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_839504">AB_839504</ext-link>; 1:400 dilution of mouse anti-HSP70/72, ADI-SPA-810-F, Enzo Life Sciences, NY, USA, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10616513">AB_10616513</ext-link>) overnight at 4°C. Afterwards, slices were washed in PBS-X and incubated with species-appropriate Alexa Fluoro-488 conjugated secondary antibody (1:500 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG for GFAP and Iba1 antibodies; 1:500 dilution of anti-mouse IgG for HSP70/72 antibody). After staining the cell nuclei with fluorescent Nissl stain (1:200 NeuroTrace 435/455 or NeuroTrace 640/660, N21479 or N21483, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), the slices were mounted on glass slides with Fluoromount/Plus mounting medium (Diagnostic BioSystems, CA, USA). Fluorescence images were acquired with an upright fluorescence microscope (BX53, Olympus) and a CCD camera (Retiga 2000R, Q Imaging, BC, Canada) or all-in-one fluorescence microscope (BZ-X700, Keyence, Osaka, Japan), and analyzed with Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link>).</p><p>To calculate the immunoreactivity of glial and heat-shock protein activation, regions of interest with approximately 1 × 1 mm covering the cortical surface and imaged depth were selected at the center of the imaging site and the mirror position in the contralateral hemisphere. Three to five slices per immunolabel were selected for the calculation in each animal. To compensate for signal dispersion in each slice, the mean fluorescence intensity on the treated side was normalized according to the mean intensity on the contralateral side for each immunolabel. The ratios of immunoreactivity in the AAV-injected hemisphere to that in the contralateral hemisphere in mice without imaging were similar to those reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Podgorski and Ranganathan (2016)</xref> but were greater than one. This may be because the cranial window implantation took place only 5–10 days before the tissue fixation and because of remaining damage from AAV injection on the ipsilateral side.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data are presented as mean ± s.d., and the Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, one-way ANOVA and <italic>post-hoc</italic> multiple comparison with Tukey-Kramer method, Spearman’s correlation tests, Pearson’s correlation tests, and permutation tests described above were used for statistical comparisons.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Two-photon calcium imaging of medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus without cortical invasion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Chris Schaeffer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The Reviewers and Reviewing Editor find considerable merit in your work, considered for publication as a &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; article. The Reviewing Editor in particular notes the importance of imaging deep into prefrontal cortex, which cannot be accessed by a bore hole that is placed through the overlying brain areas, such as used to access the CA1 region of hippocampus through the overlying cortex. However, given the reviewer comments, your manuscript is not suitable for publication at this point, but will require additional data and analysis. These are the key points:</p><p>We appreciate the emphasis on the need for a low NA focus of the incident light as a means to have only relatively short path lengths through the tissue and the need for high NA in terms of efficient collection. Towards this point:</p><p>1) We need to see a comparison between the depth capability of the system with the under-filled objective (for low NA excitation) versus the properly filled system (for higher resolution but presumably lower penetration depth). Thus, you should compare, in the same brain, the imaging performance at depths with the objective either under-filled or properly filled. This should be done at identical post-objective powers as well as at proportionally higher powers for the higher NA with proper filling, i.e., by a factor up to (7.2/15.1)^2 ~ 4 if possible; see thermal issue below.</p><p>2) Please present a brief discussion on the trade-offs between the imaging depth with resolution when under-filling the objective. You should refer to and discuss the work of Tung et al., (2005) as prior state of the art in the use of low NA illumination for increased depth of imaging.</p><p>There is concern over the possibility of sample tissue damage as a result of the relatively high level of laser excitation. As noted by reviewer 2, the laser power utilized in this report is higher than generally described for 2-photon (Dana et al., 2016) and even 3–photon microscopy (Ouzounov et al., 2017). Thus, a more careful analysis of potential cellular damage is required. Towards this point:</p><p>1) Show higher magnification images of the imaged region, the overlying brain surface, and nearby non-illuminated regions as a control.</p><p>2) Use a marker for cell damage. May we suggest as two possibilities staining with anti-MAP2 to look for disrupted processes in neurons or with anti-GFAP to look for activated astrocytes.</p><p>3) Include a positive control, e.g. staining after prolonged irradiation at high power, to establish sensitivity to laser-induced tissue injury. This control experiment may be part of a set of experiments that involve filling the full aperture as well (see above).</p><p>Lastly, while we recognize that this manuscript is submitted as a &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; article, the claims that neurons in prelimbic areas, but not in hippocampus, reliably code for reward prediction should be tempered by including other possible explanations, as noted by reviewer 1.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript reported a method that allows two-photon calcium imaging of medial prefrontal cortex (mFrc) and hippocampus without cortical invasion. The authors showed that, by using red calcium indicators, a 1100 nm laser, and an underfilled objective back aperture, neural activity could be detected at depths of 1.0–1.2mm within mFrC of adult (2-3 months) mice. The same approach was also successful in detecting calcium transients from hippocampus of young (12-40 days) mice.</p><p>Given that both the use of red indicators and longer excitation wavelengths reduces tissue scattering, imaging depth should be increased as a result. Here, the fact that the objective pupil was underfilled was emphasized as the main factor for the larger imaging depth. To support this statement, comparisons should be made with when the microscope objective is not underfilled. In other words, the authors should compare, in the same brain, the imaging performance at depth with the objective either underfilled or properly filled, at similar post-objective power. (It would also be interesting to see a properly filled objective with higher post-objective power will perform – after all, the current data indicates that there was limited heating-induced responses at 170-180 mW, so there is some room for further power increase.)</p><p>The temporal structure of neural activity in mice mFrc and hippocampus was used to support the statement that PL neurons but not hippocampal neurons reliably code for reward prediction. However, data and data analysis presented here do not preclude other possibilities (such as activity related to motion planning or changes in attentional states). More experiments and controls should be provided. For example, record the activity of the same neurons prior to the conditioning experiments, to confirm that the temporal structure is not intrinsic to mFrc neural activity independent of the reward experiments.</p><p>Panels similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A–D</xref> should be provided for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, to confirm that the conditioning experiments were indeed successful in young mice.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The use of an under-filled objective lens has been previously discussed in Tung et al., 2004. This prior work is relevant and should be referenced. There are also trade-offs between the imaging depth with the lateral (x,y) and z (sectioning) resolution that should be mentioned when under-filling the objective lens.</p><p>The authors of this manuscript are using a laser intensity of 170-180 mW under the objective. This is a very high level of optical power and could lead to changes in neural activity. To justify this level of power the authors reference a previous study that used 300 mW intensity in a 1-mm2 scan area. That reference found a peak temperature increase of 1.8C/100 mW and that continuous illumination with powers above 250 mW induced lasting damage. Prior work by Podgorski &amp; Ranganathanm, (2016) found changes in neuronal firing rates with illumination-induced heating of 1.0°C.</p><p>The scan area used in this manuscript was 512x512 pixels (0.904 µm/pixel), or 463x463 µm2. This is only 21% of the 1-mm2 scan area used in the previous study by Podgorski &amp; Ranganathanm, (2016), so heating effects would be expected to be larger. It is likely that they may have exceeded an illumination-induced heating of 1.0°C, which could impact the neural firing rates and the studied neural activity related to reward prediction. The authors should measure the brain heating in their sample under their imaging conditions to make sure it does not impact their conclusions about the neural activities.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is a well-written manuscript describing successful 2-photon imaging of in-vivo neural activity using long excitation wavelengths and red genetically encoded calcium indicators in behaviorally relevant rodent models. Specifically, hippocampal and medial prefrontal cortical activity patterns are evaluated in conditioned mice and found, in prefrontal cortex, to be temporally correlated with a reward stimulus. The methods and results are clearly reported and the figures present the data well. While the technical aspects of this study clearly demonstrate improvements in both in-vivo imaging depth and the use of red GECIs for recording neural activity patterns, the physiologic findings are not surprising given the existing body of knowledge on activity in prefrontal cortex in reward anticipation (Otis et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2016; Pinto and Dan, 2015), and therefore may offer limited biological insight.</p><p>The primary concern with this study is insufficient evaluation of sample tissue damage potentially incurred as a result of high power laser excitation. The laser power utilized in this report is higher than generally described for 2–photon microscopy (Dana et al., 2016) and even for 3-photon based imaging into hippocampus of the intact mouse brain (Ouzounov et al., 2017), and a more careful analysis of potential cellular damage would be helpful. At a minimum, the authors should show higher magnification images of the imaged region and the overlying brain surface (the two regions most likely to show damage). Of particular interest would be images that enabled analysis of microglia morphology, a sensitive indicator of tissue injury. It is also essential that the authors include a positive control (e.g. prolonged irradiation with &gt;200 mW?) that establishes that the methods used are sensitive enough to detect laser-induced tissue injury when it is present.</p><p>The authors should also provide a brief review of the existing literature regarding prefrontal cortex and hippocampal roles in reward prediction. If the findings of this study corroborate previous investigations of the brain response to reward stimulus, those studies should be mentioned. Furthermore, interpreting the current results in light of what has been previously reported will help highlight the strengths and technological advancements brought forth by this report.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26839.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We appreciate the emphasis on the need for a low NA focus of the incident light as a means to have only relatively short path lengths through the tissue and the need for high NA in terms of efficient collection.

To compare the fluorescence intensity under identical experimental conditions, we imaged tdTomato fluorescence because it is not dependent on the brain state, but is consistently bright. We performed the imaging with identical post-objective power at the same depths in the overfilled and underfilled configurations. We found that the mean bright fluorescence signal at each depth was always higher with the underfilled objective than with the overfilled objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). This might be because, in the underfilled configuration, the fluorescence signal is integrated over a larger focal volume than in the overfilled configuration and includes more fluorescent neuronal structures extending along the Z axis. The number of detected circles, which was assumed to mainly reflect the number of fluorescent neuronal somata at each depth, was greater at depths of more than 600 µm in the underfilled configuration than in the overfilled configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>).

We have added a discussion about the trade-offs in the Discussion section. In particular, we discussed the disadvantages of our method as follows:</p><p>“The major disadvantage of reducing the effective NA is a decrease in spatial resolution. In this study, the axial resolution was approximately 7 µm, which is sufficient to resolve single neurons and is unlikely to cause cross talk between neurons closely located along the Z axis (Lecoq et al., 2014). However, if dendritic branches and spines and axonal branches and boutons are the imaging target, the spatial resolution may not be sufficient.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is concern over the possibility of sample tissue damage as a result of the relatively high level of laser excitation.

We also used anti-HSP70/72 as a marker for heat-activated metabolism in glial cells and neurons. We quantitatively estimated the immunostaining intensity in the mFrC under five conditions: without imaging (as a negative control), after 15-min imaging at 800–900 µm depths, after 30-min imaging at 900–1100 µm depths, and after 30-min imaging at 300–400 µm depths (as a positive control). Under the latter three conditions, a 180 mW, 1100-nm laser was used. The fifth condition was a strong positive control: 30-min slow imaging at 200–300 µm depths with a 200 mW, 920-nm laser overfilling the objective.</p><p>Immunoreactivity 16–24 h after imaging the deep area was not statistically different from that in negative control mice. By contrast, imaging at 300–400 µm depths under the same laser conditions as the deep imaging caused significantly stronger immunoreactivity of GFAP and Iba1 than either the negative control or deep imaging. The strong positive control experiment caused significantly greater immunoreactivity of all antibodies than either the negative control or deep imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

In this study, the axial resolution was approximately 7 µm, which is sufficient to resolve single neurons and is unlikely to cause cross-talk between neurons closely located along the Z axis (Lecoq et al., 2014). However, if dendritic branches and spines, and axonal branches and boutons, are the imaging target, then the spatial resolution may not be sufficient.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors of this manuscript are using a laser intensity of 170-180 mW under the objective. This is a very high level of optical power and could lead to changes in neural activity. To justify this level of power the authors reference a previous study that used 300 mW intensity in a 1-mm2 scan area. That reference found a peak temperature increase of 1.8C/100 mW and that continuous illumination with powers above 250 mW induced lasting damage. Prior work by Podgorski &amp; Ranganathanm, (2016) found changes in neuronal firing rates with illumination-induced heating of 1.0°C.</p><p>The scan area used in this manuscript was 512x512 pixels (0.904 µm/pixel), or 463x463 µm2. This is only 21% of the 1-mm2 scan area used in the previous study by Podgorski &amp; Ranganathanm, (2016), so heating effects would be expected to be larger. It is likely that they may have exceeded an illumination-induced heating of 1.0°C, which could impact the neural firing rates and the studied neural activity related to reward prediction. The authors should measure the brain heating in their sample under their imaging conditions to make sure it does not impact their conclusions about the neural activities.</p></disp-quote><p>As instructed by the editor, we examined the possible effects on cellular functions using immunoreactivity. We used anti-GFAP (a marker for activated astrocytes) and anti-Iba1 (a marker for activated microglia) to estimate damage after imaging. We also used anti-HSP70/72 as a marker for heat-activated metabolism in glial cells and neurons. We quantitatively estimated the immunostaining intensity in the mFrC in five conditions: without imaging (as a negative control), after 15-min imaging at 800–900 µm depths, after 30-min imaging at 900–1100 µm depths, and 30-min imaging at 300–400 µm depths (as a positive control). In the latter three conditions, a 180 mW, 1100-nm laser was used. The fifth condition was a strong positive control: 30-min slow imaging at 200–300 µm depths with a 200 mW, 920-nm laser overfilling the objective.</p><p>Immunoreactivity 16–24 h after imaging the deep area was not statistically different from that in the negative control mice. By contrast, imaging at 300–400 µm depths under the same laser conditions as deep imaging caused significantly stronger immunoreactivity of GFAP and Iba1 than either the negative control or deep imaging. The strong positive control experiment caused significantly more severe immunoreactivity for all antibodies than either the negative control or deep imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). These results indicate that our assays were sensitive enough to detect laser-induced tissue injury and that two-photon imaging of the deep area with 180 mW laser power did not cause any apparent injury.</p><p>In addition, spontaneous activity of neurons in the deep area detected by two-photon calcium imaging was not different between the 5-min period at the start of imaging and a 5-min period after 20 minutes of continuous imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results strongly suggest that two-photon imaging of the deep area with ~180 mW laser power did not cause any apparent damage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is a well-written manuscript describing successful 2-photon imaging of in-vivo neural activity using long excitation wavelengths and red genetically encoded calcium indicators in behaviorally relevant rodent models. Specifically, hippocampal and medial prefrontal cortical activity patterns are evaluated in conditioned mice and found, in prefrontal cortex, to be temporally correlated with a reward stimulus. The methods and results are clearly reported and the figures present the data well. While the technical aspects of this study clearly demonstrate improvements in both in-vivo imaging depth and the use of red GECIs for recording neural activity patterns, the physiologic findings are not surprising given the existing body of knowledge on activity in prefrontal cortex in reward anticipation (Otis et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2016; Pinto and Dan, 2015), and therefore may offer limited biological insight.</p><p>The primary concern with this study is insufficient evaluation of sample tissue damage potentially incurred as a result of high power laser excitation. The laser power utilized in this report is higher than generally described for 2–photon microscopy (Dana et al., 2016) and even for 3-photon based imaging into hippocampus of the intact mouse brain (Ouzounov et al., 2017), and a more careful analysis of potential cellular damage would be helpful. At a minimum, the authors should show higher magnification images of the imaged region and the overlying brain surface (the two regions most likely to show damage). Of particular interest would be images that enabled analysis of microglia morphology, a sensitive indicator of tissue injury. It is also essential that the authors include a positive control (e.g. prolonged irradiation with &gt;200 mW?) that establishes that the methods used are sensitive enough to detect laser-induced tissue injury when it is present.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added higher magnification immunostaining images (anti-GFAP, anti-Iba1, and anti-HSP70/72) of the imaged region and the overlying brain surface from red GECI-expressing mice with and without imaging, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.

If the findings of this study corroborate previous investigations of the brain response to reward stimulus, those studies should be mentioned. Furthermore, interpreting the current results in light of what has been previously reported will help highlight the strengths and technological advancements brought forth by this report.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a discussion about what the mFrC activity before reward delivery might represent to the Discussion section. To image the activity in the CA1 hippocampus, we had to use young mice with less myelinated white matter than adult mice. Combined with the surgery schedule, this limited the conditioning period before imaging of the CA1 hippocampus to 3 days, which was shorter than that before imaging of the mFrC (4–5 days). On reanalyzing the behavioral data, we found that the young mice used for the CA1 imaging were conditioned more slowly than the adult mice used for the mFrC imaging (please compare the middle and right panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>). Thus, we have presented the results concerning behavioral conditioning in the mFrC and CA1 hippocampus experiments separately, and have removed the comparison of conditioning-related neural activity. Instead, we have discussed the importance of two-photon calcium imaging of the mFrC and hippocampus, and a technical strategy, as follows (Discussion section):</p><p>“The hippocampus connects the mFrC through the thalamus and the entorhinal cortex (Jingji and Stephen, 2015; Varela et al., 2014) and is thought to associate spatial, temporal, and reward information, which are required for goal-directed decision-making (Wiknheiser and Schenbaum, 2016). Here, the pre-reward activity in hippocampal CA1 neurons was not stable, likely because the conditioning period in the young mice was not sufficient to form such activity. If the adult hippocampus can be imaged through a wide-field cranial window and objective, the neural activity in both areas could be imaged simultaneously. Deep and wide-field two-photon calcium imaging of the intact brain will substantially aid our understanding of the brain circuits that integrate multimodal information in decision-making.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
