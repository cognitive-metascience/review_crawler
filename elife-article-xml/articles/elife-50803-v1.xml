pathogens known to employ numerous immunoevasive strategies that significantly impair the ability of the immune system to eliminate the infected cells. Here, we report that the single mouse CMV (MCMV) protein, m154, downregulates multiple surface molecules involved in the activation and costimulation of the immune cells. We demonstrate that m154 uses its cytoplasmic tail motif, DD, to interfere with the adaptor protein-1 (AP-1) complex, implicated in intracellular protein sorting and packaging. As a consequence of the perturbed AP-1 sorting, m154 promotes lysosomal degradation of several proteins involved in T cell costimulation, thus impairing virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response and virus control in vivo. Additionally, we show that HCMV infection similarly interferes with the AP-1 complex. Altogether, we identify the robust mechanism employed by single viral immunomodulatory protein targeting a broad spectrum of cell surface molecules involved in the antiviral immune response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>immune evasion</kwd><kwd>cytomegalovirus, CMV</kwd><kwd>PVR, CD155</kwd><kwd>m154 protein</kwd><kwd>adaptor protein-1, AP-1</kwd><kwd>CD8+ T cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2017-87688</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Angulo</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004488</institution-id><institution>Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UIP-11-2013-1533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lenac Rovis</surname><given-names>Tihana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008530</institution-id><institution>European Regional Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KK.01.1.1.01.0006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonjic</surname><given-names>Stipan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single mouse cytomegalovirus protein, m154, downmodulates surface expression of numerous targets important for NK and CD8 T cell activation by perturbing adaptor protein-1 sorting and redirecting targets to lysosomal degradation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV; Human herpesvirus 5), highly prevalent in the world population, is usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals and results in lifelong latency in the host organism. However, it is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunodeficient patients, and congenital HCMV infection is a leading infectious cause of long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boppana et al., 2013</xref>). Currently, there is no approved vaccine for CMV, and the existing antiviral drugs show only a modest effect in the treatment of symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Britt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kimberlin et al., 2015</xref>). To develop new strategies in antiviral therapy and the rational vaccine design, a better understanding of the interplay between the CMVs and the immune system is essential.</p><p>The hallmark of CMVs is a large number of viral proteins that interfere with the immune system components in order to suppress host antiviral response. HCMV and mouse CMV (MCMV), the most frequently used model to study the pathogenesis of HCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brizić et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reddehase and Lemmermann, 2018</xref>), possess common mechanisms of immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brinkmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lemmermann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rölle and Olweus, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brizić et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daley-Bauer et al., 2014</xref>). Both CMVs are able to downregulate molecules that have a dual role as NK cell activating and as T cell costimulatory signals (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brizić et al., 2014</xref>). Examples include immunoevasion of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) and NKG2D (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hudspeth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmiedel and Mandelboim, 2017</xref>). For instance, it was demonstrated how HCMV proteins UL18 and UL20 downregulate B7-H6, a ligand for the activating NCR, NKp30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Charpak-Amikam et al., 2017</xref>). MCMV-encoded m138 affects ligands for NKG2D, as well as B7-1, another potent T cell costimulatory and NK cell activating molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mintern et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lenac et al., 2006</xref>). Recently, we have also shown how MCMV-encoded m20.1 regulates CD155 (PVR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lenac Rovis et al., 2016</xref>) that serves as a ligand for immune receptors DNAM-1, TIGIT and CD96, expressed both on the cells of innate and adaptive immunity. There is no firm consensus how the viral regulation of NK cells affects the activity of T cell population, and a better understanding of viral products that interfere with both the innate and the adaptive arm of immune response is needed.</p><p>Clathrin-associated AP-1 complex is a member of the family of heterotetrameric protein complexes that mediate intracellular membrane trafficking in endocytic and secretory transport pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boehm and Bonifacino, 2001</xref>). In particular, the AP-1 complex is responsible for the polarized sorting and packaging of membrane proteins into clathrin-coated vesicles at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and/or endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghosh and Kornfeld, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakatsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meyer et al., 2000</xref>). The dysfunction of AP-1 complex has gained interest as a viral immunoevasive strategy of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1), identifying involved HIV proteins and describing their mechanism of action. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janvier et al., 2003</xref>). Whether and how cytomegaloviruses evade innate and adaptive immune defenses by hijacking the AP clathrin adaptors is less known.</p><p>The m154 protein, belonging to the <italic>m145</italic> gene family of MCMV immunoevasins, is known to regulate cell-surface expression of CD48, a high-affinity ligand for the activating receptor 2B4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zarama et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that m154 downmodulates the surface expression of numerous targets important for NK cell activation and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell costimulation by perturbing the AP-1 sorting and redirecting them to lysosomal degradation. The list includes CD155 (poliovirus receptor, PVR), a protein that has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic target due to its considerable immunoregulatory potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kučan Brlić et al., 2019</xref>) and we show that both HCMV and MCMV induce the accumulation of CD155 in the AP-1 compartment. We identified the motif responsible for the m154 function whose absence results in an attenuated phenotype in vivo. Overall, our results define m154 as a broad-spectrum immunomodulatory protein that interferes with the early NK response along with the virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MCMV m154 gene product downregulates surface levels of CD155</title><p>We have previously shown that MCMV protein m20.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lenac Rovis et al., 2016</xref>), just like its counterpart, the HCMV protein UL141 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tomasec et al., 2005</xref>), retains CD155 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in an immature form, leading to its proteasomal degradation. However, we have also observed that CD155 accumulates outside the ER compartment in MCMV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, upper panel), irrespective of the ER-resident m20.1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lower panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Based on the ability of the mutant virus to restore CD155 surface expression, we identified <italic>m154</italic> gene of MCMV as the one responsible for the downregulation of CD155 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also tested if this downregulation has a functional impact in terms of binding of CD155 to its immune receptors. Infection of cells with WT MCMV led to a decrease in TIGIT-Fc and DNAM-1-Fc binding while the viral mutant lacking <italic>m154</italic> gene (Δm154) restored the binding of CD155 interaction partners on the surface of infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The restoration of binding was more pronounced for TIGIT-Fc, since the binding of TIGIT to CD155 is of higher affinity and faster kinetics as compared to DNAM-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stanietsky et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>m154 protein and CD155 accumulate in the AP-1 compartment in CMV-infected cells</title><p>To determine whether m154 is involved in CD155 intracellular accumulation, we first analyzed its kinetics of expression and localization. In line with the published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zarama et al., 2014</xref>), we observed early kinetics of expression of the m154 protein on the plasma membrane of infected cells. However, we also observed that a significant amount of m154 is localized intracellularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The intracellular expression of m154 overlapped with CD155 intracellular accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

We examined if the progression of newly synthesized CD155 to the plasma membrane was arrested by m154 on the level of AP-1 compartment. In the cells infected with the virus lacking m154, CD155 was still accumulating in the AP-1 compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that m154 does not directly participate in CD155 retention in this compartment. Next, we investigated the possibility that the accumulated CD155 molecules in AP-1 compartment of MCMV-infected cells were mature, endocytosed CD155 molecules originating from the plasma membrane. To assess this, we stained the plasma membrane CD155 on uninfected and MCMV-infected cells and followed its internalization after 20 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, schematic model).

Using the same surface staining model, but with a permeabilisation step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, schematic model), we followed the intracellular trafficking of membrane CD155 by confocal microscopy and found that a significant portion of plasma membrane-stained CD155 (PM-CD155) 20 hr post-infection (p.i.) resided in the AP-1 compartment in MCMV-infected cells, confirming the membrane origin of the intracellularly accumulated CD155 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, upper panel).

To that aim, we stained the PM-CD155, treated cells with lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin and followed the trafficking of internalized CD155 after 20 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, schematic model). PM-CD155 staining was quite stable on the surface of uninfected cells, regardless of the leupeptin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The MCMV-infected cells showed an increased amount of internalized PM-CD155 after the leupeptin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The rescued portion of PM-CD155 also colocalized with late endosomes and lysosomes, as shown by staining with the acidic organelle probe DAMP. We questioned whether the redirection of PM-CD155 into lysosomes instead of recycling back to the plasma membrane is a direct consequence of m154 action. ∆m154 virus possesses viral Fc receptor that would unspecifically bind anti-CD155 antibody in our 20 hr surface staining model. Thus, we labeled plasma membrane proteins with biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, schematic model) and followed the degradation of the surface portion of CD155 both in WT and Δm154 infection by western blot. The biotinylation assay confirmed the loss of CD155 molecules from the plasma membrane of MCMV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and the partial rescue of PM-CD155 under leupeptin treatment. More importantly, the degradation of surface CD155 molecules was much less pronounced in the case of Δm154 infection, and there was no further increase of PM-CD155 with leupeptin treatment. We also demonstrated the involvement of lysosomal enzymes in the degradation of m154 protein in MCMV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In addition, PM-m154 accumulated in m154-N-HA transfectants when lysosomal degradation was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

The m154 interfered with the sorting of plasma membrane targets at the level of AP-1 complex and redirected them into the lysosomal compartment. We also showed that productive HCMV infection induces accumulation of human CD155 in the AP-1 compartment, comparable to MCMV-induced accumulation of mouse CD155. We have further identified a DD motif in the cytoplasmic tail of m154, responsible for its AP-1 colocalization and function. The deletion of m154 protein or its DD motif led to the viral attenuation in vivo. With its ability to regulate costimulatory molecules in the AP-1 compartment, m154 reduced the virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>When it comes to the interference with the AP-1 sorting machinery as a viral strategy to evade immune defense, several viruses have been reported to encode proteins able to interfere with the AP-1 complex, with the Nef protein of HIV-1 being the best-studied example. In particular, Nef stabilizes the association of AP-1 with membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janvier et al., 2003</xref>) by a mechanism that includes Nef-induced AP-1 trimerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). The AP-1 trimerisation is cargo-sensitive, directing Nef targets to be either retained intracellularly or sorted to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morris et al., 2018</xref>). The role of AP sorting machinery in CMV infection was insufficiently investigated so far. In MCMV infection, it was shown that AP-1 and the AP-3 complexes participate in the trafficking of m06/MHC I at the TGN and endosomes respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reusch et al., 2002</xref>) and that the plasma membrane AP-2 complex mediates endocytosis of the m04/MHC I complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fink et al., 2015</xref>). Regarding HCMV, the trafficking of UL20 to lysosomes involves the AP-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jelcic et al., 2011</xref>), but no specific cellular targets affected by this action of UL20 were identified so far. Since we showed here the accumulation of CD155 molecules together with AP-1 complexes in the context of productive HCMV infection, it would be interesting to see if UL20 interferes with CD155 expression by this mechanism. Whether CMVs affect AP-1 membrane binding and protein sorting in the same way as HIV-1 (22, 31, 32), involving the direct interaction between the viral protein and the AP-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shen et al., 2015</xref>), remains to be seen. We have successfully immunoprecipitated m154, but our current attempts to co-immunoprecipitate m154 with AP-1 or some of its cellular targets have failed. One of the possible reasons is the lack of suitable antibodies since currently, only one m154 antibody exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zarama et al., 2014</xref>) and it binds exactly the epitope in the cytoplasmic tail of m154, for which we have established to be crucial for the function of m154. Recent findings showed that several alpha herpesviruses also encode proteins able to bind to AP-1, indicating the conserved nature of the described mechanism in herpesviruses family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebrun et al., 2018</xref>). However, no herpesvirus protein has yet been demonstrated to affect multiple targets by interfering with AP-1 mediated protein sorting.</p><p>It was recently shown that particular genetic clusters of HCMV regulate a high number of host proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nightingale et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weekes et al., 2014</xref>), but it is not known whether this regulation involves individual or concert action of HCMV genes, nor if this regulation is AP-1-mediated. For MCMV, no single viral protein or genetic cluster with such broad regulatory function has been previously identified. High-throughput approaches, such as mass spectrometry with plasma membrane profiling, could be used to broaden further the extensive list of surface molecules affected by m154. In addition, the absence of a complete rescue of the cell surface levels of the different molecules after infection by ∆m154 or m154-DDAA suggests that MCMV might encode for additional viral products that interfere with their expression. For some of the identified m154 targets, such as CD262 (Trail-R2), CD229 (Ly9) or CD162 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1; PSGL-1), it was reported that they are internalized entirely or partially by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Austin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Del Valle et al., 2003</xref>), but for others, such as GPI-linked glycoproteins, their probability to be affected by the DD motif in the cytoplasmic tail of m154 is less obvious. We have shown the MCMV-induced accumulation of CD18 (β2-integrin) in AP-1-coated membranes, and this integrin was reported to interact with CD54 and CD47, which are also the targets of m154. Therefore, m154 might exert its broad regulating function by affecting molecules with multiple interacting partners such as CD18 integrin. By binding to integrin complexes, CD54 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1; ICAM-1) participates in the initial interactions between T cells and accessory or target cells that precede the formation of immunological synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kvale and Brandtzaeg, 1993</xref>). CD47, an integrin-associated protein, and CD270, a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand, were shown to costimulate T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reinhold et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Granger and Rickert, 2003</xref>), and CD229 and CD84 are members of the SLAM family that participate in adhesion reactions between T cells and antigen presenting cells by homophilic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Romero et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2001</xref>). Notably, while CD84 was not reported in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zarama et al., 2014</xref>) to be substantially altered by m154, a further reassessment identified this SLAM family member as an additional target of the viral protein. Thus, many of the molecules whose putative expression on antigen presenting cells is diminished by m154 are important factors in the activation of antiviral T lymphocyte responses.</p><p>It was shown previously that MCMV lacking <italic>m154</italic> is attenuated early after infection in NK-cell dependent manner, and this early attenuation was attributed to the subversion of CD48 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zarama et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, here we showed that in addition to avoiding NK cell control, m154 subverts CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell control of infection. We observed an improved CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell control of m154-DDAA viral mutant, associated with increased frequency and IFN-γ production of virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. By using an in vitro assay, we have shown that m154 impairs the capacity of antigen presenting cells to induce CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, suggesting the role of adhesion and costimulatory molecules in the improved CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell control of m154-DDAA mutant. Overall, we show that the virus lacking m154 is significantly attenuated in both early and late time points of infection and induces strong antiviral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response.</p><p>After the resolution of acute CMV infection, an immunodominant epitope-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population gradually increases over a long period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holtappels et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klenerman and Oxenius, 2016</xref>). This characteristic memory inflation makes recombinant CMVs attractive vaccine vectors that induce potent CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory. Furthermore, many of the CMV immunoevasive genes are non-essential for viral growth opening the possibility for their manipulation and modulation of the antiviral immune response. Our previous studies have highlighted that outstanding vaccine efficacy could be achieved by manipulating non-essential immunoevasive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trsan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hiršl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tomić et al., 2016</xref>). Based on our results, targeting m154 and its functional counterpart in HCMV could be a promising strategy in further designing of CMV vaccine vectors.</p><p>While we have identified the role of NK cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes in the control of MCMV m154 mutant, other immune mechanisms could play a role as well. Namely, the m154 mutant virus remained slightly attenuated even following combined depletion of NK, CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, indicating that other immune control mechanisms may be involved. We have focused our analysis on standard time point (day 7 p.i.) and intravenous route of infection, although we are aware of the fact that other routes of infection could affect the immune response to m154 mutant as well. Importantly, we have identified numerous targets of m154-dependent immunoregulation, some of which could affect the response of other immune cells, such as inflammatory monocytes that could be triggered by CD155 (PVR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lenac Rovis et al., 2016</xref>). However, one cannot exclude additional targets of m154 which could affect immune response.</p><p>Altogether, our results define m154 as a broad-spectrum MCMV immunomodulatory protein that prevents the proper sorting function of the AP-1 complex in the trans-Golgi network of the host, leading to the lysosomal degradation and decreased surface expression of several m154 targets implicated in the antiviral response. In addition to NK cell regulation, we uncover that the m154 protein impairs CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response as well. These studies add to the complex mechanism of CMV evasion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and indicate an important role of m154 protein. For the efficient vector vaccine development, a better understanding of viral genes like m154 that interfere with both the innate and the adaptive arm of the immune response is of paramount importance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells</title><p>B12 (SV40-immortalized BALB/c fibroblasts), MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblasts from BALB/c mice) and HFF (human foreskin fibroblasts) were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% or 3% of fetal calf serum (FCS) and 100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine.

The membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and visualized as described above. At least two independent experiments were performed for each subject of analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>B12 and DC2.4 cells were infected with 1–3 PFU/cell of WT MCMV or indicated viral mutants. HFF cells were infected with 1 PFU/cell of HCMV strain TB40/E for 72 hr. In siRNA silencing assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) pre-designed by Thermofisher: Stealth siRNAs MSS202065 (here referred siRNA65) and MSS273190 (here referred siRNA90) were used to silence adaptor-related protein complex AP-1, mu subunit one gene, alone or in combination. The procedure followed Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent protocol with the OPTI MEM transfection medium, LIPOFECTAMINE RNAIMAX transfection reagent, BLOCKIT ALEXA FLUOR RED OLIGO positive control of transfection and STEALTH RNAI NEG CTL HI GC negative control siRNA. In the antibody internalization assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), the m154 N-terminal HA transfectant was used, or in the case of infection, the virus lacking <italic>m138</italic> gene (Δm138) that encodes for a viral homolog of Fc receptor was used to exclude the possibility of Fc-antibody binding to the viral Fc receptor during 20 hr of incubation. The equivalence of the WT MCMV and Δm138 virus in terms of specific protein regulation was confirmed in a separate set of analyses. Following infection, cells were treated with leupeptin (75 μg/μl) where indicated and 20 h p.i. fixed and analyzed for target proteins localization. The following in-house produced antibodies were used: anti-mCD155 (clone mPVR.01), anti-hCD155 (clone hPVR.16), anti-MCMV m20.1 (clone m20.1.02), anti-m154 (clone m154.4.113), anti-CD229 (clone 7.144.2). The following purchased antibodies were used: anti-mouse calnexin, anti-mouse γ1-adaptin, anti-HA, anti-mouse CD18 (clone M18/2), anti-mouse CD47 (clone miap301). The matching isotype controls were used. For lysosomal visualization, an acidic compartments probe DAMP (N-(3-[2,4-dinitrophenyl amino] propyl)-N-(3-aminopropyl)methylamine) was used. The samples were stained with secondary antibodies coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC) fluorophores, mounted using Mowiol mounting medium and analyzed at room temperature with Olympus FV300 confocal laser scanning microscope using Olympus-Microscope-PlanApo-60X-NA1.4-oil objective and FluoView acquisition software without gamma adjustments. At least two independent experiments were performed for each subject of analysis and at least two technical replicates/experiment were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Flow cytometry and cytokine staining</title><p>Flow cytometry was performed according to the Guidelines for the use of flow cytometry and cell sorting in immunological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cossarizza et al., 2017</xref>). Uninfected or cells infected with indicated MCMV strains were stained for cell surface markers: CD155 (clone mPVR.01), CD229 (clone 7.144.2), CD18 (clone M18/2), CD48 (clone HM48-1), CD47 (clone miap301), CD54 (clone 1H4), CD84 (clone mCD84.7), CD162 (clone 2PH1), CD270 (clone HMHV-1B18), CD80 (clone MEM-233), CD262 (clone MD5-1), CD112 (clone 502–57), MULT-1 (clone 1D6), or anti-RAE-1ɛ mAb (Clone 205001). The matching isotype controls were used. In siRNA silencing assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) we monitored CD155 protein expression on B12 cells following the protocol described in the Immunofluorescence microscopy section. For the viral strains expressing GFP, infected cells were gated as GFP<sup>+</sup>. Otherwise, where needed, infected cells were gated based on the expression of MCMV protein m06 or m04, revealed by staining with anti-m06 (clone croma229) or anti-m04 (clone m04.17). The following secondary antibodies were used: anti-rat IgG F(ab’)2-PE or FITC, anti-mouse IgG F(ab’)2-PE, FITC, APC or PE-streptavidin. Fixable Viability Dye coupled to Alexa Fluor 780 was used to exclude dead cells. When needed, the blocking with 20% fetal rabbit serum and 1% fetal bovine serum was performed before immunostaining. For IFNγ staining, splenic leukocytes were prepared using standard protocols and incubated in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% of FCS and 1 µg/well of pp89-derived peptide for 5 hr at 37°C. Brefeldin A at 1 µg/ml was added immediately to the cells. Before staining, Fc receptors were blocked with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (clone 2.4G2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yokoyama and Kim, 2008</xref>). Subsequently, cells were surface stained, fixed and permeabilized, followed by intracellular staining with anti-IFNγ. The following reagent was obtained through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Tetramer Core Facility: MCMV-specific tetramer pp89-PE. MCMV pp89-derived peptide was obtained from JPT Peptide Technologies. Flow cytometry data were acquired on FACSAriaIlu, FACScan (BD Biosciences) or LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences), and analyzed using FlowJo_v10 (Tree Star) software. At least three independent experiments were performed for each subject of analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Mouse infections and viral titers</title><p>For each experiment, mice were pooled and randomized in experimental groups of five animals. Female mice aged 8–12 weeks were i.v. injected with tissue culture-grown recombinant MCMV strains with 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> PFU/animal, in a volume of 500 μl of pure DMEM. Depletion of NK cells was performed by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 20 μl of anti-asialo GM1, depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by i.p. injection of 150 μg of anti-CD8 antibody (YTS 169.4) and depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by i.p. injection of 150 μg of anti-CD4 antibody (YTS 191.1). Animals were sacrificed at indicated time points, organs were harvested and viral titers were determined by a standard plaque-forming assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brizić et al., 2018</xref>) in two technical replicates.

For in vivo experiments, mice were pooled and randomized in experimental groups of five animals. The sample size was determined by pilot studies and according to accepted practice in previous literature utilizing the MCMV model. The selection of the appropriate statistical test was based on the number and distribution of data points per group. Confidence interval was set to 95% and a level of p&lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant and assigned as *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.001, ns p&gt;0.005. Exact p values and statistical details of experiments are indicated in the figure legends. Statistical differences between the two study groups were evaluated using paired or unpaired, two-tailed t-test or the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Statistical differences between more than two study groups were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis bidirectional test.

and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The manuscript shows a role for the mouse CMV (MCMV) protein m154 in immune evasion via modulation of AP-1-dependent intracellular trafficking of several co-stimulatory molecules. The authors have shown previously that m154 mediates degradation of CD48, a high-affinity ligand for the natural killer and cytotoxic T cell receptor CD244, and have shown that an MCMV mutant lacking m154 is attenuated in vivo, and that this can be partially rescued when NK cells are depleted. They now show that m154 reduces cell surface expression of several other proteins, particularly CD155, mediating lysosomal degradation by interference with AP-1-dependent trafficking, and identify the motif in m154 responsible for this function. They also show some evidence that human CMV (HCMV) also leads to accumulation of CD155 in an AP-1-positive compartment. Overall, this study focuses on the MCMV m154 protein which disturbs trafficking of cellular proteins, and thereby confers an important advantage for successful evasion of host immune defence.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cytomegalovirus protein m154 perturbs the adaptor protein-1 compartment mediating broad-spectrum immune evasion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It should be tested whether m154 binds to any of its identified substrates, e.g. by IP/blot in leupeptin-treated cells. Is the m154 on the plasma membrane described previously a separate pool to that in the AP-1 compartment? Thus, if you surface label m154, does it get internalised with similar kinetics to its degradation substrates? Is it also degraded in lysosomes?</p><p>2) Subsection “m154 redirects several immunologically relevant targets from the AP-1 compartment to lysosomes”: it would seem important to show that a wild-type m154 with a C-terminal HA tag is fully functional – not just expressed – since this is the tag they put on their DDAA mutant protein which shows a loss of function. Currently, like is not clearly compared with like.</p><p>3) The authors haven't clearly shown how the DD mutant affects AP-1 – they demonstrate that a proposed AP-1 binding mutant is no longer localised in an AP-1 positive compartment. However, this does not prove that it is a result of a lack of AP-1 binding. This is acknowledged in the Discussion, but much of the text assumes that they have identified a binding motif – which is not proven. It should be possible to show that an AP-1 KO or KD loses the effect of m154 on its targets?</p><p>4) It is hard to know what to make of the CD8 response measurements. Given cross-priming and all the other evasions in operation, the effect is surprisingly large. Is the effect CD8-specific? An effect on NK cell (or inflammatory macrophage) recognition could feed through to dendritic cells and T cells. It is necessary to show that another immune response is unaffected by m154 disruption, e.g. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The CD48 effect of m154 was attributed to NK cell evasion. There is good precedent for evading both NK and CD8; e.g. m152 was initially a CD8 evader, then later an NK evader. It is not convincing to compare the degree of m154 reversion by CD8 and NK depletions; the data are not very tight, and the depletions differ in efficacy. No depletion shows full reversion and other innate killers, such as inflammatory monocytes, may also turn out to be involved.

Is the m154 on the plasma membrane described previously a separate pool to that in the AP-1 compartment? Thus, if you surface label m154, does it get internalised with similar kinetics to its degradation substrates? Is it also degraded in lysosomes?</p></disp-quote><p>The only anti-m154 antibody currently available is directed against the intracellular portion of the m154 protein. Therefore, to allow surface monitoring of m154 internalization, we now produced stable transfectants expressing m154 as N-terminal HA tagged protein. Our data showed that m154 N-HA is localized on the plasma membrane and in the AP-1 compartment (new Figure 2D). Using these transfectants we were able to demonstrate that surface labeled m154 is internalized into the AP-1 compartment and follows similar internalization kinetics as its degradation substrates (new Figure 3C). We have also shown that internalized m154 accumulates when lysosomal degradation is blocked (new Figure 4D) and the effect of lysosomes on the degradation of the m154 protein was also demonstrated in infected cells (new Figure 4C). Although we repeatedly tried to co-immunoprecipitate m154 with its degradation targets from leupeptin-treated cells, we did not obtain results that would confidently demonstrate interaction employing this method. We think there could be two reasons for this. First, the fact that m154 and its targets accumulate in lysosomes, which cannot degrade them due to leupeptin, does not mean that under lysosomal-compartment conditions they still form a stable complex, if such a complex otherwise exists. Second, a bioinformatic analysis of the m154 protein sequence revealed that a large part of the ectodomain sequence (more than 50%) represents Low-Complexity Regions which are regions known to allow specific protein flexibility and adaptation to different interacting partners based on their positions within a sequence. Hence, harsh conditions of the immunoprecipitation method could disrupt regions necessary for m154 interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “m154 redirects several immunologically relevant targets from the AP-1 compartment to lysosomes”: it would seem important to show that a wild-type m154 with a C-terminal HA tag is fully functional – not just expressed – since this is the tag they put on their DDAA mutant protein which shows a loss of function. Currently, like is not clearly compared with like.</p></disp-quote><p>The only currently available antibody against m154 was obtained by immunization with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the intracellular tail portion of m154, which contains the amino acids DD, and therefore the antibody does not recognize the mutated m154 protein (m154-DDAA). Thus, when creating the m154-DDAA virus, we had to add the HA tag to its cytoplasmic tail. We agree with the reviewer that the control wild type m154-HA virus (WT-m154-HA) needs to be proven functional. To address this issue, we constructed a new virus in which the HA tag was added to the C terminus of the intact m154 encoding gene. In the new Figure 6—figure supplement 4 we show now that the WT-m154-HA virus expresses the HA-tagged m154 protein. More importantly, this virus downregulates the CD155 protein on B12 cells, whereas the m154-DDAA mutant virus is unable to do it. We show the same phenomenon for CD54 protein on DC2.4 cells. This information has also been included in the new Figure 6—figure supplement 4 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors haven't clearly shown how the DD mutant affects AP-1 – they demonstrate that a proposed AP-1 binding mutant is no longer localised in an AP-1 positive compartment. However, this does not prove that it is a result of a lack of AP-1 binding. This is acknowledged in the Discussion, but much of the text assumes that they have identified a binding motif – which is not proven. It should be possible to show that an AP-1 KO or KD loses the effect of m154 on its targets?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their suggestions. We performed the experiments to answer these questions and we confirmed that AP-1 KO or KD loses the effect of m154 on its targets. We used previously published siRNA molecules that suppress the expression of the µ subunit of the AP-1 protein (AP-1 KD) and a cell line that does not constitutively express the AP-1 protein (AP-1 KO). The AP-1 KO cell line was previously obtained from embryonic cells of the AP-1 KO mouse, since it represents a lethal mutation (Meyer et al., 2000). The efficacy of siRNA transfection in AP-1 KD cells was controlled by i) the manufacturer's positive fluorescence control (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and ii) the AP-1γ subunit staining, since the AP1 protein lacking the µ subunit cannot form functional complex and cannot correctly localize the AP-1 protein in the TGN region (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Upon MCMV infection, the ability of the virus to reduce the surface expression of CD155 protein was decreased in AP-1 KD cells (new Figure 6A). Also, the ability of the m154 protein to affect the regulation of the CD155 was diminished in the case of AP1-KO cells (new Figure 6—figure supplement 2). Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that this is not a direct evidence of the interaction of the DD motif in the m154 protein with the AP-1 adapter protein, and therefore in the new version of the manuscript we avoided using the term ‘The AP-binding ([DE]D) motif’. For example, we replaced this expression with: ‘identified a DD motif in the cytoplasmic tail of m154, responsible for its AP-1 localization and function’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is hard to know what to make of the CD8 response measurements. Given cross-priming and all the other evasions in operation, the effect is surprisingly large. Is the effect CD8-specific? An effect on NK cell (or inflammatory macrophage) recognition could feed through to dendritic cells and T cells. It is necessary to show that another immune response is unaffected by m154 disruption, e.g. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The CD48 effect of m154 was attributed to NK cell evasion. There is good precedent for evading both NK and CD8; e.g. m152 was initially a CD8 evader, then later an NK evader. It is not convincing to compare the degree of m154 reversion by CD8 and NK depletions; the data are not very tight, and the depletions differ in efficacy. No depletion shows full reversion and other innate killers, such as inflammatory monocytes, may also turn out to be involved. Given that the targeted receptors are shared across cell types, expecting simple conclusions is too much. One suspects also that changing the mouse strain, MCMV strain or infection route could give a different hierarchy. Probably most of this could be dealt with by toning down conclusions and acknowledging uncertainty.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comments on the in vivo results of the study. We agree that the effects of m154 regulation on the expression of numerous molecules involved in the regulation of immune response must have a complex outcome. In addition, as pointed out by the reviewers, this outcome may vary with different experimental conditions, such as route of infection, tissue analyzed or mouse strain used. We also agree that other immune cells are probably involved in the control of m154 mutant. Therefore, as suggested, we have attenuated statements on the role of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the manuscript, and emphasized that we have found an important role for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in control of this mutant virus, while leaving open the possibility of the role of other cell types. Also, we have conducted a number of new experiments that confirm and complement our main results and which we present here, following the comments of the reviewers:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is hard to know what to make of the CD8 response measurements.

These results confirm our observations presented in the manuscript. In our previous work we reported that purified NK cells show enhanced responses (enhanced degranulation) to m154 deficient MCMV as compared to WT MCMV infected cells, arguing for the direct recognition of infected cells by NK cells (Zarama et al., 2014).</p><p>Furthermore, we have analyzed CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to m154-deficient MCMV.

We observed similar frequencies of M25-II CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in mice infected with m154 mutant and WT MCMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>, right panel). These data argue against a role of m154 in evasion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

However, by comparing different forms of presenting data and applying different combinations of depletion, we have concluded that the way of data presenting that we use is the most informative. Importantly, the results were consistent between experiments and the same was observed with both m154 MCMV mutants (m154-DDAA MCMV and Δm154 MCMV) (Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, similar dependence on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell control was observed also in C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). It is important to emphasize that C57BL/6 mice are inherently resistant to MCMV infection due to NK cell control of infection as compared to MCMV sensitive BALB/c mice, which were mostly used in our study. Therefore, C57BL/6 mice that were not depleted of NK cells exhibited virus levels that were very low or under detection limit in both WT MCMV and m154-DDAA MCMV infected groups.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that other immune cells could play a role in the control of the m154 MCMV mutant. When we tested m154 mutant virus in NSG (NOD SCID γ) mice, we observed a minor, but significant, attenuation of the m154 mutant virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). Since NSG mice lack the majority of immune cells, this opens a possibility for a role of other mechanisms in the control of the m154 mutant virus.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of m154 distruption on immune control mediated by other immune cell populations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 10<sup>5</sup> of M25-II TCR-transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD45.1+) were adoptively transferred into Ly49H-/- C57BL/6 mice (CD45.2+).
