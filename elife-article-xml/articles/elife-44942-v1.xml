In 2017, the Italian Government introduced mandatory vaccination at school entry for ten infectious diseases, including measles. However, sustainable and effective vaccination strategies targeting adults are still lacking. We use a data-driven model of household demography to estimate the potential impact on future measles epidemiology of a novel immunization strategy, to be implemented on top of the 2017 regulation, which consists of offering measles vaccine to the parents of children who get vaccinated. Model simulations suggest that the current vaccination efforts in Italy would not be sufficient to interrupt measles transmission before 2045 because of the frequency of susceptible individuals between 17 and 44 years of age. The integration of the current policy with parental vaccination has the potential to reduce susceptible adults by 17–35%, increasing the chance of measles elimination before 2045 up to 78.9–96.5%.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44942.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Measles is one of the world’s most contagious diseases causing thousands of deaths every year, despite a safe and effective vaccine being available since the 1960s. High rates of vaccination – about 95% of each age group – are required to eliminate measles, but national and global health agencies struggle to achieve high vaccination rates because some parents were and still are hesitant to vaccinate their children. As a result, large measles epidemics continue to occur even in countries with well-established vaccination programs.</p><p>In Italy, low vaccination rates year after year have resulted in large numbers of unprotected youth and adults. The country has recently introduced mandatory measles vaccination at school entry to improve vaccination coverage among children. Yet a high proportion of measles cases in Italy continue to occur in people over 20 years old, a situation that could be improved by immunization programs targeting adults. One approach would be to take advantage of the compulsory vaccination of children by offering parents the vaccine at the same time.</p><p>Marziano et al. used computer modeling to estimate how various vaccination scenarios would affect measles spread in Italy. Their models showed that current vaccination policies targeting school age children would be unlikely to eliminate measles before 2045. On the other hand, if 50% of parents were also vaccinated, elimination could be achieved by 2042, and as early as 2031 if 99% of parents agreed to vaccination.</p><p>Marziano et al. show that a parental vaccination campaign could reduce the population of adults susceptible to measles in Italy and help the country stop the spread of the disease. However, more research is needed to assess how feasible and sustainable this policy would be. Additional policies to increase vaccination against measles in adults could also help, but parental vaccination has a key advantage: it does not require active targeting to recruit parents, since they are already immunizing their children.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>measles elimination</kwd><kwd>school entry vaccination</kwd><kwd>mandatory vaccination</kwd><kwd>parental vaccination</kwd><kwd>immunity gaps</kwd><kwd>mathematical model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors declares that there was no funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Offering measles vaccination to parents who bring their children to receive any dose of measles vaccine can accelerate measles elimination in Italy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan 2012–2020 set the ambitious goal of eliminating measles in at least five World Health Organization (WHO) regions by 2020. Two years before the deadline, only the Americas have achieved measles elimination. Measles is endemic in 14 countries of the WHO European Region, including high-income countries such as Germany, Belgium, France, and Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, 2016</xref>), and it still represents a major concern for public health.</p><p>In 2017, Italy experienced one of the largest measles outbreaks of the past decade in the European Region with four deaths and 5098 cases, 4042 of which were confirmed by positive laboratory results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Italian National Institute of Health, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2018</xref>). The highest incidence was observed in infants under one year of age. About 70% of the reported cases were older than 20 years, with a median age of 27 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Italian National Institute of Health, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Filia et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that measles circulation in Italy is at least partially supported by transmission between adults. Significant immunity gaps in these age segments of the population have been highlighted by a serological screening of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rota et al., 2008</xref>) and by recent modeling studies analyzing long-term processes that affect measles transmission dynamics in the Italian population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Merler and Ajelli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trentini et al., 2017</xref>). The high fraction of measles-susceptible individuals of between 15 and 45 years of age is the result of past suboptimal routine vaccination coverage and the absence of major nationwide epidemics in recent decades, which allowed adolescents to escape both vaccination and natural infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Filia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trentini et al., 2017</xref>). In Italy, the first measles national immunization program was setup in 1983 with a single dose of measles vaccine being administered at 9 months of age. A second dose program was introduced in 1999. However, routine vaccination coverage remained below 80% until 2003, the year of approval of the Italian National Plan for the elimination of Measles and Congenital Rubella. Thereafter, vaccine uptake levels have progressively increased, even though a decrease in coverage has been detected in most recent years, possibly associated with vaccine hesitancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Filia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Merler and Ajelli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giambi et al., 2018</xref>). As a matter of fact, the national coverage reached a peak of 91% in 2010, which is well below the 95% threshold generally considered to be necessary for measles elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and May, 1991</xref>).</p><p>In July 2017, the Italian Government approved a regulation (119/2017) requiring parents to vaccinate their children before school entry against ten infectious diseases, including measles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Signorelli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D’Ancona et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Italian Ministry of Health, 2017</xref>). Vaccination against measles is now free of charge and mandatory for all children under 16 years. Unvaccinated children are not allowed to attend kindergartens, and financial penalties are imposed on the parents of unvaccinated students attending higher school levels. This regulation has the potential to increase vaccine uptake in new birth cohorts and to immunize school-age children who have escaped routine vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trentini et al., 2019</xref>). However, the new policy will not impact the existing immunity gaps in older age groups. In particular, the achievement and maintenance of high vaccination coverage among children may not be enough to avoid the reemergence of measles in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trentini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trentini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durrheim, 2017</xref>). In order to progress towards measles elimination, it is thus crucial for Italy to identify feasible, sustainable, and effective strategies to reduce the number of susceptible individuals among those who have already left the school system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Filia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trentini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durrheim, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thompson, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this work is to propose and investigate the effectiveness of a vaccination strategy to be introduced on top of the current policy.

The first vaccination program, referred to as the ‘current’ program, corresponds to the vaccination policy currently in place in Italy, which consists of the routine vaccination of children at 15 months of age, the administration of a second booster dose at 5 years of age, and the check for compliance with this two-dose schedule at both pre-primary and primary school entry. Specifically, as a consequence of the 2017 regulation, children must have received one dose when entering pre-primary schools (at about 3 years of age) and two doses when entering primary schools (at about 6 years of age). The operating guidelines provided by the Ministry of Health also indicate the implementation during the transitional year 2017 of a catch-up campaign targeting all individuals below the age of 16 years who were not compliant with the two-dose schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D’Ancona et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Italian Ministry of Health, 2018</xref>). Accordingly, in the model, routine vaccination with two-doses is performed every year while a catch-up campaign is simulated in 2017. In addition, from 2018 onwards, measles vaccine is annually offered at pre-primary and primary school entry (i.e., at 3 and 6 years of age) to all children who are not compliant with the routine schedule. Coverage levels for the first and second doses of routine vaccination are assumed to be constant over time and set equal to the most recent estimates of measles vaccination coverage at the national level: 85% and 83%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>). In our simulation, the first dose is administered to children who have never been vaccinated and the second dose is administered to those who have only received one dose. We assume the same vaccination coverage for the 2017 catch-up campaign and for vaccination at school entry. In particular, for these vaccination activities, we assume a baseline coverage level of 50%, which corresponds to current estimates of the impact of the new regulation on measles vaccine uptake in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Italian Ministry of Health, 2019</xref>). Specifically, the coverage level at pre-primary school entry represents the percentage of vaccine uptake among 3-year-old children who have never been vaccinated, whereas the coverage at primary school entry represents the percentage of vaccine uptake among children who have received fewer than two doses.</p><p>A second vaccination program, referred to as ‘parental vaccination’, consists of the implementation from 2018 onwards of a novel strategy targeting the parents of vaccinated children on top of the current program. This supplementary immunization consists of offering measles vaccination to the parents of children who are receiving any dose of measles vaccine. In our simulation, parental vaccination is offered only once to each household, the first time the parents bring one of their children to be vaccinated under the current policy. In particular, we evaluate the impact of parental vaccination under three different coverage scenarios: 50%, 75% and 99%. These percentages represent the proportion of parents who are vaccinated as part of this strategy among all eligible parents, whose exact number depends on the coverage achieved in childhood vaccination programs. We assume that a single vaccine dose is offered to each parent during parental vaccination. In all the considered scenarios, measles vaccine efficacy is set at 95% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Serres et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The effectiveness of each vaccination program is evaluated in terms of its impact on the overall and age-specific susceptibility to infection of the Italian population, on the effective reproduction number R<sub>e</sub> over the period 2017–2045, and on the amount of time required to achieve measles elimination. The effective reproductive number R<sub>e</sub> represents the expected number of secondary cases generated by one typical infected individual in a partially immune population, where the immunity within the population may be due to either vaccination or natural infection. R<sub>e</sub> provides important indications of the transmission potential of the virus in the population.

According to our simulations based on the estimates provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trentini et al. (2017)</xref> at the beginning of 2017, 8.1% (95% CI 7.3–8.9) of the Italian population was susceptible to measles. About one third of the susceptible individuals were younger than 16 years, whereas 60% of them were aged between 18 and 45 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We estimate that the number of measles cases reported during the 2017 Italian outbreak represented only 0.1% (95% CI 0.09–0.12) of the susceptible population in Italy. This implies that, in Italy, about 4.9 million (95% CI 4.4–5.4) people may still be susceptible to measles infection. The age distribution of measles susceptible individuals matches the fraction of cases by age group reported during the 2017 outbreak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), thereby confirming the reliability of simulated immunity gaps in the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Durrheim, 2016</xref>). According to our results, the catch-up campaign implemented in 2017 under the current program has contributed the immunization of 445189 (95% CI: 394797–487621) susceptible children under 16 years of age, producing a 9% reduction in the overall number of susceptible individuals in 2018 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, the obtained results show that after this initial drop, the overall fraction of susceptibles would progressively increase in the next decades, reaching 8.8% (95% CI 8.1–9.5) in 2045 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This increase is ascribable to the replacement of elderly individuals, who are predominantly immune because of natural infection, with new birth cohorts that have been only partially immunized as a consequence of suboptimal coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>). In particular, we estimate that in 2045 only 14.3% (95% CI: 12.5–15.9) of the susceptible population would be younger than 17 years, while individuals aged more than 45 years, who currently contribute only marginally to the residual measles susceptibility, would represent 69.6% (95% CI: 67.8–71.6) of the total number of susceptibles. As expected, the estimated percentage of susceptibles among individuals currently aged between 17 and 44 years would not be affected by this policy, remaining 16.2% (95% CI 14.5–17.7) in 2045 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>The introduction of parental vaccination on top of the current program has the potential to progressively reduce the immunity gaps in adults as well as the overall susceptibility of the Italian population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Remarkably, the estimated total fraction of susceptible individuals in 2045 under the parental vaccination program ranges between 6.3% (95% CI: 5.8–6.9) for 99% vaccination coverage of parents and 7.6% (95% CI: 6.9–8.2) for 50% vaccination coverage, instead of 8.8% expected under the current program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This strategy targets age groups that would otherwise never be reached by the current immunization program, that is cohorts of individuals older than 16 years in the year 2017. In particular, by 2045, parental vaccination at 50% of coverage would result in a 17.1% (95% CI: 16.8–17.5%) reduction in the number of susceptible individuals aged between 17 and 44 years in 2017, while a 35% (95% CI: 34.1–35.9%) reduction in this age group is expected if 99% coverage is assumed.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44942.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Impact of parental vaccination on the future age-specific immunity profiles.</title><p>Mean measles age-specific epidemiological status as estimated by the model for the year 2045 under different scenarios for the ‘parental vaccination’ program.

Our simulations show that the effective reproduction number in 2045 would be 0.95 (95% CI 0.82–1.11), 0.89 (95% CI 0.77–1.07), 0.84 (95% CI 0.71–1.04) when 50%, 75% and 99% of eligible families accept parental vaccination, and that with these levels of vaccination acceptance measles elimination would be achieved on average in 2042, 2037 and 2031, respectively. Our results clearly show that parental vaccination has the potential to reduce the risk of major measles epidemics dramatically in the coming decades, although it is difficult to forecast the probability that measles outbreaks will be experienced in the future (details can be found in Appendix 1).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><p>The performed analysis shows that an improvement of vaccine uptake at school entry to achieve 99% coverage in the current program may anticipate the timing of measles elimination to 2039. If vaccine uptake at school entry were to be 75%, measles elimination could be achieved in 2042, which is comparable to what might be obtained by reaching 50% of eligible families with parental vaccination in the baseline analysis. By contrast, our simulations show that, under the most optimistic scenario of 99% of coverage both for parental vaccination and vaccination at school entry measles elimination could be achieved, on average, as early as 2023.</p><p>The assumption of a shorter or longer generation time would affect model estimates of the effective reproduction number over time. In particular, under parental vaccination at 50% of coverage, a shorter (longer) generation time would result in an anticipation (delay) of the timing of measles elimination, which is estimated to occur before 2045 in 99.2% (16.8%) of model realizations. When a generation time lasting 18 days is considered, the current policy at current coverage levels was insufficient to achieve measles elimination by 2045 in 99.9% of model realizations.</p><p>The obtained estimates are qualitatively robust when considering alternative age-specific mixing patterns for the Italian population, although the inclusion of contact matrices estimated through the modeling approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fumanelli et al., 2012</xref>) results in delayed measles elimination under all considered vaccination scenarios. On the other hand, under the (hardly realistic) scenario of a population that mixes fully at random (i.e., by assuming homogeneous mixing), neither the current policy nor its combination with parental vaccination would be sufficient to achieve measles elimination by 2045.</p><p>Qualitative temporal patterns in the evolution of the effective reproduction number estimated by exploring different levels of measles transmissibility during the prodromal and exanthema phase are generally robust. The largest quantitative difference can be detected when most secondary cases are generated in the prodromal phase. In this case, under the current policy, measles elimination is predicted to occur before 2045 in 73.9% of model realizations instead of the 12.0% of model realizations seen for the baseline analysis. Similarly, under parental vaccination at 50% of coverage, when most of secondary cases are generated in the prodromal phase, measles elimination is predicted to occur before 2045 in 98.7% of model realizations compared to the 78.9% of model realizations seen in the baseline analysis.</p><p>Finally, when considering an extreme scenario in which only 25% of measles cases were reported during the 2017 outbreak, we estimate the exponential growth rate to be 0.29 (95% CI: 0.21–0.37), similar to that obtained when only reported cases are used: 0.29 (95% CI: 0.25–0.33). As estimates of the effective reproduction number depend only on the growth rate and on measles natural history, these results suggest that our findings are robust with respect to the reporting rate (and size) of the 2017 measles outbreak.</p><p>Details on the performed sensitivity analyses are reported and discussed in Appendix 1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In July 2017, the Italian Government approved a regulation requiring parents to vaccinate their children before school entry against ten infections, including measles. Recent estimates suggest that the new regulation allowed the vaccination of 50% of individuals who escaped routine vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Italian Ministry of Health, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Italian National Institute of Health, 2019</xref>). Our modeling study shows that the current policy would reduce measles susceptibility in the age segments of the population characterized by higher contact rates, resulting in a remarkable decrease in the infection transmission potential and making measles elimination a realistic target. However, if only 50% of unvaccinated children are vaccinated at school entry, disease elimination would probably be achieved only after 2045.</p><p>Offering vaccination to the parents of children who receive a measles vaccine dose could progressively reduce by 17–35% the immunity gaps among individuals who are between 18 and 45 years of age in 2018. The implementation of this program would decrease the overall susceptibility of the population by 6.2–22.0%, and would increase the probability of measles elimination before 2045 from 12.0% (estimated in the absence of this additional policy) to 78.9–96.5%. The effectiveness of this strategy clearly depends on both the coverage achieved through childhood immunization (routine programs and vaccination at school entry) and on the willingness of parents to be vaccinated themselves. The obtained estimates are generally robust with respect to different assumptions on the duration of measles generation time and on the relative transmissibility of measles during the prodromal and exanthema phases. On the other hand, under the assumption of homogeneous mixing in the population, neither the current immunization program nor parental vaccination appear to be sufficient to eliminate measles before 2045.</p><p>The study presents a few limitations that should be carefully considered in order to achieve a better interpretation of the obtained results. In particular, our estimates of the effective reproduction number were obtained using measles cases reported during the 2017 outbreak. The current degree of measles underreporting in statutory notifications is unknown. However, our estimates of the effective reproduction number are stable with respect to the possible underreporting of cases during the outbreak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciofi Degli Atti et al., 2002</xref>). The proposed analysis did not take into account potential geographical heterogeneities in measles immunity levels at the sub-national scale. Although the new regulation is expected to harmonize the vaccine offer and its uptake in Italy, significant regional differences in both immunization schedule and coverage have been reported in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonanni et al., 2015</xref>). Regions characterized by a lower than national average vaccine uptake in the past may therefore experience a delay in measles elimination with respect to the results presented in this work. In our work, future measles susceptibility might have been overestimated, as we did not explicitly model measles transmission, thus disregarding the impact of future measles spread on the immunity profile of the Italian population. Although both the occurrence and magnitude of future measles epidemics are largely uncertain and difficult to predict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Earn et al., 2000</xref>), changing patterns of measles transmission may affect both the number of susceptible adults and the incidence of severe disease in the coming years. However, the population infected during the 2017 Italian outbreak—one of the largest occurred in Europe in the last years—represented only 0.1% of the estimated susceptible population in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Italian National Institute of Health, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trentini et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that the explicit inclusion of measles transmission may have a limited impact on short- or medium-term estimates of the immunity profile and measles transmission potential. The proposed analysis relies on the simplifying assumption that parents decide whether to vaccinate their children regardless of past vaccination behavior, although it is likely that parents vaccinate either all or none of their children. All children receiving vaccination indirectly present their parents with the opportunity to vaccinate themselves. As the children receiving vaccination may be clustered in a smaller number of households than is the case in our model, we are probably overestimating the potential number of parents who are eligible for measles vaccination. In particular, in our simulations, 98.7% of families with children between 1 and 15 years of age are considered as eligible for parental vaccination, whereas in a perfectly clustered model, this percentage would be 88.1%. On the other hand, clustering of unvaccinated children may have a larger effect on measles transmission dynamics than on the number of parents eligible for vaccination. Finally, we assumed that routine vaccination coverage would not be affected by the implementation of the new national policy, and that the coverage of the catch-up campaign conducted in 2017–2018 was the same as that of vaccination at school entry (both for pre-primary and for primary schools). However, data released in December 2018 by the Italian Ministry of Health suggest that the new regulation on mandatory vaccination at school entry may have indirectly affected the first-dose vaccine uptake for children under 3 years of age. In particular, the available records show that the first-dose vaccination coverage in the 2015 age cohort has increased from 91.4% in 2017 to 94.2% in 2018, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Italian Ministry of Health, 2019</xref>) although the fraction of unvaccinated children who were vaccinated thanks to the new regulation may vary depending on the age cohort considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D’Ancona et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Italian Ministry of Health, 2019</xref>). According to the most recent estimates, measles vaccination coverage in the 2014 age cohort has increased from 87.3% in 2016 to 94.4% in 2018, suggesting that the new regulation resulted in the vaccination of about 56% of unvaccinated children in this cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Italian National Institute of Health, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our analysis shows that a marked increase in childhood immunization rates would not be sufficient to achieve measles elimination in the short- or medium-term in Italy. These results confirm the need for appropriate strategies to vaccinate individuals who have already left the school system in order to reduce critical immunity gaps in young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trentini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Filia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trentini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durrheim, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thompson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wise, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gidding et al., 2007</xref>). Attempts made to date in this direction either have only been partially effective or have required remarkable efforts in terms of the costs to and commitment of the public health authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gidding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morice et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kelly et al., 2007</xref>). In Costa Rica, a measles-rubella vaccination campaign targeting adults aged 15–39 years was successfully conducted in 2000, but it required huge efforts of communication, social mobilization, and the use of house-to-house vaccination teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morice et al., 2003</xref>). In 2001–2002, a vaccination campaign in Australia targeting young adults aged between 18 and 30 years who visited their general practitioner (GP) had little effect on the immunity gaps, probably because of a lack of promotion and central coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gidding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kelly et al., 2007</xref>). In Europe, beyond some local attempts to immunize adolescents and individuals before school leaving, which have only marginally affected the vaccine uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lashkari and El Bashir, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vazzoler et al., 2014</xref>), little has been done to reduce residual susceptibility in adults. Interventions recently set up include attempts to raise awareness in people attending social events that may represent potential hotspots for measles transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Public Health England, 2018</xref>). In this work, a new strategy is proposed, consisting of offering vaccination to parents of children who are being vaccinated against measles. Although the proposed policy can reach only a fraction of susceptible adults, that is those with children in the measles-vaccination age group, the obtained results suggest that this strategy may be both feasible and effective. In particular, our results suggest that vaccinating 50% of parents who agreed to vaccinate their children, and may therefore be inclined towards accepting vaccination, would promote measles elimination as well as reaching 50% of children who still escape measles vaccination despite the fact that vaccination is now mandatory in Italy (i.e., increasing vaccination coverage at school entry from 50% to 75%). The sustainability of the proposed strategy should be carefully evaluated by public health decision makers. However, a key advantage of this policy is that it does not require targeted activities to recruit parents, thus resulting in a relatively simple implementation protocol.</p><p>Beyond parental vaccination, alternative immunization strategies aimed at reducing residual susceptibility in adults may also be considered. These may include the extension of mandatory vaccination at university entry – an intervention already implemented in different US states. Other immunization efforts may include the introduction of proof of immunity as a condition for the enrolment of health care workers (HCWs), for whom measles vaccination is only recommended in most European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galanakis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maltezou et al., 2019</xref>). The need to improve vaccination coverage among HCWs is due to their potential to amplify measles outbreaks and their higher risk of exposure to the virus, as observed in the 2017 Italian outbreak in which 7% of cases were HCWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maltezou et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The achievement of measles elimination remains a global health priority. Actions may be also required to raise awareness and consensus about the benefits coming from vaccination and to increase the overall vaccine uptake. Country-specific policies should be identified and carefully evaluated by decision makers in order to anticipate the time of measles elimination as much as possible.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Maria Litvinova for contributing to the validation of the household generation model against census data and for useful comments on the manuscript.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Methodology, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="scode1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44942.019</object-id><label>Source code 1.</label><caption><title>Code used to run model simulations (C programming language).</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-44942-code1-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44942.020</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Stochastic demographic projections of the age structure of the Italian population over the 2018–2045 period as provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT).</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-44942-supp1-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44942.021</object-id><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Bootstrapped contact matrices as obtained from random sampling of participants to the POLYMOD contact survey.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-44942-supp2-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44942.022</object-id><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-44942-transrepform-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>In this work, no new data were collected.

Materials and methods</title><p>In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of a novel vaccination strategy, to be added on top of the current immunization program, in reducing measles susceptibility in Italy. The proposed strategy, here denoted as ‘parental vaccination’, consists of offering vaccination to parents who bring their children to be vaccinated against measles. The impact of parental vaccination on measles epidemiology is evaluated using a model that is capable of reproducing not only the age distribution of the Italian population but also the main features of Italian household demography, including the distribution of households’ size, the heterogeneity in household composition, and the age gaps between household members. To this aim, an individual-based model of household generation previously introduced in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merler et al., 2011</xref>) was adapted to simulate the time-varying socio-demographic structure of the Italian population over the period 2017–2045. The model takes advantage of data on and projections of the Italian age structure, as provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), and of the most recent census data on the composition and size of Italian households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Italian National Institute of Statistics, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Statistical Office of the European Commission, 2011</xref>). Projections of the Italian population used in this study (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) are based on different stochastic realizations of official forecasts as provided by ISTAT and obtained through a method introduced in the literature by Billari and colleagues in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billari et al., 2012</xref>).

As our estimates of the effective reproduction number depend only on the growth rate and on measles natural history, we need to check the robustness of the estimated exponential growth rate <italic>r</italic> of the 2017 outbreak to the case reporting rate. The current degree of reporting of measles in statutory notifications in Italy is unknown. However, a previous study highlighted that in the year 2000, the number of cases reported to a network of voluntary primary care pediatricians was 3.9 times higher than that reported in statutory notifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciofi Degli Atti et al., 2002</xref>).

The obtained results show that the introduction of parental vaccination can mitigate such an increase.

Therefore, we assessed the robustness of our estimates of the effective reproduction number over the 2017–2045 period when assuming a higher coverage for vaccination at school entry: 75% and 99%, instead of the 50% assumed in the analysis presented in the main text. In addition, we also considered a vaccination scenario for the current program in which the coverage at school entry is set to 0%. The latter scenario corresponds to the vaccination program that was in place prior the introduction of the new regulation in 2017 (denoted here as the ‘past program’), which consisted of the recommendation of routine vaccination in a two-dose schedule. For all scenarios considered, coverage levels for the first and second dose routine vaccinations are fixed at 85% and 83%, respectively.</p><p>The obtained results suggest that, in the absence of the new regulation, the effective reproduction number would increase to 2.01 (95% CI: 1.83–2.28) in 2045 (past program – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11a-b</xref>) and measles elimination would not be achieved by 2045. On the other hand, an improvement of measles vaccination coverage at school entry to 75% or 99% would result in a fall in the average effective reproduction number to levels below the epidemic threshold of 1 in 2042 and 2039, respectively (green and purple in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11a</xref>). In addition, the percentage of simulations resulting in measles elimination before 2045 would also increase with respect to the baseline analysis: from 12% to 89.2% and from 12% to 98.8% when school entry vaccination is considered at 75% and 99% of coverage, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11b</xref>). Furthermore, the obtained results confirm that the introduction of parental vaccination on top of the current program would accelerate progress towards measles elimination. In particular, according to our simulations, the introduction of parental vaccination (coverage of 50%, 75% and 99%) on top of the current program with a vaccination coverage at school entry of 75% would result in measles elimination in 2036, 2031 and 2026, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11 c-d</xref>), compared to 2042, 2037 and 2031 obtained in the main analysis.

We enclose here a point-by-point response to each of the reviewers’ comments. We have done our best to address all comments and suggestions by the reviewers. In particular, the major changes can be summarized as follows:</p><p>- We have restructured the manuscript to better highlight the impact of introducing parental vaccination on top of the current strategy. In particular, we decided to focus the main text on strategy “R+S+P” by assuming a baseline vaccination coverage at school entry of 50% on the basis of the latest available estimates on the impact of the new regulation in Italy. Alternative scenarios with different coverage for vaccination at school entry (namely, 0%, 75%, and 99%) were moved to the Appendix and are now presented as a sensitivity analysis. The title has been amended to reflect this change. The figures of the manuscript have been updated as well.</p><p>- Model estimates now include the uncertainty regarding: (i) the demographic projections of the age structure of the Italian population over 2018-2045; (ii) the age-specific measles immunity profile; (iii) the growth rate r of the 2017 measles epidemic; iv) the Italian contact matrices.</p><p>-We have added: (i) a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the estimates with respect to possible underreporting and uncertainty about the size of the 2017 Italian outbreak; and (ii) a sensitivity analysis on the effective reproduction number. A new subsections entitled “Sensitivity analysis” has also been added to the main text.</p><p>- We have specified in the text all missing details about the data and model assumptions.</p><p>-The Italian population forecasts over 2018–2045 used in our analysis are now provided as a Supplementary file, as long as a brief description of methods adopted by ISTAT to produce these forecasts.</p><p>- We moved to the Appendix results concerning the probability of experiencing a measles outbreak and added an analysis showing how it depends on the number of measles introductions over the course of a season.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Restructure the manuscript in order to focus more on the third strategy (R+S+P).</p></disp-quote><p>In light of the reviewers’ comment, we have restructured the manuscript in order to highlight the impact of introducing parental vaccination on top of the current regulation (R+S). In particular, according to the latest available estimates, measles vaccination coverage in the cohort 2014 has increased from 87.3% in 2016 to 94.4% as of June 2018, suggesting that the new regulation contributed to vaccinate about 56% of unvaccinated children in this cohort. In light of this, we decided to present in the main text results obtained under program R+S, including routine vaccination in a two-dose schedule and assuming a baseline vaccination coverage at school entry of 50%. We now refer to this program as “current program”. Regarding parental vaccination, we explore three different scenarios obtained by adding parental vaccination on top of the “current program” and assuming three different coverage levels (50%, 75%, and 99%), as in the original manuscript.</p><p>Alternative scenarios of the parental vaccination on top of the “current program” with different coverage for vaccination at school entry (75% and 99%) and the scenario including routine vaccination only (R) were moved to the Appendix and are now presented as sensitivity analyses. The figures of the manuscript have been updated accordingly.</p><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for providing this suggestion, as we do believe that the manuscript has now a much better flow and it clarifies the most important aspects of our analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Discuss what could be different strategies to reach older age groups (i.e. cohort with low level of immunity due to natural infection or vaccination) and their likely impact.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point of discussion. In the new version of the manuscript, we discuss possible strategies alternative to parental vaccination that could be used to reduce measles immunity gaps in older age groups. An alternative possible intervention consists in extending mandatory vaccination to universities. Indeed, two doses of the measles vaccination are already required in several US states for attending colleges and universities, and all students have to document immunity to measles before registering for classes. In Italy, to date, no vaccinations are required to enrol at universities. A second possibility is represented by targeting health care workers (HCW), for which measles vaccination is recommended, but not mandatory in most European countries including Italy [Galanakis et al., 2014]. We do believe that specific interventions targeting this subpopulation should be a priority, given the high number of measles cases reported among them in the 2017 Italian outbreak (315 out of 5,098 cases) and their potential to amplify measles outbreaks. Possible interventions in this direction include the performance of catch-up campaigns for HCW or the introduction of a proof of immunity as a requirement for admissibility to employment as HCW. The latter policy is already in place in some Italian regions (e.g., Puglia and Emilia Romagna) [Maltezou et al., 2019].</p><p>To address this point, we added the following sentences to the Discussion:</p><p>“Beyond parental vaccination, alternative immunization strategies aimed at reducing residual susceptibility in adults may be considered as well. These may include the extension of mandatory vaccination at university entry – an intervention already implemented in different US states. Other immunization efforts may include the introduction of a proof of immunity as a condition for enrolment of health care workers (HCWs), for which measles vaccination is only recommended in most of European countries [Galanakis et al., 2014, Maltezou et al., 2019]. The need for improving vaccination coverage among HCWs is due to their potential in amplifying measles outbreaks and their higher risk of exposure to the virus as happened in the 2017 Italian outbreak where 7% of cases were HCWs [Maltezou et al., 2019].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Ensure that the coverages described in the methods and used for the simulations are clearly defined in particular specify the denominators.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for being unclear on this point, that is now specified in the section Material and Methods section as follows:</p><p>“Coverage levels for the first and second dose of routine vaccination are assumed to be constant over time and set equal to the most recent estimates of measles vaccination coverage at the national level – 85% and 83%, respectively. In our simulation, the first dose is administered to children who have never been vaccinated and the second dose is administered to those who have only received one dose.”</p><p>[…]</p><p>“Specifically, the coverage level at pre-primary school entry represents the percentage of vaccine uptake among 3 years old children who have never been vaccinated, whereas the coverage at primary school entry represents the percentage of vaccine uptake among children who have received less than two doses.”</p><p>[…]</p><p>“In our simulation, parental vaccination is offered only once to each household, the first time they bring one of their children to get vaccinated under the current policy. In particular, we evaluate the impact of parental vaccination under three different coverage scenarios: 50%, 75% and 99%. These percentages represent the proportion of parents who get vaccinated with this strategy among all eligible parents, whose exact amount depends on the coverage for childhood vaccination programs. We assume that one single vaccine dose is offered to each parent during parental vaccination.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Do a sensitivity analysis regarding under reporting and size of 2017 outbreak; discuss plausibility of estimate in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have added a sensitivity analysis on underreporting and size of the 2017 outbreak. The current degree of reporting of measles in statutory notifications is unknown. A previous study estimating Italian measles incidence rates in the year 2000 from cases reported to a network of voluntary primary care paediatricians and from statutory notifications found that the former was 3.9 times higher than the latter [Ciofi degli Atti et al., 2002]. This would suggest a degree of reporting in statutory notifications of about 25%. The reporting rate of measles may have likely improved in the last decades. However, in the absence of updated estimates, we take this value as a worst-case scenario and assess the robustness of our results when accounting for a reporting rate of 25%.</p><p>In the new version of the manuscript, we have included an additional analysis where we estimate the attack rate and the growth rate associated with 1,000 synthetic time-series of measles infection cases generated on the basis of a MCMC approach applied to the likelihood of observing the original time series of reported measles cases when assuming a reporting rate of 25%. Under this assumption on measles reporting, the estimated overall number of measles cases in 2017 is 19,224 (95%CI: 18,724-19,745 vs 5,098 reported).</p><p>Remarkably, even when considering this worst case scenario on measles reporting, the estimated exponential growth rate obtained is 0.29 (95% CI: 0.21-0.37), similar to the one obtained when only reported cases are used: 0.29 (95%CI: 0.25-0.33). Since estimates of the effective reproduction number depend only on the growth rate and on measles natural history, this suggests that our results are robust with respect to reporting rate (and size) of the 2017 measles outbreak.</p><p>Methodological details on this new sensitivity analysis are reported in the revised version of the Appendix.</p><p>The outcome of this sensitivity analysis is commented in the Results section as follows:</p><p>“Finally, when considering an extreme scenario where only 25% of measles cases were reported during the 2017 outbreak, we estimate the exponential growth rate to be 0.29 (95% CI: 0.21–0.37), similar to the one obtained when only reported cases are used: 0.29 (95% CI: 0.25–0.33). Since estimates of the effective reproduction number depend only on the growth rate and on measles natural history, this suggests that our results are robust with respect to reporting rate (and size) of the 2017 measles outbreak.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Specify if the age profile of observed cases used for validation of the model is based on laboratory cases.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of detail on this. The data used for model validation consist in the age-specific number of suspected measles cases reported to the National Health Institute.</p><p>In order to clarify this point, we have modified the caption of Figure 1 as follows:</p><p>“Age distribution of susceptible individuals at the beginning of 2017 as simulated in our model (orange) and age distribution of suspected measles cases as reported during the year 2017 to the National Measles and Rubella Integrated Surveillance System (green).”</p><p>Moreover, we have modified the following sentence in Introduction to update the estimated number of measles cases reported in 2017 and specify that 4,042 out of 5,098 suspected cases were lab-confirmed measles cases.</p><p>“In 2017, Italy experienced one of the largest measles outbreaks occurred during the last decade in the European Region with four deaths and 5,098 cases, 4,042 of which were confirmed by positive laboratory results.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Provide the ISTAT data as supplementary material to ensure permanency and provide a description of the assumptions of the model used for forecasting the demographic profile until 2045, this could be added to the Appendix.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, the ISTAT data on the projections of the Italian population by age over the period 2017–2045 used in our simulations is now included Supplementary file 2.</p><p>Moreover, the procedure adopted by the ISTAT (Billari et al., 2012) to provide demographic forecasts of the population between 2018 and 2045 is now summarized in the Appendix as follows:</p><p>“Projections of the Italian population used in this study (see Supplementary file 2) are based on different stochastic realizations of official forecasts as provided by ISTAT and obtained through a method introduced in the literature by Billari and colleagues in 2012. This method relies on the framework of the so-called “random-scenario approach”, which is based on a series of subsequent expert-based conditional evaluations on the future evolution of different demographic indicators, given the values of the indicators at previous time points. Component-specific forecasts are combined and applied to an initial population (2017) to obtain different projections of the age-structure and overall size of the Italian population between 2018 and 2060.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please incorporate uncertainty regarding demographic projections, estimation of r, contact matrices and initial susceptibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for pointing out this important methodological aspect. In the new version of the main text, we now present and discuss epidemiological results associated with different trajectories of the effective reproduction number (R<sub>e</sub>) as obtained by taking into account the uncertainty on:</p><p>1) initial measles susceptibility in 2017 as estimated by Trentini et al., 2017;</p><p>2) demographic trajectories of the Italian population age-structure as provided by available projections for the period 2017–2045;</p><p>3) contact patterns as resulting from a bootstrap procedure applied to the Italian POLYMOD contact matrix;</p><p>4) exponential growth rate r associated with the 2017 measles epidemic as resulting from the linear regression analysis.</p><p>Please note that in the original version of the manuscript we were using the contact matrix estimated for Italy by Fumanelli et al., 2012, which were obtained through the construction of a virtual population parameterized with detailed socio-demographic data. However, in order to appropriately include in our estimates, the uncertainty surrounding age-specific contact patterns observed in Italy, we have now considered the POLYMOD contact matrix for Italy [Mossong et al., 2008]. In particular, this allowed us to generate 1,000 bootstrapped contact matrices for Italy based on the publicly available individual contact diaries of the POLYMOD study.</p><p>Please note, results obtained in the original manuscript by using the contact matrix estimated by Fumanelli et al., have now been included as a sensitivity analysis on model results.</p><p>In order to better clarify all the different sources of uncertainty included in our estimates we have added the following sentence in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“Results presented in this paper are based on 1,000 different model realizations for each vaccination scenario and include uncertainty regarding: the demographic projections of the age structure of the Italian population over 2018–2045; the age-specific measles immunity profiles estimated for Italy for 2017; the estimated growth rate r of the 2017 measles epidemic; and the age-specific mixing patterns of the Italian population.”</p><p>A description on how the different sources of uncertainty have been incorporated is also provided in the new version of the Appendix.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Include in the results a section on the sensitivity analysis based on results presented in the Appendix.</p></disp-quote><p>A new subsection “Sensitivity analysis” discussing the results of the performed sensitivity analyses has been added at the end of the Results section. In particular, we assess the robustness of our results with respect to:</p><p>1) Estimates of the effective reproduction number by considering scenarios with higher coverage for measles vaccination at school entry (75% and 99%, instead of 50% as assumed in our baseline analysis), either combined with parental vaccination or not.</p><p>2) Estimates of the effective reproduction number by assuming longer or shorter generation time (10 and 18 days, as compared with the 14 days assumed in our baseline analysis).</p><p>3) Estimates of the effective reproduction number under different assumptions on population mixing patterns in the form of an alternative contact matrix estimated for Italy [Fumanelli et al., 2012] and under the homogeneous mixing assumption.</p><p>4) Estimates of the effective reproduction number by explicitly accounting for two distinct phases of infectivity, instead of a single one.</p><p>5) Estimated exponential growth <italic>r</italic> when including possible under-reporting of cases for the 2017 outbreak (see reviewers’ comment #4).</p><p>Please note that sensitivity analysis 1, 3, and 4 were already present in the original version of the manuscript, but that new simulations have been performed to incorporate the different sources of uncertainty that are now accounted for in the baseline analysis (as detailed above – reviewers comment #7).</p><p>Details regarding the performed sensitivity analyses have been added in the Appendix but also mentioned in the main.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Carry additional sensitivity analysis with regards to estimation of R0.</p></disp-quote><p>In our modelling analysis, the estimate of the (effective) reproduction number depends on the estimated growth rate of the 2017 outbreak and on measles natural history. As such, we performed a new sensitivity analysis aimed at evaluating the estimates’ robustness to different assumptions on the duration of the generation time. Specifically, we considered a shorter and longer generation time (10 and 18 days) with respect to the value assumed in the baseline analysis (14 days).</p><p>We have now added a section at the end of the Results section in which we present estimates obtained through this sensitivity analysis:</p><p>“The assumption of a shorter or longer generation time would affect model estimates of the effective reproduction number over time. In particular, under parental vaccination at 50% of coverage, a shorter (longer) generation time would result in an anticipation (delay) of the timing at measles elimination, which is estimated to occur before 2045 in 99.2% (16.8%) of model realizations. When a generation time lasting 18 days is considered, the current policy, at current coverage levels, results instead insufficient to achieve measles elimination by 2045 in 99.9% of model realizations.”</p><p>Additional details and figures on the sensitivity analysis performed have also been added in the Appendix.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Discuss the impact spatial heterogeneity in term of the predictions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this useful comment, which allowed us to clarify a potential limitation of our analysis. Indeed, available epidemiological data and evidence show that Italian regions have experienced different immunization schedules and vaccination coverage in the last decades [Bonanni, 2015]. The new regulation on mandatory vaccination will hopefully promote a harmonization in the vaccine offer and uptake among children. However, different measles immunity levels have been detected across regions (e.g., Rota et al., 2008), so that regions that have been characterized by lower coverage in the past could experience a delay in measles elimination with respect to the results presented in this paper. On the other hand, we believe that all Italian regions (and possibly other countries as well) would benefit from the introduction of parental vaccination aimed at reducing measles immunity gaps in adults. The following sentence has therefore been added in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Although the new regulation is expected to harmonize vaccine offer and uptake in Italy, significant regional differences in both immunization schedule and coverage were reported in the past. Regions characterized by a lower than national average vaccine uptake in the past may therefore experience a delay in measles elimination with respect to results presented in this work.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Please discuss the assumption behind the equation of the probability of an outbreak as a function of R<sub>e</sub>. A description in the Appendix ion of how the result is derived would be good. Is it the probability for a single introduction? How does it translate in terms of probability of an outbreak over a season? What is the impact of multiple reintroduction of measles?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of detail on this point. The equation used in the original version of the manuscript represents the outbreak probability after a single reintroduction and holds for stochastic SIR epidemics models (see for instance discrete time Markov Chains [Allen, 2008]). The equation can be generalized as p=1-(1/R<sub>e</sub>)<sup>n</sup> to obtain the probability of outbreak after <italic>n</italic> importations – either as separated events or not.</p><p>However, the estimated probability of an outbreak over a season can dramatically change under different assumptions on the numberof cases imported in the population over the considered period (e.g. in one year), which is a quantity that is difficult to properly estimate and forecast. As such, we acknowledge that the outbreak probability after a single reintroduction could represents a misleading measure of measles transmission potential. Thus, we decided to move results on this from the main text to the Appendix, by adding an appropriate discussion on how this probability would change when a different number of imported cases over a season is considered.</p><p>Please note that, as suggested, we added in the Appendix a description of the assumptions behind the equation p=1-1/R<sub>e</sub>, providing appropriate references and discussion on this point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
