PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are newly identified excitatory mechanosensitive proteinsthat play important roles in a wide range of developmental and physiological processes in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alper, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coste et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). PIEZO1 is a non-selective ion channel that forms homotrimeric complexes at the plasma membrane; however, PIEZO1 exhibits a preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gnanasambandam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Syeda et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the human and mouse PIEZO1 channels respond to different mechanical stimuli, including static pressure, shear stress and membrane stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poole et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>). PIEZO1 also regulates vascular branching and endothelial cell alignment upon sensing frictional force (shear stress) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nonomura et al., 2018</xref>). Stem cells also use PIEZO1 to sense mechanical signals and to initiate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling to promote proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Del Mármol et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2018</xref>). PIEZO2 primarily functions as a key mechanotransducer for light touch, proprioception and breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nonomura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Woo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Woo et al., 2014</xref>). Mutations in both human <italic>PIEZO1</italic> and human <italic>PIEZO2</italic> have been identified among patients suffering from channelopathy diseases, such as dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (DHSt), generalized lymphatic dysplasia (GLD), and distal arthrogryposis type 5 (DA5), in which osmoregulation is disturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albuisson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andolfo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coste et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lukacs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McMillin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zarychanski et al., 2012</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>PIEZO1</italic> gene cause autosomal recessive congenital lymphatic dysplasia, whereas gain-of-function mutations lead to autosomal dominant stomatocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alper, 2017</xref>). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of PIEZO dysfunction in these diseases are not well understood.</p><p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is an attractive model system for the study of mechanotransduction in vivo. <italic>C. elegans </italic>contains multiple tubular tissues, including the reproductive system, that experience mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cram, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cram, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Voglis and Tavernarakis, 2005</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> reproductive system consists of two U-shaped gonad arms, each ending with a spermatheca and joined in the center by a shared uterus. <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites produce sperm during the L4 larval stage and then shift to produce oocytes during the adult stage. About 150 sperm are stored in each spermatheca, whereas the oocytes form in the oviduct in each gonad arm. The oocyte adjacent to the spermatheca undergoes oocyte maturation ~25 min before being ovulated into the spermatheca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greenstein, 2005</xref>). Oocyte maturation is triggered by sperm-derived polypeptides known as major sperm proteins (MSPs), which activate the oocyte mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). Once the oocyte matures, five pairs of contractile myoepithelial cells that make up the somatic gonad and that encase the germline, named sheath cells, push the matured oocyte into the spermatheca for fertilization. The spermatheca is an accordion-like multicellular tube, consisting of two spermathecal valves, the distal valve (closest to the oviduct) and the spermathecal-uterine (sp-ut) valve, and a bag-like chamber between the two valves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kimble and Hirsh, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCarter et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The two spermathecal valves are spatiotemporally coordinated to allow oocyte entry during ovulation and exit after fertilization, through acto-myosin contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kelley and Cram, 2019</xref>). Ovulation is triggered by signaling between oocytes, sheath cells, and sperm through increasing cytosolic inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bui and Sternberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clandinin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2010</xref>). The ovulated oocyte spends 3–5 min in the dilated spermatheca with both valves closed to allow the oocyte and sperm to complete fertilization and to initiate eggshell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnston et al., 2010</xref>). The constriction of the spermathecal bag cells and the opening of the spermathecal-uterine valve cells expel the fertilized egg into the uterus. Meanwhile, the sperm that are swept out of the spermatheca during oocyte exit crawl back to the constricted spermatheca. The navigation of the sperm back to the spermatheca is regulated by the chemoattractant prostaglandin, which is secreted by the oocytes and sheath cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kubagawa et al., 2006</xref>). Despite the probable role of mechanical stimuli (such as stretch of oocyte entry or the contraction of the spermatheca) during this whole process, the mechanisms underlying the mechanosensitive channels in ovulation and fertilization remain largely unknown.</p><p>In this study, we hypothesized that a mechanosensitive protein such as PEZO-1, the sole PIEZO-like protein in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> is involved in processes that include cellular movements, such as those observed in ovulation where oocytes must transit into and out of the spermatheca. Multiple deletion mutations, as well as a putative gain-of-function mutation, caused severe reproductive deficiencies, such as reduced brood sizes and defects in ovulation and sperm navigation. Somewhat surprisingly, normal calcium release was observed in the spermatheca during early ovulations of <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants. Sperm that were readily washed out of the spermatheca during ovulation failed to migrate back to the spermatheca, thus depleting the spermatheca of sperm early in the reproductive lifecycle. Supplementing male sperm through mating significantly repopulated the spermatheca with cross-sperm and rescued the extremely low ovulation rate and reduced brood size of <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants. Using an auxin-inducible degradation (AID) system, we depleted PEZO-1 in somatic tissues and the germline. Reduced brood sizes were observed in each tissue-specific degradation strain, suggesting that PEZO-1 from many tissues has multiple inputs in regulating reproduction. Thus, our analysis of numerous <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants suggests that PEZO-1 has a complex role in a number of tissues that are required for reproduction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PEZO-1 is expressed in multiple tissues throughout development</title><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes a single <italic>PIEZO</italic> ortholog, <italic>pezo-1</italic>, of which there are 14 mRNA isoformsas the result of differential splicing and transcriptional start sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris et al., 2019</xref>); these 14 isoforms code for 12 different PEZO-1 proteins. All isoforms share a common C-terminus. To visualize the expression pattern of <italic>pezo-1</italic> in vivo accurately, we directly knocked-in different fluorescent reporter genes into both the N-terminus and C-terminus of the <italic>pezo-1</italic> endogenous locus using CRISPR/Cas9. The C-terminal knock-in reporters should tag all <italic>pezo-1</italic> isoforms, whereas the N-terminal knock-in reporters should only tag the eight longest <italic>pezo-1</italic> isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Both GFP and mScarlet were used as reporters to generate N- and C-terminal fusions proteins. GFP::PEZO-1, mScarlet::PEZO-1, and PEZO-1::mScarlet were widely expressed from embryonic stages through adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E,G–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–G</xref>). The genome-edited animals behaved normally, suggesting that tagging PEZO-1 with these fluorescent reporter genes causes no functional disruption. Notably, PEZO-1 is strongly expressed in several tubular tissues, including the pharyngeal-intestinal and spermathecal-uterine valves, which is consistent with our hypothesis that <italic>pezo-1</italic> may be responsible for mechanoperception in these tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Under higher magnification, we observed PEZO-1 on the plasma membranes of oocytes and embryonic cells during a variety of embryonic stages, suggesting that PEZO-1 is a transmembrane protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). PEZO-1 is expressed in multiple reproductive tissues, including the germline, somatic oviduct, and spermatheca (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–J</xref>). Higher magnification imaging of the spermatheca revealed that PEZO-1 is also expressed on sperm membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Consistent with the hypothesis that reproductive tissues are regulated by mechanosensitive stimuli in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, expression of PEZO-1 probably functions to sense physical strain or contractility during ovulation and fertilization. Live imaging and detailed analysis of PEZO-1 expression patterns during reproduction revealed that GFP::PEZO-1 is expressed in sheath cells, sperm, both spermathecal valves and the spermathecal bag cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–O</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The fluorescent signal of GFP::PEZO-1 is observed in both spermathecal valves, suggesting that PEZO-1 may function to sense the mechanical stimuli at the valves during ovulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,M,N</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). As the fertilized oocyte is pushed into the uterus, GFP::PEZO-1-labeled sperm crawl back into the constricting spermatheca after each ovulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that PEZO-1 is expressed in the somatic gonadal cells and germline cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>pezo-</italic>1 is widely expressed in <italic>C. elegans.</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two fluorescent reporter genes were knocked-in to both N-terminus and C-terminus of <italic>pezo-1</italic>.

Two other alleles were generated by CRISPR/Cas9: <italic>pezo-1(sy1398)</italic>, which has a deletion of an exon unique to the two shortest isoforms, i and j, and a putative null allele, <italic>pezo-1(sy1199),</italic> which has a ‘STOP-IN’ mutation in exon 27 that should interfere with translation of the C-termini of all isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Although GFP::PEZO-1 and PEZO-1::mScarlet are expressed widely in adult worms, we did not observe obvious morphological differences between homozygous <italic>pezo-1<sup>KO</sup></italic> mutants and control animals. However, in all tested <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants, the number of F<sub>1</sub> progeny was significantly lower than in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Although embryos fill the uterus in wildtype mothers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), a mass of ooplasm in the uteri of both <italic>pezo-1<sup>KO</sup></italic> and STOP-IN mutants was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Occasionally, a few fertilized embryos were observed inside this mass of ooplasm (data not shown). <italic>pezo-1 CΔ</italic> and STOP-IN mutants displayed the most severe defects, with 100% of animals having a uterus filled with ooplasm at 60 hr post L4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Staining with DAPI in <italic>pezo-1<sup>KO</sup></italic> uteri revealed chromosome structures that were indicative of diakinesis-staged oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Sperm chromatin was not clearly observed, so we cannot state for certain that these crushed oocytes were not fertilized. By contrast, only mitotic chromatin of variably aged embryos were detected in control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Consistent with this observation, only unfertilized oocytes and newly fertilized embryos without intact eggshells were stained with the lipophilic dye, BODIPY, in wildtype animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). BODIPY staining revealed widespread penetration of the entire ooplasmic mass in the uteri of <italic>pezo-1 CΔ</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). These data suggest that some oocytes are not fertilized upon transit through the spermatheca and that these unfertilized oocytes may be crushed when they pass through the spermathecal valves. Although these crushed oocyte phenotypes are reminiscent of those observed in animals depleted of some eggshell components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnston et al., 2010</xref>), there are notable differences. The <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutant oocytes are not fertilized and do not make an eggshell. The lack of fertilization or eggshell synthesis is not likely to be responsible for the crushed oocyte phenotype, because the oocytes in <italic>spe</italic> mutants survive spermatheca transit and are often laid after passing through the uterus. A more detailed characterization of the ovulation defects is provided below.</p><p>In addition to these apparently crushed oocytes, reduced numbers of sperm resident in the spermatheca were observed in Day 1 <italic>pezo-1</italic> adults (0–24 hr post mid-L4) and even fewer were observed in the spermathecae in Day 2–3 adults (24–48 hr post mid-L4) compared with wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–M</xref>). Normal numbers of sperm were present in these mutant hermaphrodites prior to the first ovulation, suggesting that the ability of the sperm to return to the spermatheca after each ovulation was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). Sperm loss could also contribute to the low brood sizes observed in our <italic>pezo-</italic>1 mutants.</p><p>Ovulation rates were significantly reduced in <italic>pezo-1 CΔ</italic> Day 2 (post mid-L4 48 hr) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>), which is consistent with the reduced brood sizes that worsen in Day 2 animals. As the presence of sperm in the spermatheca is known to stimulate ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCarter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller, 2001</xref>), the reduction in sperm number could be responsible for this reduction in ovulation rate. Overall, the reduced brood size in <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants is probably due to a combination of defects in multiple tissues, resulting in defective ovulations, crushed oocytes, and defects in the ability of sperm to navigate back into the spermatheca after each ovulation.</p><p>To characterize the transit of oocytes through the spermatheca carefully, we performed live imaging to record the ovulation and fertilization process in both wildtype and <italic>pezo-1<sup>KO</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–E’</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>). The imaging began with the mature oocyte entering the spermatheca, labeled by the apical junction marker DLG-1::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). In wildtype animals, the contracting sheath cells push the oocyte into the spermatheca, and simultaneously pull the open spermatheca over the oocyte (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>). Once the oocyte enters the spermatheca, both spermatheca valves remain closed during fertilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Opening of the sp-ut valve allows the fertilized oocyte to be expelled into the uterus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). In <italic>pezo-</italic>1 mutants, many of the oocytes that did successfully enter the spermatheca were crushed when they exited through the sp-ut valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A′–E′</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>). We observed that the sp-ut valve, labeled by DLG-1::GFP, did not completely open when the oocyte attempted to exit the spermatheca, which may lead to crushing the oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C′–E′</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). The ooplasm from the crushed oocytes accumulated in the uterus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E’</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) as a large ooplasmic mass (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). During our analysis of the <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants, we frequently observed that oocytes partially entered the spermatheca but were then pinched off and broken into two pieces, one of which remained trapped in the oviduct (proximal gonad; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Moreover, some oocytes failed to enter the spermatheca and slid back into the oviduct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–M</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). The defective ovulation is probably due to incomplete constriction of the sheath cells. Overall, disrupted ovulation and oocyte transit defects were observed in <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants, consistent with the decreased brood size observed in all of our <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>PEZO-1 mutants exhibit severe ovulation defects.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) Ovulation in wildtype animals. (<bold>A, B</bold>) Ovulation is initiated by oocyte (yellow dotted circle) entry into the spermatheca, which was labelled by the apical junctional marker DLG-1::GFP (green).

IP<sub>3</sub> binding to ITR-1 releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER, which activates myosin for spermathecal contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouffard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clandinin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kovacevic et al., 2013</xref>).

To quantify statistically and to analyze the oocyte transit, we defined a series of parameters, including the dwell time and two calcium signaling metrics from the GCaMP3 time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouffard et al., 2019</xref>). A spermathecal tissue function metric, dwell time, is defined as the time from spermathecal distal valve closure to sp-ut valve opening, which represents the time during which the oocyte resides in the enclosed spermatheca. The calcium signaling metric, fraction over half max, is defined as the duration of the dwell time over the GCaMP3 half-maximal value divided by the total dwell time. The fraction over half max allows us to capture the relative level of calcium throughout the time during which the embryo passes through the spermatheca. Rising time indicates the time from the opening of the distal valve to the first time point at which the GCaMP fluorescent intensity reaches half maximum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouffard et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>pezo-1 CΔ</italic> mutants, longer transit times of the oocyte through the spermatheca resulted in elongated dwell times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>), suggesting that deletion of <italic>pezo-1</italic> resulted in disrupted tissue function. Surprisingly, GCaMP3 fluorescence in <italic>pezo-1</italic> was not significantly different from that in the wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L,M</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>; see 'Materials and methods'). GCaMP3 time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>), heat maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and kymograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>) also displayed normal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels during oocyte passage through the spermatheca in <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants. It should be noted that we only imaged the GCaMP3 reporter during the very first three ovulations in young adult animals to avoid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling interference from a distorted gonad morphology and mechanical pressure from a gravid uterus. Furthermore, it is difficult to monitor older <italic>pezo-1</italic> hermaphrodites as they do not ovulate on microscope slides. As only mild defects were observed in the <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants during these early ovulations and oocyte transit defects increased in severity over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), our data does not exclude the possibility that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling may be more severely disrupted as the animal goes through more ovulation cycles. Alternatively, the live imaging assay may not be sensitive enough to detect subtle variations in calcium signaling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>PEZO-1 mutants show normal GCaMP3 fluorescence during ovulation.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) mScarlet::PEZO-1 colocalizes with GCaMP3, which is driven by a spermatheca-specific promoter. These images represent the third ovulation for this spermatheca.

Given that PEZO-1 is expressed in these tissues, it is plausible that oocyte transit defects and reduced brood sizes are the result of impaired inter-tissue signaling, which may be mediated by PEZO-1. To investigate how this may occur, bidirectional signaling between sperm and oocytes was first tested. To test for the ability of sperm to fertilize oocytes, both wildtype and <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutant males were mated with <italic>fem-1(hc17)</italic> hermaphrodites, which do not produce any sperm or self-progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doniach and Hodgkin, 1984</xref>) and are essentially females. The <italic>fem-1(hc17)</italic> animals produced cross-progeny after mating with <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutant males, indicating that the <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutant males are fertile and that their sperm can crawl through the uterus to the spermatheca upon mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutant hermaphrodites do not produce any self-progeny after Day 3 (60 hours post mid-L4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), we tested whether mating with either wildtype or mutant males would result in any cross progeny in the aged <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants. <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutant hermaphrodites resumed ovulation and fertilization upon mating once the male’s sperm (from either wildtype or <italic>pezo-1</italic> males) reached the spermatheca (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>). To test whether sperm signaling was defective in inducing ovulation in <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants, we mated both <italic>spe-9(hc52ts)</italic> and control <italic>him-8(e1489)</italic> males with both wildtype and <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutant hermaphrodites. <italic>spe-9(hc52ts)</italic> male sperm can physically contact the oocytes but fail to fertilize them, although the sperm signaling is apparently normal and triggers ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singson et al., 1998</xref>).

An additional experiment was performed to test the ability of the sheath to respond to the sperm signal that triggers ovulation. Even though our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> suggest that just the presence of sperm can trigger ovulation, we went on to show that purified MSP-fluorescein can also trigger ovulation in older <italic>pezo-1 C∆</italic> hermaphrodites that are depleted of sperm and are no longer ovulating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–H</xref>).

This is a very efficient mechanism, such that almost every self-sperm in a hermaphrodite is used to fertilize an oocyte. It is sperm number that defines brood size; oocytes are in excess. Oocytes secrete F-series prostaglandins derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to guide sperm to the spermatheca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kubagawa et al., 2006</xref>). To test whether <italic>pezo-1</italic> hermaphrodites fail to attract the sperm back to the spermatheca, male sperm navigational performance was assessed in vivo by staining males with a vital fluorescent dye, MitoTracker CMXRos, which efficiently stains sperm in live animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whitten and Miller, 2007</xref>). Both wildtype and <italic>pezo-1 CΔ</italic> stained males were mated to non-labeled wildtype hermaphrodites for 30 min. The sperm distribution was assessed and quantified by dividing the uterus into three zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and counting the number of fluorescent sperm in each zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McKnight et al., 2014</xref>) one hour after males were removed from the mating plates. In wildtype hermaphrodites, most fluorescent sperm from both wildtype and <italic>pezo-1 CΔ</italic> males navigated through the uterus and accumulated in the spermatheca (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C,F,G</xref>). However, fewer fluorescent male sperm reached the spermatheca in Day 3 adult <italic>pezo-1 CΔ</italic> hermaphrodites, and most sperm remained throughout zones 1 and zone 2, the zones furthest from the spermatheca (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E,H,I</xref>).

However, in <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutant hermaphrodite reproductive tracts, both wildtype and <italic>pezo-</italic>1 mutant sperm were compromised in their navigational behavior over the time frame of this experiment. Although it remains possible that the ooplasmic masses that accumulate in the uterus of <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutant hermaphrodites could physically interfere with the migration of wildtype and <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutant sperm back to the spermatheca, our labeled sperm experiments with female <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants (see below) suggest that this is not a likely explanation.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Sperm guidance and navigation is disrupted in <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) To quantify sperm migration, this illustration indicates the three zones that were scored for sperm distribution. Zone 3 is the spermatheca region and the space containing the +1 fertilized embryo (yellow dotted circles in panels (B, <bold>D, F, H</bold>), whereas Zone 1 is the area closest to the vulva.

This strain was crossed with the strains expressing tir-1::mRuby driven by the three different promoters described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B–B′′</xref>; D–D′′, F–F′′).

To ensure efficient degradation, we exposed animals to auxin for one generation and analyzed the brood size of their F<sub>1</sub> progeny. This longer auxin exposure did not significantly enhance the reduction in brood size (data not shown).</p><p>Depletion of PEZO-1 in the somatic tissues, including spermathecal and sheath cells, led to a variety of ovulation defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3A–I</xref>). Pinched oocytes were frequently observed during ovulation (N = 9/27, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3I</xref>). A fraction of the pinched oocytes entered the spermatheca, whereas the rest were left in the oviduct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3C,D,I</xref>). Surprisingly, most of the pinched oocytes were successfully expelled into the uterus and underwent embryogenesis as smaller embryos (data not shown). In addition, the process of oocyte entry into the spermatheca was frequently delayed or blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3E–I</xref>), suggesting that the distal spermathecal valve remained closed. In experiments in which wildtype sperm were in vivo labeled as described earlier, and mated into control and somatic-specific PEZO-1::Degron hermaphrodites, nearly 90% of the labeled sperm reached the spermatheca (zone 3) and only a few labeled sperm were observed in the uterus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G,H,K</xref>). Notably, the ooplasmic uterine masses that we observed in our <italic>pezo-1<sup>ko</sup></italic> mutants were rarely observed in the somatic-specific degron strain.</p><p>Consistent with our male mating experiments, only 69% of the MitoTracker-labelled wildtype sperm accumulated at the spermatheca (zone 3) in the germline-specific PEZO-1::Degron animals exposed to auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–K</xref>). The remaining sperm were observed throughout the whole uterus (zones 1 and 2) after one hour of mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I,J</xref>). Crushed oocytes were rarely observed in the uterus of the germline-specific PEZO-1::Degron animals, in which the sperm distribution assay was performed. Therefore, the degradation of PEZO-1 in the germ line did not cause the severe uterine ooplasmic masses as we have observed for our <italic>pezo-1<sup>ko</sup></italic> mutants but it did interfere with sperm navigation to the spermatheca, suggesting impaired attractant signaling. This is a more likely explanation as uterine ooplasmic masses are not a physical impediment that could account for the defects in sperm migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Modeling human PIEZO genetic diseases in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p><italic>PIEZO</italic> patient-specific alleles, which are known to disrupt the normal physiological functioning of the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and blood systems in humans, were the motivation for examining the role of <italic>pezo-1</italic> in the tubular structures of <italic>C. elegans.</italic> Our studies with null alleles of <italic>pezo-1</italic> provide strong evidence that <italic>pezo-1</italic> is essential for normal <italic>C. elegans</italic> reproduction.

Most studies of PIEZOs have focused on electrophysiological assays in cultured cells. To take advantage of an in vivo system to investigate the developmental roles of the PIEZO channel in mechanotransduction, we generated deletion alleles as well as a patient-specific allele in the sole <italic>C. elegans pezo-1</italic> gene. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> reproductive system is an tubular system that is attractive for studies of <italic>PIEZO</italic> function and for mimicking the <italic>PIEZO</italic> patient-specific alleles, which are known to disrupt the normal physiological functioning of the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and blood systems in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albuisson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alper, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andolfo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2013</xref>). Although the PEZO-1 protein is broadly expressed throughout the animal, we focused on the reproductive system because of its striking phenotypes. Utilizing different <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants and the tissue-specific degradation of PEZO-1, our data indicate that dysfunction of <italic>pezo-1</italic> led to a significantly reduced brood size. This reduced brood size phenotype worsens with age. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the reproductive process incorporates a series of sequential events, including proper ovulation, fertilization, expulsion of the fertilized zygote into the uterus, and sperm navigation back to the spermatheca after each fertilization event, all of which are regulated by multiple inter-tissue signaling pathways.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>PEZO-1 channel regulates ovulation and expulsion of the fertilized zygote possibly by maintaining cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis</title><p>Ovulation is driven by the rhythmic and coordinated contraction of the gonadal sheath cells and the opening of the spermathecal distal valve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCarter et al., 1999</xref>). Similarly, expulsion of the fertilized zygote into the uterus is achieved by the contraction of the spermatheca and the opening of the spermathecal-uterine valve. Mutations in the <italic>pezo-1</italic> gene cause dramatic effects on this entire process. We observed sheath cell defects such that the mature oocyte was not properly pushed into the spermatheca. In addition, spermathecal valve defects either inhibited proper entry of the oocyte into the spermatheca, or proper exit. In many cases, the oocyte was crushed as it progressed through the spermatheca, resulting in accumulation of ooplasm in the uterus. Genetic interactions between <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants and <italic>itr-1</italic> or <italic>lfe-2</italic> RNAi support the idea that <italic>pezo-1</italic> may play a role in maintaining Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during ovulation and zygote expulsion from the spermatheca. This is consistent with previous studies showing PIEZO1 responses to mechanical stimuli through Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of the present studies, we hypothesize a few possible pathways for a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated response to mechanical stimuli to which PEZO-1 may contribute. One possibility is that PEZO-1 may detect when cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are extremely low and might replenish the cell with extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in a manner similar to that involving the CRAC channel ORAI-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lorin-Nebel et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with this idea, our genetic data revealed an enhancement of the <italic>pezo-1</italic> phenotype upon CRAC channel<italic> orai-1</italic> RNAi, which is responsible for replenishing cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggests that PEZO-1 and ORAI-1 act in parallel pathways to replenish cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. </p><p>Previous studies identified the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA) as an interacting partner of PIEZO1, which suppresses PIEZO1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). SERCA is essential for recycling Ca<sup>2+</sup> into SR/ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, which is an important process for maintaining Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during tissue contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Periasamy and Huke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zwaal et al., 2001</xref>). PIEZO1 has been reported to be involved in integrin activation to recruit the small GTPase R-Ras to the ER, which promotes Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from an intracellular store to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McHugh et al., 2010</xref>).

Future studies will be required to resolve the precise molecular effect of PEZO-1 on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and to understand how PEZO-1 regulates inter/intra cellular communication with/without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and potentially how other interacting partners coordinate during these processes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PEZO-1 channel is required for sperm navigation</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> employs multiple peptide and lipophilic hormones to coordinate different tissues during reproduction. Ovulation is initiated by MSP (major sperm proteins) signaling derived from sperm to trigger oocyte maturation and sheath cell contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuwabara, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCarter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller, 2001</xref>).

Our observations revealed a strong expression of PEZO-1 on the plasma membranes of both oocytes and sperm.

Male mating significantly rescued the very low ovulation rate in <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants, as did the injection of purified fluorescently tagged MSP. Furthermore, the sperm navigation defects were observed in the germline-specific degradation of PEZO-1 animals, which showed fewer sperm successfully navigating back to the spermatheca. Collectively, depletion of PEZO-1 disrupted the ability of sperm to navigate back to the spermatheca, which may contribute to the reduced ovulation rate and defective sheath cell contraction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Working model</title><p>Our study supports the working model that PEZO-1 functions to promote the sheath cell contractions that push the oocyte into the spermatheca as the first step in ovulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, step 1). Simultaneously, PEZO-1 may play a role in sensing the sheath cell contractions and in triggering the spermathecal distal valve to open to allow oocyte entry into the spermatheca. During fertilization, the distal and spermathecal-uterine valves have to remain closed, which is probably influenced by PEZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, step 2). After fertilization, PEZO-1 regulates the spermathecal tissues and controls the sp-ut valve to trigger a series of events to expel the fertilized oocyte into the uterus. Last, PEZO-1 appears to function in the attraction of the sperm back into the spermatheca after being pushed out by the exiting of the newly fertilized oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, step 3). Thus, dysfunction of PEZO-1 may contribute to multiple defects in all of these steps, including failure of oocyte entry into the spermatheca, the crushing of oocytes as they transit through the ovary and spermatheca, and defective sheath-to-sperm signaling that perturbs the ability of sperm to crawl back into the spermatheca after each ovulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Future studies are underway to determine the PEZO-1 function in each tissue (sheath, spermatheca, oocyte, and sperm) more precisely using even more cell-specific promoters in the AID degradation system.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Working model for PEZO-1 during ovulation.</title><p>Step One: PEZO-1 regulates somatic sheath cells and the spermathecal distal valve to push the oocyte into the spermatheca. Once a matured oocyte is ready for ovulation, PEZO-1 (red trapezoids) on the somatic sheath cells (yellow) triggers the contraction of the sheath to push the oocyte into the dilating spermatheca, through the distal valve. Meanwhile, the activated PEZO-1 (red trapezoids) on the distal valve (yellow) keeps the valve open and allows oocyte entry the spermatheca (green). Step Two: during fertilization, the PEZO-1 (red trapezoids) coordinates both distal (yellow) and spermathecal-uterine valves (yellow) to remain closed for 3–5 min. Step Three: After fertilization, PEZO-1 (red trapezoids) is activated on the spermathecal bag cells (yellow) and the sp-ut valve (yellow) to trigger a series of mechanical events (including spermathecal contractions and sp-ut valve opening) to expel the fertilized oocyte into the uterus (green). After oocyte entry into the uterus, we speculate that the PEZO-1 (red trapezoids) on the oocyte (far left) also functions to attract the sperm (green cells) back to the spermatheca. The precise mechanism of how PEZO-1 regulates sperm attraction remains unknown. Dysfunction of PEZO-1 causes the oocytes to be crushed as they are pushed into (Step 1) and expelled from the spermatheca (Step 3).

In summary, we have demonstrated that the <italic>C. elegans PIEZO1/2</italic> ortholog <italic>pezo-1</italic> is required for efficient reproduction, and demonstrate the utility of <italic>C. elegans</italic> for the study of PIEZO functions. Future studies will determine whether other patient-specific alleles disrupt ovulation and sperm navigational signaling. Using promoters with more restricted expression patterns, the tissue-specific degradation system used in this report will also allow us to further dissect the cells or tissues that influence each of the phenotypes that we observed in this study. Future genetic and FDA-approved drugs screens will be used to identify putative suppressors in <italic>pezo-1</italic> mutants. These screens may provide insightful approaches for future clinical therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains used in this study</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were maintained with standard protocols.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Diana S Chu as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Because the overall set of data do not directly support that PIEZO in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a calcium regulator, the authors should revise the manuscript, particularly many of the conclusions reached, to less strongly advocate that their data supports a role for this <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog in calcium signaling.

Reviewers felt that these issues should not warrant significant new experimental analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript describes the characterization of the function of PEZO-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. PEZO-1 is the homolog of PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 in humans, which are mechano-sensitive channel proteins. The authors generate GFP-tagged versions of PEZO-1 to show that it is expressed broadly in many cell types, including reproductive tissues. They examine knock-out mutants of pezo-1 and find severe defects in fertility. They find that loss of pezo-1 causes oocytes to be crushed during the processes of ovulation, fertilization, and expulsion to the uterus. They further show that defective sperm navigation may also contribute to fertility defects. The authors have evidence that PEZO-1 works through calcium signaling – mutation in pezo-1 shows synergistic defects when combined with reduction of calcium signaling regulators, but calcium signaling itself was not different in their assays. Both tissue-specific knock-down of <italic>C. elegans</italic> pezo-1 and introduction of PIEZO patient-specific alleles in <italic>C. elegans</italic> also lead to fertility defects.</p><p>The work is interesting and novel. This is the first characterization of PIEZO function in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where it is possible to use a variety of approaches to assess PIEZO function in a model organism. The high-quality data obtained through a combination of genetic knock-downs and AID degradation, in vivo imaging of tagged proteins, fertility assays, and calcium imaging is a strength of the work. Though PIEZO proteins are known to be important for mechanosensory transduction in several contexts in other systems, including humans and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this is also the first demonstration that PEZO-1 is important for fertility, in particular, the production of germ cells that requires an orchestration of movements. In particular, the 'crushed oocyte' phenotype is quite striking. Their demonstration that PIEZO patient-specific alleles also result in fertility defects links the <italic>C. elegans</italic> work to understanding human disease and show that there is potential to use this system in the future to further dissect PIEZO function in developmental contexts in a tractable system. Because of these numerous strengths, I would recommend publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>There are a few revisions that are required. One modest concern which is that the role of PEZO-1 in mechanical signal transduction is still not described in a concrete way. Of course, this is partially due to the obviously complicated nature of the fertility process that is affected. There are multiple points at which the mechano-sensation and transduction may be affected that result in the major phenotype of oocyte crushing. This could be improved by revising Figure 10. Instead of highlighting 'PEZO-1 Dysfunction' it would be clearer for the authors to highlight where they think PEZO-1 IS functioning. This could be done by either by adding a clear point at each step that describes that function or retitling each step to better highlight PEZO-1. The model as is now (in the text and figure) is more a reiteration of results and not so much a model for how and where PEZO-1 may be 'sensing' or 'responding' to mechanical stress. It is actually interesting that the phenotype is complicated because PIEZO proteins in other organisms may also have likewise complex roles.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper explores for the first time the role of the piezo-1/2 ortholog in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, pezo-1, and it identifies a critical function in retaining sperm in the spermatheca. In the absence of pezo-1 sperm are quickly depleted from the spermatheca and as a consequence embryo production is halted and oocyte crushing begins on both ends of the spermatheca. The quality of the work is high and its results are novel and of broad interest. However, the paper suffers from several problems that must be rectified before publication. Likely because piezo-1/2 are known to be mechanosensing calcium channels, the authors probably started this project with the hypothesis that pezo-1 functions as a mechanosensitive calcium channel. However, nature being as it is, in the end they don't have any evidence for such a function. That in itself is not a problem. What is problematic in my view is that in writing the paper they nevertheless continue to push a narrative of pezo-1 regulating calcium in the reproductive system, despite there not being any evidence for this. The second problem I have as a reviewer with the current paper is that the interpretation of many of the experiments is taken too far and it is done in the Results section, which could lead a reader to confuse speculations (or wishful thinking) for actual results. The defect in pezo-1 mutants that can explain all of the observed phenotypes is the rapid depletion of sperm from the spermatheca because they fail to return after being washed out with embryos exiting into the uterus. The mating experiments and somatic or germline specific AID experiments were supposed to clarify whether the sperm navigation defect is due to lack of pezo-1 activity in the sperm or in the somatic gonad. Unfortunately, the data presented is contradictory (or perhaps only not explained well) because after reading and rereading the paper I still can't figure out if pezo-1 is required in the sperm or in the gonad or both. Once the authors clarify this point, remove experiments that don't lead to a conclusion (inx-14/22, YP170::tdimer2), remove overinterpretation statements from the Results section, and add missing controls for some experiments (Yoda1, AID) as detailed in my comments below, I believe the paper will be worthy of publication in e<italic>Life</italic>.</p><p>1) In multiple places the authors jump to conclusions based on associative evidence such as localization or genetic interaction. For example: &quot;Notably, PEZO-1 is strongly expressed in several tubular tissues, including the pharyngeal-intestinal and spermathecal-uterine valves, which is consistent with our hypothesis that pezo-1 may be responsible for mechanoperception in these tissues.&quot; And: &quot;Consistent with the hypothesis that reproductive tissues are regulated by mechanosensitive stimuli in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, expression of PEZO-1 likely functions to sense physical strain or contractility during ovulation and fertilization.&quot; – such sentences push a narrative of pezo-1 function in mechanoperception without any support in the data. Speculations and interpretations belong in the discussion. The result section should present the results without biasing the reader to a single interpretation.</p><p>2) &quot;Partial co-localization of PEZO-1 with the ER marker SP12::GFP suggested that PEZO-1 may be processed in the ER and transported to the plasma membrane (Figure 1E).&quot; – based on the image in Figure 1E the localization of SP12 and PEZO-1 is complementary and primarily non-overlapping. If the authors have reason to believe there is substantial co-localization they need to show and quantify it. In any case, it isn't clear why this is an important point to focus on. If the authors think the location of function of PEZO-1 is the plasma membrane then why not just focus on that localization?</p><p>3) &quot;The genome-edited animals behaved normally, suggesting no functional disruption of tagging PEZO-1 with these fluorescent reporter genes.&quot; – This statement is questionable in light of what is visible in Figure 1F, where there is an accumulation of small oocyte pieces or vesicles or something else that looks abnormal between the -1 oocyte and spermatheca.</p><p>4) &quot;The fluorescent signal of GFP::PEZO-1 is observed in both spermathecal valves until the valves open, suggesting that PEZO-1 may function to sense the mechanical stimuli at the valves during ovulation&quot; – since the fluorescent protein is at the membrane it is expected to give a higher signal when the tissue is contracted compared to when it is dilated. The change in fluorescence intensity observed in the GFP::PEZO-1 movie on its own is not an indication of any mechanosensing. If the authors wish to claim enrichment in the valve at a certain time point they would need to do a ratiometric comparison with a membrane marker such as PH::mCherry.</p><p>5) &quot;To mimic a gain-of-function phenotype in pezo-1, we fed wildtype animals with Yoda1, a PIEZO1 specific chemical agonist, which keeps the channel open&quot; – No control was performed to show that Yoda1 doesn't have side effects in worms. There are plenty of chemicals that are supposedly specific but actually are not. A simple experiment that could at least show Yoda1's phenotype is PEZO-1-dependent is to perform the treatment on pezo-1KO, which we expect to be refractory to the drug and display the same brood size as pezo-1KO on its own.</p><p>6) &quot;The defective ovulation is likely due to incomplete constriction of the sheath cells and improper gating of the distal spermathecal valve.&quot; – Incomplete constriction of the sheath is sufficient to explain the entry phenotype and it is not necessary to invoke improper gating of the distal spermathecal valve, which was not specifically tested. Moreover, improper sheath contraction is consistent with the absence of sperm, while distal valve defects are not.</p><p>7) &quot;Of the oocytes that did successfully enter the spermatheca, many were frequently crushed when they exited through the sp-ut valve (Figure 3A'-E', Video 2-3). We observed that the sp-ut valve, labeled by DLG-1::GFP, did not completely open when the oocyte attempted to exit the spermatheca, which may lead to crushing the oocyte&quot; – again, a defect in the sp-ut valve is not necessary to explain the phenotype because oocytes are not normally meant to pass through the sp-ut valve and the egg shell normally protects the exiting embryo.</p><p>8) Knocking down the positive calcium regulators itr-1, sca-1, and orai-1 by RNAi enhanced the pezo-1 null phenotype and knocking down the negative calcium regulator lfe-1 partially rescued the null phenotype. Based on these findings the authors write: &quot;Therefore, these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that pezo-1 may regulate cytosolic and ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, which is crucial for proper spermathecal contractility and dilation.&quot; – However, there is no direct evidence in the paper to support the hypothesis that pezo-1 is controlling calcium levels in the reproductive system. Furthermore, in the following section the authors observe and measure directly calcium signaling in the spermatheca and observe no defects. It appears that the authors approached this project with a strong preconception of what pezo-1 is doing (based on literature in other systems) and do not allow the observations to lead to the most plausible explanations.</p><p>9) &quot;Surprisingly, GCaMP3 fluorescence in pezo-1 was not significantly different than wildtype&quot; – to me this is not surprising, since the phenotype looks like a problem with sheath contraction due to absence of sperm. Perhaps if the authors imaged GCaMP3 in the sheath they would see a lower signal in the mutant, but that could also be because of the absence of sperm and not a direct role of pezo-1 in calcium release.</p><p>10) &quot;It should be noted that we only imaged the GCaMP3 reporter during the very first three ovulations in young adult animals to avoid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling interference from a distorted gonad morphology and mechanical pressure from a gravid uterus… our data does not exclude the possibility that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling may be more severely disrupted as the animal goes through more ovulation cycles.” – despite the technical difficulties, the authors could image older worms in order to rule out or prove that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling may be disrupted in the spermatheca.</p><p>11) I'm confused about the data regarding sperm navigation to the spermatheca. In subsection Sperm from matings rescues low brood size phenotype in pezo-1 mutants it is shown that pezo-1 mutant hermaphrodites resumed ovulation and fertilization upon mating once the male's sperm (from either wildtype, spe-9(hc52ts), or pezo-1 males) reached the spermatheca. From this we can conclude that pezo-1 spermatheca have no problem to attract sperm. (the same conclusion is also drawn from the AID experiment in which pezo-1 is degraded in the somatic tissues and rescued by mating with wt male sperm). However, in subsection Sperm guidance and navigation is disrupted in pezo-1 mutants it is shown that in pezo-1 hermaphrodites few sperm reach the spermatheca after mating and most sperm remained in zones furthest from the spermatheca. This was observed for both wildtype and pezo-1 mutant male sperm in mating with pezo-1 hermaphrodites. To me, these two results are contradictory, and the authors must clarify this point. Are pezo-1 hermaphrodites defective in attracting sperm to the spermatheca? And if so, how can mating rescue their phenotype?</p><p>12) Auxin Induced Degradation is performed by tagging pezo-1 with the degron sequence and crossing with tir-1::mRuby expressing worms. However, the authors don't show any data regarding the efficacy of the degradation. Since the protein is membranal, it is expected that ubiquitination of the degron might not lead immediately to degradation. If the authors labelled the fluorescently-tagged versions of pezo-1 they could quantify the degradation by measuring fluorescence. Another option would be to perform a Western blot, if they have an antibody that recognizes pezo-1. Without such controls it is hard to draw a conclusion from the AID experiments because we don't know how much of the protein was actually degraded in either the germline or somatic tissues. Is the reason for the weaker phenotype compared to the KO the tissue specificity or residual protein?</p><p>13) Figure 8 panels H-L – the text describing these results is not clear and the labeling of two of the images must be wrong because they are all labelled with Ppie-1::tir-1::mRuby but in the graph two bars are labelled with Peft-3. In the text it is hard to follow in which case auxin was added, what the promoter was and what the result was. From the text I understood that there was a sperm navigation defect when pezo-1 was degraded in the somatic tissues, but from the graph it appears the sperm navigation defect was only observed when pezo-1 was degraded in the germline.</p><p>14) The rationale behind the experiments with inx-14 and inx-22 is not clear and I disagree with the authors conclusion that &quot;the enhancement of phenotypes with these innexins suggests that PEZO-1 may be involved in regulating inter-tissue signaling.&quot;. In my view this is a sick + sick = sicker scenario and without further experiments to directly tie pezo-1 to inter-tissue signaling the authors cannot make such claims.</p><p>15) Similarly, the observation of yolk accumulation in the pseudocoelomic cavity surrounding the gonad of the pezo-1 mutants is an intriguing observation that could be developed with further experiments (in a future manuscript), but on its own does not warrant a place in this paper. The suggesting that yolk endocytosis into the oocytes is defective and that the reduced endocytosis of yolk may disrupt prostaglandin synthesis in the oocyte, which may lead to a defect in the oocytes' ability to attract sperm towards the spermatheca is super speculative and does not belong in the Results section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>General assessment: This paper describes a functional analysis of pezo-1, the sole PIEZO channel ortholog in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. PIEZO channels are involved in mechanotransduction in a variety of systems and contexts. Here, several mutations are created and analyzed including deletions, an early stop, and gain-of-function mutations associated with human disease. pezo-1 is widely expressed in different worm tissues, notably reproductive tissues including both somatic and germline, and disruption of pezo-1 leads to fecundity defects. Assays for reproductive processes implicate defects in ovulation and sperm targeting that likely lead to this decreased fertility. While calcium signaling appears normal, mutations in genes involved in calcium signaling enhance pezo-1 as does certain disruptions of gonadal signaling. Tissue-specific rescue experiments and auxin-induced degradation are used to analyze the focus of action of pezo-1 in different reproductive processes. This paper covers a lot of ground: analysis of several distinct phenotypes in pezo-1 mutants, calcium imaging, genetic interactions, interrogation of disease alleles, and use of the relatively new auxin-induced degradation system to assess tissue specific effects. Overall, the experiments fit together well and make a coherent story.</p><p>While I have extensive comments, my major specific questions and concerns are about the following, described in more detail below (*):</p><p>1) Description and interpretation of experiments involving spe-9</p><p>2) Controls for the experiment shown in Figure 6E</p><p>3) Compared to other experiments, the inx genetic interaction experiments are relatively uninformative, and I suggest toning down the interpretation of the results. I agree that pezo-1 appears to be required for &quot;inter-tissue signaling&quot; but it is not clear how many cases are direct.</p><p>4) Auxin experiment controls</p><p>5) Details of sperm navigation experiments</p><p>Comments:</p><p>Re: Widespread expression of PEZO-1:</p><p>Multiple reporter knock-ins are used to examine where PEZO-1 is expressed. Images in Figures 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 clearly show that PEZO-1 is expressed in several tissues including germ line. However, whether different transgenes showed consistent expression patterns should be stated. A schematic of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad would help non-experts interpret the images and some added labeling would be useful.</p><p>In particular:</p><p>In Figure 1B, label intestine</p><p>For Figure 1F, additional description and labeling is needed for context. Does the lower right of the panel show developing sperm, developing oocytes, or something else?</p><p>For 1G, label both oocytes and the central structure (intestine?).</p><p>For 1J, indicate the sheath cells with an arrow.</p><p>Re Figure 1—figure supplement 1D: Why are both &quot;GFP&quot; and mScarlet shown in this image; and what structures is GFP associated with?</p><p>Subsection “PEZO-1 is expressed in multiple tissues throughout development”. This section, especially the statement &quot;GFP::PEZO-1 is expressed in both spermathecal valves until the valves open&quot; might be read to indicate that PEZO-1 localization changes during valve opening or other events of ovulation. Was this observed? This should be clarified, and any data indicating change in localization would need to be pointed out.</p><p>Re: Deletion of pezo-1 reduces brood size</p><p>These data show several different deletion/ putative loss of function alleles of pezo-1 were generated and give similar – though different strength – phenotypes of reduced fecundity and embryonic inviability. The fecundity defect worsens with age of the hermaphrodite. Treatment with a PIEZO agonist causes a phenotype similar to that of deletion alleles. It is notable that both lof and gof cause similar phenotypes. How do the authors interpret this effect? Is it consistent with other studies of PIEZO activity in other systems and the known mechanisms of action of these channels?</p><p>Since treatment with either of two different concentrations of the agonist yields similar effects, it does not seem necessary to show both concentrations. If a wider range of concentrations was tested and gave dose-dependent effects, this could be informative. Some deletion mutants might have a different dose-response curve than the wild type.</p><p>It seems like more could be done to take advantage of this pharmacological tool, though this is not necessary.</p><p>Re: severe ovulation defects</p><p>Live observations of ovulation reveal defects in sheath contractions and valve opening that move the oocyte/embryo forward through the gonad.</p><p>These data are convincing, though it would make sense to group the observations about oocyte crushing, oocytic masses, etc. from the previous section of the results with this section – or to simply combine the two sections into one.</p><p>Re: PEZO-1 mutants genetically interact with cytosolic Ca++ regulators/ show normal calcium signaling during ovulation</p><p>While most of the ms is nicely written, this section is hard to follow.</p><p>*In this reviewer's opinion, the term &quot;genetically interact&quot; can be problematic since it is neither precise for geneticists nor very accessible to non-geneticists. Even though calcium imaging appears normal in the pezo mutant, these experiments establish a potential link between the mechanisms of PEZO-1 and canonical PIEZO channels. It would be clearer for most readers to frame them in terms of manipulating Ca and avoid terms like positive or negative genetic interactions or phrases like &quot;enhancing the reduction of brood size&quot;. This is especially important because these are such interesting experiments.</p><p>Brood size data are presented as scatterplots with separate counts of early progeny and later progeny. For most of the analysis, it is unclear why splitting the data in this manner is necessary. In many cases, it makes it more difficult for a reader to compare the phenotypes of different strains, e.g. for comparing pezo-1 alleles and in the genetic interaction experiments.</p><p>In addition, the wild-type brood sizes are surprisingly variable. Does the variability decrease if full brood sizes are considered? One explanation for this could be variability in staging L4s. In turn, this raises the question of whether splitting the data is the most accurate way to show brood sizes (at least in cases where progeny are abundant at both time points – when essentially all offspring are produced early, splitting the data is indeed helpful).</p><p>Overall, it seems worth considering 1- if the data could be presented in a simpler format for some experiments and 2- if the format is not revised, if the full brood counts should be included in the supplemental data.</p><p>Re: Sperm from matings rescues pezo-1 low brood size</p><p>The experiments here show the result that pezo-1 does not appear to be required in sperm and sperm defects are not responsible for pezo-1 reproductive phenotypes.</p><p>-pezo-1 males are fully fertile in crosses to fem-1 females, indicating their sperm are functional for migration and fertilization. This is convincing.</p><p>-Crossing males to sperm-depleted pezo-1 hermaphrodites induces resumption of offspring production, indicating pezo-1 is not required for the sperm-to-ovulation signal. This is also convincing.</p><p>The authors show that signaling from oocyte to sperm, needed for navigation, is disrupted; both wild-type and pezo-1 sperm have localization defects within pezo-1 hermaphrodites. However, there do not appear to be defects in the signaling from sperm to oocytes/sheath cells that increases ovulation rate. When sperm are depleted, ovulation rate is low, but re-introduction of sperm is sufficient to induce ovulation. Furthermore, pezo-1 sperm introduced into females do fertilize oocytes, implying they are functional for migration, fertilization, and induction of ovulation.</p><p>*The way experiments in this section are presented is misleading. Based on the title, I expected to see results that pezo-1 reproductive defects are due to their sperm. The presentation of the spe-9 experiment, as a test of &quot;whether sperm signaling was defective&quot; as well as the description of the result, further imply a sperm-based defect.</p><p>Ultimately, the spe-9 result is not surprising. spe-9 sperm are known to signal ovulation in wild type, and it is expected that re-introduction of sperm into a depleted hermaphrodite would increase ovulation rate if oocytes can respond to MSP. The data here are fine but the text should be revised for clarity and accessibility. This also applies in the Abstract and spe-9 experiments done with disease alleles.</p><p>The authors do not comment on quantitative differences between crosses into wild-type hermaphrodites and into pezo-1 hermaphrodites, and statistics are only presented for non-mated herm vs various mated conditions. Have the authors considered these comparisons?</p><p>*To interpret 6E, additional controls are needed in which wild-type male sperm are supplied and ovulation rates are measured.</p><p>Direct measurement of ovulation rate – as shown in Figure 6E for spe-9 – would be a more direct assay for induction of ovulation by introduced sperm.</p><p>An n of 4-6 seems very low for these experiments.</p><p>*Re: Sperm navigation is disrupted</p><p>– Does zone 3 include only the spermatheca, as described in the text, or the spermatheca and adjacent region of the uterus, as shown in Figure 7 (and as it is usually defined in publications from the Miller lab and others)? Please clarify the text.</p><p>– Were sperm counted in a single focal plane, or throughout the gonad?</p><p>– It is unclear why 72 hr adult hermaphrodites were used for these experiments; younger animals are more typically assayed. What is the rationale for this?</p><p>– The images in Figure 7 show 72 hr adults; the quantification is with 60 hr adults. While it might seem unlikely, this difference could matter. At 60 hours, there is likely to be some hermaphrodite sperm remaining, at least in wild type, while at 72 hr sperm are more likely to be depleted, which would presumably alter the signaling environment. Related to this concern, there appear to be quite a few sperm in zones 2 and 3 in panel G. The data in 7H suggests fewer sperm should be visible in zone 3.</p><p>– There is a mismatch between the callouts and labels for the image panels in Figure 7. According to the text, 7B,D,F should show wild-type hermaphrodites; according to labels, this is B,D,E.</p><p>– The order of image panels in Figure 7 is confusing, in part because some crosses are not shown. One could add the two &quot;missing&quot; combinations (pezo-1 x WT and WT x pezo, zone 1-2). Alternatively, 7B and 7F could be moved to supplementary data or not shown.</p><p>– In 7H: Are the data from one replicate, so that the error bars reflect worm-to-worm variability, or are the data from the 3 repeats, so the error bars reflect differences among the average distribution in each experiment?</p><p>– For indicating p values in 7H, brackets should be used to show what is being compared. Presumably. the current comparisons are 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4; comparing the same male sperm in 2 different hermaphrodites. It would be interesting to add statistical comparisons for 1 vs 3, 2 vs 4, i.e. comparing different male sperm in the same hermaphrodites.</p><p>Re: Auxin experiments</p><p>– The use of auxin induced degradation to disrupt function is a nice way to try to examine tissue-specific effects.</p><p>*– Data presented in 8E,F,G show the different degron strains either untreated or treated with auxin.

PEZO-1 is the homolog of PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 in humans, which are mechano-sensitive channel proteins. The authors generate GFP-tagged versions of PEZO-1 to show that it is expressed broadly in many cell types, including reproductive tissues. They examine knock-out mutants of pezo-1 and find severe defects in fertility. They find that loss of pezo-1 causes oocytes to be crushed during the processes of ovulation, fertilization, and expulsion to the uterus. They further show that defective sperm navigation may also contribute to fertility defects. The authors have evidence that PEZO-1 works through calcium signaling – mutation in pezo-1 shows synergistic defects when combined with reduction of calcium signaling regulators, but calcium signaling itself was not different in their assays. Both tissue-specific knock-down of <italic>C. elegans</italic> pezo-1 and introduction of PIEZO patient-specific alleles in <italic>C. elegans</italic> also lead to fertility defects.</p><p>The work is interesting and novel. This is the first characterization of PIEZO function in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where it is possible to use a variety of approaches to assess PIEZO function in a model organism. The high-quality data obtained through a combination of genetic knock-downs and AID degradation, in vivo imaging of tagged proteins, fertility assays, and calcium imaging is a strength of the work. Though PIEZO proteins are known to be important for mechanosensory transduction in several contexts in other systems, including humans and Drosophila, this is also the first demonstration that PEZO-1 is important for fertility, in particular, the production of germ cells that requires an orchestration of movements. In particular, the 'crushed oocyte' phenotype is quite striking. Their demonstration that PIEZO patient-specific alleles also result in fertility defects links the <italic>C. elegans</italic> work to understanding human disease and show that there is potential to use this system in the future to further dissect PIEZO function in developmental contexts in a tractable system. Because of these numerous strengths, I would recommend publication in eLife.</p><p>There are a few revisions that are required. One modest concern which is that the role of PEZO-1 in mechanical signal transduction is still not described in a concrete way. Of course, this is partially due to the obviously complicated nature of the fertility process that is affected. There are multiple points at which the mechano-sensation and transduction may be affected that result in the major phenotype of oocyte crushing. This could be improved by revising Figure 10. Instead of highlighting 'PEZO-1 Dysfunction' it would be clearer for the authors to highlight where they think PEZO-1 IS functioning. This could be done by either by adding a clear point at each step that describes that function or retitling each step to better highlight PEZO-1. The model as is now (in the text and figure) is more a reiteration of results and not so much a model for how and where PEZO-1 may be 'sensing' or 'responding' to mechanical stress. It is actually interesting that the phenotype is complicated because PIEZO proteins in other organisms may also have likewise complex roles.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion and we have totally revised this Figure to emphasize the many processes we think PEZO-1 may influence during fertilization. We no longer reiterate the defects we already described throughout the paper. We believe our discussion of our data and our working hypothesis is better articulated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper explores for the first time the role of the piezo-1/2 ortholog in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, pezo-1, and it identifies a critical function in retaining sperm in the spermatheca. In the absence of pezo-1 sperm are quickly depleted from the spermatheca and as a consequence embryo production is halted and oocyte crushing begins on both ends of the spermatheca. The quality of the work is high and its results are novel and of broad interest. However, the paper suffers from several problems that must be rectified before publication. Likely because piezo-1/2 are known to be mechanosensing calcium channels, the authors probably started this project with the hypothesis that pezo-1 functions as a mechanosensitive calcium channel. However, nature being as it is, in the end they don't have any evidence for such a function. That in itself is not a problem. What is problematic in my view is that in writing the paper they nevertheless continue to push a narrative of pezo-1 regulating calcium in the reproductive system, despite there not being any evidence for this. The second problem I have as a reviewer with the current paper is that the interpretation of many of the experiments is taken too far and it is done in the Results section, which could lead a reader to confuse speculations (or wishful thinking) for actual results. The defect in pezo-1 mutants that can explain all of the observed phenotypes is the rapid depletion of sperm from the spermatheca because they fail to return after being washed out with embryos exiting into the uterus. The mating experiments and somatic or germline specific AID experiments were supposed to clarify whether the sperm navigation defect is due to lack of pezo-1 activity in the sperm or in the somatic gonad. Unfortunately, the data presented is contradictory (or perhaps only not explained well) because after reading and rereading the paper I still can't figure out if pezo-1 is required in the sperm or in the gonad or both. Once the authors clarify this point, remove experiments that don't lead to a conclusion (inx-14/22, YP170::tdimer2), remove overinterpretation statements from the restuls section, and add missing controls for some experiments (Yoda1, AID) as detailed in my comments below, I believe the paper will be worthy of publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments. We have addressed the problematic parts of this manuscript, toned down our narrative about calcium signaling, and removed a number of uninformative experiments that do not add to the general observations of ovulation and sperm navigation. Below we address each concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) In multiple places the authors jump to conclusions based on associative evidence such as localization or genetic interaction. For example: &quot;Notably, PEZO-1 is strongly expressed in several tubular tissues, including the pharyngeal-intestinal and spermathecal-uterine valves, which is consistent with our hypothesis that pezo-1 may be responsible for mechanoperception in these tissues.&quot; And: &quot;Consistent with the hypothesis that reproductive tissues are regulated by mechanosensitive stimuli in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, expression of PEZO-1 likely functions to sense physical strain or contractility during ovulation and fertilization.&quot; – such sentences push a narrative of pezo-1 function in mechanoperception without any support in the data. Speculations and interpretations belong in the discussion. The result section should present the results without biasing the reader to a single interpretation.</p><p>2) &quot;Partial co-localization of PEZO-1 with the ER marker SP12::GFP suggested that PEZO-1 may be processed in the ER and transported to the plasma membrane (Figure 1E).&quot; – based on the image in Figure 1E the localization of SP12 and PEZO-1 is complementary and primarily non-overlapping. If the authors have reason to believe there is substantial co-localization they need to show and quantify it. In any case, it isn't clear why this is an important point to focus on. If the authors think the location of function of PEZO-1 is the plasma membrane then why not just focus on that localization?</p></disp-quote><p>We have omitted Figure 1E; it is not an important point at all. We agree that our focus should be on the plasma membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;The genome-edited animals behaved normally, suggesting no functional disruption of tagging PEZO-1 with these fluorescent reporter genes.&quot; – This statement is questionable in light of what is visible in Figure 1F, where there is an accumulation of small oocyte pieces or vesicles or something else that looks abnormal between the -1 oocyte and spermatheca.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks so much for pointing that out. What an oversight on our end not to have been more specific in the figure legend. Those “pieces” are only observed in adults just before the first ovulation event and are the few remaining spermatids that have not migrated into the spermatheca yet. The larger pieces are residual bodies that have yet to be engulfed by the sheath cells. We have added this to the legend and also cited the paper that originally made these observations. This figure actually highlights quite well that PEZO-1 is on sperm membranes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) &quot;The fluorescent signal of GFP::PEZO-1 is observed in both spermathecal valves until the valves open, suggesting that PEZO-1 may function to sense the mechanical stimuli at the valves during ovulation&quot; – since the fluorescent protein is at the membrane it is expected to give a higher signal when the tissue is contracted compared to when it is dilated. The change in fluorescence intensity observed in the GFP::PEZO-1 movie on its own is not an indication of any mechanosensing. If the authors wish to claim enrichment in the valve at a certain time point they would need to do a ratiometric comparison with a membrane marker such as PH::mCherry.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and we have removed all comments suggesting quantitative differences in expression in the spermatheca.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) &quot;To mimic a gain-of-function phenotype in pezo-1, we fed wildtype animals with Yoda1, a PIEZO1 specific chemical agonist, which keeps the channel open&quot; – No control was performed to show that Yoda1 doesn't have side effects in worms. There are plenty of chemicals that are supposedly specific but actually are not. A simple experiment that could at least show Yoda1's phenotype is PEZO-1-dependent is to perform the treatment on pezo-1KO, which we expect to be refractory to the drug and display the same brood size as pezo-1KO on its own.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the reviewer’s comments and added the control experiments with the treatment of Yoda-1 on <italic>pezo-1 CΔ</italic> in Figure 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) &quot;The defective ovulation is likely due to incomplete constriction of the sheath cells and improper gating of the distal spermathecal valve.&quot; – Incomplete constriction of the sheath is sufficient to explain the entry phenotype and it is not necessary to invoke improper gating of the distal spermathecal valve, which was not specifically tested. Moreover, improper sheath contraction is consistent with the absence of sperm, while distal valve defects are not.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the sentence to “The defective ovulation is likely due to incomplete constriction of the sheath cells”. Thanks for that suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) &quot;Of the oocytes that did successfully enter the spermatheca, many were frequently crushed when they exited through the sp-ut valve (Figure 3A'-E', Video 2-3). We observed that the sp-ut valve, labeled by DLG-1::GFP, did not completely open when the oocyte attempted to exit the spermatheca, which may lead to crushing the oocyte&quot; – again, a defect in the sp-ut valve is not necessary to explain the phenotype because oocytes are not normally meant to pass through the sp-ut valve and the egg shell normally protects the exiting embryo.</p></disp-quote><p>Though it is true that oocytes do not normally pass through the sp-ut valve in wild-type animals, oocytes from <italic>spe</italic> mutants, which are not fertilized, do survive their transit through the sp-ut valve and the vulva without being crushed. Many <italic>spe</italic> mutants are readily identifiable because of the number of undamaged oocytes on the plate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Knocking down the positive calcium regulators itr-1, sca-1, and orai-1 by RNAi enhanced the pezo-1 null phenotype and knocking down the negative calcium regulator lfe-1 partially rescued the null phenotype. Based on these findings the authors write: &quot;Therefore, these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that pezo-1 may regulate cytosolic and ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, which is crucial for proper spermathecal contractility and dilation.&quot; – However, there is no direct evidence in the paper to support the hypothesis that pezo-1 is controlling calcium levels in the reproductive system. Furthermore, in the following section the authors observe and measure directly calcium signaling in the spermatheca and observe no defects. It appears that the authors approached this project with a strong preconception of what pezo-1 is doing (based on literature in other systems) and do not allow the observations to lead to the most plausible explanations.</p></disp-quote><p>Guilty as charged. We have toned down the entire emphasis on calcium signaling throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) &quot;Surprisingly, GCaMP3 fluorescence in pezo-1 was not significantly different than wildtype&quot; – to me this is not surprising, since the phenotype looks like a problem with sheath contraction due to absence of sperm. Perhaps if the authors imaged GCaMP3 in the sheath they would see a lower signal in the mutant, but that could also be because of the absence of sperm and not a direct role of pezo-1 in calcium release.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and hope to pursue calcium signaling in specific tissues involved in this process in the future. Sheath-specific imaging of calcium is definitely on our list for the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) &quot;It should be noted that we only imaged the GCaMP3 reporter during the very first three ovulations in young adult animals to avoid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling interference from a distorted gonad morphology and mechanical pressure from a gravid uterus… our data does not exclude the possibility that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling may be more severely disrupted as the animal goes through more ovulation cycles.” – despite the technical difficulties, the authors could image older worms in order to rule out or prove that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling may be disrupted in the spermatheca.</p></disp-quote><p>We actually tried this and because of the broken oocytes both in the uterus and some in the oviduct, these images were far too confusing to make sound conclusions. Furthermore, the bigger problem that we have yet to resolve is that older animals do not ovulate under our imaging conditions, making it impossible to image calcium dynamics even if the animals did not have crushed oocytes in their uteri. The process of squeezing the animals between a coverslip and an agarose pad often pops older and larger wild-type animals, making movies of later embryo transits harder to image.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) I'm confused about the data regarding sperm navigation to the spermatheca. In subsection Sperm from matings rescues low brood size phenotype in pezo-1 mutants it is shown that pezo-1 mutant hermaphrodites resumed ovulation and fertilization upon mating once the male's sperm (from either wildtype, spe-9(hc52ts), or pezo-1 males) reached the spermatheca. From this we can conclude that pezo-1 spermatheca have no problem to attract sperm. (the same conclusion is also drawn from the AID experiment in which pezo-1 is degraded in the somatic tissues and rescued by mating with wt male sperm). However, in subsection Sperm guidance and navigation is disrupted in pezo-1 mutants it is shown that in pezo-1 hermaphrodites few sperm reach the spermatheca after mating and most sperm remained in zones furthest from the spermatheca. This was observed for both wildtype and pezo-1 mutant male sperm in mating with pezo-1 hermaphrodites. To me, these two results are contradictory, and the authors must clarify this point. Are pezo-1 hermaphrodites defective in attracting sperm to the spermatheca? And if so, how can mating rescue their phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>Our data is contradictory. We do show that mating into <italic>pezo-1</italic> hermaphrodites does rescue the ovulation and brood size. So mated sperm, whether from wild-type males or from <italic>pezo-1</italic> males, can navigate to the spermatheca to fertilize oocytes. We now suspect that there is a defect in hermaphrodite self-sperm and their ability to navigate back to the spermatheca after being expelled during ovulation. This remains an interesting contradiction and one that we are currently pursuing. We had hoped to report it as one of the complexities of the <italic>pezo-1</italic> phenotype. We have added a few sentences to this section of the Discussion to be open about this apparent contradiction in sperm phenotypes. We address this concern above with reviewer #1’s comment 2. Please refer to Figure 6—figure supplement 1. The sperm distribution was affected in <italic>pezo-1 CΔ; fem-1(hc17)</italic> after mating, however, there are still 40-50% stained sperm able to navigate to the spermatheca (Figure 6—figure supplement 1E). Additionally, the fertilization rate of the laid embryos (we used the total sperm number here since the sperm in the uteri are still able to crawl back to spermatheca) is lower in <italic>pezo-1 CΔ; fem-1(hc17)</italic> at permissive temperature (15° C) after mating with both wild type and <italic>pezo-1 CΔ</italic> when compared to <italic>fem-1(hc17)</italic> only.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Auxin Induced Degradation is performed by tagging pezo-1 with the degron sequence and crossing with tir-1::mRuby expressing worms. However, the authors don't show any data regarding the efficacy of the degradation. Since the protein is membranal, it is expected that ubiquitination of the degron might not lead immediately to degradation. If the authors labelled the fluorescently-tagged versions of pezo-1 they could quantify the degradation by measuring fluorescence. Another option would be to perform a Western blot, if they have an antibody that recognizes pezo-1. Without such controls it is hard to draw a conclusion from the AID experiments because we don't know how much of the protein was actually degraded in either the germline or somatic tissues. Is the reason for the weaker phenotype compared to the KO the tissue specificity or residual protein?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this criticism. We have repeated these experiments with our GFP-tagged PEZO-1 to address the level of knockdown and have observed that at least 2-3 fold of fluorescent intensity of GFP::PEZO-1::Degron was reduced when the animal treated with auxin compared to non-auxin control. These results are now shown in the Figure 8—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Figure 8 panels H-L – the text describing these results is not clear and the labeling of two of the images must be wrong because they are all labelled with Ppie-1::tir-1::mRuby but in the graph two bars are labelled with Peft-3. In the text it is hard to follow in which case auxin was added, what the promoter was and what the result was. From the text I understood that there was a sperm navigation defect when pezo-1 was degraded in the somatic tissues, but from the graph it appears the sperm navigation defect was only observed when pezo-1 was degraded in the germline.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these errors in the text and Figure 8. Panels H-L are now G-J and should be much easier to follow now. We do not show DIC with MitoTracker images for the Peft-3 strain because there was no significant difference from controls. We only show the bar graph for Peft-3 in panel 8K to demonstrate that it is not significantly different with or without auxin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The rationale behind the experiments with inx-14 and inx-22 is not clear and I disagree with the authors conclusion that &quot;the enhancement of phenotypes with these innexins suggests that PEZO-1 may be involved in regulating inter-tissue signaling.&quot;. In my view this is a sick + sick = sicker scenario and without further experiments to directly tie pezo-1 to inter-tissue signaling the authors cannot make such claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment and removed the data for future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Similarly, the observation of yolk accumulation in the pseudocoelomic cavity surrounding the gonad of the pezo-1 mutants is an intriguing observation that could be developed with further experiments (in a future manuscript), but on its own does not warrant a place in this paper. The suggesting that yolk endocytosis into the oocytes is defective and that the reduced endocytosis of yolk may disrupt prostaglandin synthesis in the oocyte, which may lead to a defect in the oocytes' ability to attract sperm towards the spermatheca is super speculative and does not belong in the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback. We agree that this was highly speculative and have omitted the figure. We do speculate in the Discussion that prostaglandin synthesis could be perturbed since that is a known attractant for sperm to migrate to the spermatheca, but we keep that short and make it clear that this is pure speculation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>General assessment: This paper describes a functional analysis of pezo-1, the sole PIEZO channel ortholog in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. PIEZO channels are involved in mechanotransduction in a variety of systems and contexts. Here, several mutations are created and analyzed including deletions, an early stop, and gain-of-function mutations associated with human disease. pezo-1 is widely expressed in different worm tissues, notably reproductive tissues including both somatic and germline, and disruption of pezo-1 leads to fecundity defects. Assays for reproductive processes implicate defects in ovulation and sperm targeting that likely lead to this decreased fertility. While calcium signaling appears normal, mutations in genes involved in calcium signaling enhance pezo-1 as does certain disruptions of gonadal signaling. Tissue-specific rescue experiments and auxin-induced degradation are used to analyze the focus of action of pezo-1 in different reproductive processes. This paper covers a lot of ground: analysis of several distinct phenotypes in pezo-1 mutants, calcium imaging, genetic interactions, interrogation of disease alleles, and use of the relatively new auxin-induced degradation system to assess tissue specific effects. Overall, the experiments fit together well and make a coherent story.</p><p>While I have extensive comments, my major specific questions and concerns are about the following, described in more detail below (*):</p><p>1) Description and interpretation of experiments involving spe-9</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the text and carefully interpret the spe-9 data in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Controls for the experiment shown in Figure 6E</p></disp-quote><p>We added new control data and revised the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Compared to other experiments, the inx genetic interaction experiments are relatively uninformative, and I suggest toning down the interpretation of the results.

The fecundity defect worsens with age of the hermaphrodite. Treatment with a PIEZO agonist causes a phenotype similar to that of deletion alleles. It is notable that both lof and gof cause similar phenotypes. How do the authors interpret this effect? Is it consistent with other studies of PIEZO activity in other systems and the known mechanisms of action of these channels?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Dysfunctions of PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 caused a variety of physiological disorders, which were caused by both gain-of-function and loss-of-function. A dogmatic model is that osmoregulation is disturbed in either gof or lof mutants, which interfered with downstream cellular signaling pathways. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of PIEZO gain-of-function vs. PIEZO loss-of-function in these diseases are not well understood. The ovulation and fertility process are complicated and are regulated by a sophisticated signaling network. In our study, there are a few speculations about the role of PEZO-1 in reproductive signal transduction. We speculate that either loss-of-function or gain-of-function may spatiotemporally disturb the reproductive signaling pathways, which lead to a common read-out as reduced fecundity and embryonic inviability. We revised and highlighted our working model in Figure 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since treatment with either of two different concentrations of the agonist yields similar effects, it does not seem necessary to show both concentrations.

Even though calcium imaging appears normal in the pezo mutant, these experiments establish a potential link between the mechanisms of PEZO-1 and canonical PIEZO channels. It would be clearer for most readers to frame them in terms of manipulating Ca and avoid terms like positive or negative genetic interactions or phrases like &quot;enhancing the reduction of brood size&quot;. This is especially important because these are such interesting experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We did try to alter our language here to make it easier to read and omitted positive and negative genetic interactions. However, these genetic arguments do usually use such language as enhance or suppress when discussing phenotypes of double mutants. Since we were not directly measuring calcium, it is safer to conclude that the depletion of a given gene enhanced or suppressed the phenotypes of pezo-1 alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Brood size data are presented as scatterplots with separate counts of early progeny and later progeny. For most of the analysis, it is unclear why splitting the data in this manner is necessary. In many cases, it makes it more difficult for a reader to compare the phenotypes of different strains, e.g. for comparing pezo-1 alleles and in the genetic interaction experiments.</p><p>In addition, the wild-type brood sizes are surprisingly variable. Does the variability decrease if full brood sizes are considered? One explanation for this could be variability in staging L4s. In turn, this raises the question of whether splitting the data is the most accurate way to show brood sizes (at least in cases where progeny are abundant at both time points – when essentially all offspring are produced early, splitting the data is indeed helpful).</p><p>Overall, it seems worth considering 1- if the data could be presented in a simpler format for some experiments and 2- if the format is not revised, if the full brood counts should be included in the supplemental data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer’s comments and adjusted a few figures (Figure 2A, 2C 8E, 8F) to show the total brood for the full time period. However, we did split the brood sizes into two time periods for some experiments (like Figure 4) to emphasize that the onset of the phenotypes was late. We had considered only showing brood sizes of Day2 and later adults to highlight the decrease in brood size, but thought it best to show that Day1 adults were not as affected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Re: Sperm from matings rescues pezo-1 low brood size</p><p>The experiments here show the result that pezo-1 does not appear to be required in sperm and sperm defects are not responsible for pezo-1 reproductive phenotypes.</p><p>-pezo-1 males are fully fertile in crosses to fem-1 females, indicating their sperm are functional for migration and fertilization. This is convincing.</p><p>-Crossing males to sperm-depleted pezo-1 hermaphrodites induces resumption of offspring production, indicating pezo-1 is not required for the sperm-to-ovulation signal. This is also convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>Agree. Our data suggests that mutant male sperm are fully able to induce ovulation, to navigate to the spermatheca upon mating, and to fertilize oocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show that signaling from oocyte to sperm, needed for navigation, is disrupted; both wild-type and pezo-1 sperm have localization defects within pezo-1 hermaphrodites. However, there do not appear to be defects in the signaling from sperm to oocytes/sheath cells that increases ovulation rate. When sperm are depleted, ovulation rate is low, but re-introduction of sperm is sufficient to induce ovulation. Furthermore, pezo-1 sperm introduced into females do fertilize oocytes, implying they are functional for migration, fertilization, and induction of ovulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Also agree.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>*The way experiments in this section are presented is misleading. Based on the title, I expected to see results that pezo-1 reproductive defects are due to their sperm. The presentation of the spe-9 experiment, as a test of &quot;whether sperm signaling was defective&quot; as well as the description of the result, further imply a sperm-based defect.</p><p>Ultimately, the spe-9 result is not surprising. spe-9 sperm are known to signal ovulation in wild type, and it is expected that re-introduction of sperm into a depleted hermaphrodite would increase ovulation rate if oocytes can respond to MSP. The data here are fine but the text should be revised for clarity and accessibility. This also applies in the Abstract and spe-9 experiments done with disease alleles.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments. We have altered the writing to make it clear that we think sperm navigation is disrupted but not because the sperm are defective but rather the attractant signal for the sperm to migrate from the uterus to the spermatheca is disrupted. By “sperm-signaling”, we were thinking the signals to the sperm, but now see how this phrase sounds like the sperm is defective in signaling. We modified the Abstract and spe-9 discussion as well. Our data however is consistent with the conclusion that the attractive signal for sperm to migrate back to the spermatheca is defective and that the mutant sperm themselves are fully capable of sensing the signal, crawling, repopulating the spermatheca, and in fem-1 females, even fertilizing oocytes. However, the feedback from the three reviewers has prompted us to ask whether there might be a defect in self-sperm versus cross sperm. Even though male cross sperm don’t navigate as well as WT, they do still crawl towards the spermatheca, whereas mutant self-sperm get washed out of the spermatheca and never make it back. We have addressed these issues by the new experiments with pezo-1 females in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors do not comment on quantitative differences between crosses into wild-type hermaphrodites and into pezo-1 hermaphrodites, and statistics are only presented for non-mated herm vs various mated conditions. Have the authors considered these comparisons?</p></disp-quote><p>This too is a good suggestion. The data in Figure 6B suggests that mutant sperm when mated with WT can migrate to the spermatheca and fertilize a large number of oocytes. However, when mated into the C∆ hermaphrodites, they do sire cross progeny but at greatly reduced levels. This we believe is further support that the attractive signal from the oocytes or sheath cells are somewhat defective and not that there is a problem with the sperm crawling and fertilizing oocytes. This data is also consistent with Figure 7J where we do quantitate where these cross sperm are located 60 minutes after removing the males. We have reworked this entire section to make it clearer that the signal of pezo-1 mutants to attract sperm to the spermatheca is what appears to be dysfunctional.</p><p>We have carried out an additional experiment to test whether one possible defect was in the ability of the sheath to respond to the sperm signal to trigger ovulation. Even though our data in Figure 6E suggests that just the presence of sperm can trigger ovulation, we went on to show that purified MSP can also trigger ovulation in older pezo-1 ∆ hermaphrodites that are depleted of sperm and are no longer ovulating. We added this data in Figure 6F, G, and H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>*To interpret 6E, additional controls are needed in which wild-type male sperm are supplied and ovulation rates are measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the control in Figure 6E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Direct measurement of ovulation rate – as shown in Figure 6E for spe-9 – would be a more direct assay for induction of ovulation by introduced sperm.</p><p>An n of 4-6 seems very low for these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We increased number of tested gonad arms to &gt;10 in Figure 6E and other ovulation assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>*Re: Sperm navigation is disrupted</p><p>– Does zone 3 include only the spermatheca, as described in the text, or the spermatheca and adjacent region of the uterus, as shown in Figure 7 (and as it is usually defined in publications from the Miller lab and others)?

While it might seem unlikely, this difference could matter. At 60 hours, there is likely to be some hermaphrodite sperm remaining, at least in wild type, while at 72 hr sperm are more likely to be depleted, which would presumably alter the signaling environment. Related to this concern, there appear to be quite a few sperm in zones 2 and 3 in panel G. The data in 7H suggests fewer sperm should be visible in zone 3.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 7J quantifies all of the data (n=8) that is represented by Figure 7H and 7I.
