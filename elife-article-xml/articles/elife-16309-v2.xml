intrinsic cellular defenses against viral infection. Mammalian TRIM5α proteins are restriction factors and receptors that target the capsid cores of retroviruses and activate ubiquitin-dependent antiviral responses upon capsid recognition. Here, we report crystallographic and functional studies of the TRIM5α B-box 2 domain, which mediates higher-order assembly of TRIM5 proteins. The B-box can form both dimers and trimers, and the trimers can link multiple TRIM5α proteins into a hexagonal net that matches the lattice arrangement of capsid subunits and enables avid capsid binding. Two modes of conformational flexibility allow TRIM5α to accommodate the variable curvature of retroviral capsids. B-box mediated interactions also modulate TRIM5α’s E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, by stereochemically restricting how the N-terminal RING domain can dimerize. Overall, these studies define important molecular details of cellular recognition of retroviruses, and how recognition links to downstream processes to disable the virus.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16309.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16309.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16309.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>After infecting a cell, a virus reprograms the cell to produce new copies of the virus, which then spread to other cells. However, cells have evolved ways to fight back against this infection. For example, many mammalian cells contain proteins called restriction factors that prevent the virus from multiplying. The TRIM5 proteins form one common set of restriction factors that act against a class of viruses called retroviruses.</p><p>HIV-1 and related retroviruses have a protein shell known as a capsid that surrounds the genetic material of the virus. The capsid contains several hundred repeating units, each of which consists of a hexagonal ring of six capsid proteins. Although this basic pattern is maintained across different retroviruses, the overall shape of the capsids can vary considerably. For instance, HIV-1 capsids are shaped like a cone, but other retroviruses can form cylinders or spheres.</p><p>Soon after a retrovirus enters a mammalian cell, TRIM5 proteins bind to the capsid. This causes the capsid to be destroyed, which prevents replication of the virus. Previous research has shown that many TRIM5 proteins must link up with each other via a region of their structure called the 'B-box 2' domain in order to efficiently recognize capsids. How this assembly process occurs, and why it enables the TRIM5 proteins to recognize different capsids was not fully understood. Now, Wagner et al. (and independently Li, Chandrasekaran et al.) have investigated these questions.</p><p>Wagner et al. engineered short versions of a type of TRIM5 protein called TRIM5α and used a technique called X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of its B-box domain. This revealed that the B-box present in one molecule of TRIM5α can associate with the B-boxes on two other TRIM5α molecules. By working in groups of three (or trimers), the B-box domains connect several TRIM5α proteins to form a hexagonal net. The TRIM5α net matches the arrangement of the capsid proteins in the shell of the virus, which enables TRIM5α to bind strongly to HIV-1 capsids.</p><p>Wagner et al. also found that B-box trimers are flexible, which allows the TRIM5α net to adapt to the shape of the HIV-1 capsid and wrap around regions where it curves. In addition, computer modelling suggested that the B-box trimer may also enable TRIM5α to carry out the next steps in the process of disabling the virus. Further work is now needed to understand in more detail how the trimers have this effect.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16309.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16309.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>restriction factor</kwd><kwd>higher-order assembly</kwd><kwd>protein structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Rhesus Macaque</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM112508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pornillos</surname><given-names>Owen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 GM082545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ganser-Pornillos</surname><given-names>Barbie K</given-names></name><name><surname>Sundquist</surname><given-names>Wesley I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 GM115007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>Jonathan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Annette Lightner Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pornillos</surname><given-names>Owen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Higher-order assembly enables and links pathogen recognition and downstream steps in the TRIM5-mediated anti-HIV response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>TRIM5α is a restriction factor that intercepts the incoming capsids of diverse retroviruses, including HIV-1, and inhibits viral replication. The mechanism of restriction is not yet fully understood, but is primarily associated with premature termination of reverse transcription and accelerated dissociation of the viral core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sayah et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stremlau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2006</xref>). TRIM5α is also proposed to be a pattern recognition receptor for retroviral capsids, in that it initiates a signaling cascade to induce type I interferon upon capsid binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pertel et al., 2011</xref>). Ubiquitin (Ub) is implicated in both the antiviral (restriction) and signaling activities of TRIM5α. In particular, TRIM5α’s E3 ligase activity creates K63-linked polyUb chains. Although the functional target or targets of ubiquitination have not been established definitively, TRIM5α self-ligation correlates with the block in reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fletcher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roa et al., 2012</xref>), whereas unanchored chains have been proposed to mediate interferon signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pertel et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Like all TRIM proteins, TRIM5α consists of an N-terminal tripartite or RBCC motif (RING, B-box 2, and coiled-coil domains), followed by a C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meroni and Diez-Roux, 2005</xref>). The B-box 2 and coiled-coil domains make an integrated antiparallel dimer fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldstone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sanchez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weinert et al., 2015</xref>), which acts as a scaffold that organizes the upstream and downstream domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In TRIM5α, the C-terminal domain is a β-sandwich fold called SPRY (or PRYSPRY/B30.2), which mediates direct binding to retroviral capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diaz-Griffero et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kovalskyy and Ivanov, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sawyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sayah et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sebastian and Luban, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stremlau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). The L2 linker that connects the SPRY domain to the coiled-coil packs against the coiled-coil scaffold, and so in the TRIM5α dimer, two SPRY domains are oriented to bind the capsid simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldstone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sanchez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weinert et al., 2015</xref>). Capsid recognition by TRIM5α is an avidity-driven interaction; that is, productive binding only occurs in context of assembled capsid and assembled TRIM5α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sebastian and Luban, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stremlau et al., 2006</xref>). Higher-order assembly of TRIM5α requires the B-box 2 domain, which is thought to mediate three-fold symmetric interactions that connect coiled-coil mediated TRIM5α dimers into a hexagonal net (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diaz-Griffero et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Javanbakht et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li and Sodroski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>). This hexagonal scaffold is proposed to position the SPRY domains to match the orientations – both translational and rotational – of their corresponding binding epitopes on retroviral capsids, and thereby generate powerful avidity effects that amplify very weak (millimolar level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biris et al., 2013</xref>)) intrinsic affinities between the SPRY and capsid subunits.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16309.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design and oligomeric behavior of miniTRIM proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the TRIM5α primary sequence.

A segment of the L1 linker forms a 4-helix bundle that mediates dimerization of the RING domain, which is required for productive interactions with Ub-conjugated E2 enzymes and formation of the catalytically active Ub ligation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yudina et al., 2015</xref>). Although the B-box 2 domain does not appear to have a direct role in catalysis, B-box/B-box interactions are expected to cluster their associated RING domains and promote RING dimerization. In context of the TRIM hexagonal lattice, the apparent juxtaposition of three-way head-to-head interactions between the B-boxes and two-way interactions between the catalytic RING domains is suggested to facilitate TRIM5α self-ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yudina et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The structural basis by which the B-box 2 domain promotes higher-order assembly of TRIM5α dimers has been challenging to decipher, largely because the bivalent nature of the TRIM5α dimer and the flexible architectures of both the TRIM dimer and hexagonal lattice have impeded crystallographic characterization. Analysis of the isolated B-box 2 domain has been likewise problematic, because separating the B-box from the coiled-coil exposes a 'backside' hydrophobic surface that makes it prone to aggregation. We therefore engineered artificial constructs – which we call miniTRIMs – that retain the integrated B-box/coiled-coil fold of the full-length dimer but are more amenable to biochemical and structural analyses. These novel reagents allowed us to define the molecular details of how the B-box 2 domain facilitates higher-order assembly of TRIM5α, and how pattern recognition of retroviral capsids is coupled to ubiquitin-dependent downstream processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design and initial characterization of miniTRIMs</title><p>Our miniTRIM constructs were designed to be monovalent with respect to the RING and B-box 2 domains (to uncouple interactions mediated by these domains from the coiled-coil dimer), and yet preserve the native, quaternary B-box/coiled-coil interface (to prevent exposure of the backside hydrophobic B-box surface and non-specific aggregation). The 'RBcc' miniTRIM contained residues 1–159 from rhesus TRIM5α (which includes the RING, B-box 2, and the first 26 residues of the coiled-coil) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, colored in orange), followed by an antiparallel coiled-coil hairpin derived from a bacterial seryl-tRNA synthetase (residues 49–78 of PDB 1SRY, gray), and then residues 225–265 of the TRIM5α coiled-coil (green). To further uncouple the B-box from potential dimeric interactions of the upstream RING domain, we also designed a second construct denoted 'Bcc' that lacks the RING (residues 1–88) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Both the RBcc and Bcc miniTRIMs proved well behaved in solution, and could be purified to homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Higher-order assembly of full-length TRIM5α protein dimers requires interactions mediated by a surface patch on the B-box 2 domain that includes Arg121 (rhesus TRIM5α numbering). Biochemical and cell-based assays show that R121A and R121E mutants are deficient in capsid binding and restriction activities, and this correlates with defects in higher-order assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diaz-Griffero et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li and Sodroski, 2008</xref>). The same patch also mediates self-association of the isolated B-box 2 domain in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diaz-Griffero et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore expected the miniTRIMs to exhibit Arg121-dependent oligomeric behavior, and we tested this by using size exclusion chromatography. Consistent with expectation, both the RBcc miniTRIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and Bcc miniTRIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) eluted early from a Superdex 75 size exclusion column as asymmetric peaks with sharp leading edges and pronounced tails (blue traces). In contrast, miniTRIMs harboring the R121E mutation eluted late as more symmetrical peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>, red traces), with elution volumes consistent with monomeric species. These results indicate that the protein-protein interactions required for higher-order assembly of full-length TRIM5α are also essential for miniTRIM oligomerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Bcc miniTRIM recapitulates the B-box/coiled-coil head of TRIM5α</title><p>Despite the polydisperse nature of the miniTRIMs, we obtained numerous crystal hits.

All 12 structures were very similar to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and a complete structure is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. In general, electron densities for the B-box 2 domains and proximal regions of the coiled-coil domains were well defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), whereas densities for the hairpin linker were of poorer quality or, in some cases, missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). (Densities in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref> are illustrated with a trimer subunit.) Thus, our structures are of high quality at the functionally relevant regions, even though the artificial linker displayed significant disorder in some cases and may not be optimally designed. Our 12 Bcc miniTRIM structures superimpose very well with the crystal structure of the TRIM5α B-box 2/coiled-coil dimer (PDB 4TN3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldstone et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). This indicates that our miniTRIM constructs are excellent structural surrogates for the B-box/coiled-coil core of the full RBCC motif.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id

The dimer is quasi-equivalent to the trimer: the same sets of residues make the same interactions but with valence of two instead of three. The dimer buries a smaller surface area per subunit (450 Å<sup>2</sup>) compared to the trimer.</p><p>Both the trimer and dimer are stabilized by three layers of interactions, with a hydrophobic layer sandwiched between two hydrophilic layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,H</xref>). The top layers (closest to the N-termini of the B-boxes) make a ring of salt bridges mediated by Glu102 and Lys103 from each subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,J</xref>). The middle, hydrophobic layers center on Trp117 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,K</xref>). In both oligomers, these indole sidechains make a hydrophobic core surrounded by a collar of close packed leucine sidechains (Leu105, Leu106, Leu118, and Leu132). The third, bottom layers also consist of a ring of salt bridges, this time with Glu120 and Arg121 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,L</xref>). At the periphery of this layer, the sidechain hydroxyl of Thr30 donates a hydrogen bond to Glu120. Interactions between the layers consist of a hydrogen bond between Glu102 (top) and the indole amide of Trp117 (middle), and close packing between the Trp117 sidechain (middle) and the Arg121 sidechain guanidinium group (bottom) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,I</xref>). The Trp117 indoles in the trimer form a channel that would be expected to have a highly negatively charged hole at the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), which is likely to be partially stabilized by the positively charged Arg121 sidechains.</p><p>Comparison of the trimer and dimer bonding interactions revealed that the two oligomers are distinguished primarily by intermolecular packing between the Trp117, Leu118, and Leu132 sidechains in the hydrophobic layer. In particular, Leu118 and Leu132, which are located at the outer edges of the binding surface, are in van der Waals contact in the trimer, but more separated in the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Another distinction is that the first two turns of the coiled-coil helix are overwound and bent in the dimer form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), which might indicate some structural communication between the interacting B-boxes and the coiled-coil domain.</p><p>The apparent propensity of the B-box 2 domain to dimerize in our crystals prompted us to more closely analyze the oligomerization behavior of the miniTRIMs in solution. In order to avoid possible contributions from proximity-induced RING/RING interactions, we focused on the Bcc miniTRIM construct. We first analyzed Bcc miniTRIM by using sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) at three different loading concentrations and three rotor speeds, and the combined data set was fit globally. In control experiments, both the W117E and R121E Bcc miniTRIM mutants were monomeric, in agreement with the structures (not shown), whereas the wildtype (WT) Bcc distributions indicated self-association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Global fitting of the WT equilibrium distributions to a monomer-dimer-trimer model only returned stable values for the monomer-dimer dissociation constant (1 μM). Indeed, the AUC data gave a satisfactory fit to a monomer-dimer equilibrium model, indicating that trimers (or higher-order oligomers than dimers) were disfavored in solution. To determine whether higher-order oligomers would form at higher protein concentrations, we also analyzed the Bcc miniTRIM at 0.9 mM by using analytical size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS). The mass trace (blue curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>) had a sharp peak at the leading edge of the protein absorbance peak (black curve), a curved plateau in the central region above the expected mass for a dimer, and tapered towards the expected monomer mass at the tail. This again indicated dynamic equilibrium between monomer and dimer states, and that higher-order species were also present in the main peak, but at a much smaller fraction than dimers. Thus, the Bcc miniTRIM was predominantly dimeric in solution.</p><p>The solution behavior of Bcc miniTRIM is in sharp contrast to that of full-length protein. Published AUC analysis of freshly purified full-length TRIM5 did not show evidence of B-box mediated self-association, even at a loading concentration that is six-fold higher than our measured miniTRIM dimerization affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Langelier et al., 2008</xref>). Uncoupling of the B-box from the full coiled-coil and RING domains therefore appears to have amplified its propensity for oligomerization. Another difference is that, upon incubation, full-length TRIM5α has a clear propensity to assemble into hexagonal arrays – and by inference, three-way B-box/B-box interactions – even at low μM concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>; and this study). Since the miniTRIMs lack an intact coiled-coil, extended incubation did not result in lattice formation but only produced higher molecular weight aggregates (not shown). Our interpretation of all of these observations is that artificial uncoupling of the B-box 2 domain from the full coiled-coil and RING domains has stabilized the B-box dimer form. In context of the full-length protein, assembly cooperativity drives the B-box into the trimer form, and so the B-box dimer might represent an intermediate state that can incorporate an additional B-box domain to form the trimer. Consistent with this interpretation, our structures indicate that the Bcc miniTRIM dimers can open slightly like a clam shell, which we imagine can lead to a wider opening and provide access to a third subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). We note that this interpretation does not preclude a functional role for a B-box dimer. For example, it is possible that B-box dimerization might be a mechanism to promote RING dimerization and E3 ligase activation. Nevertheless, it seems clear that the B-box trimer is what facilitates hexagonal lattice assembly, at least in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Structure-based TRIM5α B-box 2 mutants are impaired in restriction and capsid binding</title><p>To test the functional relevance of the B-box mediated interactions in our structures, we generated structure-based mutations in full-length rhesus TRIM5α and tested the mutant proteins for their ability to inhibit transduction of GFP-labeled HIV-1 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Charge reversal mutations in the top layer of interactions (E102K, K103E, E102K/K103E) diminished restriction activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), confirming that this ring of salt bridges has an appreciable contribution to higher-order TRIM5α assembly. Individual charge reversals in the bottom layer (E120R, R121E) severely abrogated restriction activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), in agreement with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diaz-Griffero et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li and Sodroski, 2008</xref>). However, the E120R/R121E double mutation did not have a compensatory effect. This is in contrast with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diaz-Griffero et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li and Sodroski, 2008</xref>) but is consistent with the structures since Arg121 is involved in both a salt bridge and a hydrophobic packing interaction with Trp117.

Interestingly, however, the W117A mutant still harbored some restriction activity, most likely because the hydrophobic layer remains stabilized by an outer ring of leucines. As with Trp117, alanine substitution mutants for Leu118 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and Leu132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) had measurable restriction activity, whereas aspartate substitutions were more significantly disruptive. Of the remaining two leucines, L105A had full activity and L106A did not restrict HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results are again consistent with the structures since Leu105 is only partially buried, whereas Leu106 is completely buried within both the dimer and trimer interfaces. Interestingly, we found that steady state expression levels of the TRIM5α B-box 2 domain mutants varied considerably, as noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diaz-Griffero et al., 2007</xref>), and that furthermore there was an inverse correlation between the steady state expression levels of the mutant proteins and restriction activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). The best expressing mutants (e.g., W117E and R121E) did not restrict HIV, whereas the lowest expressing mutant (L105A) had WT-like restriction activity. The expression levels also inversely correlated with in vitro assembly efficiency – W117E and R121E did not assemble, whereas L105A assembled efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>; also see below). We therefore speculate that the ability to assemble reduces steady state protein levels because TRIM5α proteins that assemble are turned over more rapidly in cells. An extension of this argument is that the ability of TRIM5α to assemble correlates with its ability to restrict HIV-1.</p><p>We also tested the effect of the hydrophobic B-box 2 domain mutations on capsid binding activity in vitro. For these experiments, we used TRIM5-21R, a chimeric construct described in previous studies as a functional and structural surrogate for TRIM5α due to its more favorable biochemical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diaz-Griffero et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Langelier et al., 2008</xref>). We incubated crosslinked HIV-1 CA tubes (biochemical surrogates for the HIV-1 capsid) with WT and mutant TRIM5-21R proteins, and then measured binding in a co-pelleting assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fribourgh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stremlau et al., 2006</xref>). In control experiments, about 50% of WT TRIM5-21R was consistently found in the pellet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Mutants were analyzed in parallel with a WT control, and results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> are representative of mutant binding efficiencies relative to WT from at least two experiments with independent protein preparations. Essentially all of the B-box mutants tested had detectable capsid binding activity, which was expected because all of these constructs contained an intact SPRY domain and because the R121E mutation that abolished restriction still supported capsid binding in a similar assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, our results showed that weaker or no capsid binding correlated with weaker or no restriction activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), confirming that B-box 2 domain mediated interactions promote efficient capsid recognition.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16309.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>CA tube pull-down assay.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) WT control.

For this analysis, we focused on the hydrophobic (layer 2) mutations. Previously, purified TRIM5-21R was shown to assemble spontaneously into hexagonal arrays when incubated in low salt buffer at about 1 mg/mL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>). These micron-sized arrays can be readily visualized by negative stain electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, the R121E mutant did not assemble spontaneously even at concentrations up to 30 mg/mL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore tested our TRIM5-21R mutants for spontaneous assembly at both low (1 mg/mL) and high (&gt;5 mg/mL) protein concentrations. We found that mutations that gave the most significant reductions in restriction activity (L106A, W117E, L118D, and L132D) also prevented assembly at all protein concentrations tested (up to 18 mg/mL) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and data not shown). Two of the mutations that supported intermediate restriction activity (L118A and L132A) also supported hexagonal lattice assembly, but only at high protein concentrations and to a more limited extent compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). A third intermediate mutation, W117A, altered the assembly phenotype of TRIM5-21R. This mutant failed to assemble in standard low salt buffer at both 1 and 5 mg/mL, but at high protein concentrations and higher salt (&gt;250 mM NaCl), it assembled into striated arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Interestingly, the L105A mutation (full restriction activity) also altered the spontaneous assembly behavior of TRIM5-21R. Under the same conditions as WT (low salt buffer and 1 mg/mL protein), L105A formed macramé-like networks that appeared distinct from either the hexagonal or striated arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16309.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Spontaneous assembly of TRIM5-21R.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) WT TRIM5-21R spontaneously assembled into hexagonal arrays at a concentration of 1 mg/mL in 25 mM Tris, pH 8, 25 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP (standard conditions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>).

We therefore tested whether the CA-NC arrays can 'rescue' the altered spontaneous assembly phenotype of L105A and W117A. However, results were inconclusive; although the TRIM proteins appeared to associate with the CA-NC arrays, diffraction patterns that would indicate overlaying lattices were not observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and data not shown). We therefore used an alternative assay wherein soluble TRIM5α and HIV-1 CA are mixed and incubated under basic conditions and moderate salt concentrations, which results in formation of CA tubes that are almost uniformly decorated with TRIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>). The overlaying TRIM lattice on these tubes is related to the flat hexagonal arrays, except that it now follows the basal curvature of the CA tubes. Both WT TRIM5-21R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and the L105A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) showed similar behavior in this assay; that is, virtually all the tubes were uniformly decorated, and the decorations looked similar to each other and to those made by WT TRIM5α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to the flat arrays, hexagon shapes were more difficult to discern in projection images of the curved arrays, and so we also analyzed negatively stained samples by electron tomography. As observed with vitrified samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>), densities surrounding the CA tubes were readily discernible in the tomograms of our negatively-stained samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). As expected, the peripheral TRIM5α layers exhibited a high degree of disorder, but for both WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) and L105A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), we could clearly observe regions of local order with hexagonal rings having the expected dimensions for a TRIM hexamer. Interestingly, a proportion of the L105A decorations appeared more ladder-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), but again the distances between the repeating units were similar to the TRIM hexagon dimensions. We therefore conclude that, although there is no clear structural explanation for the spontaneous assembly behavior of the L105A mutant, it can nevertheless form hexagonal arrays when it binds CA tubes in vitro. The inability of this mutant to form flat lattices (the endpoints of both the spontaneous assembly and template driven methods) suggests that B-box/B-box interactions might have some link to lattice curvature.</p><p>We also used the co-assembly assay to characterize the W117A mutant that assembled into striated arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This mutant also decorated the CA tubes, but the decorations were more limited in extent compared to either WT or L105A, and regions of undecorated CA were more readily apparent in the projection images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Similarly, the tomograms revealed considerable disorder in the overlaying TRIM lattice, and hexagon-shaped decorations were not easily discerned (not shown).</p><p>In summary, our analysis of structure-based B-box 2 domain mutations support a general correlation between TRIM5α restriction activity in cells, capsid binding efficiency in vitro, and hexagonal lattice assembly in vitro. Our results therefore fit the model wherein both capsid recognition and antiviral restriction are facilitated by B-box mediated assembly of TRIM5α into a hexagonal lattice that wraps around the viral capsid.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Molecular modeling of the TRIM5 hexagonal lattice</title><p>The low-resolution structure of the TRIM5α hexagonal lattice consists of large lobes of density at the two-fold and three-fold symmetric positions connected by thin linkers of density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>). The thin linkers are made by the antiparallel coiled-coil dimer scaffold and the two-fold lobes are made by the SPRY domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldstone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sanchez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weinert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Our structural and biochemical analyses indicate that the three-fold vertexes are made by B-box 2 domain trimers. By combining our miniTRIM trimer crystal structure with that of the B-box/coiled-coil dimer (PDB 4TN3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldstone et al., 2014</xref>), we built a molecular model of a flat TRIM5α hexagonal lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The unit cell spacing of this model is 338.5 Å, which is an almost exact match to the observed value for rhesus TRIM5α (340 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>). All of the SPRY domains are located on one side of the lattice plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, blue spheres), where they could bind the capsid simultaneously. At the three-fold vertexes, the N-terminal ends of the B-boxes point toward the other side of the lattice plane. This suggests that the RING domains are oriented away from the capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, red spheres). This molecular architecture indicates that the higher-order TRIM scaffold also compartmentalizes the biochemical activities of the RING and SPRY domains.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16309.020</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Molecular model of a flat TRIM5α hexagonal lattice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top view, with the B-box 2 domains colored in orange and the coiled-coil domains in green.

The availability of 12 independent miniTRIM structures allowed us to perform a similar analysis here. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, superposition of the miniTRIM structures revealed that the coiled-coil can swing relative to the B-box 2 domain. Flexion occurs about the B-box/coiled-coil interface, which is lined almost exclusively by aliphatic sidechains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Note that in context of full-length TRIM5, this 'greasy' interface is a quaternary contact between the subunits of the native dimer. Bending of the first two turns of the coiled-coil helix in the dimer subunits produced the greatest change in orientation of the B-box relative to the coiled-coil, but the rigid body motions were also evident in comparing dimer subunits or trimer subunits alone (not shown). In context of the trimer, the three coiled-coils do not contact each other and can therefore move independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C,D</xref>).

Residues 72–82 are disordered in the monomeric RING structure, but are folded into a 4-helix bundle in the dimeric RING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lienlaf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yudina et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, a RING monomer has a longer (and presumably more flexible) linker to the B-box than a RING dimer subunit.</p><p>We used the program RANCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernadó et al., 2007</xref>) to calculate an ensemble of 10,000 models wherein the monomeric RING is flexibly tethered to the B-box trimer. Linker residues were modeled as impenetrable spheres, and the entire linker was assumed to be an 'intrinsically disordered' segment ('native' setting in RANCH). This treatment seemed appropriate since the linker adopts alternative secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lienlaf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yudina et al., 2015</xref>). In the resulting ensemble, the vast majority of the RING domains are located above the plane of the trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>, right). Thus, even flexibly tethered monomeric RINGs are predominantly located on one side of the lattice and away from the capsid. In a subset of our models, the RING/B-box linker folds down, in a configuration that brings the RING domain against the trimer vertex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>, left). In principle, close packing of the RING domain and/or the RING/B-box linker against the trimer interface might explain the observation that the RING domain contributes to the efficiency of TRIM5α higher-order assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16309.022</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Models of RING domain configurations in context of the B-box trimer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RING domains were modeled as monomers attached to their respective B-boxes by a flexible 23- residue linker.

A RING dimer subunit is therefore separated from its B-box by a shorter linker of 12 residues (<sub>83</sub>EVKLSPEEGQKV<sub>94</sub>). Analysis of this sequence using the PEP-FOLD server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2014</xref>) predicts that residues 87–94 have some propensity to fold into a short helix, and we therefore speculate that the dimeric RING/B-box linker might actually be a hinge rather than a flexible tether. Since E2-Ub binding imposes additional spatial constraints, stereochemical clashes can only be avoided if the RING dimer is positioned above the B-box trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). We therefore conclude that in context of the TRIM hexagonal lattice, the B-box trimer spatially restricts the RING domain, such that an active E3 ligase can only form on the side of the lattice that faces the cytoplasm. We also performed the same analysis on the B-box dimer; as expected, it also restricted RING positions, but to a lesser extent than the trimer (not shown).</p><p>The functional target of TRIM5α ubiquitination has not been determined definitively, but self-ubiquitination correlates with inhibition of retroviral reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fletcher et al., 2015</xref>). The principal Ub attachment sites are in the RING domain (Lys45 and Lys51) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fletcher et al., 2015</xref>). Although a B-box dimer is more naturally compatible with a RING dimer, a B-box trimer suggests an intuitively appealing mechanism for self-ubiquitination because it clusters three RING domains. In this model, two of the RING domains would dimerize and orient an E2-conjugated Ub for nucleophilic attack by the third RING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yudina et al., 2015</xref>). To determine if such a mechanism of self-ubiquitination is stereochemically plausible, we constructed a model for a ubiquitination complex on a TRIM5α trimer vertex, by adding a third RING and an E2-Ub conjugate to one of our RING dimer/B-box trimer models. The two RING subunits that form the dimer were connected to their corresponding B-boxes by 12-residue linkers, whereas the third RING was connected by a longer and more flexible 23-residue linker. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>, we were able to identify stereochemically acceptable conformations that simultaneously allow trimerization of the B-box, dimerization of two RINGs, binding of the RING dimer to a Ub-conjugated E2, and positioning of the appropriate lysine in the third RING for nucleophilic attack of the E2-Ub thioester bond. Thus, although our modeling approach is somewhat crude, the results indicate that B-box trimerization is compatible with RING activation and TRIM5α self-ubiquitination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Hexagonal lattice model for avid capsid binding</title><p>The 'pattern recognition' model of capsid binding postulates that higher-order assembly of TRIM5α into a hexagonal lattice positions multiple SPRY domains to match both the orientations and spacing of their binding epitopes on the capsid surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Our studies are consistent with this model, and further indicate that three-fold symmetric interactions at the vertexes of the hexagonal net are directly mediated by the B-box 2 domain. Indeed, our analysis suggests a 'rank order' of avidity promoting interactions, beginning with the 'minimal' coiled-coil dimer unit that positions (or clusters) two SPRY domains to bind the capsid simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldstone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Javanbakht et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yap et al., 2007</xref>). In principle, higher-order assembly of any geometry can amplify the recognition and restriction activities of the minimal dimer unit, but complete avidity and full restriction seem to occur when the TRIM5 dimers are arranged to match the lattice symmetry of the capsid. This principle appears exemplified by the L105A and W117A B-box mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Like WT, the L105A mutant was fully restriction competent, bound to CA tubes efficiently in vitro, and formed observable hexagonal decorations on the tubes. In contrast, the W117A mutant was impaired in all three activities, even though it can clearly assemble spontaneously into higher-order but non-hexagonal arrays in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>TRIM lattice flexibility and curvature</title><p>Previous studies have analyzed how idealized (flat) capsid and TRIM lattices align in projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldstone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weinert et al., 2015</xref>). This is reasonable because facets of the capsid surface are approximately flat, and because flat TRIM5α lattices assemble on two-dimensional crystals of the HIV-1 capsid protein. However, retroviral capsids present highly curved surfaces for TRIM5 binding, and the TRIM lattice must accommodate this curvature. Our structures demonstrate that the B-box/coiled-coil interface acts as a ball-and-socket joint, which imparts considerable flexibility in the way the coiled-coil arms emanate from the three-fold symmetric vertexes. Interestingly, our models define two major trajectories along which the coiled-coil can swing relative to the trimer plane (approximately parallel and approximately perpendicular). Motions parallel to the trimer plane change the angle between adjacent coiled-coils emanating from a vertex. This is consistent with the observation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al. (2016)</xref> that the vertex angles in TRIM hexagonal lattices can deviate significantly from the ideal value of 120°, even in flat lattices. In our models, the coiled-coil can make an arc of about 12° along this trajectory. Angles between coiled-coil arms would therefore range from 120° ± 24°, which accounts for the full range of observed values (100–144°) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Perpendicular motions, on the other hand, modulate the concavity of the triskelion and can generate lattice curvature. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E and F</xref> illustrate how the structural flexibility described above can allow the assembling TRIM lattice to scan for the most favorable SPRY domain positions and optimize local binding interactions, while simultaneously following the curvature of the bound capsid.</p><p>Flexibility in the triskelion arms also suggests a straightforward mechanism for generating multilayered TRIM assemblies, because a coiled-coil can extend a B-box 2 domain above or below its current lattice plane to nucleate a new lattice. TRIM5α lattices in vitro are frequently multilayered, whether spontaneously assembled or nucleated by capsid templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>; and this study). We speculate that the so-called cytoplasmic bodies that form upon overexpression of TRIM5α in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stremlau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell et al., 2007</xref>) might also assemble in this manner.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Flexibility in B-box/B-box interactions</title><p>Our finding that miniTRIMs can form quasi-equivalent dimers and trimers uncovers yet another mode of flexibility in TRIM5α self-assembly. B-box dimers are clearly disfavored under our 'ideal' in vitro conditions wherein full-length TRIM5α assembles into hexagonal arrays. In principle, however, B-box dimers provide a means for extending the TRIM array in regions where the local assembly environment disfavors trimers. Indeed, apparent dimer linkages can be occasionally discerned in TRIM-coated capsids in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, B-box dimerization is associated with local bending of the first two turns of the coiled-coil helix, as well as altered packing of the B-box against the coiled-coil domain. This suggests a potential mechanism of allosteric communication that can link B-box oligomerization and coiled-coil dynamics. Indeed, our observation that the L105A mutant could not assemble into flat arrays while remaining competent in forming curved arrays is another indication of a structural and functional link between B-box/B-box interactions, the coiled-coil dimer scaffold, and lattice curvature.</p><p>B-box mediated interactions also promote dimerization of the upstream RING domain and E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pertel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yudina et al., 2015</xref>). The catalytically active RING configuration is more structurally compatible with a B-box dimer, and it is therefore possible that the B-box switches its oligomeric configuration to facilitate enzymatic function. In principle, it is possible for a RING-containing subunit to act simultaneously as ligase and ubiquitination substrate within the same E2-Ub/E3 complex, as biochemically demonstrated for the RING domain of RNF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plechanovová et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, our modeling studies also support a mechanism by which the B-box trimer could contribute to TRIM5α self-ubiquitination. Specifically, a B-box trimer could bring together three RINGs, with the first two acting as the E3 ligase and the third acting as the substrate. More important, our analysis further suggests that folding of the RING/B-box linker into a 4-helix bundle restricts the RING dimer to the outer surface of the TRIM hexagonal lattice, i.e., on the opposite side of the capsid binding surface. We suggest that this spatial compartmentalization facilitates formation of exposed polyubiquitin chains that can recruit downstream cytosolic factors to promote restriction and/or interferon signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>MiniTRIM construction, expression, and purification</title><p>Synthetic DNA (Genewiz, Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) encoding the RBcc miniTRIM sequence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and upstream His-tag and yeast Smt3p (SUMO) leader sequence was subcloned into pET30a (Novagen/EMD Millipore, Germany).

The RING dimer structure was then re-aligned manually, and then rotated to avoid steric clashes. We found that the RING 4-helix bundle was an important restraint that led to identification of only a handful of plausible RING dimer/B-box trimer configurations. The model for the self-ubiquitination complex was created by superimposing one of the RING dimer/miniTRIM trimer models, the crystal structure of the TRIM5α RING dimer in complex with Ubc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yudina et al., 2015</xref>), and the structure of the RNF4 RING dimer in complex with ubiquitin-conjugated Ubc5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plechanovová et al., 2012</xref>). To model the third, substrate RING, the ensemble of 10,000 RING monomer/miniTRIM trimer models was then screened computationally to identify an orientation that placed the appropriate RING lysine (Lys45 or Lys51) within 8 Å of the E2-ubiquitin thioester bond without steric clashes between any of the structural elements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>Coordinates and structure factors are available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org">http://www.rcsb.org</ext-link>: P212121 trimer, 5IEA; C2 dimer, 5EIU; P1 dimer, 5F7T.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Pornillos, Ganser-Pornillos, and Sundquist labs for experimental support and/or critical reading of the manuscript.

Some success has been had with subdomains, but understanding how the domains fit together has been elusive. To address the core TRIM5 assembly, the authors generated B-box domain constructs (RBcc miniTRIM and Bcc miniTRIM) with a truncated coiled-coil domain and hairpin linker that behaved well in solution. R121E mutants disrupted the ability of the miniTRIMs to oligomerize, as shown by size exclusion chromatography. Crystals were obtained with Bcc miniTRIM and multiple structures were solved that overlapped with a previous structure of the B-box 2/coiled-coil dimer. The miniTRIM formed dimers and trimers, the latter with 3 B-box 2 domains at the vertex and a contribution from the N-terminus of the coiled-coil helix. Most were dimers in solution, though the trimer form better matched the hexamer models observed with full-length protein. Mutations that disrupted critical interactions (E102K, K103E, E102K/K103E, E120R, and R121E) were generated in the context of full-length protein and shown to disrupt restriction activity in tissue culture. Expression levels correlated inversely with the ability to assemble and to restrict. All TRIM5 mutants were able to pellet with CA assemblies albeit with reduced efficiency. Mutations that reduced restriction activity (L106A, W117E, L118D, and L132D) prevented or decreased spontaneous assembly of TRIM5-21R into a hexameric lattice, or assembly with CA. The authors then generated models to explain how TRIM5 forms a lattice that accommodates binding to the variable curvature of the retroviral CA lattice, formation of B-box trimers, RING dimers bound to Ub-E2s, as well as proximity of a RING domain K51 to the thioester of Ub-E2. The creative approaches here have paid off. They are beautifully executed and greatly advance our understanding of the structure/function of TRIM5. The manuscript is well written, clear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript from Wagner and colleagues describes the results of experiments aimed at understanding the higher order assembly of TRIM5α on the surface of retroviral capsid cores. TRIM5α is a cytoplasmic restriction factor that recognizes the mature capsid core after viral entry and prevents completion of the first half of the viral replication cycle. TRIM5α contains an N-terminal RING domain, a B-box domain, a coiled coil and a C-terminal PRYSPRY domain. The protein dimerizes via the coiled-coil domain forming an extended linear structure, with the two PRYSPRY (recognition) domains coming together at the center of the dimer. Recent published work has shown that recombinant TRIM proteins representing TRIM5α appear to assemble as a hexameric lattice on the surface of the viral capsid lattice, and that each side of a TRIM hexamer is composed of a dimer. The current paper focuses on understanding multimeric interactions between B-box domains, and suggests that these trimerize to form the three-fold vertices of the TRIM5 lattice. The results also suggest that the TRIM5α lattice has flexibility at the vertices allowing concavity necessary to coat a curved surface (such as the icosahedral capsid shell) as well as flexibility in the angle between the TRIM5α &quot;arms&quot; extending from the B-boxes.</p><p>All experiments focus on &quot;miniTRIMs&quot;, recombinant proteins that contain a B-box and a short segment of the coiled coil held in place by a heterologous coiled-coil hairpin from a bacterial protein. While an alternative structure that also contained a RING domain was made, it failed to crystallize and is not characterized in the study.</p><p>The authors are appropriately cautious about the use of the heavily modified proteins, and there are no major concerns. The implied model including formation of the vertices, a mechanism for allowing concavity, and placement of the RING domains above the TRIM5 plane (and away from the capsid), is logical and should inspire additional work by this and others. The model is also consistent with/supported by the co-submission by Li et al.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>The title should refer to &quot;retrovirus restriction factor&quot; rather than &quot;HIV restriction factor&quot;; the latter implies some sort of specificity, and more importantly, detracts from the very interesting fact that TRIM5α recognizes a conserved higher-order structure rather than a virus-specific epitope or motif. The title maybe also promises more than is in the paper – the focus is exclusively on the B-box, and maybe this would be better specified in the title?</p><p>Results – &quot;our miniTRIM constructs are excellent surrogates for the head regions of the full RBCC motif&quot; is misleading, in particular since not much information is presented for the RBcc miniTRIM.</p><p>In the subsection “Structure-based TRIM5α B-box 2 mutants are impaired in restriction and capsid binding”, third paragraph – in the absence of quantitation, the section suggesting an inverse correlation between expression levels and assembly seems like a bit of a stretch.
