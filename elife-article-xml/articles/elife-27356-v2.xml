The transition between the two cell states, termed commitment, is poorly understood. Here, we characterise commitment by integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data from disaggregated primary human keratinocytes held in suspension to induce differentiation. Cell detachment induces several protein phosphatases, five of which - DUSP6, PPTC7, PTPN1, PTPN13 and PPP3CA – promote differentiation by negatively regulating ERK MAPK and positively regulating AP1 transcription factors. Conversely, DUSP10 expression antagonises commitment. The phosphatases form a dynamic network of transient positive and negative interactions that change over time, with DUSP6 predominating at commitment. Boolean network modelling identifies a mandatory switch between two stable states (stem and differentiated) via an unstable (committed) state. Phosphatase expression is also spatially regulated in vivo and in vitro. We conclude that an auto-regulatory phosphatase network maintains epidermal homeostasis by controlling the onset and duration of commitment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epidermis</kwd><kwd>commitment</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>protein dephosphorylation</kwd><kwd>Boolean networks</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>096540/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oulès</surname><given-names>Bénédicte</given-names></name><name><surname>Liakath-Ali</surname><given-names>Kifayathullah</given-names></name><name><surname>Walko</surname><given-names>Gernot</given-names></name><name><surname>Viswanathan</surname><given-names>Priyalakshmi</given-names></name><name><surname>Watt</surname><given-names>Fiona M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G1100073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pisco</surname><given-names>Angela Oliveira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>108058/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lamond</surname><given-names>Angus I</given-names></name><name><surname>Ly</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of transcriptomics, proteomics and modelling identifies a network of interacting protein phosphatases that act as a biological switch to move cells from the stem cell compartment to the differentiated compartment in cultured human epidermis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Commitment is a transient state during which a cell becomes restricted to a particular differentiated fate. Under physiological conditions, commitment is typically irreversible and involves selecting one differentiation pathway at the expense of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nimmo et al., 2015</xref>). While commitment is a well-defined concept in developmental biology, it is still poorly understood in the context of adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Simons and Clevers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Semrau and van Oudenaarden, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nimmo et al., 2015</xref>). This is because end-point analysis fails to capture dynamic changes in cell state, and rapid cell state transitions can depend on post-translational events, such as protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</xref>).</p><p>We set out to examine commitment in human interfollicular epidermis, which is a multi-layered epithelium formed by keratinocytes and comprises the outer covering of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Watt, 2014</xref>). The stem cell compartment lies in the basal layer, attached to an underlying basement membrane. Cells that leave the basal layer undergo a process of terminal differentiation as they move through the suprabasal layers. In the final stage of terminal differentiation, the cell nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles are lost and cells assemble an insoluble barrier, called the cornified envelope, which is formed of transglutaminase cross-linked proteins and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Watt, 2014</xref>). We have previously shown that keratinocytes can commit to terminal differentiation at any phase of the cell cycle, and upon commitment they are refractory to extracellular matrix-mediated inhibition of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Watt, 1989</xref>).</p><p>Although there are currently no markers of epidermal commitment, we have previously used suspension-induced differentiation of disaggregated human keratinocytes in methylcellulose-containing medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Watt, 1989</xref>) to define its timing. Here, we use this simple experimental model to identify markers of commitment and discover why it is a transient state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynamic expression of protein phosphatases during suspension-induced differentiation</title><p>Since keratinocytes increase in size as they differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Watt, 1989</xref>), we enriched for undifferentiated cells by filtration prior to placing them in suspension for up to 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Live-cell imaging was used to monitor cell growth for 3 days post-transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Knocking down seven of the phosphatases significantly increased clonal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), with five phosphatases – DUSP6, PPTC7, PTPN1, PTPN13 and PPP3CA - having the most pronounced effect (p-value&lt;0.001). Silencing of these five phosphatases also increased colony size and delayed the loss of colony forming ability in suspension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c–d</xref>).

Knocking down each phosphatase did not have a major effect on the growth rate of keratinocytes and live-cell imaging did not reveal any apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2e</xref>). Cumulatively, the effects on keratinocyte self-renewal and differentiation suggest that DUSP6, PPTC7, PTPN1, PTPN13 and PPP3CA are pro-commitment protein phosphatases.</p><p>The effects of knocking down DUSP10 at 0 hr differed from those of the other five phosphatases. DUSP10 knockdown significantly reduced clonogenicity (p-value&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>) and, in contrast to the other phosphatases, decreased the growth rate of keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b,e</xref>). In addition, whereas expression of DUSP6, PPTC7, PTPN1, PTPN13 and PPP3CA declined by 8 hr in suspension, DUSP10 expression remained high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Taken together, their effects on keratinocyte self-renewal and differentiation suggest that all six are commitment-associated protein phosphatases, with DUSP10 differing from the other phosphatases in potentially antagonising commitment.</p><p>To examine the effect of knocking down the pro-commitment phosphatases on the ability of keratinocytes to reconstitute a multi-layered epithelium, we seeded cells on de-epidermised human dermis and cultured them at the air-medium interface for three weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2f,g</xref>). Knockdown of DUSP6, PTPN1, PPP3CA and PTPN13 did not prevent cells from undergoing terminal differentiation, as evidenced by suprabasal expression of involucrin and accumulation of cornified cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2f</xref>). However, the number of TP63-positive cells was increased, whether measured as a proportion of the total number of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>) or per length of basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2g</xref>). Knockdown of DUSP6, PTPN1 or PPP3CA increased epidermal thickness without increasing the proportion of proliferative, Ki67-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2g</xref>). Conversely, PTPN13 knockdown led to an increase in the percentage of Ki67-positive cells and a slight reduction in epidermal thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>), which could reflect an increased rate of transit through the epidermal layers. In addition, Ki67 and TP63-positive cells were no longer confined to the basal cell layer of epidermis reconstituted following phosphatase knockdown but were also present throughout the viable suprabasal layers.</p><p>To complement our studies with siRNAs, which achieve transient knockdown, we performed stable knockdown of the pro-commitment phosphatases with shRNA lentiviral vectors (two different shRNAs per target; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>) and performed epidermal reconstitution experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3b,c</xref>).

Furthermore, many suprabasal cells co-expressed TP63 and IVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3f</xref>).

These effects are consistent with the known requirement for ERK MAPK activity to maintain keratinocytes in the stem cell compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Trappmann et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Transcriptional regulation of epidermal differentiation is mediated by the Activator Protein 1 (AP1) family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eckert et al., 2013</xref>), which is the main effector of the MAPK and ErbB signalling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang and Karin, 2001</xref>). Quantification of the levels of AP1 transcripts during suspension-induced terminal differentiation revealed that different AP1 factors changed with different kinetics, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gandarillas and Watt, 1995</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Notably, the level of several members of the MAF subfamily of AP1 factors (MAF, MAFB and MAFG) significantly increased during differentiation, consistent with recent evidence that they mediate the terminal differentiation program in human keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lopez-Pajares et al., 2015</xref>). In line with these observations, knockdown of individual pro-commitment phosphatases reduced the induction of MAF AP1 factors in suspension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). These experiments are consistent with a model whereby induction of phosphatases in committed keratinocytes causes dephosphorylation of ERK MAPK and prevents the increase in expression of AP1 transcription factors that execute the terminal differentiation program.</p><p>Given that DUSP10 knockdown differed from the other protein phosphatases in decreasing the clonogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>) and growth rate of keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b,e</xref>), we examined the effect of DUSP10 knockdown on ERK1/2 activity and AP1 factor expression. Unlike knockdown of DUSP6, PPTC7, PTPN1, PTPN13 or PPP3CA, knockdown of DUSP10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>) did not increase ERK1/2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g,h</xref>). Consistent with its known regulation of p38 MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caunt and Keyse, 2013</xref>), DUSP10 knockdown increased phospho-p38 at 0 hr; however, this effect was not observed at later times in suspension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>). When the effects of DUSP10 knockdown on AP1 transcription factors were compared with those of DUSP6, it was clear that these phosphatases differentially regulated several AP1 factors, including members of the JUN, FOS and MAF subfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>).</p><p>We confirmed the differing effects of DUSP10 and DUSP6 on cell fate by using either Cumate or Doxycycline inducible overexpression in human keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e–g</xref>).

To do so, we employed a Boolean network abstraction and constructed a model in which all phosphatases, DUSP6, PPTC7, PTPN1, PTPN13, PPP3CA and DUSP10, were allowed to interact either positively or negatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). For this we utilised the concept of an Abstract Boolean Network (ABN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yordanov et al., 2016</xref>), which by assigning definite or possible interactions, implicitly defines approximately 10<sup>17</sup> concrete different Boolean network models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In accordance with this modelling formalism, we abstracted discretised gene expression levels as ‘on’ or ‘off’ if their mean expression was respectively higher or similar/lower than the average of all genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). From the set of all possible Boolean networks (the ABN), we sought to test whether there would be a network consistent with the discretised gene expression states over the differentiation time course. To this end, we employed the automated reasoning approach encapsulated in the tool RE:IN, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dunn et al., 2014</xref>. We encoded a set of experimental constraints comprising the different time points analysed during suspension-induced differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). These constraints define whether each gene should be on or off at each time step along the differentiation trajectory (Materials and methods). Using this approach, we formally deduced that a single Boolean network was unable to recapitulate the measured gene expression dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>).</p><p>As we were not able to find a single interaction network sufficient to model the discretised gene expression states, we further investigated each individual time point to identify whether the network topology might differ over the time course in suspension. To obtain the necessary experimental data to identify critical network interactions, we performed individual knockdowns of the phosphatases after 0, 4, 8 or 12 hr in suspension. Next, we measured by RT-qPCR the effect that each individual knockdown had on the mRNA level of any of the other phosphatases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>) at each time point. We used the fold-change of the interaction to inform its directionality (activating or inhibitory) only if it was statistically significant (p-value&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>).

Using the discretised gene expression levels defined above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>), we sought to test whether the network topologies derived for each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>) were consistent with the data. For this we used an extension of RE:IN, called RE:SIN, which allows the user to explore switching networks, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shavit et al. (2016)</xref>. RE:SIN allowed us to determine whether the inferred networks could recapitulate the dynamic changes in gene expression by similarly encoding these as expected states on the commitment trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). We first found that the networks inferred by the genetic knockdown experiments could not satisfy the experimental constraints. This suggested that there were additional interactions between the phosphatases. To identify such interactions, we analysed the effect that each individual knockdown had on the protein levels of the other phosphatases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>) and the effect of DUSP6 and DUSP10 overexpression on phosphatase mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2e</xref>). We included those as possible interactions, again using the concept of an ABN at each time step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>).</p><p>By defining an ABN at each time point that incorporates the possible phosphatase interactions deduced from the knockdown experiments, we found that the experimental constraints could be satisfied. Furthermore, our analysis revealed which of the possible interactions were required to meet these constraints. These could therefore be considered as definite interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We thus used the approach encapsulated in RE:SIN to uncover the networks governing differentiation at each time point.</p><p>The Boolean network analysis indicates a key role for DUSP6 at commitment (4 hr), when DUSP6 expression is positively regulated by all the other phosphatases in the network and by a self-activating loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). In contrast, at all other time points the interactions between individual phosphatases were predominantly negative. Several phosphatases, including PTPN1 and PTPN13, showed positive autoregulation at one or more time point. It is also notable that DUSP10 was predominantly negatively regulated by other phosphatases, except at 4 hr, when it was positively regulated by PTPN1 and by an autoregulatory loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).</p><p>To test the robustness of the network, we examined the effects of treating keratinocytes with the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) and a Protein Kinase C inhibitor (PKCi). Both drugs blocked suspension-induced terminal differentiation, as measured by expression of IVL and TGM1, and prevented downregulation of ITGα6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b,c</xref>). However, cells treated with TSA still underwent commitment, as evaluated by loss of colony-forming ability and downregulation of TP63, whereas those treated with the PKC inhibitor did not. At 12 hr in suspension, both drugs reduced expression of DUSP10 and PTPN13 and increased expression of DUSP6 and PPTC7 relative to untreated cells; however, they differentially affected PPP3CA and PTPN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).</p><p>We next used our modelling approach to test whether network switching still occurs under PKCi and TSA treatment using the constrained ABNs that we derived for each stage. As before, we discretised gene expression levels from these experiments as ‘on’ or ‘off’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). Under both treatments, we found that we could not transit through the networks while respecting the expected expression states, corroborating the experimental findings that terminal differentiation is blocked in these conditions. The PKCi phosphatase expression pattern at 12 hr was compatible with the phosphatase interaction network derived at 0 hr, supporting the conclusion that PKCi arrests cells in the stem cell compartment. In TSA-treated cells the network must switch from that derived at 0 hr to that derived at 4 hr, and subsequently to that derived at 8 hr, or straight from 0 hr to 8 hr. Neither PKCi nor TSA treatment resulted in an expression pattern compatible with the network derived at 12 hr for untreated cells, consistent with the inhibition of differentiation.</p><p>The above findings can be summarised using dynamical systems terminology. Epidermal differentiation can be described by two saddle-node bifurcations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e,f</xref>). We start with a single minimum that corresponds to a stable state: the stem cell. Then we pass through a first saddle-node bifurcation where we have two minima, so the system can switch from one state to the other and this corresponds to commitment. Next the global minimum changes and we finally have a second saddle-node bifurcation that leads again to a single steady state, which corresponds to the differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). From here, the stem cell state and the terminally differentiated state emerge as stable states, while commitment is inherently unstable and serves as a biological switch.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Protein phosphatase expression is patterned within human epidermis and responds to topographical cues</title><p>Given the role of the protein phosphatases in regulating commitment of keratinocytes in suspension, we examined whether phosphatase expression was also subject to spatial regulation, since spatiotemporal coordination of stem cell behaviour contributes to epidermal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doupé and Jones, 2012</xref>). By wholemount labelling the basal layer of sheets of human epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jensen et al., 1999</xref>), we found that DUSP6, PTPN1 and PPP3CA were most highly expressed in cells with the highest levels of β1 integrin or α6 integrin, which correspond to stem cell clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jensen et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3a,b</xref>). In contrast, PPTC7 was enriched in the integrin-low regions, while PTPN13 and DUSP10 were more uniformly expressed throughout the basal layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3a,b</xref>). The inverse relationship between the patterns of PPP3CA and PPTC7 expression is in good agreement with the network analysis demonstrating negative regulation of PPP3CA by PPTC7 in undifferentiated keratinocytes (0 hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).</p><p>The patterned distribution of phosphatases could be recreated in vitro by culturing keratinocytes on collagen-coated PDMS elastomer substrates that mimic the topographical features of the human epidermal-dermal interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Viswanathan et al., 2016</xref>). We observed clusters of cells with high levels of DUPS6 on the tops of the features, where stem cells expressing high levels of β1 integrins accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Viswanathan et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). In contrast, DUSP10 was uniformly expressed regardless of cell position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). These results indicate that the phosphatases are subject to spatial regulation that is independent of signals from cells in the underlying dermis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have presented evidence that epidermal commitment is a biological switch controlled by a network of protein phosphatases that are regulated spatially and temporally. Applying Boolean network analysis to our experimental data, we were unable to recapitulate the observed changes in phosphatase gene expression using a single ABN, but we could do so by implementing a scheme of network switching. This led us to conclude that the interactions among the commitment phosphatases change in the course of differentiation. The negative feedback loops predominating at 0, 8 and 12 hr are known to result in stable phenotypes because the network is able to counteract additional inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zeigler et al., 2000</xref>). However, at 4 hr all but one of the interactions were positive. Positive feedback loops lead to instability, because the network amplifies any inputs it receives. This supports the concept of commitment as an unstable state, which aligns with the experimental evidence of that happening within a defined temporal window.</p><p>The key role of DUPS6 at commitment fits well with its upregulation by Serum Response Factor, which is known to control keratinocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Connelly et al., 2010</xref>), and its importance in controlling the activation kinetics and dose-response behaviour of ERK MAPK signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blüthgen et al., 2009</xref>). However, the involvement of multiple phosphatases in commitment may protect cells from undergoing premature terminal differentiation. Furthermore, their patterned distribution within the epidermal basal layer would be consistent with different phosphatases regulating commitment in different positions along the basement membrane, and with the ability of different external stimuli to trigger differentiation via different intracellular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Watt, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The upregulation of basal layer markers in the suprabasal epidermal layers on knockdown of pro-commitment phosphatases mimics features of psoriatic lesions in which ERK is known to be upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haase et al., 2001</xref>). In particular, in the epidermal reconstitution assays there was suprabasal expression of Ki67 and TP63, with TP63+ cells co-expressing IVL. These observations lead us to speculate that commitment is abnormally stabilised in psoriasis, as observed in TSA treated keratinocytes in suspension. Given that protein phosphatases within the commitment network are known to regulate expression of inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caunt and Keyse, 2013</xref>), deregulated phosphatase expression could potentially contribute to the pathophysiology of psoriasis.</p><p>In conclusion, the simple experimental model of suspension-induced keratinocyte differentiation has enabled us to capture some of the complex transcriptional and post-translational events that control the transition from the stem to the differentiated cell compartment. We now have the opportunity to explore, systematically, the key upstream and downstream regulators of protein phosphatases during epidermal homeostasis, injury and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Primary human keratinocytes (strain km) were isolated from neonatal foreskin and cultured on mitotically inactivated 3T3-J2 cells in complete FAD medium, containing one part Ham's F12, three parts Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM), 10<sup>−4</sup> M adenine, 10% (v/v) FBS, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10<sup>−10</sup> M cholera toxin and 10 ng/ml EGF, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gandarillas and Watt, 1995</xref>).

Briefly, a set of possible and definite interactions comprises an Abstract Boolean Network (ABN), which implicitly defines a set of concrete Boolean networks. Each concrete network has a unique topology defined by the different combinations of the possible interactions, which can be present or absent. This allows the user to explore alternative model topologies, and to test the requirement for different interactions that are suggested by experimental data. The software allows the user to seek the set of concrete Boolean network models that are consistent with a set of experimental constraints, and then to use this constrained set of models to make predictions of untested behaviour. Experimental constraints are defined as expected states along network trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), which are constructed from discretised gene expression patterns. The software is freely available to use and can be accessed together with tutorials and FAQ at research.microsoft.com/rein.</p><p>We considered Boolean networks with synchronous updates, such that each gene in the network updates at each step in the network trajectory. Logical update functions for each gene, which define how the gene switches on or off in response to its regulators, were as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yordanov et al., 2016</xref>. We first used RE:IN to test whether a single network (one that does not switch along the differentiation trajectory) is consistent with the observed changes in gene expression. We tested all possible single networks by allowing possible positive and negative interactions between each pair of genes. None of these networks was found to be consistent with the gene expression changes. We next constructed a switching problem in which we defined four ABNs, which individually correspond to the time points measured in our knockdown experiments. We defined the allowable network switching to be monotonic: networks can progress forward in time (i.e. 0 hr to 4 hr, 0 hr to 8 hr etc.) but not backwards (i.e. 8 hr cannot switch to 4 hr or 0 hr). We then used RE:SIN to test whether it was possible to find a sequence of networks that allowed the gene expression changes to be satisfied. We found that this was possible, and, furthermore, identified interactions that were required/disallowed to meet the constraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Defining constraints for Boolean network analysis</title><p>The network governing differentiation must be consistent with observed changes in gene expression patterns over time.

Individual gene expression measurements were discretised as ‘on’ or ‘off’ if their mean expression was respectively higher or similar/lower than the average of all genes.

Light labelled cells served as the 0 hr sample whereas heavy labelled cells were suspended in methylcellulose and harvested at 4, 8 and 12 hr. Cell extracts prepared from 0 h cells were mixed individually with 4, 8 and 12 hr samples at a 1:1 ratio of total protein.

The sequences of the siRNA oligos are provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>shRNA infection</title><p>shRNA lentiviral vectors were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Mission shRNA). Two shRNAs per target were chosen. Their sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">Supplementary file 12</xref>. Primary keratinocytes were transduced with lentiviral particles for 48 hr, before being subjected to 2 μg/ml Puromycin selection for 72 hr. Cells were then expanded for experimental analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Doxycycline and cumate inducible overexpression</title><p>For the Doxycycline inducible system we used the pCW57-GFP-2A-MCS lentiviral vector (gift from Adam Karpf; Addgene plasmid # 71783). Primary keratinocytes were transduced with lentiviral particles containing protein expression vector encoding genes for wild-type DUSP6, mutant DUSP6<sup>C293S</sup> and DUSP10. 2 days post-transduction, cells were subjected to 2 μg/ml Puromycin selection for 3 days and then 1 µg/ml Doxycycline was added to the growth medium.</p><p>For Cumate induction, we used the lentiviral QM812B-1 expression vector (System Biosciences). Cells were transduced and selected as described for the Doxycycline system and protein expression was induced by addition of 30 µg/ml Cumate solution to the growth medium.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Clonogenicity assays</title><p>One-hundred, 500 or 1000 keratinocytes were plated on a 3T3 feeder layer per 10 cm diameter dish or per well of a six-well dish. After 12 days, feeders were removed and keratinocyte colonies were fixed in 10% formalin (Sigma) for 10 min then stained with 1% Rhodanile Blue (1:1 mixture of Rhodamine B and Nile Blue A [Acros Organics]). Colonies were scored using ImageJ and clonogenicity was calculated as the percentage of plated cells that formed colonies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Skin reconstitution assays</title><p>Pre-confluent keratinocyte cultures (km) were disaggregated and transfected with SMART pool siRNAs or non-targeting control siRNAs, or with lentiviral shRNAs. 24 hr post-siRNA transfection or &gt;7 days post-shRNA infection, keratinocytes were collected and reseeded on irradiated de-epidermised human dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sen et al., 2010</xref>) in six-well Transwell plates with feeders and cultured at the air–liquid interface for 3 weeks. The cultures were then fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (overnight), paraffin embedded and sectioned for histological staining. 6 μm thick sections were labelled with haematoxylin and eosin or appropriate antibodies. H and E stained images were acquired with a Hamamatsu slide scanner and analysed using NanoZoomer software (Hamamatsu).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Automated analysis of skin reconstitution assays</title><p>H and E stained sections were scanned with a Hamamatsu slide scanner and analysed in Python. Briefly, tissue sections were automatically detected based on k-means segmentation, and colours were rebalanced. The epidermis was then isolated by colour separation (extraction of haematoxylin color channels by a deconvolution algorithm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ruifrok and Johnston, 2001</xref>). After performing an automatic thresholding, epidermal area was measured by pixel counting. To measure epidermal thickness, the area was divided by a 1-pixel wide reduced-topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van der Walt et al., 2014</xref>). Full script is available as Supplementary Source Code 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immunofluorescence staining of cultured cells and reconstituted skin</title><p>For IVL staining of cells in suspension, cells were recovered from methylcellulose, spun down onto a slide using a Cytospin and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilised. Sections of paraffin embedded reconstituted skin were dewaxed, rehydrated and subjected to heat-mediated antigen retrieval. Immunofluorescence labelling of cells and sections was performed with the appropriate antibodies. Wherever indicated, DAPI was used to label nuclei. Image acquisition was performed using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc.). To determine % antibody-labelled cells in sections, the total numbers of labelled cells and DAPI+ cells were assessed in Image J using the Cell Counter plugin. To determine the number of labelled cells per μm of basement membrane, the number of labelled cells was divided by the length of the basement membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Cells were lysed on ice in 1x RIPA buffer (Bio-Rad) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche). Total protein was quantified using a BCA kit (Pierce). Soluble proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4–15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto Trans-Blot 0.2 µm PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) using the Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad). Primary antibody probed blots were visualised with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham). The ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad) was used to image the blots. Quantification of detected bands was performed using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).

Skin samples from either breast or abdomen were obtained as surgical waste with appropriate ethical approval and treated with Dispase (Corning) overnight on ice at 4°C. The epidermis was peeled off as an intact sheet and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hr. Fixed epidermal sheets were washed and stored in PBS containing 0.2% sodium azide at 4°C. Sheets were permeabilised and stained with specific antibodies in a 24-well tissue culture plate. Image acquisition was performed using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope. 3D maximal projection (1024 × 1024 dpi), volume rendering and deconvolution on stacked images were generated using NIS Elements version 4.00.04 (Nikon Instruments Inc.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Antibodies against the following proteins were used: P-ERK (Cell Signaling # 9101; western blot – 1:1000 dilution), ERK (Cell Signaling # 9102; western blot – 1:1000), P-p38 (Cell Signaling # 9211; western blot – 1:1000), p38 (Cell Signaling # 9212; western blot – 1:1000), Cyclophilin B (R and D # MAB5410; western blot – 1:4000), MKP-3/DUSP6 (Abcam # ab76310; western blot - 1:1000 and R and D Systems # MAB3576-SP; immunostaining – 1:200), PPTC7 (Abcam # ab122548; western-blot 1:250 and Sigma # HPA039335; immunostaining – 1:200), PTPN1/PTP1B (Sigma # HPA012542; western-blot - 1:500; R and D Systems # AF1366-SP; immunostaining – 1:200), PTPN13 (R and D Systems # AF3577; western-blot - 1:300 and immunostaining – 1:200), PPP3CA/Calcineurin A (Sigma # HPA012778; western-blot 1/1000 and R and D Systems # MAB2839-SP; immunostaining – 1:200), DUSP10 (Abcam # 140123; western-blot - 1:1000 and immunostaining – 1:200), TP63 (SCBT # sc-8431 or Abcam # ab735; immunostaining – 1:100), Involucrin (SY5, in-house; immunostaining – 1:500, or DH1, in-house; immunostaining – 1:200), Ki67 (Abcam # ab16667; immunostaining – 1:100) and β1-Integrin (clone P5D2, in-house; immunostaining – 1:200).

Mishra et al. use human epidermal keratinocytes to explore this process. The authors induce keratinocyte differentiation using suspension cultures and perform analysis of gene and protein expression. This analysis revealed a set of phosphatases that promote keratinocyte differentiation, while another phosphatase, DUSP10, antagonizes commitment to differentiate. The authors validate their findings using siRNA knockdown and in vitro epidermal reconstitution assays. Pro-commitment phosphatases negatively regulate MAPK signaling and positively regulate the transcription factor AP1 to promote differentiation. In silico analysis suggests that commitment to differentiate is controlled by an autoregulatory network of phosphatases in human epidermal keratinocytes.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the data shown are of general interest to the field of cell biology.

These skin constructs are taken out for 3 weeks which is outside the range of the efficacy of siRNAs (3-5 days), it is unclear how to interpret the results.

We now clearly refer to Yordanov et al. (2016), where all mathematical details of the modelling approach are explained. We also provide the necessary information to enable readers to understand how we implemented this approach, including the set of possible and definite interactions that comprise our Abstract Boolean Networks (ABNs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, newly included Figure 4—figure supplement 7, and revised Figure 4—tablesupplements 8, 9) and the definition of the constraints that we encoded into RE:IN / RE:SIN. Together with the expanded Materials and methods section, the revised manuscript provides a comprehensive explanation of the modelling approach we implemented.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Additionally, the characterization of the temporal regulation of the network is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript to make this clear. First, we tested whether a single Boolean network could be consistent with the experimentally observed changes in gene expression states associated with different lengths of time in suspension. Briefly, we exploited the concept of an Abstract Boolean Network (ABN) to define allpossible networks that could exist between the phosphatases we considered. Thus, we encoded an ABN in which possible positive and negative interactions existed between each pair of phosphatases. We then used the gene expression data to define expected states along the differentiation trajectory, which should be satisfied by a valid network model. We used the time measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) as a proxy for the number of steps along the trajectory (e.g. the expression measurements at 3h should occur after 3 steps on the network trajectory). Finally, RE:IN allowed us to test all concrete networks defined by this ABN. We found that, computationally, a single network of positive and negative interactions between the protein phosphatases (Figure 4—figure supplement 7A) could not simulate the differences in gene expression observed experimentally as a function of time in suspension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We therefore introduced a new concept: the interaction network between the phosphatases could change over time. We defined ABNs for each time step (the topologies of which were informed by our knockdown experiments) and sought to identify networks for each time point that were consistent with the measured gene expression states. We translated our experimental data, relating both to changes in time and the effects of PKC inhibition and TSA treatment, into computational steps (‘active’ for upregulated, ‘inactive’ for downregulated), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. In this way every iteration step of the network analysis corresponds to temporal progression in real time. With this approach we could successfully model the changes in the phosphatase interaction network that occur over time in suspension. The revised manuscript now includes an extensive explanation of the iteration scheme used to perform the computational analysis (Materials and methods subsection “Dynamical Boolean Network Analysis”; Results subsection “A protein phosphatase interaction network acts as a switch to transition cells between the stem and differentiated cell compartments” main text pages 7 – 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Knockdown the genes permanently (shRNA delivery by lenti or retroviruses) or knockout of DUSP6, PTPN1, and PPP3CA.

Although the efficacy of the siRNAs is indeed a matter of days, the consequences of knocking down the phosphatases in stem cells are nevertheless long-term since they affect cell fate decisions that are manifested during the terminal differentiation programme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along these lines, DUSP10 knockdown should be compared to scrambled siRNA rather than DUSP6 knockdown (DUSP6 knockdown reduced expression of AP1 transcription factors and thus comparing anything against this group could make the DUSP10 knockdown look like its artificially increasing the AP1 transcription factors.)</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the reviewers are referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>.
