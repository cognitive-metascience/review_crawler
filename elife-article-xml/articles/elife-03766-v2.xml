Previous research suggested that AtCERK1 is the major chitin receptor and mediates chitin-induced signaling through homodimerization and phosphorylation. However, the reported chitin binding affinity of AtCERK1 is quite low, suggesting another receptor with high chitin binding affinity might be present. Here, we propose that AtLYK5 is the primary chitin receptor in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Mutations in AtLYK5 resulted in a significant reduction in chitin response. However, AtLYK5 shares overlapping function with AtLYK4 and, therefore, <italic>Atlyk4/Atlyk5-2</italic> double mutants show a complete loss of chitin response. AtLYK5 interacts with AtCERK1 in a chitin-dependent manner. Chitin binding to AtLYK5 is indispensable for chitin-induced AtCERK1 phosphorylation. AtLYK5 binds chitin at a much higher affinity than AtCERK1. The data suggest that AtLYK5 is the primary receptor for chitin, forming a chitin inducible complex with AtCERK1 to induce plant immunity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03766.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03766.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03766.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Invading fungi are responsible for many of the plant diseases that affect global crop production. Plants have to be able to identify these fungi, and activate the right defense strategies if they are to protect themselves. Chitin is a polymer that is found in the cell walls of all fungi, but not in plants, so if the plant detects chitin, it knows that a potentially harmful fungus may be nearby.</p><p>The detection of chitin, and the resulting activation of a plant's defenses, requires a receptor protein called CERK1. In rice, CERK1 needs to interact with another receptor protein called CEBiP, which binds to chitin. However, in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>—which is widely studied in plant research—CERK1 can bind to chitin on its own, although this interaction is very weak, so it has been suggested that a second protein may be involved.</p><p>Cao et al. have now found that a receptor protein called LYK5, which is very similar to CERK1, is much better at attaching to chitin in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. It can also bind to CERK1, but only when chitin is present, and is required for activation of basic plant defenses. The experiments suggest that LYK5 detects chitin on behalf of CERK1, in a similar way to how CEBiP works in rice.</p><p>The next step in this research is to work out how CERK1 and LYK5 are able to activate plant defenses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03766.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03766.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Arabidoposis</italic></kwd><kwd>plant innate immunity</kwd><kwd>chitin receptor</kwd><kwd>CERK1</kwd><kwd>LYK5</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003627</institution-id><institution>Rural Development Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program Systems and Synthetic Agrobiotech CenterPJ009068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stacey</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006151</institution-id><institution>Basic Energy Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-FG02-08ER15309</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stacey</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006206</institution-id><institution>Biological and Environmental Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-06CH11357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joachimiak</surname><given-names>Andrzej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM094585</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joachimiak</surname><given-names>Andrzej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The chitin-triggered immune response is mediated by a LYK5 and CERK1 receptor complex in Arabidopsis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As sessile organisms, plants have developed effective immune systems to defend against invading pathogens. Pathogen perception in plants can be divided into two different layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>). The initial response, mediated by perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), is termed MAMP-triggered immunity (MTI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boller and Felix, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Macho and Zipfel, 2014</xref>). MTI is characterized by a wide range of physiological responses, including production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, calcium influx, ion channel activation, callose deposition, growth inhibition, and expression of defense-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Macho and Zipfel, 2014</xref>). However, adapted pathogens can inhibit MTI through the secretion of specific effector proteins or small RNAs into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weiberg et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2014</xref>). In response, plants have evolved polymorphic nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) proteins that either directly or indirectly recognize these effectors; thereby, restoring plant immunity. This form of immunity is termed effector-triggered immunity (ETI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bent and Mackey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boller and Felix, 2009</xref>). Compared to MTI, ETI is much stronger and often associated with a hypersensitive response (HR), which involves programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Plants use cell-surface localized pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect MAMPs activating MTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boller and Felix, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Macho and Zipfel, 2014</xref>). In plants, several PRRs have been well characterized, including FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2) and elongation factor-TU (EF-Tu) RECEPTOR (EFR), which detect bacterial flagellin and EF-Tu, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gomez-Gomez and Boller, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zipfel et al., 2006</xref>). These two receptors belong to the leucine rich repeat receptor like protein kinase (LRR-RLK) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shiu and Bleecker, 2001</xref>). Activation of these receptors by ligand binding induces the association with BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1)- Associated receptor Kinase 1 (BAK1) and phosphorylation of Botrytis-Induced Kinase (BIK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chinchilla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heese et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Phosphorylated BIK1 dissociates from the receptor and subsequently phosphorylates the respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (RBOHD) protein, which controls ROS production in a calcium-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kadota et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Other MAMPs, such as the oligosaccharides bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and fungal chitin [degree of polymerization (dp) ≥ 6], are detected by lysin-motif (LysM) containing proteins. The chitin receptor was first reported in rice with the identification of the chitin-elicitor binding protein (CEBiP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaku et al., 2006</xref>), which contains an extracellular LysM motif and a transmembrane domain, but lacks an intracellular kinase domain. Data indicate that CEBiP forms a complex with the rice chitin-elicitor receptor kinase 1 (OsCERK1) to mediate MTI in response to chitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayafune et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shimizu et al., 2010</xref>). OsCERK1 has an active, intracellular kinase domain. The data suggest that OsCERK1 does not bind chitin but its intracellular kinase domain is activated by chitin binding to OsCEBiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayafune et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, AtCERK1 was shown to be a key chitin receptor involved in chitin perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wan et al., 2008</xref>). For example, <italic>Atcerk1</italic> mutant plants completely lose the ability to respond to chitin elicitation. There are three homologs of CEBiP in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, but a triple knock-out mutant, <italic>Atlym1/Atlym2/Atlym3</italic> lacking these three proteins was fully competent to respond to chitin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wan et al., 2012</xref>). However, two CEBiP like proteins appear to function in conjunction with CERK1 to mediate recognition of bacterial PGN (OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 in rice, AtLYM1 and AtLYM3 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Willmann et al., 2011</xref>). Another CEBiP-like protein, AtLYM2, was demonstrated to act independently of AtCERK1 to mediate chitin-induced suppression of intracellular flux through plasmodesmata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faulkner et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there are five members of the lysin-motif receptor like kinase family (LYKs), that is, AtCERK1/LysM RLK1/AtLYK1, and AtLYK2-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wan et al., 2012</xref>). AtCERK1 was reported as the primary chitin receptor based on the mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wan et al., 2008</xref>) but also the fact that the protein can be precipitated by binding to chitin beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iizasa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petutschnig et al., 2010</xref>). The X-ray crystal structure of the ectodomain of AtCERK1 was solved by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al. (2012b)</xref>. The structure predicted interaction of chitin oligomers with the second LysM motif in the extracellular domain. These authors suggested a model by which long chain chitin oligomers (dp ≥ 6) bound to the LysM domains on two monomers, resulting in homodimerization of AtCERK1. This dimerization was shown to activate the intracellular kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petutschnig et al., 2010</xref>). However, there remains the possibility that, similar to the situation in rice, the active chitin receptor is composed of more than one protein. For example, mutations in <italic>AtLYK4</italic> were shown to significantly reduce the plant response to chitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wan et al., 2012</xref>), although the phenotype was not as pronounced as that of <italic>Atcerk1</italic> mutant plants. While the X-ray crystal structure of the ectodomain of AtCERK1 provided evidence that it is indeed a chitin binding protein, a puzzling aspect of this work is the low binding affinity (chitooctaose, K<sub>d</sub> = 45 µM) reported, based on calorimetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>). Another puzzling aspect is that mutations in AtCERK1, predicted to block chitin binding (AtCERK1<sup>A138H</sup>), did not block chitin-induced AtCERK1<sup>A138H</sup> phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>). These data led us to consider the possibility that a second protein may be involved that mediates high affinity chitin binding and works with AtCERK1 to activate MTI.</p><p>In this study, we show that mutations in AtLYK5 result in a significant reduction in the plant chitin response. AtLYK5 is required for chitin-induced AtCERK1 homodimerization and phosphorylation. AtLYK5 binds to chitin with a much higher affinity than AtCERK1. The data suggest that AtLYK5 is the primary receptor for chitin, forming a chitin-inducible complex with AtCER<sc>K1</sc> to induce plant innate immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AtLYK5 is essential for the chitin response in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has five LysM receptor kinases (LYKs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, plants mutated in each of these genes were tested for their ability to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to chitin elicitation. As expected from previous publications, mutations in <italic>AtCERK1</italic> showed strongly reduced ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wan et al., 2008</xref>), while mutations in <italic>AtLYK4</italic> also showed a slight reduction in ROS production upon chitin elicitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wan et al., 2012</xref>). In previous publications, which involved screening <italic>Atlyk1-5</italic> mutants, we reported that a transposon insertion in <italic>AtLYK5</italic> did not affect chitin-induced MTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wan et al, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2012</xref>). This conclusion was based on measuring <italic>AtWRKY53</italic> expression upon chitin addition<italic>.</italic> At the time of these studies, the only <italic>Atlyk5</italic> mutant available was in the Lansberg (Ler) background (<italic>Atlyk5-1</italic>). As part of a new round of screening, we again examined the chitin response of <italic>Atlyk5-1</italic> mutant plants. qRT-PCR analysis showed that chitin treatment induced similar expression of <italic>AtWRKY53</italic> in both Ler wild-type and <italic>Atlyk5-1</italic> mutant plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>); data consistent with the previously published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wan, et al, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2012</xref>). However, in contrast to these results, the expression of <italic>AtWRKY33</italic> 15 min after chitin treatment was significantly reduced in <italic>Atlyk5-1</italic> mutant plants relative to Ler wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Chitin-triggered MAP kinase (MPK) phosphorylation was also significantly reduced in <italic>Atlyk5-1</italic> mutant plants compared with Ler wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The phosphorylated AtCERK1 triggered by chitin elicitation can be detected as a band shift based on immunoblots using anti-AtCERK1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petutschnig et al., 2010</xref>). Chitin-triggered AtCERK1 phosphorylation was detected in Ler wild-type plants but was reduced in <italic>Atlyk5-1</italic> mutant plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In general, based on chitin-triggered ROS production, Ler wild-type plants showed a lower response to chitin than Col-0 plants, while <italic>Atlyk5-1</italic> mutant plants showed similar ROS production to the wild-type when treated with chitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these experiments suggested that our original conclusion concerning AtLYK5 may not be correct; that is, this protein may be involved in chitin response. What is clear is that the <italic>Atlyk5-1</italic> mutant, with a transposon insertion in the 3′ region of the gene, does not exhibit a strong phenotype under all conditions. The analysis of the chitin response in the Ler ecotype is further complicated by the generally weak response to chitin elicitation.</p><p>Given these concerns, we identified and characterized a Col-0 <italic>Atlyk5</italic> mutant (<italic>Atlyk5-2</italic>) from the SALK population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This line has a T-DNA in the extracellular domain of AtLYK5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). It should be noted that in our original publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wan et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2012</xref>), all of the <italic>Atlyk</italic> mutants, with the exception of <italic>Atlyk5-1</italic>, were derived from the Col-0 ecotype. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, chitin-induced ROS production was significantly lower in the <italic>Atlyk5-2</italic> mutant plants compared to Col-O wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Calcium influx is activated by exposure of wild-type plants to chitin. Similar treatment of <italic>Atlyk5-2</italic> mutant plants showed a 90% reduction and a significant delay in the calcium response, while <italic>Atcerk1</italic> mutant plants showed essentially no calcium response to chitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Flagellin-triggered calcium influx in both <italic>Atcerk1</italic> and <italic>Atlyk5-2</italic> mutant plants were similar to Col-0 wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that these defects were specific to chitin and not to a general effect on MTI. MPK3 and MPK6 are specifically phosphorylated upon chitin elicitation in Col-0 wild-type but not in <italic>Atcerk1</italic> mutant plants. Significant reduction in MPK phosphorylation was detected in <italic>Atlyk5-2</italic> mutant plants after chitin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Therefore, in order to predict the chitin binding site(s) within the AtLYK5 extracellular domain, a computational model of the AtLYK5 ectodomain was built by homology modeling against the known crystal structure of the fungal ECP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanchez-Vallet et al., 2013</xref>), a LysM effector protein, which binds chitin with very high affinity (binding at pM levels; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on the docking model of AtLYK5 with chitooctaose, the binding affinity was calculated at −8.9 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), a value comparable to the computational binding affinity of ECP6 (−9.0 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Four residues, that is, Thr-72, Tyr-128, Ser-206, and Ser-216, were predicted to form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with chitooctaose based on docking model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The problem with this model is that it does not account for the relatively low binding affinity of AtCERK1 for chitin and the fact that mutations (AtCERK1<sup>A138H</sup>) predicted to disrupt chitin binding did not block AtCERK1 autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>). These discrepancies can now be explained by the interaction of AtCERK1 with AtLYK5, which binds chitin with a significantly higher affinity than AtCERK1. Indeed, AtLYK5 is required for AtCERK1 dimerization and also kinase activation. The data suggest that AtLYK5 exists in the cell, in the absence of chitin, as a homodimer. Chitin binds to AtLYK5 leading to its association with AtCERK1, dimerization and kinase activation. In this way, chitin signaling is transduced downstream through AtCERK1 kinase activity.</p><p>Our model, together with the studies from rice, suggests that AtCERK1 is not the primary chitin receptor. In rice, one long-chain chitooligosaccharide is sandwiched between two OsCEBiP monomers. Chitin treatment induces the association of OsCEBiP with OsCERK1, which activates the OsCERK1 intracellular kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayafune et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shimizu et al., 2010</xref>). However, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the three CEBiP-like proteins are not required for chitin-triggered innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shinya et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wan et al., 2012</xref>). Instead, AtLYK5 appears to play a similar role as CEBiP as a chitin-binding receptor to mediate AtCERK1 activation through ligand-induced association. These two systems are very similar since both OsCEBiP and AtLYK5 lack the intracellular kinase function. OsCEBiP has no intracellular kinase domain, while AtLYK5 contains an intracellular kinase domain that lacks activity. However, the AtLYK5 intracellular kinase domain does appear to have biological function, likely by mediating protein–protein interactions. It is likely that the chitin receptor complex functions as a heterotetramer in both rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayafune et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), although this needs to be confirmed. Such an oligomer complex could explain why in vitro receptor binding affinities (∼1 µM) do not correlate well with the measured responses of plants to chitin elicitation at nM concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). An oligomeric AtCERK1 receptor complex is also consistent with the finding that AtLYM1 and AtLYM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Willmann et al., 2011</xref>) are necessary for PGN-induced MTI. All these studies suggest that the primary function of AtCERK1/OsCERK1 is not chitin binding per se, but to serve as a receptor scaffold for interaction with chitin binding co-receptors and, most importantly, to provide intracellular kinase activity.</p><p>Based on ITC data, AtLYK5 has similar chitooctaose binding affinity to that of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) while, under the same conditions, AtCERK1 showed extremely low chitooctaose binding activity. Previously published data, also using ITC, measured the chitopentaose binding affinity of WGA in the low µM range, while the binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub>) to shorter chitin oligomers (GlcNAc)<sub>2–4</sub> was significantly lower (i.e., mM level; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asensio, et al., 2000</xref>). ITC is one of the best methods to study protein–protein interactions or protein-ligand association. Since ITC detects protein–protein or protein-ligand interaction directly which is label-free, the binding affinity value might be slightly different from other methods. For example, in the case of WGA, ITC values (K<sub>d</sub>) for binding to chitobiose and chitotriose were 1.6 mM and 117 µM, respectively, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asensio, et al., 2000</xref>), while similar measurements using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) gave Kd values of 165 µM and 45 µM, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lienenmann et al., 2009</xref>). Published reports for the chitin binding affinity for AtCERK1 also vary widely. For example, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iizasa et al., 2010</xref>) measured the affinity of AtCERK1 for chitin on a solid surface (commercial chitin magnetic beads) and reported a value (K<sub>d</sub>) of 82 nM. It is difficult to reconcile this number with other values obtained by ITC. One possible explanation is that the use of a solid surface promoted oligomerization of AtCERK1 resulting in an enhancement of binding affinity. In contrast, using ITC, the binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub>) of AtCERK1 for chitotetrose, chitopentaose, and chitooctaose was measured as 159 µM, 66 µM, and 45 µM, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>). However, these studies were performed with significantly higher protein and ligand concentration (i.e., 0.1 mM AtCERK1 protein vs 4 mM chitotetraose or chitopentaose, and 2.4 mM chitooctaose) than used in our study. Again, such high protein concentrations could have promoted oligomerization of the AtCERK1 protein, which would affect the binding affinities.</p><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has five LYK genes. We can now assign biological function to four of these proteins. AtLYK3 appears to be involved in recognizing short chain (dp = 4–5) lipo-chitooligosaccarides and chitooligosaccarides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). However, this recognition leads to a suppression of MTI. The role of AtLYK2 remains unknown but it should be noted that this gene shows very low expression in all tissues examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liang et al, 2014</xref>). AtCERK1/AtLYK1, AtLYK4 and AtLYK5 all appear to mediate the plant response to chitin elicitation leading to MTI. Previously, we reported that the Ler ecotype <italic>Atlyk5-1</italic> mutant was not defective in chitin-induced MTI. However, our current data show that this mutant likely represents a weak mutant allele, perhaps due to the 3′ position of the transposon insertion. The Ler ecotype is also not ideal for studying chitin signaling since it shows a generally weaker response compared to Col-0. In contrast, the Col-0 ecotype <italic>Atlyk5-2</italic> mutant showed a reduced response to chitin treatment in all assays tested, including pathogen response. The phenotype of the <italic>Atlyk5-2</italic> mutant was reversed by genetic complementation with the wild-type AtLYK5 gene.</p><p>Chitin-induced MTI requires long chain chitin oligomers (dp ≥ 6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wan et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2012</xref>). The functions of AtLYK4 and AtLYK5 are partially redundant in that single mutants retain residual responses to chitin, while <italic>Atlyk4/Atlyk5-2</italic> double mutant plants show a complete lack of response to chitin, similar to the <italic>Atcerk1</italic> mutants. However, AtLYK5 appears to have the predominant role in chitin elicitation, as judged by the relative strength of the <italic>Atlyk4</italic> and <italic>Atlyk5-2</italic> mutant phenotypes. There are biochemical differences in the function of AtLYK4 and AtLYK5; for example, AtLYK4 interacts with AtCERK1 independently of the presence of chitin, while AtLYK5-AtCERK1 interaction is chitin dependent. The biological significance of these differences and the functional redundancy of AtLYK4 and AtLYK5 are currently unclear. One possibility is that AtLYK4 also functions as a chitin binding receptor to mediate the plant chitin repsonse.</p><p>Receptor homodimerization or oligomerization and subsequent phosphorylation are common mechanisms for ligand-mediate receptor activation. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> examples include AtBRI1 homodimerization and heterodimerization with AtBAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nam and Li, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santiago, et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun, et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). AtFLS2 appears to exist in the cell as a homodimer before and after ligand perception and then associates with AtBAK1 upon flagellin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert, et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chinchilla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heese et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun, et al., 2013b</xref>). The suggested mechanism is that ligand perception triggers autophosphorylation between the homodimer or trans-autophosphorylation between/among hetero-interacting proteins to initiate cellular signaling. It appears that all LysM receptors may function as a protein complex. For example, in leguminous plants, the LysM domain, Nod factor receptors (e.g., <italic>Lotus japonicas</italic> Nod factor receptor 1 and 5; LjNFR1 and LjNFR5) function as a heterodimer to mediate high affinity binding to the lipo-chitooligosaccharide Nod factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broghammer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gust et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radutoiu et al., 2003</xref>). It should be emphasized that this model for Nod factor binding is very similar to that of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chitin receptor. In both cases, one LysM RLK (CERK1/NFR1) has an active intracellular kinase domain but interacts with a second LysM RLK (LYK5/NFR5) that lacks intracellular kinase activity. This similarity underlines the now well recognized evolutionary link between chitin, Nod factor and mycorrhizal (Myc) factor recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liang et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and treatment</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant plants <italic>Atcerk1</italic> (GABI-KAT 096F09), <italic>Atlyk2</italic> (SAIL_318C08), At<italic>lyk3</italic> (SALK_140374), <italic>Atlyk4</italic> (CS850683), <italic>Atlyk5-2</italic> (SALK_131911C), and wild-type Col-0 plants were used in this study.

Prior to acceptance you need, however, to address the issues listed below: 1) A major criticism concerns the binding data obtained by ITC. While an affinity constant for WGA (for a positive control) is given, there is no comparable number for chitin affinities of AtCERK1 and AtLYK5. The only statement found is that AtLYK5 has a comparable Kd as WGA, and is 200-fold more sensitive to chitin than AtCERK1. It was unclear to us, however, how the numbers given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> or any information in the text support these statements. Here, it is absolutely mandatory to give Kd values and an easily understandable description of how these values were determined. In addition, it should be shown that chitin binding as determined by ITC is ligand-specific. Here, competition assays with elicitor-active and inactive chitin fragments should be provided. In addition, a comprehensive discussion of apparent discrepancies between published chitin binding constants for CERK1 (Liu, 2012 45 uM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iizasa, 2010</xref>, 82 nM) and those determined in this study should be provided. This is important as the authors claim that the binding affinity of LYK5 is substantially higher than that of CERK1 and thus makes this protein the genuine chitin receptor.</p><p>2) Evidence should be provided that CEERK1 and LYK5 both operate in the same cell types/tissues. This is important as it might rule out that both proteins are chitin receptors with different tissue or cell-type specificities.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>: As previous papers have incorrectly overlooked LYK5 as required for chitin perception, we think this figure needs all of the lyk mutants and a water control. Also; statistics are not clear here or throughout the manuscript. It is not stated what comparison “*” is referred to. Please show the control as 100% and calculate the other samples relative to that. And please explain why you are using at this point wrky29 and wrky30 and not as previously wrky33 and wrky53?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: The ITC for LYK4 should be done as well, to see if a weaker binding of LYK4 compared to LYK5/CERK1 correlates with the physiological data (ROS, WRKY activation).

This is important as the authors claim that the binding affinity of LYK5 is substantially higher than that of CERK1 and thus makes this protein the genuine chitin receptor</italic>.</p><p>This is a great point. The Kd value for each protein is now provided in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Unfortunately, we could not conduct the competition experiment as you suggest. This is because the ITC method detects protein-ligand interaction based on the differential heat after binding of ligand. Hence, ITC cannot distinguish heat changes produced by LYK5-chitooctaose, or by LYK5- inactive chitin, such as chitotetraose. However, to address criticism, we did conduct direct binding studies of LYK5 with chitotetraose and found no binding (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, as would be expected of a receptor involved in chitin elicitation, LYK5 appears to prefer longer chitin oligomers.</p><p>We added a detailed discussion regarding the binding affinity of CERK1. Basically, we feel that the previous studies had technical flaws and, in both cases, binding was done under conditions that would be predicted to favor protein oligomerization which would give an artificially higher binding affinity. In the case of Liu et al this is due to the very high concentrations of protein (0.1 mM) and ligand (4mM or 2.4mM) used in their binding assays. In the case of Iizasa et al, oligomerization would have been favored due to the fact that binding was measured against a solid substrate (chitin beads). Of course, this is conjecture on our part but we believe this is a likely explanation for the apparent discrepancy in the results. Perhaps more importantly, in our case, since we used proteins purified at the same time and assays done under identical conditions, a direct comparison of AtCERK1 and AtLYK5 binding was possible.</p><p><italic>2) Evidence should be provided that CEERK1 and LYK5 both operate in the same cell types/tissues. This is important as it might rule out that both proteins are chitin receptors with different tissue or cell-type specificities</italic>.</p><p>Yes, we did real time quantitative RT-PCR using templates from different growth ages and different tissues, and found that CERK1, LYK4 and LYK5 shared a similar expression pattern in all samples tested. The only slight variation was that LYK5 had higher expression in root than CERK1 or LYK4 (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and Figure S1N). Our data is consistent with the expression pattern calculated by an online software AtGenExpress Visualization Tool (AVT): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jsp.weigelworld.org/expviz/expviz.jsp">http://jsp.weigelworld.org/expviz/expviz.jsp</ext-link>.</p><p>Also, work of another postdoc in the lab has shown that both LYK5 and CERK1 are localized to the plasma membrane, also consistent with their direct interaction.</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref><italic>: As previous papers have incorrectly overlooked LYK5 as required for chitin perception, we think this figure needs all of the lyk mutants and a water control.

These results showed that only <italic>cerk1</italic>, <italic>lyk4</italic> and <italic>lyk5-2</italic> are involved in the chitin response. We also rewrote the section on the statistical analysis and hope that it is now clearer. As we have reported in past talks, we believe that <italic>lyk2</italic> is likely a pseudogene, or at least is not expressed under any conditions tested, while, as we published in Science, LYK3 appears to recognize Nod factor and short chain chitin oligomers. Hence, with this current paper and our past work, we have assigned a function to all of the Arabidopsis LYK proteins that are expressed.</p><p>We analyzed the expression of <italic>WRKY33</italic> and <italic>WRKY53</italic> in <italic>lyk5-2</italic> mutant plants. The data showed that the expression of these two genes was greatly reduced after chitin treatment compared with wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>4)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref><italic>: The ITC for LYK4 should be done as well, to see if a weaker binding of LYK4 compared to LYK5/CERK1 correlates with the physiological data (ROS, WRKY activation). Overall LYK4 is poorly dealt with in the current manuscript</italic>.</p><p>Actually, It is a very interesting question. We are also very curious about the binding affinity of AtLYK4.</p><p>However, the problem is that expression and purification of the LysM protein is very difficult. Based on our own experience, this is due to an inability to express the proteins in sufficient quantity for such studies. We consider ourselves fortunate that we were able to get enough CERK1 and LYK5 proteins to do the studies described in the paper. Unfortunately, the same was not true of LYK4. Using the same conditions we used for CERK1/LYK4, we tried to express the LYK4 extracellular domain in <italic>E.coli</italic> but obtained poor expression. What protein that was produced was insoluble and efforts to solubilize and refold have, thus far, proven unsuccessful. Therefore, although we would like to address the reviewers and our own curiosity about LYK4, this is going to have to wait until we work out a condition to get sufficient protein for binding studies. Since our current paper focuses on LYK5, these experiments concerning LYK4 are not really pertinent to the story being described. The data support the model that LYK5 is the major chitin binding protein, while LYK4 plays a minor role. We certainly hope to overcome the technical problems with regard to LYK4 expression and, if successful, will likely publish this as a separate story with the main focus on LYK4.</p></body></sub-article></article>
