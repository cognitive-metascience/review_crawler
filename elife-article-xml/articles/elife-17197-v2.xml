Yet, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Using a combination of behavior, pharmacology, in vivo surface sensing of translation (SUnSET) and DiOlistic labeling we found that, translational control by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) bidirectionally regulates auditory but not visual imprinting and related changes in structural plasticity in chickens. Increasing phosphorylation of eIF2α (p-eIF2α) reduces translation rates and spine plasticity, and selectively impairs auditory imprinting. By contrast, inhibition of an eIF2α kinase or blocking the translational program controlled by p-eIF2α enhances auditory imprinting. Importantly, these manipulations are able to reopen the critical period. Thus, we have identified a translational control mechanism that selectively underlies auditory imprinting. Restoring translational control of eIF2α holds the promise to rejuvenate adult brain plasticity and restore learning and memory in a variety of cognitive disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17197.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17197.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17197.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Shortly after hatching, a chick recognizes the sight and sound of its mother and follows her around. This requires a type of learning called imprinting, which only occurs during a short period of time in young life known as the “critical period”. This process has been reported in a variety of birds and other animals where long-term memory formed during a critical period guides vital behaviors. In order to form imprinted memories, neurons must produce new proteins. However, it is not clear how new experiences trigger the production of these proteins during imprinting. Unraveling such mechanisms may help us to develop drugs that can recover plasticity in the adult brain, which could help individuals with brain injuries relearn skills after critical periods are closed.</p><p>It is possible to imprint newly hatched chicks to arbitrary sounds and visual stimuli by placing the chicks in running wheels and exposing them to repeated noises and videos. Later on, the chicks respond to these stimuli by running towards the screen, mimicking how they would naturally follow their mother. This system allows researchers to measure imprinting in a carefully controlled laboratory setting.</p><p>A protein called elF2α plays a major role in regulating the production of new proteins and has been shown to be required for the formation of long-term memories in adult rodents. Batista et al. found that elF2α is required to imprint newly hatched chicks to sound. During the critical period, this factor mediates an increase in “memory-spines”, which are small bumps on neurons that are thought to be involved in memory storage. On the other hand, elF2α was not required to imprint newly hatched chicks to visual stimuli, suggesting that there are different pathways involved in regulating imprinting to different senses. Batista et al. also demonstrate that using drugs to increase the activity of eIF2α in older chicks could allow these chicks to be imprinted to new sounds.</p><p>The next steps following on from this work are to identify proteins that eIF2α regulates to form memories, and to find out why eIF2α is only required to imprint sounds. Future research will investigate the mechanisms that control visual imprinting and how it differs from imprinting to sounds.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17197.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17197.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>imprinting</kwd><kwd>critical period</kwd><kwd>translational control</kwd><kwd>structural plasticity</kwd><kwd>memory formation</kwd><kwd>early learning</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>neuroethology</kwd><kwd>dendritic spines</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>International Society for Neuroethology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Konishi Research Award 2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Batista</surname><given-names>Gervasio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIMH 096816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Costa-Mattioli</surname><given-names>Mauro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NINDS 076708</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Costa-Mattioli</surname><given-names>Mauro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC007690</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pena</surname><given-names>Jose L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rose F.

A particular feature of imprinting is that it occurs exclusively within a short critical period (CP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolhuis, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nevitt et al., 1994</xref>), when structural and functional changes take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hensch, 2004</xref>). Imprinting drives a vigorous following behavior in chickens, key for filial attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Insel and Young, 2001</xref>). This rather unique and precocious behavior is advantageous for investigating experience-driven activation of molecular pathways around birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bredenkötter and Braun, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bock and Braun, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCabe et al., 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">1981</xref>). Unders tanding the biological basis of imprinting can shed light on the mechanisms of learning in newborns and create new avenues to rejuvenate adult brain plasticity by reopening CPs.</p><p>The formation of imprinted memories has been described across sensory modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nevitt et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCabe et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Remy and Hobert, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bock et al., 1997</xref>). Interestingly, in chickens, auditory and visual imprinting relies on different brain structures. Imprinted sounds activate the mediorostral nidopallium/mesopallium (MNM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bock and Braun, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wallhäusser and Scheich, 1987</xref>), where neural responsiveness increases after training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bredenkötter and Braun, 1997</xref>). In contrast, the intermediate medial mesopallium (IMM, former IMHV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCabe et al., 1982</xref>) is required for visual imprinting, where neural responses shift to favor the imprinted object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horn et al., 2001</xref>). While the brain circuits and neurophysiological changes have been uncovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scheich, 1987</xref>), much less is known about the molecular machinery linking experience and the formation of imprinted memories in each sensory modality.</p><p>While imprinting requires protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gibbs and Lecanuet, 1981</xref>), little is known about the underlying translational control mechanisms. The translation of mRNA into protein occurs in three steps: initiation, elongation and termination and can be regulated through several signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>). Translation initiation is believed to be the rate-limiting step and a key target for translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buffington et al., 2014</xref>). A major way in which translation initiation is regulated is by modulating the formation of the ternary complex <italic>via</italic> phosphorylation of the translation-initiation factor eIF2α. In rodents, protein synthesis controlled by phosphorylation of eIF2α is critically required for long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Prisco et al., 2014</xref>) as well as long-term memory storage in several systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stern et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ounallah-Saad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). Here we asked whether this central translational control mechanism plays a role in imprinting in newborn chickens and can be used to restore imprinting outside of the CP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Critical periods for visual and auditory imprinting</title><p>Dark reared chickens were placed in a running wheel in front of an LCD screen and a speaker for training. Visual and auditory imprinting were tested separately 24 hr after training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Stimuli consisted of animated movies showing a virtual object, and artificial sounds synchronized to movements of the object in the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, see supplementary materials). The imprinting was assessed by the preferential approach to the imprinted stimuli, either visual or auditory, compared to the approach to novel stimuli. The preference for imprinted stimuli is commonly used as an index of long-term memory storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horn, 2004</xref>). Individuals' preference was measured by calculating an index, where positive and negative values indicate preference for the imprinted or novel stimulus, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>). This index accounts for fluctuations in baseline locomotion across trials, as described in the Method section. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamaguchi et al., 2012</xref>), chickens showed imprinting to either visual or auditory cues one day after hatching (P1) but not after four days (P4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>), indicating that the CP for imprinting ends before P4.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17197.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral paradigm and the critical period for imprinting.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic sequence of behavioral experiments.

Briefly, the antibiotic puromycin (PMY) incorporated into newly synthesized proteins can be detected through immunolabeling and used to monitor translation. Because brain tissue incorporates PMY more slowly compared to other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flexner et al., 1962</xref>) pilot experiments were conducted, showing that IP-injected PMY accessed the chicken’s brain within 3–4 hr. Thus PMY was injected 1 hr before a 2 hr training and samples were collected 4 hr after injection to capture training-induced translation.</p><p>We found that imprinting training increased translation both in MNM and IMM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>) after a 2 hr training session, compared to controls, which were running on the wheel but presented with an empty screen. To further estimate the time-window during which auditory and visual imprinting are sensitive to protein synthesis inhibition, we trained chickens for 1 or 2 hr on P1. Two-hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, right panel) training triggered robust auditory imprinting, which was blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor clycloheximide (CHX) injected immediately after training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, left panel). In contrast, one-hour training did not elicit significant auditory imprinting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, right panel). Interestingly, the temporal dynamics of protein synthesis dependency of visual imprinting was different. While one-hour training triggered visual imprinting that was suppressed by CHX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, left panel), visual imprinting after two-hour training was not blocked by post-training administration of CHX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> right panel). Consistent with the effect on behavior, CHX effectively blocked imprinting-triggered protein synthesis in both MNM and IMM areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>).

Despite having been studied for decades, the mechanism mediating the formation of imprinted memories remains elusive. Here we showed that, although visual and auditory imprinting require newly synthesized proteins, eIF2α-mediated translational control bidirectionally regulates auditory but not visual imprinting and related changes in structural plasticity. Remarkably, targeting this translational control mechanism pharmacologically recovers auditory imprinting after the closing of the critical period.</p><p>Critical periods in the auditory system have been widely studied across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scheich, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Riebel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Insanally et al., 2009</xref>). Yet the mechanisms engaged during the CP for auditory imprinting have not been elucidated. One major limitation has been the design of stringent experimental approaches that control for social experience and innate biases, while achieving robust auditory imprinted memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van and Bolhuis, 1991</xref>). We aimed to address these concerns by: (1) raising chickens in darkness and constraining social interaction, (2) imprinting chickens to more than one type of object and sound, and (3) increasing the length of training compared to other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wallhäusser and Scheich, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van and Bolhuis, 1991</xref>) to achieve significant memory retention longer than 24 hr after training. These improvements, in addition to the novel custom-made audiovisual animation used for training, provided a stronger experimental design for assessing auditory and visual imprinting.</p><p>Several lines of evidence support the modality-specific role of eIF2α. First, training decreased phosphorylation of eIF2α in the auditory-imprinting relevant area MNM, but not in IMM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Second, pharmacologically increasing eIF2α phosphorylation with Sal003 selectively disrupted auditory imprinting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Third, inhibiting eIF2α phosphorylation with PKRi or directly blocking p-eIF2α-mediated translational control with ISRIB, enhanced auditory imprinting after weak training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d–e</xref>). Interestingly, although Sal003 and ISRIB altered protein synthesis in IMM, these manipulations had no detectable effect on the formation of visual memories. The reason why eIF2α is not involved in visual imprinting is not yet understood. It is possible that expression of eIF2α kinase or phosphatase complexes differs between visual and auditory areas, or that upstream signaling pathways fail to engage eIF2α dephosphorylation. It would be interesting to test whether other tasks involving memory formation, such as one-trial avoidance learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson et al., 2008</xref>), also require translational control by eIF2α. An appealing idea is that other translational control pathways such those controlled by the mechanistic target of rapamycin mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>) mediate the formation of visual memories.</p><p>While previous studies in adult rodents suggest that eIF2α-mediated translation regulates the two major forms of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stern et al., 2013</xref>), here we report for the first time that experience-dependent structural plasticity of dendritic spines requires eIF2a dephosphorylation. Furthermore, and consistent with our behavioral results, eIF2α-mediated translation exclusively regulated spine remodeling in the auditory but not in the visual area. This result is particularly important since structural plasticity is crucial during CPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mataga et al., 2004</xref>) but the underlying molecular mechanisms were unknown. Different forms of structural plasticity have been linked to memory, including spine turnover and morphological changes of preexisting spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamprecht and LeDoux, 2004</xref>). In this case, the structural plasticity found in IMM and MNM could be consistent with potentiation and enlargement of specific dendritic spines, favoring the detection of imprinted stimuli. While we did not observe changes in spine density, the increase in mushroom spines and decrease in thin spines may suggest coordinated structural plasticity as previously reported in hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourne and Harris, 2011</xref>). Thus, our results shed light on the biological basis of experience-dependent spine remodeling and uncovered eIF2α as a major player in spine remodeling.</p><p>Another interesting question is whether translational control by eIF2α in glial cells affects imprinting. Glutamate application induces a transient increase of eIF2α phosphorylation in glial cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flores-Méndez et al., 2013</xref>). This effect has been linked to glutamate removal from the synaptic cleft by glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flores-Méndez et al., 2013</xref>). However, its contribution to memory formation in vivo remains untested. In future studies, it will be important to dissect the role of p-eIF2a in memory formation at the cellular level.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>eIF2α-mediated translational control: an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to rejuvenate plasticity and memory?</title><p>Behavior is shaped during sensitive periods in early postnatal life, characterized by epochs of heightened brain plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hensch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nabel and Morishita, 2013</xref>).

This has been successfully achieved in the visual cortex of rodents through direct manipulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission, either pharmacologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hensch et al., 1998</xref>) or through transplantation of embryonic inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis et al., 2015</xref>).

Our results uncover a translational control mechanism as a novel target for reopening CPs. Indeed, two different strategies, either blocking p-eIF2α-mediated translation or inhibiting the upstream kinase PKR, enabled chickens to imprint to sounds after the end of the CP, suggesting that blocking p-eIF2α-mediated translation control enhances CP-mediated plasticity. A recent report shows that reducing p-eIF2α-mediated translational control in the VTA can convert adult into adolescent mice with respect to their vulnerability to cocaine-induced changes in synaptic strength and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Based on these results and the evolutionarily conserved nature of this process, we speculate that reopening CPs through blockade of eIF2α-mediated translational control could be used to recover plasticity in the mature brain and treat cognitive dysfunctions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>We used newly hatched chicks of both sexes from the White Leghorn strain <italic>Gallus gallus domesticus</italic> (Charles River supplier).

The start of each animation was commanded by software written in Matlab, which was interfaced to Med Associates equipment through a USB DAQ card (National instruments USB-6008).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-17197-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17197.017</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Stimulus A presented to chickens.</title><p>This animation was played on a screen during training.

If the chicken did not move the wheel during the first half hour of exposure, the experiment was interrupted and not included in the sample. Training length varied from 0 to 120 min, depending on the protocol. To investigate long-lasting effects on imprinting we tested chickens the day after training.</p><p>Visual and auditory imprinting were tested independently in a sequential test, where the novel and imprinted stimuli are presented in alternation. While other studies have used a simultaneous choice test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamaguchi et al., 2012</xref>), the sequential test allowed us to randomize stimulus presentation, measure baseline locomotion and assess the response to novel and imprinted (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>) stimuli independently. Each test included 5 presentations of the imprinted stimulus and 5 presentations of the novel stimulus. The duration of each presentation was 1 min. Baseline locomotion was measured during 30 s between trials. Imprinted and novel stimuli were alternated over five consecutive blocks. The first stimulus that started the sequence was picked randomly. Although this method differs from previous reports where fixed sequences were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolhuis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Town and McCabe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCabe and Horn, 1988</xref>), randomization prevents biases and motivation changes over time emerging from fixed sequences.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-17197-media3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17197.019</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Chicken imprinted to stimulus B approaching the screen.</title><p>This approach behavior was quantified during the presentation of imprinted or novel stimuli to compute a preference index.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17197.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17197.019</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>Previous studies have used different criteria and indexes to quantify the strength of imprinting. Such quantifications have included differences in time spent in the proximity of the imprinted object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamaguchi et al., 2012</xref>), differences in locomotion toward the imprinted and novel stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolhuis et al., 2000</xref>), differences in locomotion during the presentation of imprinted and novel objects and the absence of a stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maekawa et al., 2006</xref>), and number of chickens within a group selecting the imprinted stimulus over several trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wallhäusser and Scheich, 1987</xref>). In this study, we normalized differences between locomotion to novel and imprinted stimuli by the average baseline locomotion in the wheel when no stimulus was presented. Therefore, to assess imprinting, we calculated a preference index (PI), <italic>PI = ∑(Imprinted<sub>STL</sub> - Novel<sub>STL</sub>)<sub>/</sub> Baseline<sub>A</sub></italic> where <italic>STL</italic> indicates stimulus-triggered locomotion either during the presentation of the imprinted stimulus (<italic>Imprinted<sub>STL</sub></italic>) or presentation of the novel stimulus (<italic>Novel<sub>STL</sub></italic>), and baseline<sub>A</sub> refers to the average baseline locomotion across the experiment. An advantage of this quantification over previous methods is that: (1) it takes into account the fluctuations in basal locomotion before each stimulus presentation, and (2) it weights differences in approaching behavior by average locomotion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Assessment of the sensitive period</title><p>The sensitive period for filial imprinting has been reported to close within 3–4 days after hatching(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamaguchi et al., 2012</xref>). To ensure the training and preference tests captured this sensitivity, the ability of chickens to develop a preference to visual and auditory stimuli within the first 4 days after hatching was measured immediately and 24 hr after training.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vivo SUnSET</title><p>We optimized previously reported in vivo SUnSET protocols in muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goodman and Hornberger, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goodman et al., 2011</xref>) for monitoring protein synthesis in the chick brain. It has been shown that PMY injected intravenously takes 2–4 hr to be incorporated into the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flexner et al., 1962</xref>). This contrasts with the fast incorporation (approximately 30 min) into muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goodman and Hornberger, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goodman et al., 2011</xref>) and other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flexner et al., 1962</xref>). In pilot experiments, we determined that 3–4 hr after injecting a low dose of PMY (MP Biomedicals, 0.04 mg/g, diluted in distilled H<sub>2</sub>0, IP) was the optimal time period for detecting the incorporation of PMY in newly synthesized proteins. This information was used to adjust the timing of PMY injection in our behavioral pharmacology experiments.</p><p>To simultaneously assess experience-dependent translation across sensory modalities and brain regions, in the same animal, we identified a training schedule that reliably triggered auditory and visual imprinting. Since 2 hr but not 1 hr training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>) triggered both auditory and visual imprinting, we used the former schedule. Four hours after PMY injection chicks were decapitated and brains were rapidly (2–3 min) placed in cold PFA (4%) overnight at 4°C. A vibratome (Leica VT 1000S) was used for making 100 µ sagittal cross sections. After three 10 min washing with PBS, samples were incubated overnight at 4°C in a solution containing antibodies against PMY (EMD Millipore, cat# MABE343, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2566826">AB_2566826</ext-link>) and S6 (Cell signaling, cat# 2217, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_331355">AB_331355</ext-link>) to identify cell somas. Samples were washed in PBS (three 10 min wash) and placed for 1.5 hr in a solution containing Alexa-488 (Invitrogen, cat# A21202, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2535788">AB_2535788</ext-link>) and Alexa-568 (Invitrogen, cat# A10042, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2534017">AB_2534017</ext-link>) against the primary antibody host species. After washing again 3 times for 10 min in PBS, samples were covered with Prolong Gold mounting media (Molecular probes, cat# P36935).</p><p>A confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Duo V2) was used to collect images from IMM and MNM (10X, zoom 3). All images were taken blind to the experimental groups. IMM is located 2.5 mm from the dorsal surface of the brain and 0.5–1 mm from the caudal edge of the forebrain, limited below and laterally by the lateral ventricle. MNM is located 0.5–1 mm lateral from the midline, 3 mm from the dorsal surface of the brain and 5 mm from the caudal edge of the forebrain, below the lateral pallial lamina that separates the hyperpallium and mesopallium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Puelles et al., 2007</xref>). All compared samples were processed the same day, using the same protocol, and images were taken with equal microscope settings. Control animals were housed in the same conditions as trained animals but presented with an empty screen.</p><p>Images were analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH, 1.50i). Threshold was adjusted by the S6 signal to select cell somas. PMY signal was detected using the selection created for the S6 channel. To compare across groups all measures were normalized to the average intensity of the control group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Protein synthesis inhibition</title><p>To investigate the involvement of protein synthesis in long-term memory formation during imprinting we injected cycloheximide (Tocris, CHX, 1 mg/kg, IP), diluted in 0.1% DMSO and saline, immediately after training. Since 1 hr training was enough to generate visual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) but not auditory imprinting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), we injected CHX immediately after 1 hr and 2 hr training, and tested the effect on imprinting 24 hr later for each sensory modality, independently.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Manipulation of the eIF2α signaling pathway</title><p>We used the specific blocker of eIF2α phosphatases Sal003 (Sigma Aldrich,0.2 mg/Kg, diluted in 0.1% DMSO and 0.9% Saline, IP) to test whether a reduction in eIF2α phosphorylation is required for imprinting. We used 2 hr training for this experiment, which reliably triggered strong visual and auditory imprinting, and injected Sal003 before training to ensure translation was inhibited during and immediately after training.</p><p>To specifically enhance the formation of imprinted memories by reducing eIF2α–mediated translational control, we conducted two independent manipulations: animals were injected immediately after training with either the specific inhibitor of the eIF2a kinase PKR (PKRi; EMD Millipore, 0.1 mg/Kg, diluted in 0.1% DMSO and 0.9% saline) or ISRIB (Sigma Aldrich, 2.5 mg/Kg, diluted in 50% DMSO and 50% saline, IP), which blocks the translational effect induced by p-eIF2α. To avoid a ceiling effect masking the enhancement of imprinting, we used 1 hr training (weak training) and tested preference 24 hr after training.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Lysates of IMM and MNM (anatomical boundaries described above) were obtained from brain tissue, punched out from 0.75- to 1mm-thick sagittal brain slices collected from imprinted and control animals.

Imprinting was assessed 24 hr after training as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Dendritic spine analysis</title><p>Brains were rapidly dissected (in 2–3 min) and placed in paraformaldehyde (4%) for 1 hr, then transferred to the phosphate buffer solution. A vibratome (Leica VT 1000S) was used for making 200 uM slices. Tungsten beads coated with lipophilic dye (DiI) were delivered to each slice using a modified gene gun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gan et al., 2000</xref>). The dye was allowed to spread overnight. The next day, each slice was mounted using ProLong Gold mounting media. A confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Duo V2) was used to collect Z-stacks (63X, zoom 3) from areas of interest containing labeled dendritic branches. Images of secondary branches, within 50–75 µm from the soma, were used for spine analysis.</p><p>Dendritic spines were counted blind to experimental groups using Image J software (Version 1.50a). A multicolored lookup table (Fire) was used to reliably visualize individual spines. Two 10 μm segments were marked randomly along each secondary dendritic branch. Spines along each of the two segments were counted by a blind experimenter. The spines ‘head width, presence of neck and overall length were used for classifying them in filopodia, stubby, thin, or mushroom, using published criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourne and Harris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanders et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakravarthy et al., 2006</xref>). Briefly, spines without clear head and neck, and shorter than 1 μm, were categorized as stubby. Spines longer than 1 μm were classified as mushroom or thin, depending on whether a head and neck were observed. Protrusions longer than 2 μm were categorized as filopodia.</p><p>To investigate if eIF2α was required for structural plasticity, we injected chickens with Sal003 (i.p., 0.2 mg/kg) and trained them for 2 hr. The day after the training, we labeled dendritic arbors and assessed dendritic spines, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot (Systat Software). Data distribution normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk and F-test to evaluate the differences of variances. When variances were significantly different the Welch’s correction was used. Statistics were based on the two-sided Student’s t test, or the two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc test for multiple comparisons of normally distributed samples. Otherwise the Mann-Whitney or the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests were used. Within-group variation is indicated by standard errors of the mean of each distribution, which are depicted in the graphs as error bars. p&lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Anna Francesconi, Bryen Jordan and Michael Beckert for their critical discussion and comments on the manuscript.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors’ note: this article was originally rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but the authors were invited to resubmit after an appeal against the decision.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Translational control of auditory imprinting and structural plasticity by eIF2α&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The question of what regulates critical periods and imprinting has broad appeal, and your efforts to show a modality specific translational control mechanism underlying the critical period for imprinting were of great interest to the reviewers. As currently presented, however, the reviewers did not find your conclusions that the translational regulator eIF2α and its phosphorylation state regulate the formation of auditory memories and spine plasticity convincing. For the protein synthesis aspect, better demonstration of actual alterations in synthesis of given proteins would strengthen the study. In addition, more clearly stating the time points of injection relative to the timing of training, confirmation of the brain areas examined for sampling of spine changes, and clarification of whether the p-eIF2α signal derived from neurons or from neurons and glia by immunohistochemistry of the tissue taken for immunoblotting, would enhance your presentation.</p><p>Your attempts to distinguish effects on auditory but not visual imprinting are laudable, but are confounded by difficulties in the field in separating stimuli for auditory versus visual learning; your design should be better argued compared to previous efforts. Finally, the novel method you use for the preference index for analyzing imprinting could be better explained and compared to previously used tests, and the appropriateness of the statistical tests you used considered.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The work by Batista et al. is very intriguing. Understanding what regulates critical periods and imprinting are indeed important questions that need to be addressed and will be of great interest to a broad community. While the title suggests that eIF2α controls translation-dependent auditory imprinting and structural plasticity, the authors do not provide any direct evidence that new proteins are synthesized. At best, the authors can claim that eIF2α is involved in auditory imprinting. Thus, the authors need to provide convincing evidence that translation, or increased protein synthesis, is required for auditory imprinting and structural plasticity. In addition, while the literature suggests eIF2α is involved in memory formation, so are other protein synthesis pathways such as mTOR, as mentioned in the Discussion. The authors should include Western blot analysis for other protein synthesis pathways, as a control.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref></p><p>The use of cycloheximide does not indicate that protein synthesis is required. To show convincingly that protein synthesis is involved, the authors must show that (1) total protein synthesis (or some proteins) is elevated at 2-hour training in auditory imprinting and at 1-hour training in visual imprinting, and (2) training-induced increase in protein synthesis is blocked by cycloheximide. This can be done by metabolic labeling or demonstration that levels of select proteins are increased by Western blot analysis.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref></p><p>Total eIF2α seems to be reduced in imprinted samples. The authors should measure other proteins whose levels are not affected by imprinting and normalize total eIF2α to demonstrate that imprinting affects eIF2α phosphorylation and not total levels of eIF2α.</p><p>The authors should also show that the manipulation of eIF2α phosphorylation directly affects protein synthesis. They may demonstrate this by measuring total protein (or select proteins) levels of MNM.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref></p><p>The authors use PKRi and ISRIB to investigate the critical period. It's rather dubious that Sal003 was not used to investigate the critical period. Does Sal003 fail to open the critical period? The authors should use the same manipulation/drugs for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript addresses an important issue in the molecular mechanism of imprinted memories during a critical period. The authors argue that the translational control by phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 2α subunit (eIF2α) is required for auditory imprinting, and mediates changes in dendritic spines in the MNM region. They present data that the increasing phosphorylated eIF2α prevents the formation of auditory memories and spine plasticity. In contrast, the inhibition of an eIF2α kinase enhances auditory memories. Furthermore, they provide evidence that the blocking p-eIF2α mediated translational control enhances auditory memories and reopens the critical period.

The study includes data indicating that auditory imprinting involves translation initiation regulation by eIF2α, and in particular that eIF2α is phosphorylated and inhibited to allow for plasticity in the auditory cortex during the critical period. This indicates that mRNAs containing upstream open reading frames (whose translation is upregulated when eIF2α is phosphorylated and inhibited) are of particular importance to auditory plasticity during the critical period. In contrast, the authors show that phosphorylation of eIF2α, and hence eIF2α translational regulation, is not involved in visual imprinting. The findings are intriguing and I believe important. However, I also believe that there are some significant flaws in the experimental design and interpretation that weaken the study. My principal concerns have to do with the question of how well the translational inhibition worked, and the question of the kinetics of translational regulation in the MNM (for auditory imprinting) and IMM (for visual imprinting). What were the kinetics of inhibition of protein synthesis following IP injection? Was it equivalent in MNM and IMM? It's not clear from the manuscript whether or not the IP injection was done at the end of the 1 hr and the 2 hr training. The authors write: &quot;both auditory and visual imprinting rely on protein synthesis but following different temporal dynamics&quot;, and yet the conclusions from the translational inhibition experiments are all based on manipulations that do not appear to consider the differential temporal dynamics of imprinting (because they simply target a single time point, optimized for the effects on auditory imprinting). I also think it's really important to show that there is an effect on translation, and in particular on eIF2α-mediated translation. This is provided for Sal003 in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, but only for &quot;brain samples,&quot; not for IMM or MNM. Without this, the results are all based on pharmacological interventions, which always have some caveats unless the expected effects are directly measured. For example it looks like there is significant variability in the ratio of peIF2α to eIF2α in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, which raises the question of whether this correlates in any way with plasticity during imprinting.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Translational control of auditory imprinting and structural plasticity by eIF2α&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

This is an important manuscript describing how protein synthesis mediates structural plasticity and behavior. The finding that restoring translational control of eIF2α opens the critical period is timely and important. The authors have addressed most of my concerns.</p><p>Still missing from the manuscript is an explanation as to why the authors ignored the protein synthesis dependent visual plasticity at 1 hour of training. A sentence or two justifying the shift toward the 2 hour training period and the focus on auditory imprinting over visual imprinting would provide the reader with the logic behind the next set of experiments.

I am a little bit surprised to hear that the first trials of the novel stimulus generated a stronger suppression of locomotion because it never happens when we use the simultaneous choice test as a method to measure the preference for visual imprinting. It seems to me that the novel stimulus causes fear for chicks in the initial trials. Usually, newly-hatched chicks show the preference to novel conspicuous moving objects. Rather in some cases, I even choose the object which attracts the intrinsic preference of chicks as a control in the test. Under the condition, the imprinted chicks still show the strong preference against the controls in the simultaneous choice test. I am worried whether or not the training for imprinting by the authors is sufficient enough to cause the strong preference against the controls. Also, there is a possibility that the increasing number of trials in the test can bring the similar effect as the imprinting training. The authors may improve the methods of the training and the test in future to strengthen their interesting findings by the molecular approach.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17197.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>The question of what regulates critical periods and imprinting has broad appeal, and your efforts to show a modality specific translational control mechanism underlying the critical period for imprinting were of great interest to the reviewers. As currently presented, however, the reviewers did not find your conclusions that the translational regulator eIF2α and its phosphorylation state regulate the formation of auditory memories and spine plasticity convincing. For the protein synthesis aspect, better demonstration of actual alterations in synthesis of given proteins would strengthen the study.</italic> </p><p>As requested by the editor, we now measured protein synthesis in vivoin response to drug treatments and training using the SUrface SEnsing of Translation (SUnSET) technique. We now show that imprinting triggers translation in imprinting-relevant areas of the forebrain (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and validate all pharmacological manipulations on the eIF2α pathway as means of regulating translation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These new results strengthen our conclusions on the translational control of auditory imprinting by eIF2α.</p><p><italic>In addition, more clearly stating the time points of injection relative to the timing of training, confirmation of the brain areas examined for sampling of spine changes, and clarification of whether the p-eIF2α signal derived from neurons or from neurons and glia by immunohistochemistry of the tissue taken for immunoblotting, would enhance your presentation.</italic> </p><p>To clarify the time points of injection relative to the timing of training we added a schematic in each figure indicating when injection was performed relative to training. Also, in the methods section we provide the rationale for the timing of the injection for each experiment.</p><p>As pointed out by one of the reviewers, the boundaries of MNM and IMM are diffuse, thus now we report the coordinates used in our study to sample spine changes within those regions. In brief, since there are no- specific markers for each area, we determined the location of MNM and IMM based on anatomical landmarks. Also, while these structures are reported to be large (~1 mm<sup>3</sup>), we constrained our search for cells within a 0.5 mm radius around the center.</p><p>eIF2α is ubiquitous across cell types, therefore we find interesting the question whether experience-dependent changes in eIF2α phosphorylation emerge from glia or neurons. Indeed, even in the memory field the cell-type contribution of eIF2α phosphorylation remains to be determined. in vitrostudies have shown that changes in glial eIF2α after glutamate application are transient, lasting around 5-10 minutes. It has been speculated that this process helps glial cells to cope with the metabolic stress of removing glutamate from the synaptic cleft. We included this information at the end of the third paragraph of the Discussion section and raised this interesting and important question for future work.</p><p><italic>Your attempts to distinguish effects on auditory but not visual imprinting are laudable, but are confounded by difficulties in the field in separating stimuli for auditory versus visual learning; your design should be better argued compared to previous efforts.</italic> </p><p>It has been shown audiovisual stimulation enhances both visual and auditory imprinting tested separately (Bolhuis et al., 1992). Moreover, investigations on visual imprinting have commonly used audiovisual stimulation during training. However, most studies have focused on the mechanisms underlying visual imprinting because studying auditory imprinting carries additional experimental challenges, such as effect of previous social interaction and the difficulty in eliciting robust auditory memory. To clarify how we overcame these difficulties we revised the second paragraph of the Discussion section. In brief, our behavioral paradigm aimed to: 1) restrict social interaction and raise chicks in darkness, 2) generate a balanced data set where chicks were trained with two different synthetic sounds, and 3) increase the training length compared to previous studies to generate a robust long-lasting auditory memory.</p><p><italic>Finally, the novel method you use for the preference index for analyzing imprinting could be better explained and compared to previously used tests, and the appropriateness of the statistical tests you used considered.</italic> </p><p>Imprinting strength has been assessed differently across studies. We now mention the different approaches used in the past before introducing ours. As pointed out by one of the reviewers, the classic preference score (PS) was the ratio between locomotion during imprinted trials and total locomotion, PS= locomotion during imprinted trials / total locomotion. This preference index was used previously to assess imprinting strength in a 4-trial testing paradigm with stimuli presented in ‘fixed’ sequence (either imprinted- novel-novel-imprinted or novel-imprinted-imprinted-novel). Upon preliminary analysis, we noticed that considering only the first 4 trials for computing the classic preference score overestimated the strength of the imprinting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>). This was mainly because the first trials of the novel stimulus generated a stronger suppression of locomotion, compared to subsequent presentations of the same stimulus. For this reason, we decided to test imprinting strength in 10 pseudo-random trials. In addition, total locomotion varied largely from first to last trials mainly because locomotion during the novel trials increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>). Because baseline locomotion was the most stable parameter, on average, we decided to use it to normalize the difference in locomotion between imprinted and novel trials. We believe our computation of the preference score is advantageous for randomizing the stimulus presentation (thus ruling out biases due to sequence), normalizing by a more stable variable (baseline) and increasing the number of trials to 10 to assess not only novelty detection but also the maintenance of the preference over time.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17197.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>) Classic preference score (PS) for auditory and visual imprinting computed as PS=locomotion during imprinted trials/ total locomotion, in chickens trained for 2 hours (n=13), b) locomotion before and during the presentation of the imprinted stimulus (n=26, in each trial) and c) locomotion before and during the presentation of the novel stimulus (n=26, in each trial)</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17197.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17197.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-17197-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>We appreciate the comments on the statistical analysis.

Understanding what regulates critical periods and imprinting are indeed important questions that need to be addressed and will be of great interest to a broad community. While the title suggests that eIF2α controls translation-dependent auditory imprinting and structural plasticity, the authors do not provide any direct evidence that new proteins are synthesized. At best, the authors can claim that eIF2α is involved in auditory imprinting. Thus, the authors need to provide convincing evidence that translation, or increased protein synthesis, is required for auditory imprinting and structural plasticity. In addition, while the literature suggests eIF2α is involved in memory formation, so are other protein synthesis pathways such as mTOR, as mentioned in the Discussion. The authors should include Western blot analysis for other protein synthesis pathways, as a control.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. As requested, we now measure translation in vivoin response to training and tested the effect of different drugs. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, training increased translation in imprinting-relevant areas. In addition, we demonstrate that this increase in translation can be blocked with cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, C</xref>).

However, very little is known about the translational control pathways involved in imprinting.

The authors argue that the translational control by phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 2 α subunit (eIF2 α) is required for auditory imprinting, and mediates changes in dendritic spines in the MNM region. They present data that the increasing phosphorylated eIF2 α prevents the formation of auditory memories and spine plasticity. In contrast, the inhibition of an eIF2 α kinase enhances auditory memories. Furthermore, they provide evidence that the blocking p-eIF2 α mediated translational control enhances auditory memories and reopens the critical period. They propose a modality-specific translational control mechanism underlying the critical period for imprinting.</italic> </p><p><italic>The paper contains sufficient interest and originality to merit publication, however, the impact is weakened by a technical limitation of the methods used to quantify the preference score and to analyze the statistics.

We agree that our computation of the preference index should be more detailed and justified. As stated above, imprinting preference scores are influenced both by novelty and persistence of a preference for the imprinted stimulus. Thus, we designed our index taking both components into account, to avoid biasing the scores by disproportionate differences in the first trials due to novelty responses. The new version of the manuscript elaborates on this issue and compares our index with the ones in previous studies.</p><p><italic>Major points</italic> </p><p><italic>My main concern is that the preference index of the authors (&lt;imprinting-control&gt;/baseline) differs from that of the conventional method of Horn et al.

Compared to the method of Horn et al., this method seems to be affected by the individual difference of animals. I am wondering why the authors used &quot;baseline&quot;.

This index was generated to reflect imprinting across a larger number of trials and obtain a more accurate measure of memory strength. In contrast with previous studies, we did not use fixed presentation sequences and opted to pseudo randomize presentation order. We would like to argue that this paradigm better controls for the possible effect of stimulus presentation order. In addition, a fine trial-by-trial analysis of the locomotor response to novel and imprinted stimuli showed that the preference score captures the influence of both novelty detection and the persistence of increased locomotion towards the imprinted stimulus. Therefore, while classic preference scores are computed over 4 trials, we decided to measure preference across 10 trials. Based on the same analysis, we noticed that baseline (locomotion when only a background image is presented), was the most stable parameter during the experiment. Thus we decided to normalize differences to baseline.</p><p><italic>As for the statistical analysis, the authors use either unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney U test to examine the difference between two groups.

I assume the neurons are randomly labeled in the MNM. Therefore, more than 1000 spines at least per each experimental setting should be examined to detect significant morphological changes beyond individual deviation. At the same time, the exact location of brain area they examined and the morphological definition of dendritic spine for classification in chick should be mentioned in detail in the method section</italic> </p><p>The analysis method of dendritic spines is an important issue that we considered before performing the experiments. One advantage of the ‘diolistic’ technique is that it granted stochastic labeling of neurons both in MNM and IMM. Thus the results were not affected by labeling biases.</p><p>We agree that a large number of spines and dendrites should be analyzed to detect biologically meaningful differences between experimental groups. To assess this we carried out a power analysis to determine the minimum sample size per group (n<sub>dendrites</sub>=42, for statistical power= 0.85) and aimed to a total number of spines per group (average for our study= 673.33) within the range of previous studies in birds (~450-1500 spines, Roberts et al., 2010). In all analyzed groups our sample size is above 42 dendrites.</p><p>As mentioned above, we now included a more detailed description of the coordinates of the areas. We also include a more detailed description of the criteria in the methods section and a schematic of the categories in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>This manuscript from Batista et al. is beautifully written and addresses the role of translational regulation during critical period plasticity in the chick. The study includes data indicating that auditory imprinting involves translation initiation regulation by eIF2α, and in particular that eIF2α is phosphorylated and inhibited to allow for plasticity in the auditory cortex during the critical period. This indicates that mRNAs containing upstream open reading frames (whose translation is upregulated when eIF2α is phosphorylated and inhibited) are of particular importance to auditory plasticity during the critical period. In contrast, the authors show that phosphorylation of eIF2α, and hence eIF2α translational regulation, is not involved in visual imprinting. The findings are intriguing and I believe important. However, I also believe that there are some significant flaws in the experimental design and interpretation that weaken the study. My principal concerns have to do with the question of how well the translational inhibition worked, and the question of the kinetics of translational regulation in the MNM (for auditory imprinting) and IMM (for visual imprinting). What were the kinetics of inhibition of protein synthesis following IP injection? Was it equivalent in MNM and IMM? It's not clear from the manuscript whether or not the IP injection was done at the end of the 1 hr and the 2 hr training. The authors write: &quot;both auditory and visual imprinting rely on protein synthesis but following different temporal dynamics&quot;, and yet the conclusions from the translational inhibition experiments are all based on manipulations that do not appear to consider the differential temporal dynamics of imprinting (because they simply target a single time point, optimized for the effects on auditory imprinting). I also think it's really important to show that there is an effect on translation, and in particular on eIF2α-mediated translation.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that ensuring that drugs have a similar temporal dynamic to alter protein synthesis is crucial for our interpretations. Using SUnSET, we now show that we can alter translation bidirectionally, in both IMM and MNM, with pharmacology (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>This is provided for Sal003 in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, but only for &quot;brain samples,&quot; not for IMM or MNM. Without this, the results are all based on pharmacological interventions, which always have some caveats unless the expected effects are directly measured. For example it looks like there is significant variability in the ratio of peIF2α to eIF2α in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, which raises the question of whether this correlates in any way with plasticity during imprinting.</italic> </p><p>There is some intrinsic variability in p-eIF2α levels that cannot be correlated with performance, so far, because to carry out such experiments, quantification of p-eIF2α needs to be done before testing the animals. in vivomeasures of p-eIF2α, which are required to overcome this difficulty, are not yet available.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>[…] The reviewers have several queries, and ask for further clarification on the following:</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer 1 asks for you to explain why protein synthesis dependent visual plasticity at 1 hour of training was ignored and the focus placed on 2 hours; an explanation would help the reader move to the logic of the next set of experiments.</italic> </p><p>We decided to use 2-hour training to evaluate experience-dependent changes in translation because it allowed us to assess protein synthesis across brain regions in the same animal. Using 1-hour training did not induce reliable auditory imprinting. The interesting difference in time course is conveyed to readers in the Results section ‘Protein-synthesis dependency of auditory and visual imprinting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). We now further clarify the motivation for the 2-hour training in the methods as follows:</p><p>“To simultaneously assess experience-dependent translation across sensory modalities and brain regions, in the same animal, we identified a training schedule that reliably triggered auditory and visual imprinting. Since 2-hour but not 1-hour training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>) triggered both auditory and visual imprinting, we used the former schedule.”</p><p><italic>In addition, this reviewer wanted an explanation of the relevance of structural spine changes over density in the context of behavior.</italic> </p><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for suggesting references, which we now cite. To elaborate on the possible relevance of the observed structural plasticity on behavior and memory formation, we added the following paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>“Different forms of structural plasticity have been linked to memory, including spine turnover and morphological changes of preexisting spines (32). In this case, the structural plasticity found in IMM and MNM could be consistent with potentiation and enlargement of specific dendritic spines, favoring the detection of imprinted stimuli. While we did not observe changes in spine density, the increase in mushroom spines and decrease in thin spines may suggest coordinated structural plasticity as previously reported in hippocampal slices (42)”</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2 wondered why the first trials of the novel stimulus strongly suppressed locomotion; this does not seem to occur in the reviewer's hands in their experimental design. This reviewer is concerned about whether the training for imprinting by the authors is sufficient to cause strong preference compared with controls.</italic> </p><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for sharing personal experience.</p><p>We chose the sequential scheme in a running wheel because it allowed us to: 1- randomize the stimulus order, 2- measure baseline locomotion, 3- assess independently the response to novelty and to the imprinted stimulus. We have not been the first using this training schedule and reporting suppression by novel stimuli. Initial suppression of locomotion by the novel stimulus using a similar setup to ours has been reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; Maekawa et al., 2006). In addition, Maekawa et al. (2006) showed that aversion to novelty emerged after training. Thus behavioral suppression by novel stimuli is not inconsistent with innate attraction to conspicuous moving objects. To contextualize our methodology we now highlight in the methods our use of a sequential test and acknowledge the simultaneous choice test, used in other studies:</p><p>“Visual and auditory imprinting were tested independently in a sequential test, where novel and imprinted stimuli are presented in alternation. While other studies have used a simultaneous choice test (23), the sequential test allowed us to randomize stimulus presentation, measure baseline locomotion and assess the response to novel and imprinted stimuli independently.”</p><p>Regarding the reviewer’s concern about whether training for imprinting is sufficient to induce strong preference, we would like to argue that the response to the imprinted stimulus was substantially above baseline across trials. We enclose a figure from the previous rebuttal letter supporting this claim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>). The magnitude of imprinting induced by our training provided us a dynamic range to perform both loss- and gain-of-function manipulations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
