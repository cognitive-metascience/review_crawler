gastrula/segmentation stages, but it is unclear if such generally expressed factors act by the same mechanism throughout embryogenesis. We identify a TALE-dependent gene regulatory network (GRN) required for anterior development and detect TALE occupancy associated with this GRN throughout embryogenesis. At blastula stages, we uncover a novel functional mode for TALE factors, where they occupy genomic DECA motifs with nearby NF-Y sites. We demonstrate that TALE and NF-Y form complexes and regulate chromatin state at genes of this GRN. At segmentation stages, GRN-associated TALE occupancy expands to include HEXA motifs near PBX:HOX sites. Hence, TALE factors control a key GRN, but utilize distinct DNA motifs and protein partners at different stages – a strategy that may also explain their oncogenic potential and may be employed by other broadly expressed TFs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>maternal regulation</kwd><kwd>Prep</kwd><kwd>Pbx</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>pioneer factor</kwd><kwd>gene network</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS38183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sagerström</surname><given-names>Charles G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/N00907X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bobola</surname><given-names>Nicoletta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TALE transcription factors bind different genomic motifs and function together with different protein partners at different stages of zebrafish embryogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many transcription factors (TFs) involved in vertebrate embryogenesis are expressed across relatively large time windows that encompass a variety of cellular and morphological changes. While it seems likely that such TFs function by the same mechanism throughout embryogenesis, there is no <italic>a priori</italic> reason that this should be the case. One group of TFs in this category is the TALE (<underline>t</underline>hree <underline>a</underline>mino acid <underline>l</underline>oop <underline>e</underline>xtension) family of homeodomain proteins. The TALE family includes Pbx, as well as the closely related Prep and Meis proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Waskiewicz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deflorian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pöpperl et al., 2000</xref>). Pbx and Prep/Meis were originally identified as factors that form complexes with Hox TFs to drive cell fate decisions and tissue-specific gene expression starting at gastrula/segmentation stages (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moens and Selleri, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ladam and Sagerström, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Merabet and Mann, 2016</xref>]). Accordingly, several Hox-dependent enhancers contain regulatory elements consisting of immediately adjacent Pbx and Hox half-sites, usually of the form TGATNNAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pöpperl et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maconochie et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grieder et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ryoo and Mann, 1999</xref>), located a short distance from TGACAG (HEXA) binding sites for Prep/Meis monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ferretti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tümpel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jacobs et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ferretti et al., 2000</xref>). TALE factors also act in complexes with other tissue-specific TFs (e.g. Pdx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Peers et al., 1995</xref>), Rnx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rhee et al., 2004</xref>), MyoD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Knoepfler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berkes et al., 2004</xref>), Eng (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kobayashi et al., 2003</xref>), Otx2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agoston and Schulte, 2009</xref>) and Pax6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agoston et al., 2014</xref>]) during gastrulation/segmentation stages. Additionally, TALE factors have oncogenic potential and have been implicated in various types of leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kamps and Baltimore, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nourse et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moskow et al., 1995</xref>). In agreement with an important developmental role, disruption of TALE function leads to severe embryonic phenotypes such that mice homozygous for null mutations in <italic>pbx1</italic>, <italic>prep1</italic> or <italic>meis1</italic> die <italic>in utero,</italic> while <italic>pbx3</italic> mutants die a few days after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rhee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Selleri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fernandez-Diaz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hisa et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, disruption of the earliest expressed TALE genes in zebrafish (<italic>prep1.1, pbx2</italic> and <italic>pbx4</italic>) produces severe embryonic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deflorian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Waskiewicz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pöpperl et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In spite of their function having been defined primarily at gastrula/segmentation stages, TALE factors are actually present throughout embryogenesis. In particular, zebrafish Prep and Pbx mRNA and protein is both maternally deposited and ubiquitously expressed in the later embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fernandez-Diaz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deflorian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pöpperl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vlachakis et al., 2000</xref>). Since all known TFs that bind TALE factors are not expressed until gastrula stages or later, it follows that TALE factors may have distinct roles prior to gastrula stages. Accordingly, Prep and Pbx can be detected at gene regulatory elements prior to the binding of their partner TFs. For instance, Prep and Pbx occupy the <italic>hoxb1a</italic> enhancer prior to Hoxb1b binding and before <italic>hoxb1a</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choe et al., 2014</xref>), while Pbx binds the <italic>myogenin</italic> locus before MyoD and prior to onset of <italic>myogenin</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berkes et al., 2004</xref>). Here, we explore the possibility that TALE factors may have uncharacterized roles during early embryogenesis. We find that maternally deposited TALE factors primarily occupy a 10 bp DECA motif at blastula stages. This motif was previously identified as a binding site for Prep:Pbx dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knoepfler and Kamps, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Kumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Laurent et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Penkov et al., 2013</xref>), but was not assigned a biological role. We also find that these DECA sites have adjacent binding sites for the NF-Y pioneer TF and we show that TALE and NF-Y form a complex. Furthermore, TALE and NF-Y are required for the gradual transition to an active chromatin state of a gene network controlling anterior embryonic development. By segmentation stages, the binding repertoire of TALE factors expands to also include HEXA sites and PBX:HOX binding sites associated with the same gene network. Hence, TALE TFs control an anterior gene network throughout zebrafish embryogenesis, but do so by employing distinct DNA motifs and protein partners at different embryonic stages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TALE factors control a gene network regulating formation of anterior embryonic structures in zebrafish</title><p>TALE factors play a key role in early vertebrate embryogenesis, as evidenced by the phenotypes observed in TALE loss-of-function animals. In particular, loss of <italic>prep1.1, pbx2</italic> and/or <italic>pbx4</italic> function in zebrafish produces smaller heads and reduced eye size, as well as CNS defects – including disruptions of hindbrain segmentation – and cardiovascular defects that manifest themselves in the form of cardiac edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deflorian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Waskiewicz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pöpperl et al., 2000</xref>), but the genetic basis of these defects is not well understood. In order to comprehensively identify TALE-dependent genes involved in embryogenesis, we used RNA-seq to compare gene expression in wildtype versus TALE loss-of-function animals. We focused on the function of <italic>pbx2</italic>, <italic>pbx4</italic> and <italic>prep1.1</italic> since these genes are ubiquitously expressed and represent the predominant TALE factors in the early zebrafish embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deflorian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Waskiewicz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pöpperl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vlachakis et al., 2000</xref>). We used gene knock-down (KD; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref> for details) to generate embryos lacking Pbx and Prep function (as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Waskiewicz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deflorian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pöpperl et al., 2000</xref>]) and we observe the expected phenotype – including a reduced head, smaller eyes, cardiac edema, loss of pectoral fins, loss of hindbrain Mauthner neurons and disrupted cartilage formation in the head region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Comparisons of RNA-seq data from control and TALE KD embryos at developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) when TALE-dependent tissues are being specified (early gastrula; 6hpf) or initiating morphogenesis (segmentation stages; 12hpf) revealed minimal gene expression changes at 6hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>), but extensive changes at 12hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Specifically, the expression of 671 genes (526 genes downregulated and 145 upregulated; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) is altered in TALE KD embryos compared to control embryos at 12hpf. GO-term analysis on the genes downregulated in 12hpf TALE KD embryos revealed an enrichment for roles in embryonic development – particularly head formation, neural development (including eye and hindbrain development) and circulatory system formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), consistent with the TALE KD phenotype. Furthermore, these TALE-regulated genes are enriched for transcriptional regulators and a large number encode known TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>), suggesting that this gene set defines a gene regulatory network (GRN). Upon comparison to previously reported TALE loss-of-function phenotypes, we find that of 13 Pbx-dependent genes identified in the zebrafish retina and hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">French et al., 2007</xref>), seven (<italic>egr2b, mafba, eng2b, rx2, gdf6a, hmx4, meis3</italic>) are also downregulated in our analysis. Similarly, of six genes downregulated in Prep loss-of-function zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deflorian et al., 2004</xref>), four (<italic>pax6a, hoxb1a, hoxa2b, hoxb2a</italic>) are downregulated in our experiment. This suggests that our RNA-seq analysis captured a comprehensive set of TALE-dependent genes. We conclude that TALE TFs control a gene regulatory network (TALE GRN), which instructs anterior embryonic development and that becomes operative between 6hpf and 12hpf.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36144.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TALE factors control a gene network regulating formation of anterior embryonic structures.</title><p>See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.

Since this role was characterized primarily at segmentation stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ferretti et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jacobs et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tümpel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pöpperl et al., 1995</xref>), we considered the possibility that the Prep<sub>12hpf-only</sub> peaks may represent TALE factors acting together with tissue-specific TFs. Indeed, MEME analysis of Prep<sub>12hpf-only</sub> peaks returned a 6 bp TGACAG (HEXA) motif, but not the DECA motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). HEXA motifs are binding sites for monomeric Prep (or Meis) factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berthelsen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shen et al., 1997a</xref>) and have been found at several Hox-dependent regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ferretti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ryoo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jacobs et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tümpel et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly, MEME also identified a TGATTTAT sequence, which represents a binding site for TALE:HOX dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Penkov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shen et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 1996</xref>), at the Prep<sub>12hpf-only</sub> peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This Hox motif is not located at the center of the Prep peaks, but is off-set by ~10 bp, as has been observed previously at regulatory elements where Prep/Meis acts with Hox TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jacobs et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ferretti et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2000</xref>). We next examined the prevalence of the different motifs at Prep<sub>3.5hpf</sub> versus Prep<sub>12hpf-only</sub> peaks. We find that 75% of Prep<sub>3.5hpf</sub> binding sites contain a DECA motif, while only 7% of Prep<sub>12hpf-only</sub> sites do so. Conversely, 44% of all Prep<sub>12hpf-only</sub> binding sites, but only 11% of Prep<sub>3.5hpf</sub> sites, contain a HEXA motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Consistent with HEXA motifs being associated with a Prep cofactor role, we also find that PBX:HOX binding sites are more prevalent at Prep<sub>12hpf</sub> peaks (24%) than at Prep<sub>3.5hpf</sub> peaks (5%). It is surprising that HEXA sites are not occupied by Prep at blastula stages and we considered the possibility that HEXA sites may not be accessible at this stage. We made use of previously published ATAC-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaaij et al., 2016</xref>) to examine DNA accessibility at DECA versus HEXA sites at 4hpf and find that HEXA sites are considerably more accessible than DECA sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting that chromatin accessibility is not a limiting factor for Prep binding at HEXA sites in the blastula stage embryo.</p><p>While both DECA and HEXA sites have been reported previously, our data show for the first time that there is a temporal order to how TALE factors utilize these motifs during embryogenesis. Specifically, TALE factors occupy primarily DECA sites at blastula stages and these motifs remain occupied at least until segmentation stages, but by segmentation stages additional binding sites become utilized so that TALE factors also occupy HEXA motifs associated with binding sites for tissue-specific TFs such as Hox proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Some TALE-occupied sites are associated with chromatin marks at Blastula stages</title><p>Previous analyses of individual DNA elements containing HEXA motifs adjacent to PBX:HOX motifs demonstrated that these act as enhancers in mouse and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pöpperl et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jacobs et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ferretti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Choe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ferretti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Di Rocco et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Manzanares et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tümpel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wassef et al., 2008</xref>). Conversely, de novo motif discovery in conserved hindbrain enhancers – combined with functional testing in zebrafish – identified HEXA and PBX:HOX motifs as being essential for enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Parker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grice et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, we find that the Prep<sub>12hpf-only</sub> peaks are found at highly conserved regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and are associated with chromatin modifications known to mark enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Finally, we find that of 74 hindbrain enhancers active at 48–72hpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grice et al., 2015</xref>), 19 (26%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) are associated with a Prep<sub>12hpf-only</sub> peak. Hence, the arrangement of HEXA sites associated with PBX:HOX motifs (and other tissue-specific TF motifs) that we observe at 12hpf is very likely to represent enhancer elements.</p><p>In contrast, no biological function has yet been assigned to elements containing DECA motifs. We characterized 11 Prep-occupied DECA sites in greater detail and find that eight are associated with genomic regions conserved in five other fish species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Six of these elements are also conserved in mammals, suggesting that they play an evolutionarily important role. To identify a role for these elements, we tested whether Prep<sub>3.5hpf</sub> peaks correlate with particular chromatin features by comparison to available ChIP-seq data sets from 4.5hpf blastula stage zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bogdanovic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Ranking TALE-bound regions based on their level of H3K4me1 (a histone modification associated with enhancers and promoters) reveals a clear pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In particular, K-means clustering produced four clusters of sequences, three of which (representing ~25% of all TALE-occupied sites) are highly marked by H3K4me1. To distinguish TALE-occupied sites associated with chromatin marks from sites that lack (or display very low levels of) such marks, we refer to them as MPADs (Modified Prep Associated Domains) and non-MPADs, respectively. We find that MPADs are also enriched for H3K4me3 (a mark of active promoters) and H3K27ac (a mark of active enhancers and promoters). In addition, MPADs center on nucleosome-depleted regions and are highly enriched for RNA polymerase II occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). MPADs are also preferentially found within 5 kb of TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), are enriched near genes involved in transcriptional regulation and embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and are found at conserved sites in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, the remaining 75% of TALE-occupied sites display only sparsely modified histones at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These non-MPAD sites lack a nucleosome free region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and are only weakly associated with RNA Polymerase II, but they are highly methylated on CpG dinucleotides. The non-MPAD sites are mostly found at distances greater than 5 kb from TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), associated genes are not enriched for any specific functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and they are not highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36144.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Some TALE-occupied sites are associated with chromatin marks at blastula stages and developmental control genes are enriched near MPADs displaying repressive histone modifications.</title><p>See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>.

We find that ~40% (1595/4008) of the Prep-associated genes in mESCs have orthologs with a nearby Prep<sub>3.5hpf</sub> peak in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>), indicating that Prep binding near developmental control genes is evolutionarily conserved.

Hence, at blastula stages, TALE-occupied sites can be divided into ones that are associated with various chromatin marks and are located near promoter regions of developmental control genes (MPADs), and ones that are largely devoid of histone marks and that are not associated with specific gene functions (non-MPADs).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Developmental control genes are enriched near MPADs displaying repressive histone modifications</title><p>We noticed that a subset of MPADs shows detectable enrichment for the repressive H3K27me3 histone modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To examine this finding further, we ranked MPADs based on their level of H3K27ac and H3K27me3 at blastula stages. K-means clustering divided the resulting distribution into four groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). For the sake of comparison, we refer to these as Class 1–4 MPADs. In particular, MPADs with high (Class 1) and intermediate (Class 2) levels of H3K27ac are associated with high levels of H3K4me3 and RNA Pol II occupancy, while elements with low levels of H3K27ac (Class 3 and 4) are not. Notably, the subset of MPADs with the lowest level of H3K27ac are associated with high levels of H3K27me3 (Class 4). When we analyze the GO-terms of genes associated with each of the four MPAD classes, we find that H3K27me3-modified Class 4 MPADs are more highly associated with developmental control genes than are Class1-3 MPADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In agreement with the chromatin profile at MPADs, RNA-seq analysis at 6hpf (shortly after the onset of zygotic gene expression) revealed that genes associated with Class 1 and 2 MPADs are expressed at higher levels than genes associated with Class 3 and 4 MPADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Similarly, ranking MPADs from mESCs based on H3K27ac levels revealed categories analogous to those observed in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F,G</xref>).</p><p>Hence, MPADs can be further subdivided such that Class 1 and 2 display active chromatin marks and are found near genes expressed at 6hpf. In contrast, Class 4 MPADs are marked by H3K27me3 and are associated with genes involved in developmental processes, but these are not highly expressed at 6hpf. Class 3 MPADs are only marked by H3K4me1 and genes associated with this class show an intermediate level of expression at 6hpf, but they are not enriched for specific biological functions. We conclude that the chromatin state of MPADs correlates with the biological function of nearby genes and that developmental control genes are primarily associated with repressed (H3K27me3-modified) Class 4 MPADs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Class 4 MPADs transition to an active chromatin state during embryogenesis</title><p>We next examined whether chromatin modifications at MPADs change as embryogenesis progresses by comparing their H3K27ac status at the blastula stage (4.5hpf) to that at late gastrula (9hpf) – when the embryonic axes have formed and organogenesis is beginning. We find that Class 1 and 2 MPADs undergo a reduction in the level of H3K27ac modification from 4.5hpf to 9hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), while RNA-seq at 12hpf (to capture changes in gene expression corresponding to chromatin changes at 9hpf; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) shows that the associated genes are expressed at similar levels at 12hpf and 6hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Class 3 MPADs show an intermediate effect with a small change in H3K27ac levels and a slight increase in expression of associated genes.

Indeed, we find that TALE GRN genes are significantly associated with Class 4 (and Class 3), but not Class 1 or 2, MPADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). A closer analysis of the TALE GRN genes associated with Class 3 and 4 MPADs revealed that they are enriched for functions related to transcriptional regulation and early embryonic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) that align well with the developmental defects observed in TALE KD embryos. In fact, 27 of the 34 TALE GRN genes associated with Class 4 MPADs encode TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and a literature review uncovered that ~65% (22/34) have been previously implicated in the formation of embryonic structures that are affected in TALE KD embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). These findings suggest that TALE factors act via Class 4 (and, to a certain extent, Class 3) MPADs to control a core set of TFs in the TALE GRN. To directly test this possibility, we assessed whether TALE factors are required for the expression of MPAD-associated genes by 12hpf.

The effect of the NF-YDN is somewhat more severe than that resulting from TALE KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), but the two phenotypes share some features – including smaller head and eyes, as well as cardiac edema – suggesting that NF-Y may also regulate the expression of genes in the TALE GRN. To test this, we analyzed expression of 21 TALE-dependent genes associated with Class 4 MPADs (out of the 34 such genes identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; six of these were also confirmed as associated with NF-Y occupancy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and find that 18 (86%) are downregulated upon NF-Y disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Furthermore, NF-Y disruption leads to a decrease in H3K27ac at MPADs associated with these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), similar to our observation following disruption of TALE function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). A shared role for TALE and NF-Y factors in controlling H3K27ac may be broadly relevant at the blastula stage, since we find that TALE peaks with adjacent CCAAT motifs are generally associated with higher levels of H3K27ac and lower levels of H3K27me3 than TALE peaks that lack a nearby CCAAT box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We do not find any differences in the distribution of NF-Y motifs among the various MPAD classes, suggesting that NF-Y is generally associated with TALE occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We noticed from our bioinformatics analysis that NF-Y sites occur very close to DECA sites, with the average spacing being ~20 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), raising the possibility that NF-Y may physically interact with TALE proteins. Since Prep:Pbx is a heterodimer and NF-Y is a heterotrimeric TF, we tested the ability of Prep and Pbx to bind NF-YA and/or NF-YB in pairwise combinations by co-immunoprecipitation from transfected HEK293 cells. In this context, we find that both Prep and Pbx interact with the NF-YB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) and NF-YA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>) subunits, indicating that Prep:Pbx and NF-Y can form complexes. We conclude that NF-Y binds adjacent to TALE factors at DECA sites and that both factors are required for regulation of the TALE GRN, possibly by functioning in a complex.</p><p>As discussed above, genomic elements containing HEXA and PBX:HOX motifs have been shown to function as enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pöpperl et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jacobs et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ferretti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Choe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ferretti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Di Rocco et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Manzanares et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tümpel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wassef et al., 2008</xref>), but it is not clear if elements containing DECA and NF-Y sites have such activity. In particular, most TALE GRN genes associated with Class 4 MPADs have tissue-specific expression patterns, but the TALE and NF-Y factors are ubiquitously expressed, suggesting that genomic elements containing only DECA and NF-Y sites may not be sufficient to drive gene expression. Accordingly, by testing seven DECA and NF-Y site-containing genomic elements for enhancer activity in HEK293 cells, we find that only one drives luciferase reporter expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Accordingly, our analysis detected HEXA motifs with nearby PBX:HOX motifs at Prep binding sites associated with a TALE-dependent anterior GRN in segmentation stage (12hpf) zebrafish embryos. Strikingly, we find that TALE-occupancy is associated with this GRN already at blastula stages (3.5hpf), but at this stage TALE factors instead utilize DECA sites (consisting of immediately adjacent Pbx and Prep sites). We also discovered that NF-Y binds CCAAT motifs near DECA sites and forms complexes with TALE factors. Finally, we demonstrate that TALE and NF-Y are both required for the transition to an active chromatin profile at GRN-associated genes. Hence, TALE factors control an anterior GRN throughout embryogenesis, but the choice of binding motifs and partner proteins varies such that TALE factors interact with NF-Y at DECA sites starting at blastula stages and then expand their binding repertoire to also include HEXA sites, where they interact with Pbx:Hox dimers, by segmentation stages (see summary model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).</p><p>Although DECA sites were identified previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Penkov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Kumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Laurent et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knoepfler and Kamps, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 1997</xref>), they have not been assigned a biological function. Our experiments now reveal that genomic elements containing DECA and NF-Y motifs may not be sufficient to act as enhancers. Instead, TALE and NF-Y bind many of these elements prior to the appearance of active chromatin marks. Indeed, we note that many genomic loci bound by Prep at 3.5hpf are highly occupied by nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>), indicating that Prep can access its binding sites in compacted embryonic chromatin. Furthermore, we find that TALE factors are required for the deposition of H3K27ac marks at these elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This may be a general function of TALE factors since several TALE proteins bind CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Choe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Saleh et al., 2000</xref>) – the enzyme responsible for H3K27 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tie et al., 2009</xref>) – and Pbx reportedly promotes active chromatin in a breast cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Magnani et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, NF-Y contains a histone-fold and makes both specific and non-specific contacts with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nardini et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that NF-Y may access its binding site by displacing histones. Hence, the joint activity of TALE and NF-Y may represent a pioneer function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Iwafuchi-Doi and Zaret, 2016</xref>) that permits access to DECA/NF-Y sites in compacted chromatin (see summary model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Although only ~50% of TALE-occupied sites are associated with a NF-Y motif at 3.5hpf, there are also nearby motifs for SP/KLF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and KLF4 is a pioneer factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Soufi et al., 2015</xref>) that binds TALE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bjerke et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that TALE proteins may act together with various other TFs in a pioneer role at DECA sites.</p><p>We find that many of the TALE-dependent genes identified by our analysis are expressed in the anterior embryo. Since TALE and NF-Y factors are present ubiquitously, this suggests that additional tissue-restricted inputs are required to achieve spatially appropriate expression of these genes during embryogenesis. We therefore hypothesize that TALE and NF-Y pioneer activity is required for nearby tissue-specific enhancers to become functional (see summary model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). In fact, the additional Prep-occupied sites that emerge by 12hpf may represent such tissue-specific enhancers. Some of these sites contain monomeric HEXA motifs near PBX:HOX motifs in an arrangement found at many hindbrain enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grice et al., 2015</xref>) and they are enriched near DECA/NF-Y sites. These 12hpf Prep sites contain not only PBX:HOX binding sites, but also motifs for other tissue-specific TFs (such as myogenic factors) indicating that DECA/NF-Y motifs may play a general role in promoting access to enhancers. We also note that TALE factors arose prior to Hox genes in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bürglin and Affolter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hrycaj and Wellik, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Holland, 2013</xref>), suggesting that TALE activity at DECA sites may represent an original function and that TALE factors may have been subsequently co-opted to function together with tissue-specific TFs.</p><p>Maternally deposited material controls embryonic development in zebrafish until 3hpf-4hpf. Indeed, TALE and NF-Y are maternally deposited in zebrafish ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deflorian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Waskiewicz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2009</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and by 3.5hpf – the stage when we carried out our ChIP-seq analysis – zygotic Prep, Pbx and NF-Y expression is not yet detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Hence, the initial activity of TALE and NF-Y at DECA/NF-Y sites at 3.5hpf is likely maternally directed, while DECA/NF-Y sites and HEXA/PBX:HOX sites detected at 12hpf are more likely occupied by zygotically produced factors. Differences between maternally and zygotically controlled stages of embryogenesis may also explain why Prep binds HEXA sites efficiently at 12hpf, but not at 3.5hpf. Specifically, it is possible that Prep cannot bind HEXA sites as a monomer but requires the cooperation of tissue-specific TFs (such as Hox proteins) that are not present maternally. Indeed, our recent work demonstrated that binding of Meis proteins (that are closely related to Prep proteins) to HEXA motifs is stabilized by Hox proteins in segmentation stage mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Prep binds many genomic loci in the 3.5hpf embryo and these sites display diverse chromatin states, such that Class 1 and 2 MPADs are associated with genes expressed by 6hpf, Class 4 MPADs with genes expressed by 12hpf and non-MPADs with genes expressed at later stages of embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). While our functional analysis indicates that primarily genes associated with Class 4 MPADs are affected by TALE KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), this is likely a result of our choosing the 12hpf timepoint for RNA-seq. Indeed, we show that non-MPADs continue to transition to an active chromatin state at least until 24hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), but any genes that become expressed as a result of this transition would not have been detected by our analysis. For instance, muscle differentiation involves TALE function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berkes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Knoepfler et al., 1999</xref>) and Prep peaks are found near genes involved in myogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Although expression of myogenic genes is somewhat affected in TALE KD embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>) much of muscle differentiation takes place after 12hpf suggesting that this expression effect would be more pronounced at later stages. Accordingly, the effect of TALE factors at Class 3 MPAD-associated genes is less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), possibly because these genes are involved in muscle development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Genes associated with Class 1 and 2 MPADs are only mildly TALE-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Strikingly, ~70% of ‘first-wave’ genes (ones activated by maternal factors in the early zygote [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2013</xref>]) are located near Prep peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>) – particularly near Class 1 and 2 MPADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H</xref>) – but expression of these genes is not affected by TALE KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). The reason for this is not clear, but the pluripotency factors Nanog, Pou5fl and SoxB1 are required for expression of first-wave genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Leichsenring et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2013</xref>) and may act redundantly with TALE and NF-Y at these early stages. Accordingly, our RNA-seq analysis found that expression of <italic>nanog, pou5fl</italic> and <italic>soxB1</italic> is not disrupted in TALE KD embryos. Alternatively, the onset of the knockdown effect may be delayed, preventing it from disrupting early TALE activity required for first-wave gene expression.</p><p>Lastly, TALE factors act as oncogenes in several systems and have been specifically implicated in various types of leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kamps and Baltimore, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nourse et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moskow et al., 1995</xref>). Their oncogenic potential has generally been considered in the context of their action as transcription cofactors to Hox proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eklund, 2007</xref>). Our finding that TALE factors use additional binding motifs and interaction partners, as well as their ability to promote an active chromatin state, suggests that this model should be expanded to also consider non Hox-related mechanisms for TALE factor-mediated leukemogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

BED files containing Prep biding site coordinates and wiggle files of previously published datasets (Key Resources Table) downloaded from GEO or ENCODE were used as inputs. First, signal matrices at Prep bound regions were made using the compute matrix tool in reference-point mode with the following parameters: distance upstream and downstream of the start site of the regions defined in the BED file: 1000 or 2,000 bp, bin size: 25 bp. When necessary, the regions were ranked based on mean signal values. Second, score matrices were used to generate heatmaps and mean score profiles with the plot heatmaps and plot profile tools respectively. We note that the public ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq datasets are from slightly different timepoints (4.5hpf and 4hpf, respectively) than our Prep ChIP-seq dataset (3.5hpf). Since each dataset requires hundreds to thousands of embryos (that cannot be individually staged) and zebrafish development is slightly asynchronous, it is likely that collecting embryos at these three timepoints will result in considerable overlap of the actual stages analyzed.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the Genomic Technologies and Bioinformatics Core Facilities at the University of Manchester, UK and to Alper Kucukural at the University of Massachusetts Bioinformatics Core for assistance.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was submitted to and approved by the University of Massachusetts Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol A-1565) and the University of Massachusetts Medical School Institutional Review Board (protocol I-149).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="scode1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36144.016</object-id><label>Source code 1.</label><caption><title>moth.py (Motif Occurrence for TALE and Hox factors) file.</title><p>This module identifies transcription factor motifs (for TALE, Hox and NF-Y) in input sequences.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior/Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hugo Parker (Reviewer #1); Licia Selleri (Reviewer #2); Miguel Torres (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The essential revisions are described below but we also include the full reviews of the three reviewers for further details.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Ladam et al. investigate how TALE factors contribute to early zebrafish development by characterizing Prep1.1 DNA-binding profiles at blastula and segmentation stages. They correlate these binding profiles with chromatin marks at these loci and with gene expression data from wild-type vs. TALE knock-down embryos. By focusing on two developmental timepoints, they make the interesting finding that the DNA-binding preference of Prep1.1 appears to expand during development. Strikingly, early binding to 'DECA' motifs is a feature at the blastula stage and additional binding to 'HEXA' motifs with adjacent Pbx-Hox motifs is seen by the segmentation stage. Exploring this further, they identify NF-Y as a potential binding partner of Pbx and Prep in blastula embryos. This leads to a model in which TALE factors utilise different modes of DNA-binding at different times in development, depending on the availability of co-factors such as NF-Y and Hox factors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors must demonstrate that their model is correct by testing several of the identified elements by reporter assays in zebrafish embryos (or at the very least in cell lines in vitro), coupled with mutation of predicted TALE and NF-Y binding sites to address the importance of these sites for enhancer function.</p><p>2) The TALE knock-down phenotype needs to be better characterized with appropriate validation of the specificity of the morpholino.</p><p>3) The authors need to explain the temporal discrepancies of all their assays.</p><p>4) The authors should provide clarifications/explanations regarding the statement that TALE GRN genes are significantly associated with Class 4 and Class 3, but not Class 1 or 2, MPADs (Figure 6A, B).</p><p>5) The authors should include a final diagram depicting the model of Prep1.1/TALE DNA-binding dynamics across developmental time and how this relates to the activation of the components of the TALE-GRN, changes in chromatin state and interactions with co-factors.</p><p>6) Absolute statements should be avoided (e.g. &quot;TALE factors control gene expression by regulating a chromatin transition… at a core set of genes encoding TFs that direct anterior development.&quot;)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This work addresses an important question because Prep and Pbx proteins are crucial factors for vertebrate development and are present throughout embryogenesis but most of the focus up to now has been on their roles during segmentation stages, with their early roles and mode/s of DNA-binding receiving relatively little attention. The finding that these factors exhibit an expansion of their DNA-binding repertoire between blastula and segmentation stages is novel and interesting, representing a significant advance in our understanding of the dynamic roles of these factors during early development. However, I have a few points that I think should be addressed, that would considerably strengthen the conclusions and the manuscript.</p><p>i) The TALE knock-down phenotype needs to be described/characterised in more detail, to provide a more comprehensive view of the developmental context and to validate the specificity of the morpholino cocktail. For instance, hindbrain segmentation/neuroanatomy and craniofacial morphology should be characterised in the triple morphants to provide more detailed evidence that the knockdown is as expected given the previously characterised MO phenotypes. I also suggest moving the justification for using MO's that is in the Figure 1—figure supplement 1 legend to the Materials and methods section or the main text, where it will be more prominent.</p><p>ii) An assumption made is that Prep1.1-bound sites, or at least a sub-set of them, represent enhancer elements. The authors must demonstrate that this is true by testing a few such elements by reporter assay in zebrafish embryos, coupled with mutation of predicted TALE and NF-Y sites to address the importance of these sites for enhancer function. This can be done relatively quickly by transient transgenesis, is frequently used for mechanistic dissection of cis-regulatory elements, and will provide crucial evidence for the functionality of these putative enhancers.</p><p>iii) The authors use data from mouse ESCs to infer evolutionary conservation of the TALE GRN and of TALE-NF-Y co-localised binding, which expands the scope beyond zebrafish. A complementary approach is to address how many Prep1.1-bound peaks overlap with fish-mammal conserved non-coding elements that have been described in the literature. It is also worth checking if any are homologous to elements in the VISTA enhancer browser and have been experimentally validated in transgenic mice. This is straightforward to do and could potentially add weight to the argument that these interactions are evolutionarily conserved.</p><p>iv) This manuscript would really benefit from a final diagram depicting the model of Prep1.1/TALE DNA-binding dynamics across developmental time and how this relates to the activation of the components of the TALE-GRN, changes in chromatin state and interactions with co-factors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The paper by Franck Ladam et al. presents original studies on unexplored mechanisms that underlie very early roles of TALE transcription factors (TFs) in blastula/gastrula versus later roles during segmentation stages of zebrafish development.</p><p>This interesting study makes a substantial leap forward by identifying binding of TALE factors at genomic Pbx:Prep (DECA) sites during early zebrafish developmental stages, at 3.5 hpf. The authors also report that binding motifs for the maternal NF-Y TF are enriched near DECA sites and that NF-Y can form complexes with TALE proteins. Interestingly, the authors demonstrate that in the later post-gastrula embryo, at segmentation stages, GRN-associated TALE occupancy expands to include HEXA motifs with adjacent PBX:HOX sites. Therefore, the authors convincingly demonstrate that TALE factors control a key GRN, but utilize distinct DNA motifs and protein partners at different developmental stages, which is a novel and as yet unexplored mechanism underlying differential and temporally-restricted functions of TALE TFs in vertebrate embryogenesis.</p><p>The manuscript comprises an arsenal of high-quality results that are illustrated in complex and impeccable figures. The identification of distinct sequence-based mechanisms that underlie TALE binding to DNA thus directing different developmental functions at successive stages of embryogenesis is per se a fundamental finding. This study will be of high importance and interest for TALE biology, which sorely lacks mechanistic research conducted in vivo in animal models. The original findings reported in this paper can also open newpaths of investigation on roles of TALE factors in the earliest stages of embryogenesis in other organisms, including mammals. In addition, the distinct strategies that are being employed by TALE factors to execute developmental processes at different stages of embryogenesis might be similarly adopted by other TFs with widespread expression patterns, thus opening additional avenues for broader investigations.</p><p>Concerns that should be addressed:</p><p>1) Results – General Consideration:</p><p>The authors conduct multiple genome-wide experiments and/or mine available genome-wide datasets, including RNA-Seq, ChIP-seq for Prep1, ATAC Seq, ChIP-seq for chromatin marks. The time-point analyzed are not fully consistent across these experimental approaches, e.g. RNA-Seq for controls and TALE KD zebrafish embryos is performed at 6hpf (early gastrula) and at 12hpf (segmentation stage); ChIP-seq for Prep1.1 is performed at 3.5hpf (blastula) and at 12hpf (segmentation stage); ATAC-Seq at 4hpf (blastula; available datasets); and ChIP-seq for chromatin marks at 4.5hpf (blastula; available datasets). While this could be somewhat concerning, the findings and the overall message emerging from the study are strong and do not appear to be weakened by the slight temporal discrepancies. Indeed: a) out of the 13,300 Prep peaks at 3.5hpf, ~60% co-localize with a Prep peak at 12hpf, suggesting that a large fraction of binding sites remains occupied throughout embryogenesis; b) an additional ~16,500 peaks detectable at 12hpf do not co-localize with Prep 3.5hpf peaks, demonstrating that additional binding sites become occupied at later developmental stages; c) Prep binding is dynamically and continuously associated with the TALE GRN during zebrafish embryogenesis; d) TALE factors utilize distinct binding motifs at very early versus late stages of embryogenesis; e) TALE-occupied sites are associated with specific chromatin states at blastula stages; f) developmental control genes are enriched near Modified Prep Associated Domains (MPADs) displaying repressive histone modifications; g) Class 4 MPADs transition to an active chromatin state during later stages of embryogenesis; h) TALE and NF-Y factors have joint roles at very early developmental stages and can form complexes.</p><p>This reviewer is not particularly concerned about the minor temporal discrepancies present among the various genome-wide assays conducted in this study, given the strong message emerging from all of the reported high-throughput experiments. However, it might be useful to underscore throughout the text and in the Discussion that TALE factors adopt distinct mechanistic strategies in zebrafish blastula and early gastrula versus segmentation stages; in other words to simply cluster together the functions of TALE TFs in blastula and early gastrula within one single group (comprising 3.5, 4, 4.5, and 6 hpf). To this end, it would help to slightly modify the cartoon illustrating the subsequent zebrafish developmental stages in Figure 1A. The authors could group [blastula stages and early gastrula stages] within one single bracket or inside one single box andthe [segmentation stages] inside another bracket or box. Accordingly, this clustering could be clarified in the figure legend.</p><p>2) Results, subsection “TALE factors control the chromatin state at Class 4 MPADs associated with the anterior GRN”: The authors state that TALE GRN genes are significantly associated with Class 4 and Class 3, but not Class 1 or 2, MPADs (Figure 6A, B). However, RNA-seq (Figure 5C) shows that genes associated with Class 3 MPADs (and also Class 1 and 2 MPADs) are expressed at similar levels at 12hpf and 6hpf (Figure 5D). In contrast, Class 4 MPADs display higher levels of H3K27ac at 9hpf than at 4.5hpf (Figure 5A, B) and their associated genes show the greatest increase in expression between 6hpf and 12hpf. In addition, only class 4 MPADs showed a strong switch to an active chromatin state from 4.5hpf to 9hpf during zebrafish embryogenesis (Figure 5A, B), while class 3 MPADs did not exhibit any significant switch (Figure 5A, B). Collectively, these results are somewhat difficult to reconcile. The authors should qualify these findings and try to explain these differences. Are other factors necessary for activation of Class 3 MPADs? Or do the acetylation changes appear at a later time-point for Class 3 MPADs? Can other scenarios be envisaged? It would be helpful to add these considerations at least to the Discussion section of the paper.</p><p>3) Results: The authors state: &quot;These findings indicate that TALE factors control gene expression by regulating a chromatin transition – from repressive chromatin in blastula stage embryos to active chromatin in segmentation stage embryos – at a core set of genes encoding TFs that direct anterior development.&quot;</p><p>This statement is very strong and absolute, whereas it does not hold across the entire animal kingdom. In fact, in the mouse TALE factors substantially affect &quot;posterior&quot; development, as shown by the presence of severe posterior developmental defects in various mouse models with LOF for different TALE TFs. For example, in Pbx LOF mouse embryos it has been reported that the posterior axial skeleton, the hindlimb, and the urogenital system are severely compromised, among other posterior structures. In addition, also in the zebrafish embryo, Prep binds many loci in addition to ones associated with the anterior GRN and some of these additional sites are near genes that regulate other developmental processes known to involve TALE function. For instance, Prep peaks are found near genes involved in myogenesis (Figure 2D, E) and expression of myogenic genes is disrupted in TALE KD embryos, as the authors report in the Discussion section of the paper. Given all of these considerations, the statement above should be at least qualified and also toned down:</p><p>&quot;These findings indicate that TALE factors control gene expression by regulating a chromatin transition – from repressive chromatin in blastula stage embryos to active chromatin in segmentation stage embryos – at a core set of genes encoding TFs that direct primarily anterior development in the zebrafish embryo.&quot;</p><p>4) Results, subsection “NF-Y proteins regulate TALE GRN expression and form complexes with TALE factors”, first paragraph: The authors describe a NF-Y motif that is specifically enriched at Prep3.5hpf peaks (Figure 7B). NF-Y is also maternally deposited in zebrafish (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A), consistent with a joint role for TALE and NF-Y factors at very early developmental stages. This is a critical finding, as it identifies a potential new cofactor for TALE proteins. The authors could better emphasize this exciting finding, for example drawing a parallel between the roles of NF-Y in zebrafish and in mouse embryonic development. In fact, also in the mouse NF-Y has been shown to have critical functions for very early embryonic development (Bhattacharya et al., 2003). This parallel would broaden the impact and breadth of the reported findings and would relate them also to other species, e.g. mammals.</p><p>5) Discussion: Given the wealth of high-quality results and novel findings that are reported in this interesting study, it would greatly help to add one additional figure – or figure panel – with a cartoon that summarizes and illustrates in a succinct manner the most salient findings. This would leave the reader with a strong and easy-to-remember 'take-home' message.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Ladam et al. reports a ChIPseq analysis of Prep proteins at two developmental stages of the zebrafish embryo -blastula and segmentation- and the correlation of these data with transcriptome modifications associated to combined downregulation of Prep and Pbx factors using a morpholino approach. This work identifies a shift in binding preference by Prep factors between the two stages analyzed. While in the blastula the preferred binding site is a Prep-Pbx combined site, in the segmenting embryo the preference shifts to binding sites in which Prep binds to the Prep-alone binding site or the Pbx-Hox binding site (to which is can bind forming trimers). Classification of the blastula binding sites by their Histone Modification profile identifies a subset of targets that show repressive marks at the blastula stage and become active at the segmentation stage in a regionally-restricted manner. This class is enriched in genes whose expression and Histone modification profile is sensitive to the loss of Prep-Pbx function, indicating a pioneer function for Prep-Pbx in this tissue-specific genes.</p><p>In addition to this, authors analyze the occurrence binding sites for the pioneer transcription complex, which appear strongly associated to the Prep-Pbx binding motifs. They characterize association of Prep-Pbx to subunits of the NF-Y complex and they demonstrate that NF-Y activity is required for the transcriptional and epigenetic activation of Prep-Pbx responsive genes.</p><p>This is an important work mainly for two conclusions; one is that TALE transcription factors show stage-specific preference for binding sites defined by binding sequence. The data are compelling on this conclusion and suggest that it is the activation of tissue-specific transcriptional cofactors at later stages what directs this specificity.</p><p>The second finding is the identification of a cooperative complex between two pioneering complexes Prep-Pbx and NF-Y. This is an important finding, although some aspects remain only superficially explained or are not fully conclusive. My main concern on this point is that the authors claim to have discovered the function of the Prep-Pbx-NF-Y binding sites, however they do not perform any functional assay on this sequence. In my opinion, the data shown are only correlative with respect to this point. While elimination of Prep-Pbx function or elimination of NF-Y function affects a common set of targets, this does not demonstrate that the effect is through the action of these proteins as a complex on the Prep-Pbx-NF-Y binding sequence. Also, is the Prep/Pbx or NF-Y function different for those sites/genes in which only the Prep-Pbx sites are present versus those in which the Prep-Pbx-NF-Y site is found?. Also, given that the set of sensitive genes are tissue-specific and their activation associates with the colonization of nearby Prep-only and Pbx-Hox sites, could the function of these new sites be the one that is relevant for chromatin opening and transcriptional activation and not the interaction at the Prep-Pbx site?. Therefore, if possible, experiments in which the Prep-Pbx-NF-Y binding sequence is functionally analyzed for factor binding and enhancer activity should be included to make conclusions stronger.</p><p>In connection to this, a more comprehensive description of the prevalence of the Prep-Pbx and Prep-Pbx-NF-Y sites among the classes studied would help understanding whether there is specific association to subclasses. This would include the classification according to stage (blastula-specific, segmentation-specific and common) and MPAD classes. Also a detailed description of the occupancy of specific sites associated to the TALE GRN containing the Prep-Pbx-, Prep-Pbx-NFy, Prep-only or pbx-Hox binding sites and how these evolve between blastula and segmentation would be a very valuable addition to the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36144.066</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p></disp-quote><p><italic>1) The authors must demonstrate that their model is correct by testing several of the identified elements by reporter assays in zebrafish embryos (or at the very least in cell lines</italic> in vitro<italic>), coupled with mutation of predicted TALE and NF-Y binding sites to address the importance of these sites for enhancer function.</italic> </p><p>There are two types of elements identified by our analyses – one where Prep occupies monomeric HEXA binding sites associated with PBX:HOX motifs (this type of element is much more frequently occupied at 12hpf than at 3.5hpf) and one where Prep occupies DECA sites associated with NF-Y motifs (this is the predominantly occupied motif at 3.5hpf).</p><p>Elements containing HEXA+PBX:HOX motifs have been studied previously. Analyses of individual such elements in the mouse demonstrated that they act as enhancers and that the Prep, Pbx and Hox binding sites are essential for enhancer function (Pöpperl et al., 1995; Jacobs, Schnabel, and Cleary 1999; Ferretti et al., 2005; Ferretti et al., 2000; Di Rocco, Mavilio, and Zappavigna 1997; Manzanares et al., 2001; Tümpel et al., 2007; Wassef et al., 2008). Accordingly, we have previously shown that an element from the zebrafish <italic>hoxb1a</italic> locus (that contains a Prep+Pbx:Hox motif) drives gene expression in vivo and in vitro and that the TALE and Hox sites are essential (Choe et al., 2009; Vlachakis, Ellstrom, and Sagerström 2000). Furthermore, motif discovery in CNEs combined with functional testing in zebrafish recently identified HEXA+PBX:HOX motifs as being essential for enhancer activity (Grice et al., 2015; Parker et al., 2011). Hence, previous work has demonstrated that HEXA+PBX:HOX containing elements act as enhancers. This is now discussed in the Results subsection “Some TALE-occupied sites are associated with chromatin marks at blastula stages”, first paragraph. The revised manuscript now also includes additional data showing that the HEXA+PBX:HOX elements identified in our study are evolutionarily conserved (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A) and associated with known enhancer marks (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). Finally, we now show that, of 74 enhancers known to be active in the zebrafish hindbrain (Grice et al., 2015; Parker et al., 2011), 19 (26%; Figure 4—figure supplement 1C) coincide with Prep<sub>12hpf-only</sub> peaks. Since enhancer activity was assayed at 2-3 days of development, but our ChIP data is derived from 12hpf (and we applied a stringent FE&gt;10 cutoff for the Prep peaks), this represents a substantial overlap. These results are now discussed in the aforementioned Results subsection. Hence, our analyses of HEXA+PBX:HOX elements are consistent with previous reports defining these elements as enhancers.</p><p>Since the DECA+NFY containing elements are novel, they have not been previously assayed for enhancer activity. Our data show that many such elements are associated with chromatin marks indicative of enhancers. In particular, our analysis in Figure 4A, B uses H3K4me1 (a modification that is well established as a mark of enhancers) to define MPADs at 4.5hpf and Figure 4F shows that many MPADs are marked by H3K27ac (a mark found at active enhancers) at 4.5hpf. Notably, many MPADs that lack H3K27ac at 4.5hpf, gain it over the next several hours (Figure 5A, B). In fact, even some Prep-bound sites that lack H3K4me1 at 4.5hpf (non-MPADs) gain enhancer marks during embryogenesis (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Hence, many DECA+NFY elements appear to be (or become) associated with enhancer marks. We also find that these elements are enriched at regions of the genome that are conserved with mammals (revised Figure 4E), consistent with DECA+NFY elements playing an evolutionarily critical role. Importantly, even though DECA+NFY motifs are associated with enhancers, these motifs are not necessarily expected to be <italic>sufficient</italic> to convey enhancer activity. In fact, we have previously shown both in vivo and in vitro that TALE factors are not sufficient to drive gene expression (Choe, Ladam, and Sagerström 2014; Choe et al., 2009; Vlachakis, Choe, and Sagerström 2001), indicating that TALE factors alone do not mediate enhancer activity. Furthermore, Prep, Pbx and NF-Y are all ubiquitously expressed, but their binding is associated with genes that are expressed in a tissue-restricted manner, indicating that there must be additional regulatory input at enhancers for these genes. Accordingly, in the original manuscript, we did not propose that the DECA+NFY elements act as enhancers. Instead, our observation that TALE and NF-Y occupy many genomic sites prior to the appearance of enhancer marks (Figure 4A) and are required for the deposition of H3K27ac modifications at TALE-dependent genes (Figure 6F, 7F), led us to suggest that these factors are instead required at a step prior to establishment/action of enhancers (possibly in a ‘pioneer’ role). This is now clarified in the second paragraph of the Discussion and in a new model diagram in Figure 7H. Nevertheless, as requested by the reviewers, we have now cloned and tested genomic regions containing DECA+NFY sites in HEK293 cells. We have previously used transfection in HEK293 cells to demonstrate that HEXA+PBX:HOX containing elements from the zebrafish <italic>hoxb1a</italic> locus acts as an enhancer (Choe et al., 2009), so this is a reasonable system to assay zebrafish enhancers. We find that only one of the seven elements drives expression of a luciferase reporter (this is true also when TALE and NF-Y TFs are co-transfected with the reporter plasmids; data shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1E), indicating that DECA+NFY elements may not function as classical enhancers. This is consistent with our proposed model that Prep, Pbx and NF-Y instead act at these elements to play an earlier role (possibly as pioneer factors) to permit the subsequent action of tissue-specific TFs (such as Hox TFs) at nearby enhancers. This model is clarified in the new Figure 7H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The TALE knock-down phenotype needs to be better characterized with appropriate validation of the specificity of the morpholino.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>[Additional details from reviewer 1: The TALE knock-down phenotype needs to be described/characterised in more detail, to provide a more comprehensive view of the developmental context and to validate the specificity of the morpholino cocktail.

I also suggest moving the justification for using MO's that is in the Figure 1—figure supplement 1 legend to the Materials and methods section or the main text, where it will be more prominent.]</italic></p><p>Several published studies indicate that complete removal of Pbx or Prep function in zebrafish converges on the same phenotype (Pöpperl et al., 2000; Waskiewicz, Rikhof, and Moens 2002; Waskiewicz et al., 2001; Choe, Vlachakis, and Sagerström 2002; Deflorian et al., 2004). Accordingly, we expect that simultaneous disruption of Pbx and Prep function will also produce this phenotype. The published phenotype has been characterized morphologically, as well as by alcian blue staining for head cartilage, by immunostaining for hindbrain neurons and by in situ hybridization/microarray analysis for changes in gene expression. In the original submission of this manuscript, we show that our TALE KD phenotype is morphologically indistinguishable from the published phenotype (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). We have now also assayed head cartilage formation and differentiation of hindbrain Mauthner neurons – we find that both are affected as expected based on the published reports (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B; this analysis also revealed that the pectoral fins are lost in our TALE KD embryos, as expected (Pöpperl et al., 2000)). This analysis is now covered in the Results subsection “TALE factors control a gene network regulating formation of anterior embryonic structures in zebrafish”. Lastly, we compared our RNA-seq data from TALE KD embryos to gene expression changes in two published reports (French et al., 2007; Deflorian et al., 2004). It is difficult to do a direct quantitative comparison since our RNA-seq was done at 12hpf after KD of both Prep and Pbx, while French et al. knocked down only Pbx and assayed gene expression (by microarray and in situ hybridization) at 18hpf and Deflorian et al. knocked down only Prep and assayed (only by in situ hybridization) at 20-24hpf. In spite of these caveats, of the 13 genes downregulated in French et al., seven were downregulated in our analysis and of the six genes downregulated in Deflorian et al., four were downregulated in our experiment (this is covered in the aforementioned subsection). We note that gene expression changes in TALE KD embryos become more pronounced over time (i.e., we see greater changes at 12hpf than at 6hpf), likely explaining why not all previously reported TALE-dependent genes are detected by our RNA-seq. In sum, we conclude that our TALE KD produces a phenotype very similar to the published phenotype resulting from Pbx or Prep knockdown.</p><p>As requested, the MO justification has been moved to the Materials and methods subsection “Interference with protein function in embryos”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors need to explain the temporal discrepancies of all their assays.</p><p>[Additional details from reviewer 2: The time-point analyzed are not fully consistent across these experimental approaches, e.g. RNA-Seq for controls and TALE KD zebrafish embryos is performed at 6hpf (early gastrula) and at 12hpf (segmentation stage); ChIP-seq for Prep1.1 is performed at 3.5hpf (blastula) and at 12hpf (segmentation stage); ATAC-Seq at 4hpf (blastula; available datasets); and ChIP-seq for chromatin marks at 4.5hpf (blastula; available datasets). While this could be somewhat concerning, the findings and the overall message emerging from the study are strong and do not appear to be weakened by the slight temporal discrepancies.]</p></disp-quote><p>Our analyses center on two timepoints – late blastula (3.5-4.5hpf) and early segmentation (12hpf). These timepoints were chosen because they represent a stage prior to zygotic gene expression (late blastula) and a stage coincident with the onset of tissue morphogenesis (early segmentation). These stages are now indicated in Figure 1A and the rationale for their selection is explained in the legend to Figure 1.</p><p>For the late blastula stage, we use chromatin ChIP-seq (4.5hpf) and ATAC-seq (4hpf) datasets for comparisons to our 3.5hpf Prep ChIP-seq data. The use of datasets from slightly different timepoints allowed us to use published datasets instead of replicating previous work. We agree with reviewer 2 that the difference between 3.5hpf, 4hpf and 4.5hpf is unlikely to affect our conclusions for two key reasons. 1) at these stages all zebrafish blastomere cells appear to be pluripotent and capable of differentiating into any tissue derivative (Ho and Kimmel 1993). 2) genome-wide analyses at these stages require large numbers of embryos (hundreds to thousands) that cannot be individually staged. Since zebrafish development is not perfectly synchronized, embryos will develop at slightly different speeds – even in a clutch from a single female. Therefore, when large numbers of embryos are collected, they are likely to contain a range of slightly different stages, meaning that ChIP-seq/ATAC-seq analyses done at 3.5hpf, 4hpf and 4.5hpf will actually have considerable overlap in the actual stages of the embryos analyzed. This fact is now mentioned in the Materials and methods subsection “Analysis of chromatin features”. We did not carry out RNA-seq at 3.5hpf because zygotic gene expression is not yet active at this timepoint. Instead, we selected the 6hpf timepoint (early gastrula), when zygotic gene expression is more robust. However, we do not detect any differentially expressed genes at 6hpf, so this RNA-seq dataset is not used to identify TALE-dependent genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should provide clarifications/explanations regarding the statement that TALE GRN genes are significantly associated with Class 4 and Class 3, but not Class 1 or 2, MPADs (Figure 6A, B).</p><p>[Additional details from Reviewer 2: The authors state that TALE GRN genes are significantly associated with Class 4 and Class 3, but not Class 1 or 2, MPADs (Figure 6A, B). However, RNA-seq (Figure 5C) shows that genes associated with Class 3 MPADs (and also Class 1 and 2 MPADs) are expressed at similar levels at 12hpf and 6hpf (Figure 5D). In contrast, Class 4 MPADs display higher levels of H3K27ac at 9hpf than at 4.5hpf (Figure 5A, B) and their associated genes show the greatest increase in expression between 6hpf and 12hpf. In addition, only class 4 MPADs showed a strong switch to an active chromatin state from 4.5hpf to 9hpf during zebrafish embryogenesis (Figure 5A, B), while class 3 MPADs did not exhibit any significant switch (Figure 5A, B). Collectively, these results are somewhat difficult to reconcile. The authors should qualify these findings and try to explain these differences. Are other factors necessary for activation of Class 3 MPADs? Or do the acetylation changes appear at a later time-point for Class 3 MPADs? Can other scenarios be envisaged? It would be helpful to add these considerations at least to the Discussion section of the paper.]</p></disp-quote><p>Our data show that TALE-dependent genes are associated with Class 3 and 4, but not Class 1 or 2 MPADs (Figure 6A). The reviewer comments that Class 3 MPAD-associated genes appear to behave more like Class 1 and 2 MPAD-associated genes in some regards and asks us to address this issue. However, our data indicate that, while the Class 3 MPAD-associated genes undergo smaller changes than Class 4-associated genes, they nevertheless show a greater increase in expression and higher H3K27ac levels than genes associated with Class 1 and 2 MPADs (Figure 5A-D), suggesting that they differ from Class 1 and 2 genes in these regards. These differences are now emphasized on lines 296-297. We do not know why Class 3 MPAD-associated genes show less pronounced signs of activation than Class 4 MPAD-associated genes, but we note that Class 3 MPAD-associated genes are more highly enriched for functions related to muscle differentiation (Figure 6C). This process is just beginning at the timepoint we used to assay gene expression (RNA-seq in Figure 5C, D) and H3K27ac (ChIP-seq in Figure 5A), suggesting that activation of Class 3 MPAD-associated genes may still be ongoing at this stage.

For example, in Pbx LOF mouse embryos it has been reported that the posterior axial skeleton, the hindlimb, and the urogenital system are severely compromised, among other posterior structures. In addition, also in the zebrafish embryo, Prep binds many loci in addition to ones associated with the anterior GRN and some of these additional sites are near genes that regulate other developmental processes known to involve TALE function. For instance, Prep peaks are found near genes involved in myogenesis (Figure 2D, E) and expression of myogenic genes is disrupted in TALE KD embryos, as the Authors report in the Discussion section of the paper.

This suggests that TALE and NF-Y acting at DECA+NFY motifs play an important role.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Therefore, if possible, experiments in which the Prep-Pbx-NF-Y binding sequence is functionally analyzed for factor binding and enhancer activity should be included to make conclusions stronger.</p></disp-quote><p>This issue is addressed under Essential revisions – point 1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In connection to this, a more comprehensive description of the prevalence of the Prep-Pbx and Prep-Pbx-NF-Y sites among the classes studied would help understanding whether there is specific association to subclasses. This would include the classification according to stage (blastula-specific, segmentation-specific and common) and MPAD classes. Also a detailed description of the occupancy of specific sites associated to the TALE GRN containing the Prep-Pbx-, Prep-Pbx-NFy, Prep-only or pbx-Hox binding sites and how these evolve between blastula and segmentation would be a very valuable addition to the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not find any significant differences in the distribution of DECA versus DECA+NFY sites among the various regulatory elements (MPADs and non-MPADs), nor do we find a difference in their association with TALE GRN genes. This is now shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1D and discussed in the second paragraph of the subsection “NF-Y proteins regulate TALE GRN expression and form complexes with TALE factors”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
