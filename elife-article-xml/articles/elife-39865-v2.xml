instead of the otherwise universal polyA tail. A metallo β-lactamase (MBL) fold enzyme, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 73 (CPSF73), is proposed to be the sole endonuclease responsible for 3' end processing of both mRNA classes. We report cellular, genetic, biochemical, substrate selectivity, and crystallographic studies providing evidence that an additional endoribonuclease, MBL domain containing protein 1 (MBLAC1), is selective for 3' processing of RD histone pre-mRNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle. Depletion of MBLAC1 in cells significantly affects cell cycle progression thus identifying MBLAC1 as a new type of S-phase-specific cancer target.</p></abstract><kwd-group

histone proteins (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) is coordinated with DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harris et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ewen, 2000</xref>). Metazoan mRNAs encoding for the ‘replication-dependent’ (RD) core histones lack the normal polyA tail formed by 3' end hydrolysis of pre-mRNA followed by polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Proudfoot, 2011</xref>). Instead, they undergo endonucleolytic cleavage at the 3ʹ side of an RNA hairpin (stem loop) producing mRNA with a 3´stem loop (SL), which is exported from the nucleus for use in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marzluff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marzluff and Koreski, 2017</xref>). By contrast, the pre-mRNA of replication-independent histone variants are normally polyadenylated and constitutively expressed during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marzluff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wagner et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>A single endonuclease, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 73 (CPSF73), is proposed to be responsible for the hydrolysis of both RD histone pre-mRNA (SL) and normal protein-coding pre-mRNA (polyA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dominski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mandel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kolev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sullivan et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dominski, 2010</xref>). Although maturation of both classes of RNAs requires a hydrolytic reaction, different macromolecular complexes are recruited to the different pre-mRNA classes (SL or polyA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kolev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sullivan et al., 2009b</xref>). Specific factors involved in RD histone pre-mRNA maturation are the stem loop binding protein (SLBP), the FLICE-associated huge protein (FLASH), and the U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U7snRNP) that binds to a histone downstream element (HDE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dominski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kolev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sullivan et al., 2009b</xref>). Defective 3ʹ end processing of RD histone pre-mRNA, caused by depletion of factors including CPSF73, SLBP, Sm-like protein 11 (Lsm11), CstF64 or FLASH, results in the generation of extended transcripts downstream of the HDE sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sullivan et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Romeo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sullivan et al., 2009b</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and humans, misprocessed RD histone pre-mRNA has been observed to undergo polyadenylation involving utilization of a secondary polyadenylation signal sequence located downstream of the HDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sullivan et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Romeo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kari et al., 2013</xref>). Depletion of factors belonging to the 5ʹ cap-binding complex (CBC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hallais et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Narita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gruber et al., 2012</xref>), or to the cleavage factor II (CF IIm), which is normally involved in 3ʹ end processing of normal protein-coding pre-mRNA (polyA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hallais et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Vries et al., 2000</xref>), also results in extended RD histone pre-mRNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hallais et al., 2013</xref>). These observations suggest a complex and dynamic relationship between the factors involved in the different stages of the RD histone pre-mRNA transcription process, which may involve participation of factors normally belonging to the polyA mRNA processing machinery.</p><p>Important cancer medicines, including histone deacetylase and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, target proteins involved in the S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Newbold et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Falkenberg and Johnstone, 2014</xref>). In work aimed at identifying potential new S-phase cancer targets, we considered known and potential roles of MBL-fold proteins involved in nucleic acid hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dominski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pettinati et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daiyasu et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, to the role of CPSF73, and the likely pseudo-enzyme CPSF100, in pre-mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dominski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mandel et al., 2006</xref>), MBL-fold nucleases are involved in DNA repair (SNM1A-C nucleases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yan et al., 2010</xref>), snRNA processing (INTS9 and INTS11), and tRNA processing (ELAC 1 and 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skaar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vogel et al., 2005</xref>). Whilst most of the ~18 human MBL-fold proteins have established functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pettinati et al., 2016</xref>), the functions of several are unassigned, including the MBL domain containing protein 1 (MBLAC1). Here, we report evidence that MBLAC1 is a nuclease specific for cleavage of RD histone pre-mRNA. Crystallographic and biochemical studies show that MBLAC1 has an overall MBL fold and di-zinc ion containing active site related to that of CPSF73, but which has distinctive structural features involving active site flanking loops and the absence of the β-CASP domain, which is only present in CPSF73. MBLAC1 depletion from cells leads to the production of unprocessed RD histone pre-mRNA due to inefficient 3ʹ end processing. The consequent depletion of core histone proteins correlates with a cell cycle defect due to a delay in entering/progressing through S-phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MBLAC1 structure reveals similarity with MBL-fold nucleases</title><p>On the basis of sequence similarity studies MBLAC1 has been assigned as an RNAse Z and glyoxalase II subfamily enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ridderström et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sievers et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, we found that recombinant MBLAC1 prepared from <italic>E. coli</italic> has only low, likely non-specific, glyoxalase activity as observed for other hMBL-fold proteins belonging to the same subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shen et al., 2011</xref>). To investigate its function, we solved a crystal structure of MBLAC1 (1.8 Å resolution, space group P1) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The structure reveals a stereotypical αββα MBL- fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carfi et al., 1995</xref>) with two central mixed β-sheets (I and II), comprised of 8 and 5 strands respectively, surrounded by helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In β-sheet I, β-strands 1, 2, 5–6 and 8–10 are anti-parallel, with β-strands 6–8 being parallel; β-strands 3 and 4 are part of a loop region and are aligned anti-parallel to each other and parallel to β-strands 2 and 5, respectively. In β-sheet II, β-strands 11, 12, 13 and 14 are anti-parallel, and β-strands 14 and 15 are parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). MBLAC1 has four of the five characteristic MBL-metal-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pettinati et al., 2016</xref>), His116, His118 Asp120 and His121 (motif II), His196 (motif III), Asp221 (motif IV) and His263 (motif V) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (using BBL numbering) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galleni et al., 2001</xref>) with two waters completing metal coordination. In the structure of recombinant MBLAC1 produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the active site was refined with two iron ions present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Two other regions in the MBLAC1 structure (aa 51–66 and the C-terminal region, aa 239–266) are disordered, implying flexibility and possible involvement in substrate recognition. LACTB2 is reported to have high overall structural similarity with CPSF73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levy et al., 2016</xref>). However, whilst comparison of the MBL domains of MBLAC1 and CPSF73 reveals similar di-zinc ion binding modes, there are clear differences in their active site flanking loops; only the β3-β4 MBLAC1 active site loop (β1-β2 in LACTB2), is present in CPSF73 (β1-β2 loop), where it is relatively shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Loss of MBLAC1 impairs cell cycle progression</title><p>We sought to gain insight into the biological role of MBLAC1 by its depletion in HeLa cells using siRNA. Flow cytometry reveals that unsynchronised cells depleted for MBLAC1 show a cell cycle defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This is manifested by increased accumulation of cells in G<sub>1</sub>/early S-phase and decreased proportions of cells in G<sub>2</sub> compared to controls.

However, 4 hours post-release, control cells progressed normally through the cell cycle, while MBLAC1 depleted cells displayed a strong delay in G<sub>1</sub>/early S-phase. Western blots were then used to investigate the nature of the delay in cell cycle progression by monitoring levels of cyclin D1, a cell cycle protein marker expressed during G<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Darzynkiewicz et al., 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) into newly synthesised DNA in synchronised cells was monitored by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left graph) followed by propidium iodide (PI) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These results indicate that both MBLAC1 and, as expected, CPSF73 depleted cells are impaired in efficiently entering/progressing in S-phase. Although both depletions displayed a delay 30 min post-release, the defect was more pronounced with MBLAC1 depletion over the full cell cycle, implying a cell-cycle-specific role for MBLAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Western blot analyses indicated that in control samples (siLuc) MBLAC1 levels were increased 6 hr post-release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) corresponding to mid S-phase (as shown by flow cytometry profiles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Although both MBLAC1 and CPSF73-depleted cells progress through the complete cell cycle, levels of cyclins D1 (G<sub>1</sub> marker) and E (a G<sub>1</sub>/S boundary and S progression marker) were strongly modified compared to controls. As described above, cyclin D1 levels were strongly upregulated with MBLAC1 depletion, while cyclin E levels were reduced compared to controls. Notably for CPSF73 depletion, cyclins D1 and E showed intermediate levels compared to MBLAC1 depletion and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Given the strong correlation between S-phase and histone biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harris et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ewen, 2000</xref>), histone H3 levels were used to analyse RD histone protein abundance in MBLAC1 and CPSF73 depleted cells.

However, little evidence for ribonucleolytic activity was observed when wtMBLAC1 was incubated with MUT RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This observation suggests that MBLAC1 specifically recognises the biologically authentic CA dinucleotide required for histone pre-mRNA maturation and that this site is critical for recognition/initial cleavage/binding by MBLAC1. Mononucleotides were not observed to accumulate under any of the tested conditions (data not shown) implying a lack of exonucleolytic activity for MBLAC1. Thus, consistent with the crystallographically observed structural similarity between MBLAC1 and LACTB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levy et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), these results identify MBLAC1 as a ribonuclease with endonucleolytic activity. Unlike purified CPSF73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mandel et al., 2006</xref>), which exhibits substantially sequence-independent ribonuclease activity, isolated MBLAC1 appears more sequence selective especially with shorter RNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

To investigate the specificity of the observed MBLAC1 hydrolytic activity on histone pre-mRNA, 50 to 40 nucleotide RNA fragments corresponding to a portion of the RD human histone HIST2H3C pre-mRNA were [γ-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP 5' labeled and incubated with wtMBLAC1 produced in HEK239 cells (50 ng) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The reaction catalysed by MBLAC1 on the wild-type RNA 1 generated two main products assigned as 27 and 29 nucleotides long (based on our fragment numbering system), corresponding to the ‘physiological’ major and minor cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Streit et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furger et al., 1998</xref>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This observation is in agreement with previous studies, where the major and minor cleavage sites were reported to occur 5 and 7 nucleotides after the stem-loop, respectively, that is ACCCA corresponding to cleavage in position 27, and ACCCACA corresponding to cleavage in position 29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scharl and Steitz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furger et al., 1998</xref>). When a single nucleotide in RNA 1 is mutated at position 27 (A/G), to abolish the ‘physiological’ CA dinucleotide at this position (RNA 2), we observed production of a single main processing product corresponding to cleavage at position 29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Although hydrolysis of RNA 2 was clearly observed, it appeared less efficient compared to that of RNA 1. This observation is in agreement with the results described above where a single point mutation at position 27 negatively affects catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). mutMBLAC1 purified from HEK293 cells was also tested using RNA 2 to investigate its ability to hydrolase the substrates at specific positions; as anticipated, mutMBLAC1 showed very little hydrolytic activity on RNA 2 compared to wtMBLAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To further investigate the specificity of cleavage after the CA at position 27, the wild-type RNA was modified to contain only one CA dinucleotide at position 27 (RNA 3). Incubation with MBLAC1 led to the production of a single observed degradation product consistent with cleavage at position 27 (major cleavage site), but again with apparently impaired efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). When the nucleotide sequence of the stem-loop was inverted, to maintain secondary structure (RNA 4), the cleavage reaction appeared less efficient, although the cleavage specificity was apparently not compromised within our limits of detection (note that the processing products of RNA 4 has a slower electrophoretic mobility) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This observation suggests the precise stem-loop sequence composition does not affect the correct positioning of MBLAC1 at the physiological CA cleavage site. When the stem-loop sequence was modified to ablate its conformation (RNA 5), cleavage at position 27 (the major cleavage site) was apparently completely abolished; instead, a major band was observed corresponding to cleavage at the CA, position 23, although longer degradation fragments were also detected (consistent with cleavage at positions 29, and possibly 32, 35) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The degradation patterns observed for RNA 4 and 5 imply that likely the stem-loop structure prevents MBLAC1 from accessing putative single-stranded cleavage sites located upstream of position 27, thus helping to maintain specificity of cleavage at position 27. MBLAC1 activity was also evaluated on a fragment lacking the HDE sequence (RNA 6); interestingly, with this substrate efficient cleavage was maintained and the major cleavage site (position 27) still recognised, although the cleavage specificity was reduced, leading to the formation of additional degradation bands corresponding to hydrolysis at all the CA dinucleotides present in the fragment 6 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

The observation of a cell cycle defect in entering/progressing through S-phase correlates with reduced histone protein abundance in HeLa cells after depletion of MBLAC1, either using siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These results are in agreement with a defect in efficient histone pre-mRNA maturation as we observed by chrRNA-seq analyses in HeLa cells depleted of MBLAC1 where RD histone pre-mRNA transcripts manifested abnormally 3' end extensions reflecting inefficient maturation. The inability of MBLAC1-depleted cells to produce the appropriate amount of histone proteins due to the lack of mature mRNA encoding for them is also consistent with occurrence of a ‘G<sub>1</sub>-like’ block, as observed by flow-cytometry and western blot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results imply that during S-phase, MBLAC1 has a specialised role in RD histone pre-mRNA processing.</p><p>Studies with recombinant MBLAC1 purified from human or <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, define MBLAC1 as an endoribonuclease, with selectivity for cleavage at the biologically authentic CA dinucleotides (positions 27 and 29 using our nomenclature, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These results imply that the stem-loop secondary structure of RD nascent pre-mRNA is involved in enabling preferential cleavage at position 27. The presence of the HDE sequence appears to be required to avoid non-specific cleavage, although cleavage at position 27 was still observed when the HDE was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The involvement of the HDE element in determining selectivity is supported by in vitro studies utilizing HeLa nuclear extracts indicating that the HDE is a major factor in defining the cleavage site of RD histone pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scharl and Steitz, 1994</xref>). The work with isolated MBLAC1 reveals that it has potential to catalyse cleavage at CA sites other than at positions 27 and 29, although the biological relevance of these other reactions needs to be validated. Future work can also focus on establishing the details of the kinetics of MBLAC1 catalysis and the structural features that enable its selectivity, including the nature of its interactions with the stem-loop and the HDE element at the 3' end of RD histone pre-mRNA.</p><p>Further detailed work is required to compressively define the factors responsible for targeting MBLAC1 to the RD histone pre-mRNA cleavage site. The available results indicate that it is possible that the observed in vitro sequence specificity of MBLAC1 may enable recognition of core histone pre-mRNA substrates without the requirement for as many additional factors as is necessary in the case of CPSF73 (or that MBLAC1 requires different factors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sullivan et al., 2009b</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dominski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kolev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sullivan et al., 2009a</xref>), we found that CPSF73 promotes RD histone pre-mRNA processing. However, it is likely that CPSF73 is relatively more important than MBLAC1 in RD histone pre-mRNA processing outside of S-phase, reflecting its essential role in the biosynthesis of polyadenylated mRNA, including that of multiple histone variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marzluff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marzluff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wagner et al., 2007</xref>). CPSF73 could well also be wholly or partly responsible for processing of defective RD histone pre-mRNA that subsequently undergoes polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sullivan et al., 2009b</xref>) when MBLAC1 is depleted in cells. Reported biochemical work with CPSF73 in its isolated form has only been carried-out with few histone pre-mRNA model sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kolev and Steitz, 2005</xref>). Thus, it is possible that both CPSF73 and MBLAC1 selectively impact on the rates of maturation of different histone pre-mRNA substrates in vivo, opening up the possibility for selective modulation of the biosynthesis of RD histone variants. Although further validation work is required, our observations in cells support also the proposal that MBLAC1 and CPSF73 impact to different extents on similar genes, possibly compensating for depletion of one another in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Our genetic and cellular studies imply that MBLAC1 inhibition may selectively slow down S-phase progression in cancer cells. Thus, MBLAC1 may represent a new S-phase specific cancer target. The true bacterial MBLs involved in antibacterial resistance have been shown to be amenable to small molecule targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pettinati et al., 2016</xref>), and it is likely that human MBL-fold endonucleases will also be sensitive to small molecule inhibition. Our results suggest that targeting MBLAC1 may not be as toxic as CPSF73, which has a pleiotropic role in polyadenylated pre-mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mandel et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the development of MBLAC1 inhibitors, likely for use in combination with other drugs, is of interest from the cancer treatment perspective. Finally, it is notable that relatively non-selective zinc ion chelating compounds, including HDAC inhibitors such as SAHA (suberanilohydroxamic acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">West and Johnstone, 2014</xref>), are already used for cancer treatment via S-phase targeting. It is possible that these, at least in part, work by inhibiting metal dependent endoribonucleases, such as CPSF73 and MBLAC1.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Unless otherwise specified, reagents were from <italic>Sigma-Aldrich</italic>.

Alternatively, BrdU-treated cells were fixed by adding ice-cold 70% ethanol overnight. Cells were then incubated with 2 N HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature and washed with 0.1 M sodium tetraborate buffer, pH 8 for 2 min. Cells were washed and incubated with a FITC conjugated anti-BrdU antibody (<italic>BioLegend</italic>) for 1 hr at room temperature. PI staining followed as described above. Cell cycle profiles were analysed by flow cytometry with FACSCalibur (<italic>BD Biosciences</italic>) and processed using FlowJo software (<italic>Tree Star</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Chromatin RNA extraction and libraries preparation</title><p>Chromatin RNA (ChrRNA) was extracted from HeLa cells 48 hr after siRNA transfection to coincide with the end of the second thymidine block time-point. Approximately 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were resuspended in 500 µL of ice-cold RLB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 0.5% nonidet-P40 (NP-40), 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and lysed by adding an equal volume of RLB buffer with 24% (m/v) sucrose. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation (14,000 x g) at 4°C for 10 min. Isolated nuclei were resuspended in 120 µl of NUN1 buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 75 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 50% Glycerol, 0.125 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT), followed by addition of 1.2 ml NUN2 buffer (20 mM HEPES KOH pH 7.6, 7.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl, 1 M urea, 1 % NP-40, 1 mM DTT). Nuclei were incubated for 15 min on ice with mixing by vortexing for 5 s every 5 min. Chromatin pellets were precipitated by centrifugation (14,000 x g) at 4°C for 10 min and then resuspended in 200 ml HSB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) in presence of 4 U TURBO DNase (<italic>Ambion</italic>) and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. Following a 20-min proteinase K treatment (<italic>Roche</italic>) at 37°C, chromatin RNA (chrRNA) was phenol-chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated. RNA was resuspended in 200 µL of 1x TURBO DNAse buffer in presence of 4 U TURBO DNase and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The entire procedure of extraction, precipitation and DNase treatment was repeated twice. RNA was then extracted and precipitated again, prior to solubilisation in 75 µL of RNase free water.</p><p>Prior to RNA libraries preparation, rRNA was depleted using the Ribo-Zero Magnetic kit (<italic>Illumina</italic>) from 2.5 µg of ChrRNA. Libraries were prepared starting from 100 ng chrRNA using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (<italic>NEB</italic>) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Deep sequencing using Hiseq4000 with paired-end (75 bp) runs was performed by the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics (WTCHG), Oxford, UK.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Real time PCR analyses</title><p>ChrRNA was extracted from synchronised HeLa cells 48 hr after siRNA transfection as described above. For reverse transcription, 500 to 900 ng of ChrRNA from each sample was used to generate single-strand cDNA by incubation with random hexamers (<italic>Qiagen</italic>) and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (<italic>Life Technologies</italic>). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the SYBR Green Master Mix (<italic>Qiagen</italic>). Relative RNA levels were calculated using the ΔCt method. Data were acquired and analysed using Rotor-GeneQ (<italic>Qiagen</italic>). Defects in 3ʹ end transcription termination were evaluated using amplicons located downstream of the 3ʹ untranslated region (3ʹ UTR) of RD histone genes. The relative abundance of unprocessed sequences was normalised to the relative abundance of an amplicon covering a portion of the GAPDH gene body (GB) or to the corresponding histone GB abundance. Primers used are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>. Similarly, chrRNA was extracted from synchronised wild-type and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated MBLAC1-depleted HeLa cells; cDNA libraries and quantitative RT-PCR were performed as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Chromatin RNA-Seq data processing</title><p>GRCh38 was used as a reference genome. RNA-sequencing reads were trimmed using Cutadapt 1.8.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin, 2011</xref>). An in-house Perl scripts Perl script was used to remove the reads left unpaired.

Aligned reads were processed to only include properly paired, properly mapped reads with no more than two mismatches using SAMtools 1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Data were scaled to library size (genomeCoverageBed) using Bedtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). For data vizualization, trackhubs for the UCSC browser were created by employing the UCSC bedGraphToBigWig tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kent et al., 2002</xref>). For the gene body normalised plots, expression levels (as reads per kilobase per million mapped reads, RPKMs) were calculated for a region of 'TES-100bp' for each gene in all the three samples, namely, LUC, MBLAC1 and CPSF73. These values were then used to normalise each base position followed by plotting them using Python script. Gene body normalised plots were then log two transformed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>RNA-chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis</title><p>Wild-type and MBLAC1 C-terminal FLAG knock in HeLa cells were synchronised in early S-phase using a double thymidine block and used in RNA-chromatin immunoprecipitation (RNA-ChIP) experiments as described by B.

After recovery, cells were harvested and used to select MBLAC1-depleted cell clones by limiting dilution plating and to isolate genomic DNA to evaluate the gene deletion efficiency by PCR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Genomic DNA was then extracted from cell clones and PCR reactions amplifying the DNA region flanking the sgRNA targeting sites were performed to confirm MBLAC1 gene deletion. PCR products corresponding to the wt gene or to the gene deletion were gel purified and their sequence confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Total RNA was then extracted from cell clones carrying the MBLAC1 deletion using TRI reagent (<italic>Ambion</italic>) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-qPCR analyses were performed to evaluate MBLAC1 mRNA levels after CRISPR/Cas9-mediated depletion as above.

The authors obtain a crystal structure of the protein, which suggests that MBLAC1 could function as an RNase. Biochemical assays provide largely convincing evidence that MBLAC1 indeed possesses endonuclease activity and has a preference for CA sequence. To investigate its in vivo function, the authors knock down MBLAC1 and observe cell cycle and transcription termination defects, which are suggested to be specific for replication-dependent (RD) histone genes.</p><p>Overall the structural and biochemical data convincingly show that MBLAC1 can function as an RNA endonuclease. However, the reviewers are not fully convinced that MBLAC1 is specifically involved in RD histone RNA 3' end processing and suggest additional analyses to examine this key question.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The meta-gene analyses show overall higher expression levels for histone genes both upstream and downstream of the transcript end site (TES) (Figure 4D). Hence, the read-through signal appears much less significant than what is stated. This is unusual for a termination factor. Could the higher signals downstream of the TES simply be an indirect effect of higher histone mRNA expression or is this a normalization issue? If the latter, this data should be presented as gene-body normalized and/or as heat maps illustrating all individual histone mRNAs. Also, the genome browser images (e.g. Figure 4B-C) do not fully convey how the gene-body vs read-through signal relate to one another.</p><p>2) RD histone RNA 3'end processing has been extensively studied and the machinery is well characterized. The authors fail to provide strong evidence linking MBLAC1 to known RD histone RNA 3'end processing factors. They cite that MBLAC1 binds to Clp1, but it is not clear that Clp1 functions in RD histone RNA processing. Is it possible that MBLAC1 might participate independent of other known factors? To demonstrate this, the authors need to provide evidence that MBLAC1 at least associates with histone gene TESs, for example by ChIP assays.</p><p>3) Figure 1, Figure 5 and Figure 6: The authors should show the purity of the purified proteins on silver-stained SDS gels. In order to completely exclude contaminating nuclease activity, results in Figure 5 and Figure 6 could be complemented with catalytically dead protein purified from HEK293 cells.</p><p>4) Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 2: How is it possible that histone H3 protein levels are down upon MBLAC1 depletion (either by siRNA or CRISPR), when the corresponding mature mRNA levels appear either unaffected or increased?</p><p>5) The data presented in the paper doesn't convincingly show that MBLAC1 is selective for RD histone transcripts: In Figure 4B/ Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, there are more reads immediately downstream of the TES in siMBLAC1 than in the siLuc control.

We understand the concern about the meta-gene analyses. Unfortunately, the higher histone gene expression level observed in the control sample (siLUC) leads to a normalization issue in comparing the extent of read through with the knock downs when the data were scaled to library size (which is a standard method for meta-gene analyses). To avoid the normalization issue the raw data were plotted for individual histone genes (Figure 4—figure supplement 3) showing in more detail the different histone genes that are affected by MBLAC1 or CPSF73 knock down. This approach enables better comparison with the results of other experiments where the relative abundance of unprocessed RNA was normalized not only to the abundance of a house-keeping gene (GAPDH), but also to that of the corresponding histone gene-body (as suggested by the reviewer). The results from the two methods are consistent (Figure 4D,E). We believe that the revaluation of these data will reassure the reviewer regarding the authentic effect of MBLAC1 on histone pre-mRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) RD histone RNA 3'end processing has been extensively studied and the machinery is well characterized.

To demonstrate this, the authors need to provide evidence that MBLAC1 at least associates with histone gene TESs, for example by ChIP assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments and suggestions for helpful new experiments, which we have carried out. We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion that MBLAC1 may well act independently from other known histone pre-mRNA processing factors, as we suggest in the manuscript and as supported by the observation MBLAC1 manifests substrate specificity in its purified form (see Figure 5 and Figure 6). We have carried out ChIP analyses to investigate the potential association of MBLAC1 with histone genes. Unfortunately, although our results pointed in this direction, the background signal was too high to allow definitive analyses. We therefore focused our efforts on RNA-Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses. In both cases (ChIP and RNA-ChIP experiments) we used a C-terminal FLAG tagged MBLAC1 cell line generated from HeLa cells using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. This enabled us to use an anti-FLAG antibody to immunoprecipitate MBLAC1 at endogenous levels (anti-MBLAC1 antibodies suitable for IP are not currently commercially available). As shown in Figure 4G the comparison of controls (from both WT HeLa cells and FLAG cell line) and anti-FLAG samples (from FLAG tagged MBLAC1 knock in cells) clearly shows that the observed RIP signal for histone mRNA is not due to background but is MBLAC1 specific. This proposal is also supported by comparison of the signal detected for RD histones and normal protein coding mRNA (GAPDH) obtained after immunoprecipitation of MBLAC1 or FLASH. As shown, both anti-FLAG and anti-FLASH samples result in very similar RNA-ChIP profiles. We used FLASH as internal control because it is a well-known member of the 3′ histone pre-mRNA machinery (Marzluff, 2017). Even though the resolution limit of the technique cannot clearly distinguish between the TSS and TES of the histone mRNA due to the small size of these transcripts, the similar enrichments shown by both anti-FLAG and anti-FLASH are reassuring.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1, Figure 5 and Figure 6: The authors should show the purity of the purified proteins on silver-stained SDS gels. In order to completely exclude contaminating nuclease activity, results in Figure 5 and Figure 6 could be complemented with catalytically dead protein purified from HEK293 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we now show protein purity by silver-stained SDS gel using wild-type and active site variant (mutMBLAC1) produced in both <italic>E. coli</italic> and HEK293 cells (Figure 5A). As shown, all the preparations are &gt;95% pure (by gel analysis) except for the mutant enzyme produced in HEK293 cells. The somewhat lower HEK293 mutant (mutMBLAC1) enzyme purity implies a lack of contaminating nucleases: the observation mutMBLAC1 is less pure and less active is supportive of a lack of contaminating nucleases in our preparations (Figure 5A). The results shown in the previous versions of Figure 5 and Figure 6 have been complemented with new results (Figure 5D and Figure 6B); notably, analogous wild-type and active site variant (mutMBLAC1) proteins produced in HEK293 cells show similar catalytic properties to those produced in bacteria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 2 : How is it possible that histone H3 protein levels are down upon MBLAC1 depletion (either by siRNA or CRISPR), when the corresponding mature mRNA levels appear either unaffected or increased?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. These observations can be explained either by a compensating effect (low protein levels stimulate higher transcription or increased RNA stability) (Radhakrishnan, 2016), or by the increased stability and nuclear retention of unproperly terminated (possibly polyadenylated) RD histone pre-mRNA following incorrect 3′ end cleavage (Romeo, 2014). Either way, when the reviewer refers to “mature mRNA levels”, we believe that these transcripts should be considered as the totality of both properly and improperly processed histone pre-mRNA (this is because not all the improperly processed pre-mRNA appear to undergo polyadenylation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The data presented in the paper doesn't convincingly show that MBLAC1 is selective for RD histone transcripts: In Figure 4B/ Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, there are more reads immediately downstream of the TES in siMBLAC1 than in the siLuc control.

The expression levels of RD histone genes in the control sample (siLuc) are higher compared to those in both the MBLAC1 and CPSF73 depletions rendering the log2-transformation inappropriate for clear presentation. Thus, to address the issue, we have used gene-body normalization as follows: expression levels (as reads per kilobase per million mapped reads, RPKMs) were calculated for a region of 'TES-100bp' for each of the analysed histone genes in all the samples (siLUC, siMBLAC1, and siCPSF73). These values were then used to normalize each base position. For clarity, we have presented the data in both ways, i.e. (A) Gene-body normalization for each analysed histone gene and (B) Raw data plotted for individual histone genes (previous Figure 4—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Discussion section: “[…] recognition of the secondary structure of the stem-loop by MBLAC1 is important in maintaining the specificity of the cleavage” Why recognition?
