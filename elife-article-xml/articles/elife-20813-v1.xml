generating electro-chemical signals. Our understanding of this process, especially how the cytoskeleton influences it, remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that mice lacking the α-tubulin acetyltransferase Atat1 in sensory neurons display profound deficits in their ability to detect mechanical stimuli. We show that all cutaneous afferent subtypes, including nociceptors have strongly reduced mechanosensitivity upon Atat1 deletion, and that consequently, mice are largely insensitive to mechanical touch and pain. We establish that this broad loss of mechanosensitivity is dependent upon the acetyltransferase activity of Atat1, which when absent leads to a decrease in cellular elasticity. By mimicking α-tubulin acetylation genetically, we show both cellular rigidity and mechanosensitivity can be restored in Atat1 deficient sensory neurons. Hence, our results indicate that by influencing cellular stiffness, α-tubulin acetylation sets the force required for touch.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20813.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20813.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>acetylation</kwd><kwd>sensory neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heppenstall</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Increased stiffness of sensory neurons in the absence of microtubule acetylation renders mice profoundly insensitive to touch and pain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanical forces acting upon cells or tissues are propagated into the opening of mechanically gated ion channels such as Piezo2 as the first step in the sense of touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maksimovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Woo et al., 2014</xref>). In many cases this process occurs through direct interplay of ion channels with the lipid bilayer. For example, the bacterial mechanotransduction channel MscS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sukharev, 2002</xref>) and eukaryotic two-pore-domain potassium channels TRAAK and TREK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brohawn et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lolicato et al., 2014</xref>) are fully activated by mechanical stimuli when reconstituted in reduced membrane systems, and the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 is also likely to be gated by force exerted via lipids due to its exceptional sensitivity to membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lewis and Grandl, 2015</xref>). However, in-vivo, membrane ion channels are not isolated from the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix, and mechanical sensitivity may depend on further interaction with other cellular components such as the underlying cytoskeleton to modify and redistribute membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delmas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krieg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qi et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, NompC ion channels were shown to be linked between the plasma membrane and microtubules by a tether protein domain in the N-terminus of the channel, and this linkage is essential for mechanosensitivity of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch sensitivity of specialized touch receptor neurons is dependent on both the actin binding protein β spectrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krieg et al., 2014</xref>) and the microtubule cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bounoutas et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>A feature of <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch receptor neurons is that their axons are filled with specialized cross-linked bundles of heavily acetylated 15-protofilament microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalfie and Thomson, 1982</xref>). Disruption of the molecular components of these microtubules, MEC7 β-tubulin and MEC12 α-tubulin leads to a loss of mechanical sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bounoutas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukushige et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, mutation of MEC17, the major tubulin acetyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akella et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shida et al., 2010</xref>) also reduces touch sensitivity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cueva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Topalidou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). Of note, it is not clear whether this loss of touch sensitivity stems from the absence of tubulin acetylation in MEC17 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shida et al., 2010</xref>) or from other unknown actions of MEC17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akella et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davenport et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukushige et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Topalidou et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>MEC17 functions to transfer an acetyl group to the lysine 40 (K40) residue on the luminal side of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Szyk et al., 2014</xref>), and this post-translation modification is remarkably well conserved in organisms that have cells with cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shida et al., 2010</xref>). Intriguingly, Atat1, the mammalian orthologue of MEC17, is expressed ubiquitously in all mouse peripheral sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalebic et al., 2013a</xref>), and these neurons have amongst the highest level of α-tubulin acetylation in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalebic et al., 2013b</xref>). This raises the question as to whether acetylated microtubules also have an essential function in mouse sensory neurons, and if yes, how, mechanistically they influence mechanosensation.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the contribution of microtubule acetylation to mammalian mechanosensation by conditionally deleting Atat1 from mouse peripheral sensory neurons. We found that Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice display a profound loss of mechanical sensitivity to both light touch and painful stimuli with no impact on other sensory modalities. We demonstrate that this arises from a reduction in mechanosensitivity of all cutaneous afferent subtypes, including nociceptors, and adecreased mechanically activated currents in sensory neurons upon Atat1 deletion. We further establish that this broad loss of mechanosensitivity is dependent upon the acetyltransferase activity of Atat1, and that by mimicking α-tubulin acetylation genetically, mechanosensitivity can be restored in Atat1 deficient sensory neurons. Finally we show that acetylated microtubules localize to a prominent band under the membrane of sensory neuron cell bodies and axons, and in the absence of Atat1 and acetylated α-tubulin, cultured sensory neurons display significant reductions in their cell elasticity. Our results indicate that the microtubule cytoskeleton is an essential component of the mammalian mechanotransduction complex and that by influencing cellular stiffness, α-tubulin acetylation can tune mechanical sensitivity across the full range of mechanoreceptor subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice display reduced sensitivity to innocuous touch and pain</title><p>To investigate cell autonomous effects of Atat1 disruption in sensory neurons we took a conditional gene deletion strategy. <italic>Atat1</italic><sup>fl/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalebic et al., 2013b</xref>) were crossed with a sensory neuron specific Cre driver line <italic>Avil</italic>-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zurborg et al., 2011</xref>) to generate <italic>Avil</italic>-Cre::<italic>Atat1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> (referred to as Atat1<sup>cKO</sup>) and control <italic>Avil</italic>-Cre::<italic>Atat1</italic><sup>fl/+</sup> mice (referred to as Atat1<sup>Control</sup>). Mice were then subjected to a series of behavioural assays. We first tested their ability to detect an innocuous mechanical stimulus applied to the hairy skin. Adhesive tape was fixed gently to the backs of animals and the number of responses counted over a 5 min observation period. While control mice made regular attempts to remove the tape, Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice effectively ignored the tape for much of the time, and the total number of responses was significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). We next investigated the sensitivity of mice to innocuous mechanical stimuli applied to the glabrous skin by lightly stroking the underside of the paw with a diffuse cotton swab. Again, Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice responded significantly less (p&lt;0.01) to this stimulus than Atat1<sup>Control</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We also examined whether mechanical sensitivity to punctate stimuli was altered in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice by applying von Frey filaments of calibrated forces to the hindpaw of mice. Control animals responded to forces as low as 0.07g with an increase in detection into the noxious range. However, Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice required significantly higher forces to evoke a response throughout the range of von-Frey filaments (median threshold 0.4g for Atat1<sup>Control</sup> and 1g for Atat1<sup>cKO </sup>p=0.003, Mann-Whitney test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). To investigate noxious mechanical sensitivity in more detail, we analysed responses to a clip applied to the base of the tail. Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice displayed substantially longer response latencies to the clip compared to Atat1<sup>Control</sup> mice and again, essentially ignored this noxious stimulus (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). We further tested whether thermal detection was effected by Atat1 deletion by measuring responses to noxious heat or to evaporative cooling. We observed no difference in withdrawal latencies to a range of temperatures in the hotplate test between Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> and Atat1<sup>Control</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) or to tail immersion in a hot water bath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, sensitivity to cooling of the paw with acetone was comparable in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> and Atat1<sup>Control</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Finally we assessed the motor coordination and of Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice by evaluating their performance on a rotarod device or on a raised metal grid. Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> and Atat1<sup>Control</sup> mice displayed similar latencies to fall from the rotating drum across all speeds tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) and a similar number of slips from the grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). Thus, Atat1 is required for the detection of innocuous and noxious mechanical touch but not for noxious heat or proprioceptive coordination.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20813.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioural analysis of Atat1<sup>cKO</sup>mice.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Bar-chart summarising the results of a tape test to assay low threshold mechanosensation.

We therefore asked whether a similar structure is also evident in peripheral sensory neurons and whether it is dependent upon the presence of acetylated α-tubulin. We performed superresolution dSTORM (direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy)(microscopy on DRG neurons stained with α-tubulin antibodies, and indeed observed that microtubules form an interweaved network in all neurons examined, especially towards the centre of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref>).

One possibility is that it sets the rigidity of cells thereby influencing the amount of force required to displace the plasma membrane and activate mechanosensitive channels. We explored this by directly measuring cell elasticity using atomic force microscopy. In DRG neurons from Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice we observed that cellular stiffness was significantly higher across a range of indentations extending from displacements of 200 nm to 600 nm (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus higher forces are required to indent sensory neurons from Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice than Atat1<sup>Control</sup> mice.</p><p>We confirmed this further by assaying the shrinkage of sensory neurons induced by a hyperosmotic stimulus. In the absence of Atat1, sensory neuron axons displayed less shrinkage than their control counterparts, an effect that could be rescued by expression of the acetylation mimicking mutation α-tubulin K40Q (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>). Finally we examined how the microtubule cytoskeleton responds to compression induced by osmotic pressure. Using a novel tubulin labelling fluorescent dye we were able to resolve individual microtubule bundles in live imaging experiments. Strikingly, in DRG neurons from Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice we observed significantly reduced microtubule displacement upon application of hyperosmotic solutions compared to control and K40Q expressing cells (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref> to m), again supporting the premise that in the absence of α-tubulin acetylation sensory neurons are more resistant to mechanical deformation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we establish that deletion of the α-tubulin acetyltransferase Atat1 from mouse peripheral sensory neurons results in a profound and remarkably selective loss of cutaneous mechanical sensation. We demonstrate that this impacts strongly upon both light touch and pain, and that all mechanoreceptor subtypes which innervate the skin are less responsive in the absence of Atat1. This phenotype arises from reduction of the amplitude of mechanically activated currents in sensory neurons, and we propose that it is mediated by the loss of a sub-membrane band of acetylated α-tubulin in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice that sets mechanical rigidity of these cells. Our data thus describe a model whereby cellular stiffness regulates mechanical sensitivity by setting the force required to indent the plasma membrane and activate mechanosensitive ion channels.</p><p>In addition to its well characterized role as an α-tubulin acetyltransferase, Atat1 has been shown to have functions beyond its acetyltransferase activity at α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castro-Castro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalebic et al., 2013a</xref>). Indeed in C. elegans, several reports indicate that acetylated tubulin is not required for touch sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akella et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davenport et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukushige et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Topalidou et al., 2012</xref>) and as such it is unknown as to how MEC17 (the C. elegans orthologue of Atat1) regulates mechanosensation in nematodes. It was therefore important to determine whether α-tubulin acetylation does indeed underlie the loss of mechanosensation in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice. We addressed this through genetic rescue experiments where we attempted to restore mechanosensitivity of Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> sensory neurons by exogenous expression of Atat1 and α-tubulin point mutants. Importantly, we found that an acetyltransferase deficient form of Atat1 had no effect on mechanically activated current amplitude, while genetically mimicking tubulin acetylation with an α-tubulin K40Q mutation did restore mechanosensitivity. Thus acetylated microtubules are likely the effector for the loss of mechanosensation in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice, suggesting that mammals and nematodes may utilize Atat1 differentially in controlling touch sensation.</p><p>Given the multitude of cellular processes that depend on microtubules, especially in cells with elongated axons such as peripheral sensory neurons, one possible mechanism by which Atat1 might be affecting mechanosensitivity is via altered structure of the peripheral nervous system, perhaps as a result of aberrant axonal transport in the absence of acetylated microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reed et al., 2006</xref>). We performed a thorough analysis of the organization of the peripheral sensory system and observed no differences in rates of neurotrophin/receptor transport and axon outgrowth in vitro, or in the ultrastructure of peripheral nerves and their innervation of the skin and spinal cord in vivo. Moreover, deletion of Atat1 was remarkably selective in that it impacted only on cutaneous mechanosensation and had no effect on thermal responses, or on electrical or other functional properties of sensory neurons such as their sensitivity to capsaicin and pH. We have previously reported that STOML3, another critical mediator of mechanotransduction, associates with microtubules in a specialized vesicle where it interacts with acid-sensing (proton-gated) ion channel (ASIC) subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lapatsina et al., 2012</xref>). Uncoupling of vesicles from microtubules leads to incorporation of STOML3 into the plasma membrane and increased acid-gated currents. Acetylation status of microtubules could conceivably influence the transport of these vesicles and contribute to the phenotype in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice. However, since we observed no alteration in proton gated currents, it is unlikely that the reduction of mechanosensitivity is due to the altered transport of STOML3 in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice.</p><p>Despite the profound loss of cutaneous mechanosensation, we observed no deficits in proprioception in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice. This is in contrast to Piezo2 knockout mice which display severe proprioceptive defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Woo et al., 2015</xref>). The lack of proprioceptive phenotype in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice does not stem from incomplete recombination by the Avil-Cre driver in proprioceptive neurons because we previously observed that full Atat1 knockout mice also display no alterations in proprioception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalebic et al., 2013b</xref>). Rather it may arise either from developmental compensation of a partial reduction in mechanosensitivity in these neurons, or from mechanistic differences in mechanotransduction in proprioceptors and cutaneous afferents. Similarly, we did not observe here, or in ubiquitous knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalebic et al., 2013b</xref>), any apparent change in other aspects of mechanosensation, such as whisker function and exploration, or in developmental consequences of reduced touch sensitivity such as nursing or growth. This may reflect a lack of sensitivity of the tests we performed, or again, developmental compensation arising from residual responsiveness. The use of more selective conditional Cre lines would circumvent this problem and also allow for further studies on the role of Atat1 in specific touch sensations such as those arising from C-low threshold mechanoreceptors or from visceral mechanical nociceptors, which were not considered here.</p><p>We found that acetylated microtubules localize to a prominent band under the membrane of sensory neuron cell bodies. Furthermore our AFM measurements showed that in the absence of Atat1 and acetylated α-tubulin, the stiffness of sensory neurons was significantly elevated across a range of indentation stimuli in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice, and cells were more resistant to osmotically induced shrinkage. We also monitored the movement of microtubules during shrinking using live imaging, and again observed reduced compression of the microtubule network upon Atat1 deletion. Importantly this defect could be rescued by introduction of the α-tubulin acetylation mimic into neurons. Thus our data point towards a role for acetylated tubulin in setting neuronal elasticity, and imply that in its absence, cells are stiffer which ultimately changes the force distribution to the neuronal membrane, requiring more force to indent the membrane and activate mechanosensitive channels. This is consistent with the phenotype in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice in that all mechanoreceptor subtypes, regardless of the type of mechanosensitive currents/channels, are less responsive in the absence of Atat1. It also suggests that a residual response may be evident across patch clamping, skin-nerve electrophysiology and behavioural experiments, in that at higher forces, neuronal membranes in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice would eventually be displaced, leading to mechanosensitive ion channel activation. Whether this is the case could be directly addressed using new technology based upon pillar arrays that displace neurons in the nanometer range allowing for quantitative analysis of mechanoelectrical transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Poole et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, another approach which has been used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wetzel et al., 2007</xref>), would be to determine whether any afferents lose their mechanosensitivity completely in the ex vivo skin nerve preparation, which we did not investigate here.</p><p>While our data shows that there is a correlation between reduced mechanical sensitivity and neuronal elasticity in the absence of Atat1, there are some caveats to this interpretation. For example, we performed AFM measurements at the neuronal soma whereas in vivo, mechanotransduction occurs at sensory neuron endings. In future work it would therefore be informative to assess cell stiffness along neurites which are much more sensitive to mechanical displacement than the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu and Lewin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Poole et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, we detected acetylated tubulin enriched under the membrane of axons which are not in themselves mechanosensitive, and while we show that acetylated tubulin is expressed at neuronal endings in the cornea, superresolution microscopy would be required to demonstrate conclusively that it is indeed submembrane localized. In this light there are also other models of mechanosensation that would accord with our data. For example, microtubules have been implicated in sensory mechanotransduction in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval dendritic arborisation neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch receptor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bounoutas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukushige et al., 1999</xref>) and mammalian osmosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prager-Khoutorsky et al., 2014</xref>). Their role has mainly been explored from the perspective of an anchoring function that serves to tether mechanosensitive ion channels in the membrane. Further support for a tethered mechanotransduction complex comes from observations in sensory neurons where a physical tether has been described that may link mechanosensitive ion channels to the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2010</xref>). It is possible that acetylated tubulin serves as a coordination point for these tethers in the mechanotransduction complex, and that in its absence misorganization of the microtubule network leads to reduced force transfer from the extracellular matrix to ion channels. Finally, another critical component of the complex, STOML3 has been demonstrated to change the force distribution in neuronal membrane via binding cholesterol. However, while a specific reduction of stiffness in sensory neuron membranes is observed in STOML3 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qi et al., 2015</xref>), cellular stiffness is increased upon deletion of Atat1, yet both STOML3 knockout mice and Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice exhibit deficits in mechanosensation. One explanation for this difference is that disruption of α-tubulin acetylation increases the overall neuronal stiffness, rendering sensory neurons more resistant to mechanical deformation, and thereby impeding the transmission of force to other mechanical transducing elements, including STOML3, the cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix and plasma membrane. In contrast, STOML3 distributes the force directly within the membrane to ion channels, and a stiffened membrane facilitates this process. It is also possible that membrane stiffness is set at an optimal range to distribute force among the membrane, cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix and thus tune the sensitivity of mechanosensitive ion channels.</p><p>In light of the increased stiffness of Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> sensory neurons we also examined the gross organization of the cytoskeleton in these cells. Similar to osmosensory neurons in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prager-Khoutorsky et al., 2014</xref>) we observed that microtubules formed a lattice like structure in DRG neurons; however this was not altered in the absence of Atat1. Similarly, we detected no difference in phalloidin staining in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice suggesting that mechanosensory defects do not arise from interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. How α-tubulin acetylation sets cellular stiffness is therefore not immediately apparent, and a key question will be to investigate whether this occurs by directly altering the rigidity of individual microtubules or through interaction with other membrane and cytoskeletal elements. Intriguingly, it has recently been shown that another tubulin posttranslation modification, detyrosination, stiffens cardiomyocytes and promotes microtubule buckling in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Robison et al., 2016</xref>). Desmin intermediate filaments were identified as a physical link between detyrosinated microtubules and the sarcomere, opening up the possibility that analogous mechanisms may function in sensory neurons, and that other microtubule posttranslational modifications may also influence sensory mechanotransduction. Further work using electron microscopy for example to examine the structure of microtubules and their modifications at the ultrastructural level, particularly under the membrane, may give insight into this process. What is clear however is that the mechanism appears to be broadly applicable since the lack of mechanosensitivity of Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice extends beyond phenotypes observed when other mechanotransduction complex proteins such as Piezo2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>) and STOML3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wetzel et al., 2007</xref>) are deleted. The convergence of multiple mechanisms onto a single posttranslational modification of α-tubulin, and its remarkable selectivity, indicates that microtubule acetylation represents a fundamental component of the mechanosensory apparatus, as well as an attractive target for novel therapeutic strategies to treat mechanical pain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse lines</title><p>The generation and genotyping of all mouse lines used has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalebic et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zurborg et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioural testing</title><p>The tape test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>), cotton swab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>), von Frey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwan et al., 2006</xref>), tail clip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>), hot plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwan et al., 2006</xref>), tail immersion test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elhabazi et al., 2014</xref>), acetone drop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 1994</xref>) and rotarod assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamm et al., 1994</xref>) respectively, were all performed as described previously.

The chamber was perfused with a synthetic interstitial fluid (SIF buffer) consisting of (in mM): NaCl, 123; KCl, 3.5; MgSO4, 0.7; NaH2PO4, 1.7; CaCl2, 2.0; sodium gluconate, 9.5; glucose, 5.5; sucrose, 7.5; and HEPES, 10 at a pH of 7.4.) The skin was placed with the corium side up, and the nerve was placed in an adjacent chamber for fiber teasing and single-unit recording. Single units were isolated with a mechanical search stimulus applied with a glass rod and classified by conduction velocity, von Frey hair thresholds and adaptation properties to suprathreshold stimuli. A computer-controlled nanomotor (Kleindiek Nanotechnik) was used to apply mechanical ramp-and-hold stimuli of known amplitude and velocity. Standardized displacement stimuli of 2 s or 10 s duration were applied to the receptive field at regular intervals (interstimulus period, 30 s).

After electroporation, the cell suspension was transferred to 500 µl of RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) for 10 min at 37°C. This suspension, supplemented with 10% horse serum, was used to plate the cells onto glass coverslips for recording.

Recordings were made from DRG neurons using fire-polished glass electrodes with a resistance of 3–7 MΩ. Extracellular solution contained (mM): NaCl 140, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 2, KCl 4, glucose four and HEPES 10 (pH 7.4), and electrodes were filled with a solution containing (mM): KCl 130, NaCl 10, MgCl2 1, EGTA one and HEPES 10 (pH 7.3). Cells were perfused with drug-containing solutions by moving an array of outlets in front of the patched cells (WAS02; Ditel, Prague). Observations were made with an Observer A1 inverted microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a CCD camera and the imaging software AxioVision. Membrane current and voltage were amplified and acquired using EPC-10 amplifier sampled at 40 kHz; acquired traces were analyzed using Patchmaster and Fitmaster software (HEKA). Pipette and membrane capacitance were compensated using the auto function of Pulse. For most of the experiments, to minimize the voltage error, 70% of the series resistance was compensated and the membrane voltage was held at −60 mV with the voltage-clamp circuit. After establishing whole-cell configuration, voltage-gated currents were measured using a standard series of voltage commands. Briefly, the neurons were pre-pulsed to −120 mV for 150 ms and depolarized from −65 to +55 mV in increments of 5 mV (40 ms test pulse duration). Next the amplifier was switched to current-clamp mode and current injection was used to evoke action potentials. If the membrane capacitance and resistance changed more than 20% after the mechanical stimulus, the cell was regarded as membrane damaged and the data discarded. Mechanical stimuli were applied using a heat-polished glass pipette (tip diameter 3–5 µm), driven by a MM3A Micromanipulator system (Kleindiek), and positioned at an angle of 45 degrees to the surface of the dish. For soma indentation, the probe was typically positioned so that a 1.4 µm movement did not visibly contact the cell but that a 2.8 µm stimulus produced an observable membrane deflection under the microscope. So a 2.8 µm probe movement was defined as a 1.4 µm mechanical stimulation, and a series of mechanical steps in 0.7 µm increment were applied at 5 s intervals. The displacement threshold was determined as mechanical stimulus that elicited a current ≥20 pA.

Samples were embedded in 2% agarose and 100 μM sections were cut. The sections were treated with 50% ethanol 30 min and subsequently incubated with a 5% serum blocking solution of 0.3% Triton-X in PBS for 1 hr. Samples were then incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4°C NF200 1:200 (Sigma Aldrich, N0142), CGRP 1:500 (Rockland, 200–301-DI5) and IB4 1:100 (Invitrogen, I21414).

Axons were allowed to grow across the microchannels connecting the two chambers for 3–5 days. On the day of the experiment, media in both the cell body and axon chambers was replaced with media with no serum for 3 hr. 1 μM mono-biotinylated NGF purified in house from eukaryotic cells was coupled with 1 μM streptavidin conjugated quantum dots 655 (Life Technologies, Italy) for 30 min on ice, then diluted to 5 nM in imaging buffer (as above) and then used to replace the media in the axon chamber. A 25% vol difference was kept between the cell body and the axon chamber to avoid backflow from the axon to the cell body chamber. After 1 hr incubation at 37°C in 5% CO2, retrograde transport of NGF-Qdot655 containing endosomes was imaged using a confocal Ultraview Vox (Perkin Elmer) equipped with a 5% CO2 humidified chamber at 37°C. 100 s time lapses were recorded using 300 ms exposure time. Images were analyzed with Imaris software using the particle tracking function and autoregressive motion track generation setting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>FRAP analysis of DRG</title><p>DRG were transfected with Piezo2-GFP using a nucleofector device (Amaxa) as described above. After two days FRAP analysis was then carried out on a LEICA SP5 confocal microscope. Cells were imaged for 10 frames pre-bleach before being bleached for a further 10 frames (70% laser power), following this the cells were imaged once every minute for 15 min to measure recovery. Data was analysed and graphs generated using Sigma-Plot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Superresolution microscopy</title><p>The cells were washed once with 3 ml of warm PBS and then fixed and permeabilized for 2 min in cytoskeleton buffer containing 0.3% Glutaraldehyde and 0.25% Triton X-100. Following this, the cells were fixed for 10 min in cytoskeleton buffer containing 2% Glutaraldehyde and treated for 7 min with 2 ml of 0.1% Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4) in PBS. Cells were then washed 3 times for 10 min in PBS. The cells were incubated with primary antibody for 30 min (mouse anti α-tubulin, Neomarker, 1:500) in PBS +2% BSA After washing 3 times for 10 min with PBS, the cells were transferred to the secondary antibody (goat anti mouse Alexa 647, 1:500, Molecular Probes A21236) at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were then washed three times with PBS for 10 min and then mounted for STORM imaging. At the time of imaging cells were overlaid with STORM blinking buffer: 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 10% Glucose, 100 U/ml Glucose Oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich), 40 μg/ml Catalase (Sigma-Aldrich).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Superresolution image analysis</title><p>The analysis of microtubule (MT) network morphology was done using the open source software CellProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carpenter et al., 2006</xref>). The MT signal was enhanced by a top-hat filter and then binarised with the same manual threshold for all images. Binary images were skeletonized using CellProfiler's 'skelPE' algorithm and the resulting skeleton was subjected to branchpoint detection. We measured MT density by dividing the skeleton length with imaged cell area and we measured MT crossing density by dividing the number of branchpoints with skeleton length. Moreover, we measured the local angular distribution of the MTs in order to assess whether they run in parallel, or in a crossing manner (angular variance). To this end, we subjected each pixel to a rotating morphological filter using a linear structural element with a length of 11 pixels, and recorded at which angle we obtained a maximum response. We computed the response for angles from 0 to 170 degrees at steps of 10 degrees since there is no information on MT polarity. Next we measured the local circular variance of the MT orientations in a sliding window with a diameter of 51 pixels, using angle doubling as it is commonly done for axial data. The circular variance has a value one if the MTs in a given region are completely parallel and has smaller values (down to 0) if the MTs are oriented in various directions. Finally, we computed the average circular variance of all MT pixels in a given cell. If this value were close to one it would mean that locally, on a length scale of 51 pixels, the MTs are parallel in most of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Atomic force microscopy (AFM)</title><p>Force spectroscopy measurements were performed in a similar manner to that described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qi et al., 2015</xref>). Force spectroscopy measurements were performed by using a NanoWizard AFM (JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) equipped with a fluid chamber (Biocell; JPK) for live cell analysis and an inverted optical microscope (Axiovert 200; Zeiss) for sample observation.</p><p>DRG cells were seeded on glass coverslips previously coated with a first layer of polylysine (500 μg/ml for about 1 hr room temperature) and a second layer of laminin (20 μg/ml for about 1 hr at 37°C). The cells were then cultured for at least 15 hr before measurements. Then, the sample was inserted into the fluid chamber immersed in culture medium and measurements were carried out at room temperature. The status of cells was constantly monitored by optical microscope.</p><p>Indenters for probing cell elasticity were prepared by mounting silica microspheres of 4.5 μm nominal diameter (Bangs Laboratories Inc.) to tipless V-shaped silicon nitride cantilevers having nominal spring constants of 0.32 N/m or 0.08 N/m (NanoWorld, Innovative Technologies) by using UV sensitive glue (Loxeal UV Glue). Silica beads were picked under microscopy control. Before measurements the spring constant of the cantilevers was calibrated by using the thermal noise method.</p><p>By using the optical microscope the bead-mounted cantilever was brought over the soma of single DRG and pressed down to indent the cell. The motion of the z-piezo and the force were recorded. On each cell eight-about ten force-distance curves were acquired with a force load of 500 pN and at a rate of 5 μm sec-1 in closed loop feed-back mode.</p><p>Cell elastic properties were assessed by evaluating the Young’s modulus (E) of the cell. This value was obtained by analysing the approaching part of the recorded F-D curves using the JPK DP software. The software converts the approaching curve into force-indentation curves by subtracting the cantilever bending from the signal height to calculate indentation. Afterwards force-indentation curves were fitted by Hertz-Sneddon model for a spherical indenter according to this equation:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>ν</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo> <mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mtext>ln</mml:mtext><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow> <mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mtext> ln</mml:mtext><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Here, δ is the indentation depth, a is the contact radius of the indenter, R is the silica bead radius, ν is the sample’s Poisson ratio (set to 0.5 for cell) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rotsch et al., 1999</xref>) and E is Young’s modulus.

The cells were then transferred to imaging buffer (10 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM D-glucose) at 320mOsm. Following a 5 min acclimatization period the cells were subjected to a 440mOsm (osmolarity adjusted with mannitol) hyperosmotic shock for 3 min. All imaging was carried out using a Leica SP5 resonant scanner. To increase the permeability and fluorogenicity of the previously described far-red microtubule probe SiR-tubulin2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lukinavičius et al., 2014</xref>) we exchanged the docetaxel in SiR-tubulin with the more hydrophobic cabazitaxel. The molecule was synthesized using the same procedures as described for SiR-tubulin. A detailed characterization of SiR-tubulin2 will be published elsewhere.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Maria Kamber and Emerald Perlas of EMBL Monterotondo Mouse and Histology facilities for technical support of our work and Violetta Paribeni for mouse husbandry.

The authors report profound deficits in the behavior of the animals when confronted with a variety of mechanical stimuli but no impairments in their responses to thermal stimuli. Analysis of the physiological responses of identified primary afferents innervating the hairy skin indicate that loss of Atat1 leads to profound loss of mechanosensitivity amongst both mechanoreceptors and nociceptors. The authors report that loss of mechanosensitivity is associated with loss of mechanosensitive currents evoked by poking isolated sensory neurons. Importantly, the authors show that the loss of mechanosensitive current can be rescued by reintroducing Atat1 into the neurons or by a mutation in α-tubilin that mimics the effects of the acetylation. The authors have carried out an extensive series of control experiments in an attempt to rule out indirect effects of Atat1 deletion during development that might impact on the phenotype. Finally, the authors conclude that acetylation of α-tubilin may be necessary to stiffen the membrane which enhances the ability of force to activate mechanosensitive channels. The paper contains novel and interesting data that will have a significant impact on the field and will be of broad interest to many neuroscientists working on sensory mechanisms. The key conclusion that the authors make that it is membrane stiffness that &quot;explains&quot; the effect of the Atat1 gene deletion is however overstated and based on a selective review of the literature. The authors should consider alternative explanations and discuss more critically the interpretation of their experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers mention that the paper contains novel and interesting data that will have a significant impact on the field and will be of broad interest to many neuroscientists working on sensory mechanisms. However, there are a number of major concerns, which preclude publication in its present form. Some concerns mention a lack of related references and a discussion of alternative models.</p><p>The authors are invited to submit a revised version of the manuscript, in which they fully address all points listed below (points 1-3 require additional experimental data).</p><p>1) Rotarod and Grid test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G and H</xref>): the authors conclude that Atat1 KO mice are normal in motor coordination, since no significant differences were observed between the genotypes. This may be true, however the number of animals per experiment was very low with six and seven individuals per genotype, respectively. In contrast to the acetone test, which is also based on six mice each, rotarod and grid test show a tendency and large error bars (e.g. KOs in rotarod). N-values in rotarod and grid test, need to be increased to support the statements on proprioception.</p><p>2) The authors used heterozygous KO mice as controls throughout the study. They may have done pilot experiments to prove that (i) heterozygotes perform similar as wildtypes and (ii) Cre expression per se has no effect. This needs to be stated in the manuscript or to be added as supplemental controls to support the conclusions.</p><p>3) Please add data on the efficiency of Atat gene deletion in the conditional mice.</p><p>Is the phenotype of reduced sensory neuron mechanosensitivity identical in the Atat1 full knockout? Cre drivers are never 100% efficient in recombining with floxed alleles and the efficiency for different floxed loci are not identical. I did not see any data on the efficiency of Atat1 gene deletion in the cKO mice. qPCR, southern blotting etc. are not shown. The easiest way to be sure here is to show that the phenotype in the full knockout is at least as severe as in the cKO. Have these experiments been done?</p><p>4) The key conclusion that the authors make that it is membrane stiffness that &quot;explains&quot; the effect of the Atat1 gene deletion is however overstated and based on a selective review of the literature. The authors should consider alternative explanations and discuss more critically the interpretation of their experiments.</p><p>5) Please cite and discuss the following literature based on the comments below. Please consider and discuss alternative explanations and models.</p><p>A) The conclusion that changes in membrane stiffness underlies the effect of Atat1 gene deletion is based on data from AFM measurements on the cell body in culture. This is not the place where transduction happens in vivo and more importantly is completely different in morphology to the sensory endings of any sensory fiber type in the skin (tiny elongated tubes compared to a huge compressible balloon). This is fine when measuring the activation of mechanosensitive currents at the cell soma but there are several papers showing that displacement thresholds are much smaller to activate such currents in sensory neurites which are much more similar to sensory ending in vivo (e.g. PMID: 21725315 and Hu and Lewin 2006 quoted, but not in this context).</p><p>B) Moreover, the authors suggest that stimuli in a range up to 200 nm indentation may be selective for indentation of the membrane whereas up to 600 nm may impinge on the cytoskeleton. However, in a recent study Poole and colleagues showed that membrane displacements of much less than 50 nm are capable of maximally activating mechanosensitive currents in mechanoreceptors (PMID:24662763, not quoted). Indeed, their finding that membrane stiffness increases after deletion of Atat1 is to this reviewer counterintuitive as increased stiffness of the membrane would be expected to decrease the activation threshold for mechanosensitive channels to force. However, this expectation is highly dependent on where channels are in relation to other mechanical elements in the system. Indeed, the authors totally ignore models, which are also based on good experimental evidence in sensory neurons (see PMID: 20075867; 21725315) that physical tethers that link directly or indirectly channels to the matrix are critical for the sensitivity of mechanosensitive channels to force. It appears to me more likely that the organization or mis-organization of the microtubule network in the vicinity of such complexes that include matrix interaction may better explain the loss of mechanoreceptor sensitivity in their mutant mice. In any case ignoring the literature that such interactions are critically important oversimplifies and may mislead the reader. Again, the change in stiffness of the membrane correlates with the effects on mechanosensitivity but does not necessarily explain them.</p><p>6) One additional point is that Hu and colleagues have claimed that membrane softening is associated with loss of STOML3 (PMID 26443885) but here the authors observe membrane stiffening in the absence of Atat1. However, both genetic manipulations lead to loss of mechanosensitive currents. This is not so easily reconciled with the authors favoured interpretation and should be explicitly addressed in the Discussion. (Posted 27th Sep 2016)</p><p>7) Introduction, third paragraph: &quot;well conserved in ciliated organisms&quot; – organisms are not ciliated they have cells with cilia. Reword please.</p><p>8) Subsection “Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice display reduced mechanosensitivity across all mechanoreceptor subtypes innervating the skin”, second paragraph: Rugiero et al. 2010 showed that the RA mechanosensitive current is velocity dependent not that mechanoreceptor firing frequencies are highly velocity dependent an issue addressed directly in PMID 18815344 for instance. Please replace with a more appropriate reference.</p><p>9) Subsection “Morphological analysis of the peripheral nervous system in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice”: &quot;neurotrophin transport&quot; is misleading; it is neurotrophin/receptor transport as such experiments are generally thought to measure transport of NGF internalized with its receptor. It is odd here that the authors fail to mention their own work indicating that STOML3 another critical mediator of mechanotransduction is transported in vesicles associated with microtubules (PMID 22773952). Indeed, this paper shows that then molecular characteristics of such vesicles are distinct from classical signaling endosomes so a change in STOML3 transport could conceivably contribute to the phenotype they see. This is worth mentioning and emphasizes that the interpretation that membrane stiffness is everything is being over sold at the expense of other possibilities.</p><p>10) Subsection “Genetically mimicking α-tubulin acetylation restores mechanosensitivity of Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> sensory neurons”. The authors repeatedly emphasize the requirement of Atat1 for mechanosensitive currents. However, it has recently been shown that lack of mechanosensitive current activation to poking is not associated with complete loss of mechanosensitive currents (PMID:24662763) as membrane displacement experiments demonstrate that loss of mechanosensitive currents in STOML3 mutant neurons is associated not with loss but with increased displacement thresholds for activating native emchanosensitive neurons (PMID:24662763). The authors should modulate their language accordingly.</p><p>11) This raises another issue that the authors did not address experimentally, which at least deserves a mention. Namely: were any of their recorded afferents in the ex vivo skin nerve preparation completely silent to mechanical stimulation? If the authors have not measured this it should be at least mentioned that this is an unknown.</p><p>12) Subsection “Increased rigidity of DRG neurons from Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice”, first paragraph: rather arbitrary statements about the indentations that impinge on membrane or cytoskeleton. The plasma membrane is less than 10 nm thick so I fail to see why 200nm should primarily perturb the plasma membrane only (see again PMID 24662763).</p><p>13) Discussion, sixth paragraph: how can loss of mechanosensitivity in nociceptors (which is in any case no by no means complete) lead to noxious stimuli being perceived as innocuous? This speculation should be removed.</p><p>14) The Discussion should include more alternative models and not focus exclusively on membrane stiffness as the only explanation.

If so, it is not mentioned in the figure legend and/or Materials and methods section. Please add the missing information.

In contrast, data for saphenous nerve axons and sensory neuron axons are less convincing. To fully conclude, super-resolution imaging of axons will be needed, although I know this is hard to perform. To circumvent this requirement, I suggest that the authors use less affirmative phrasing in the Results/figure sections (subsection “Acetylated tubulin localizes to a prominent submembrane band in peripheral sensory neurons” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> legend), that they provide higher-magnification images, or that they confine these results to the Supplemental data.</p><p>18) The data relating to hyperosmotic experiments, presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>, are not adequate; a before and after picture is required (as shown in the associated supplementary figure).

Some concerns mention a lack of related references and a discussion of alternative models.</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors are invited to submit a revised version of the manuscript, in which they fully address all points listed below (points 1-3 require additional experimental data).</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Rotarod and Grid test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G and H</xref>): the authors conclude that Atat1 KO mice are normal in motor coordination, since no significant differences were observed between the genotypes. This may be true, however the number of animals per experiment was very low with six and seven individuals per genotype, respectively. In contrast to the acetone test, which is also based on six mice each, rotarod and grid test show a tendency and large error bars (e.g. KOs in rotarod). N-values in rotarod and grid test, need to be increased to support the statements on proprioception.</italic> </p><p>We have performed additional experiments to increase N numbers. This data has been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The authors used heterozygous KO mice as controls throughout the study. They may have done pilot experiments to prove that (i) heterozygotes perform similar as wildtypes and (ii) Cre expression per se has no effect. This needs to be stated in the manuscript or to be added as supplemental controls to support the conclusions.</italic> </p><p>We have stated in the manuscript that heterozygote control mice perform similarly to wildtypes. Data is also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> supporting this statement.</p><p><italic>3) Please add data on the efficiency of Atat gene deletion in the conditional mice.</italic> </p><p><italic>Is the phenotype of reduced sensory neuron mechanosensitivity identical in the Atat1 full knockout? Cre drivers are never 100% efficient in recombining with floxed alleles and the efficiency for different floxed loci are not identical. I did not see any data on the efficiency of Atat1 gene deletion in the cKO mice. qPCR, southern blotting etc. are not shown. The easiest way to be sure here is to show that the phenotype in the full knockout is at least as severe as in the cKO. Have these experiments been done?</italic> </p><p>We have added data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> showing that the phenotype in the full knockout is as severe as the cKO.</p><p><italic>4) The key conclusion that the authors make that it is membrane stiffness that &quot;explains&quot; the effect of the Atat1 gene deletion is however overstated and based on a selective review of the literature. The authors should consider alternative explanations and discuss more critically the interpretation of their experiments.</italic> </p><p>We have expanded the Discussion to include alternative mechanisms and be more critical of our own data.</p><p><italic>5) Please cite and discuss the following literature based on the comments below. Please consider and discuss alternative explanations and models.</italic> </p><p><italic>A) The conclusion that changes in membrane stiffness underlies the effect of Atat1 gene deletion is based on data from AFM measurements on the cell body in culture. This is not the place where transduction happens in vivo and more importantly is completely different in morphology to the sensory endings of any sensory fiber type in the skin (tiny elongated tubes compared to a huge compressible balloon). This is fine when measuring the activation of mechanosensitive currents at the cell soma but there are several papers showing that displacement thresholds are much smaller to activate such currents in sensory neurites which are much more similar to sensory ending in vivo (e.g. PMID: 21725315 and Hu and Lewin 2006 quoted, but not in this context).</italic> </p><p>This point has been discussed.</p><p><italic>B) Moreover, the authors suggest that stimuli in a range up to 200 nm indentation may be selective for indentation of the membrane whereas up to 600 nm may impinge on the cytoskeleton. However, in a recent study Poole and colleagues showed that membrane displacements of much less than 50 nm are capable of maximally activating mechanosensitive currents in mechanoreceptors (PMID:24662763, not quoted). Indeed, their finding that membrane stiffness increases after deletion of Atat1 is to this reviewer counterintuitive as increased stiffness of the membrane would be expected to decrease the activation threshold for mechanosensitive channels to force. However, this expectation is highly dependent on where channels are in relation to other mechanical elements in the system. Indeed, the authors totally ignore models, which are also based on good experimental evidence in sensory neurons (see PMID: 20075867; 21725315) that physical tethers that link directly or indirectly channels to the matrix are critical for the sensitivity of mechanosensitive channels to force. It appears to me more likely that the organization or mis-organization of the microtubule network in the vicinity of such complexes that include matrix interaction may better explain the loss of mechanoreceptor sensitivity in their mutant mice. In any case ignoring the literature that such interactions are critically important oversimplifies and may mislead the reader. Again, the change in stiffness of the membrane correlates with the effects on mechanosensitivity but does not necessarily explain them.</italic> </p><p>We have discussed more fully our data in light of other models of mechanosensation adding the suggested references.</p><p><italic>6) One additional point is that Hu and colleagues have claimed that membrane softening is associated with loss of STOML3 (PMID 26443885) but here the authors observe membrane stiffening in the absence of Atat1. However, both genetic manipulations lead to loss of mechanosensitive currents. This is not so easily reconciled with the authors favoured interpretation and should be explicitly addressed in the Discussion. (Posted 27th Sep 2016)</italic> </p><p>We have discussed further membrane softening associated reductions in mechanosensitivity in light of our data.</p><p><italic>7) Introduction, third paragraph: &quot;well conserved in ciliated organisms&quot; – organisms are not ciliated they have cells with cilia. Reword please.</italic> </p><p>We have corrected this.</p><p><italic>8) Subsection “Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice display reduced mechanosensitivity across all mechanoreceptor subtypes innervating the skin”, second paragraph: Rugiero et al. 2010 showed that the RA mechanosensitive current is velocity dependent not that mechanoreceptor firing frequencies are highly velocity dependent an issue addressed directly in PMID 18815344 for instance. Please replace with a more appropriate reference.</italic> </p><p>We have replaced with the correct reference.</p><p><italic>9) Subsection “Morphological analysis of the peripheral nervous system in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice”: &quot;neurotrophin transport&quot; is misleading; it is neurotrophin/receptor transport as such experiments are generally thought to measure transport of NGF internalized with its receptor. It is odd here that the authors fail to mention their own work indicating that STOML3 another critical mediator of mechanotransduction is transported in vesicles associated with microtubules (PMID 22773952). Indeed, this paper shows that then molecular characteristics of such vesicles are distinct from classical signaling endosomes so a change in STOML3 transport could conceivably contribute to the phenotype they see. This is worth mentioning and emphasizes that the interpretation that membrane stiffness is everything is being over sold at the expense of other possibilities.</italic> </p><p>We have corrected neurotrophin transport to neurotrophin/receptor transport. We have also discussed our previous finding that STOML3 is transported in microtubule associated vesicles and that this could also underlie the phenotype.</p><p><italic>10) Subsection “Genetically mimicking α-tubulin acetylation restores mechanosensitivity of Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> sensory neurons”. The authors repeatedly emphasize the requirement of Atat1 for mechanosensitive currents. However, it has recently been shown that lack of mechanosensitive current activation to poking is not associated with complete loss of mechanosensitive currents (PMID:24662763) as membrane displacement experiments demonstrate that loss of mechanosensitive currents in STOML3 mutant neurons is associated not with loss but with increased displacement thresholds for activating native emchanosensitive neurons (PMID:24662763). The authors should modulate their language accordingly.</italic> </p><p>We have corrected statements where we over emphasize the requirement of Atat1 for mechanosensitive currents. We have also discussed the possibility that increased displacement thresholds could account for the phenotype.</p><p><italic>11) This raises another issue that the authors did not address experimentally, which at least deserves a mention. Namely: were any of their recorded afferents in the ex vivo skin nerve preparation completely silent to mechanical stimulation? If the authors have not measured this it should be at least mentioned that this is an unknown.</italic> </p><p>This is an important point that we have added to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>12) Subsection “Increased rigidity of DRG neurons from Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice”, first paragraph: rather arbitrary statements about the indentations that impinge on membrane or cytoskeleton. The plasma membrane is less than 10 nm thick so I fail to see why 200nm should primarily perturb the plasma membrane only (see again PMID 24662763).</italic> </p><p>We have corrected this.</p><p><italic>13) Discussion, sixth paragraph: how can loss of mechanosensitivity in nociceptors (which is in any case no by no means complete) lead to noxious stimuli being perceived as innocuous? This speculation should be removed.</italic> </p><p>We have removed this speculation.</p><p><italic>14) The Discussion should include more alternative models and not focus exclusively on membrane stiffness as the only explanation. Several important parts of the literature have been completely ignored.</italic> </p><p>As described above we have modified the Discussion to make it more balanced.</p><p><italic>15) I cannot see whether the experiments measuring mechanosensitive currents in DRG neurons was done blind to the genotype and/or transfection.
