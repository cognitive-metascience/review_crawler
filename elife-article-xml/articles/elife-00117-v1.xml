round of DNA replication is followed by two consecutive rounds of nuclear divisions called meiosis I and meiosis II. In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes segregate, while sister chromatids remain together. Determining how this unusual chromosome segregation behavior is established is central to understanding germ cell development. Here we show that preventing microtubule–kinetochore interactions during premeiotic S phase and prophase I is essential for establishing the meiosis I chromosome segregation pattern. Premature interactions of kinetochores with microtubules transform meiosis I into a mitosis-like division by disrupting two key meiosis I events: coorientation of sister kinetochores and protection of centromeric cohesin removal from chromosomes. Furthermore we find that restricting outer kinetochore assembly contributes to preventing premature engagement of microtubules with kinetochores. We propose that inhibition of microtubule–kinetochore interactions during premeiotic S phase and prophase I is central to establishing the unique meiosis I chromosome segregation pattern.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00117.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00117.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00117.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Diploid organisms contain two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from the mother and the other from the father. Humans, for example, have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and the chromosomes within each pair are said to be homologous because they are similar to each other in a number of ways, including length and shape. When it comes time for one of these cells to duplicate, each chromosome is first replicated to generate a pair of identical chromosomes called sister chromatids, which subsequently separate in a cell division process known as mitosis to produce two identical daughter cells.</p><p>While most cells proliferate via mitotic cell division, the germ cells that generate gametes in the form of sperm or eggs undergo a different cell division known as meiosis. This process reduces the number of chromosomes by a factor of two, so that the original number of chromosomes is restored by the fusion of gametes during sexual reproduction. During meiotic cell division, a single round of DNA replication is followed by two consecutive rounds of nuclear division called meiosis I and meiosis II. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are separated. Subsequently, during meiosis II, the sister chromatids separate to produce a total of four products, each with half the number of chromosomes as the original cell.</p><p>The separation of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids relies on them being pulled apart by microtubules. One end of each microtubule is attached to a protein-based structure called a kinetochore, which is assembled onto the centromere of each chromosome. The other end of each microtubule is attached to a structure that is called a centrosome in human cells and a spindle pole body in yeast cells. Human cells have two centrosomes, which reside on the opposite poles of the cell, and likewise for the spindle pole bodies in yeast cells. In mitotic cells and in meiosis II, microtubules attach to kinetochores in a way that means the sister chromatids are pulled apart. During meiosis I, on the other hand, they attach to kinetochores in a manner so the homologous chromosomes are pulled apart.</p><p>Miller et al. now show how the timing of the interaction between the kinetochore and microtubules is critical to ensure that the homologous chromosomes are separated during meiosis I. They found that premature interactions resulted in the separation of sister chromatids (as happens in mitosis) rather than the separation of homologous chromosomes, as is supposed to happen in meiosis I. They also showed that cells prevent such premature interactions by dismantling the outer regions of the kinetochore and reducing the levels of enzymes called CDKs in the cell. These results demonstrate that preventing premature microtubule–kinetochore interactions is essential for establishing a meiosis I-specific chromosome architecture, and they also provide fresh insights into how the molecular machinery that is responsible for mitotic chromosome segregation can be modulated to achieve meiosis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00117.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00117.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>cyclin-dependent kinase</kwd><kwd>tension</kwd><kwd>cohesin</kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Matthew P</given-names></name><name><surname>Ünal</surname><given-names>Elçin</given-names></name><name><surname>Brar</surname><given-names>Gloria A</given-names></name><name><surname>Amon</surname><given-names>Angelika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM62207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Matthew P</given-names></name><name><surname>Ünal</surname><given-names>Elçin</given-names></name><name><surname>Brar</surname><given-names>Gloria A</given-names></name><name><surname>Amon</surname><given-names>Angelika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ünal</surname><given-names>Elçin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brar</surname><given-names>Gloria A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Preventing premature interactions between microtubules and protein-based structures called kinetochores ensures that chromosomes are segregated by meiosis rather than mitosis in reproductive cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells have evolved intricate mechanisms to execute proper partitioning of the genetic material during cell division. This task is especially complex in meiosis, the cell division used by sexually reproducing organisms to generate gametes. The goal of meiosis is to reduce the genome content by half such that proper ploidy is maintained upon fusion of gametes. To achieve this, a single round of DNA replication is followed by two consecutive rounds of nuclear division called meiosis I and meiosis II. During meiosis I homologous chromosomes segregate. Meiosis II resembles mitosis in that sister chromatids segregate from each other. The establishment of this specialized chromosome segregation pattern requires three changes that modulate how chromosomes interact with each other and with the microtubule cytoskeleton: (1) reciprocal recombination between homologous chromosomes, (2) the way linkages between sister chromatids, known as sister-chromatid cohesion, are removed from chromosomes and (3) the manner in which chromosomes attach to the meiotic spindle.</p><p>Homologous recombination is initiated by programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are catalyzed by Spo11 following premeiotic DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>). Subsequent repair of DSBs by crossover recombination generates physical linkages between homologous chromosomes. This, in turn, allows homologs to attach to the meiosis I spindle such that each homolog interacts with microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles. As a result, homologous chromosomes biorient on the meiosis I spindle. The spindle assembly checkpoint prevents the onset of chromosome segregation until this process is completed. Once each pair of homologs is bioriented, checkpoint signaling ceases and anaphase entry ensues. A ubiquitin ligase known as the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome and its specificity factor Cdc20 (APC/C-Cdc20) targets Securin for degradation, relieving Separase inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen-Fix et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciosk et al., 1998</xref>). Separase is a protease that cleaves the kleisin subunit of cohesin, the protein complex that mediates sister-chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Uhlmann et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schleiffer et al., 2003</xref>). In meiosis I, cleavage of cohesin at chromosome arms allows homologs to segregate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buonomo et al., 2000</xref>). However, cohesin around the centromeres is protected from cleavage during meiosis I, which is essential for the accurate segregation of sister chromatids during meiosis II. Protection of centromeric cohesin is accomplished by preventing phosphorylation of Rec8, the meiosis-specific kleisin. This occurs, at least in part, by Sgo1 (MEI-S332)-dependent recruitment of the protein phosphatase PP2A to centromeric regions where it antagonizes Rec8 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerrebrock et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katis et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kitajima et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Riedel et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The third modification necessary to bring about the meiotic chromosome segregation pattern is the manner in which kinetochores attach to microtubules during meiosis I and meiosis II. In meiosis I, kinetochores of sister chromatid pairs (henceforth sister kinetochores) attach to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole, a process called sister kinetochore coorientation. During meiosis II, as during mitosis, sister kinetochores attach to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles and are thus bioriented (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marston and Amon, 2004</xref>). In budding yeast, sister kinetochore coorientation is brought about by the monopolin complex, which consists of Mam1, Lrs4, Csm1 and the casein kinase 1, Hrr25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Toth et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rabitsch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petronczki et al., 2006</xref>). Lrs4 and Csm1 localize to the nucleolus during interphase. During exit from pachytene, a stage of prophase I, Lrs4 and Csm1 associate with Mam1 and Hrr25 at kinetochores, a process that requires the Polo kinase Cdc5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clyne et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Amon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matos et al., 2008</xref>). How the association of monopolin with kinetochores is coordinated with respect to kinetochore assembly and microtubule–kinetochore interactions during meiosis is not understood.</p><p>Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are the central regulators of the mitotic and meiotic divisions. In budding yeast, a single CDK associates with one of six B-type cyclins (Clb1-Clb6) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morgan, 1997</xref>). In meiosis, Clb5- and Clb6-CDKs drive DNA replication and recombination, whereas Clb1-, Clb3- and Clb4-CDKs promote the meiotic nuclear divisions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marston and Amon, 2004</xref>). Meiotic cyclin-CDK activity is regulated both at the transcriptional and translational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grandin and Reed, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlile and Amon, 2008</xref>). Transcription of <italic>CLB1</italic>, <italic>CLB3</italic> and <italic>CLB4</italic> occurs only after exit from pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu and Herskowitz, 1998</xref>); <italic>CLB3</italic> is also translationally repressed during meiosis I, thus restricting Clb3-CDK activity to meiosis II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlile and Amon, 2008</xref>). The major mitotic cyclin, <italic>CLB2</italic>, is not expressed during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grandin and Reed, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Here we investigate the importance of cyclin-CDK regulation in establishing the meiotic chromosome segregation pattern. We show that expression of a subset of cyclins during premeiotic S phase and early prophase I, defined as the prophase stages up to exit from pachytene, causes premature microtubule–kinetochore interactions. This, in turn, disrupts both sister kinetochore coorientation and protection of centromeric cohesin during meiosis I, revealing that the temporal control of microtubule–kinetochore interactions is essential for meiosis I chromosome morphogenesis. Furthermore, we define the mechanism by which premature microtubule–kinetochore interactions are prevented; through regulation of cyclin-CDK activity and of outer kinetochore assembly. Our results demonstrate that preventing premature microtubule–kinetochore interactions is essential for establishing a meiosis I-specific chromosome architecture and provide critical insights into how the mitotic chromosome segregation machinery is modulated to achieve a meiosis I-specific pattern of chromosome segregation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cyclin expression is sufficient to induce spindle formation and microtubule–kinetochore interactions</title><p>We previously reported that <italic>CLB3</italic> expression prior to meiosis I induces a change in the pattern of chromosome segregation such that sister chromatids, instead of homologous chromosomes, segregate during the first nuclear division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlile and Amon, 2008</xref>). To determine how Clb-CDKs impact meiotic chromosome segregation and whether Clb-CDKs play redundant or specific roles in regulating this process, we examined the consequences of prematurely expressing <italic>CLB1</italic>, <italic>CLB3</italic>, <italic>CLB4</italic> or <italic>CLB5</italic>.</p><p>In our previous studies we expressed <italic>CLB3</italic> from the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter driven by an estrogen inducible Gal4-ER fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlile and Amon, 2008</xref>). Expression from the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter led to Clb3 accumulation in meiosis I to levels that are comparable to those seen in meiosis II in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlile and Amon, 2008</xref>). However, estrogen interferes with meiotic progression when added during early stages of sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To circumvent this problem we utilized the copper-inducible <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter to drive Clb3 expression. Expression from the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter led to approximately fivefold higher levels of Clb3 protein compared to expression from the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To examine the consequences of the two <italic>CLB3</italic> constructs on chromosome segregation we used <italic>GAL-CLB3</italic> and <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> strains in which one of the two homologs of chromosome III was marked by integrating a tandem array of tetO sequences ∼20 kb from CENIII (heterozygous LEU2-GFP dots). These cells also expressed a tetR-GFP fusion, which allowed visualization of the tetO arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>). The analysis of GFP dot segregation during the first meiotic division revealed that despite the difference in Clb3 protein levels, the extent of sister chromatid segregation in meiosis I was similar between <italic>GAL-CLB3</italic> and <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This finding indicates that expression of Clb3 from either the <italic>CUP1</italic> or <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter efficiently induces sister chromatid segregation during meiosis I. Furthermore, the timing of when Clb3 is expressed, rather than the amount of Clb3 present, appears to be the primary determinant of this phenotype. Based on this observation and the finding that all four cyclins showed equal expression when produced from the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) we utilized the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter for most subsequent analyses.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00117.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of premature cyclin expression and corresponding total CDK activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild-type (A4962) and <italic>GAL4-ER</italic> (A19151) cells were induced to sporulate.

To this end we used strains carrying heterozygous CENV-GFP dots and an Spc42-mCherry fusion (Spc42 is an SPB component) to monitor the behavior of the marked centromere with respect to the spindle axis. In wild-type and <italic>CUP-CLB5</italic> cells, sister kinetochores remained closely associated with each other and did not appear to be tightly associated with SPBs, consistent with the observation that these cells failed to form a spindle. In contrast, we observed dynamic separation of heterozygous CENV-GFP dots upon expression of <italic>CLB1</italic> or <italic>CLB3</italic>, with sister kinetochores frequently splitting and coming together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). This observation is reminiscent of the behavior of bioriented sister chromatids during metaphase of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pearson et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Cells expressing <italic>CLB4</italic> did not show transient splitting of sister kinetochores in prophase I, indicating that chromosomes are either unable to attach to the spindle or that homologous chromosomes, instead of sister chromatids, are bioriented as occurs in wild-type cells during metaphase I. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the behavior of <italic>CUP-CLB4</italic> cells in which both homologs of chromosome V harbor CENV-GFP dots (henceforth homozygous CENV-GFP dots). Similar to wild-type, we observed that in <italic>CUP-CLB4</italic> cells the two CENV-GFP dots remained tightly associated in prophase I, indicating that the homologous chromosomes are paired and not attached to the prematurely formed spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these results indicate that <italic>CUP-CLB1</italic>, <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> or <italic>CUP-CLB4</italic> expression promotes bipolar spindle formation in pachytene-arrested cells, but only <italic>CLB1</italic> and <italic>CLB3</italic> expression can promote stable microtubule–kinetochore attachments sufficient to generate tension.</p><p>To determine whether different amounts of total CDK activity were responsible for the phenotypic differences of prematurely expressing Clb1 or Clb3 compared to Clb4, we measured total CDK activity (Cdc28 in budding yeast) using Histone H1 as a substrate. Cdc28-associated kinase activity was low during prophase I and increased more than 25-fold during metaphase I/anaphase I in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Expression of all four cyclins led to a significant increase in total CDK activity in prophase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), but importantly, the degree of increase did not correlate with the ability to induce sister chromatid splitting in the <italic>NDT80</italic> arrest. For example, Clb1 expression led to a similar increase in Cdc28-associated kinase activity as expression of Clb4, yet Clb1 induced sister chromatid splitting whereas Clb4 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1F and 2B,C</xref>). We conclude that the ability to induce sister chromatid splitting does not correlate with total CDK activity produced by the various <italic>CUP-CLB</italic> fusions. Furthermore, SPB separation and spindle formation are not sufficient to induce microtubule–kinetochore interactions. Events that can be triggered by Clb1 and Clb3, but not Clb4 are also necessary to promote attachments sufficient to generate tension.

In wild-type cells harboring heterozygous CENV-GFP dots, Pds1 degradation was immediately followed by movement of the single GFP dot to one side of the cell, indicating that homologous chromosomes had segregated.

Although <italic>mam1∆</italic> cells biorient sister chromatids during meiosis I, they delay nuclear division until meiosis II due to the presence of centromeric cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Toth et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rabitsch et al., 2003</xref>). The delay in nuclear division of a <italic>mam1∆</italic> was partially alleviated by the expression of <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). This partial effect is likely due to not all <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells losing centromeric cohesion prematurely in meiosis I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We conclude that both centromeric and arm cohesin are lost from chromosomes at the onset of anaphase I in <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells.</p><p>Next, we investigated the cause of premature centromeric cohesin removal in <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells. Cleavage of cohesin by separase requires the phosphorylation of Rec8 at multiple residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katis et al., 2010</xref>).

Furthermore, the <italic>rec8-29A</italic> allele caused a similar metaphase I delay in wild-type and <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells when expressed as the sole source of <italic>REC8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5 fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplements 5 and 6</xref>).

The cause of this reduction is currently unclear, but could indicate that in <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells, cohesin removal also relies on a separase-independent pathway, that is the prophase removal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yu and Koshland, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Our results demonstrate that Rec8 phosphorylation is required for cohesin removal in <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells and suggest that the defect in centromeric cohesin protection may result from increased phosphorylation of centromeric Rec8. To test this possibility, we used phospho-specific antibodies against two in vivo phosphorylation sites of Rec8 (pS179 and pS521) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katis et al., 2010</xref>; M. Attner personal communication, October 2011) and analyzed the relative enrichment of total Rec8 and phospho-Rec8 at CENV or at an arm cohesin binding site by ChIP in metaphase I-arrested cells. The two phospho-specific antibodies immunoprecipitated similar amounts of Rec8 in wild-type and <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells at the arm site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), which is consistent with arm cohesin being primed for Separase cleavage. However, the amount of phosphorylated Rec8 was increased at the centromere in <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells compared to wild-type cells, albeit not to the same extent as in cells depleted for Sgo1 (<italic>sgo1-mn</italic>), in which meiosis I centromeric-cohesin protection is completely defective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We conclude that <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells are compromised in preventing centromeric Rec8 phosphorylation during meiosis I.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Sgo1-PP2A localization is not affected in <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells</title><p>Sgo1-PP2A and the meiosis-specific protein Spo13 prevent centromeric Rec8 phosphorylation during meiosis I to protect this cohesin pool from cleavage. All three proteins localize to kinetochores during meiosis I, which is thought to be critical for their cohesin-protective function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katis et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kitajima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kitajima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Riedel et al., 2006</xref>). Surprisingly, Sgo1, the PP2A regulatory subunit Rts1 and Spo13 localized normally in prophase I- and metaphase I-arrested <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7 fig4s8 fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplements 7–9</xref>).

However, this reduction during anaphase I is most likely a consequence rather than a cause of premature loss of centromeric cohesin. In cells expressing a phosphomimetic version of Rec8 (<italic>rec8-4D</italic>) that cannot be retained at centromeres beyond meiosis I, Rts1 localization is also reduced in anaphase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s11">Figure 4—figure supplement 11</xref>). It is thus unlikely that the reduction of Sgo1 and Rts1 at centromeres during anaphase I contributes to the premature loss of centromeric cohesin. These findings, together with our observation that centromeric Rec8 phosphorylation is increased in <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells, indicate that Sgo1-PP2A function, but not localization, is impaired in <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Modulating microtubule–kinetochore interactions affects monopolin-induced sister chromatid cosegregation during mitosis</title><p>How does premature expression of <italic>CLB3</italic> interfere with establishment of the meiosis I chromosome segregation pattern? The comparison of the effects caused by <italic>CLB3</italic> and <italic>CLB4</italic> misexpression provided insight into this question. Both cyclins induce spindle formation in prophase I. However, chromosomes are able to attach to this spindle and experience pulling forces only in <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells. Thus, the ability to form tension-generating attachments (i.e. <italic>CUP-CLB1</italic> or <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells) correlates with defects in meiosis I chromosome morphogenesis and segregation. This correlation suggests that premature microtubule–kinetochore engagement during premeiotic S phase/early prophase I is the underlying cause of chromosome missegregation in <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells and predicts that tension generating microtubule–kinetochore attachments should inhibit meiosis I chromosome morphogenesis. Conversely, preventing them should enable building a proper meiosis I chromosome architecture.</p><p>We tested the first prediction using a previously described method in which monopolin-dependent sister kinetochore coorientation is induced during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monje-Casas et al., 2007</xref>).

However, when cells are allowed to form microtubule–kinetochore attachments prior to <italic>CDC5</italic> and <italic>MAM1</italic> expression, cosegregation of sister chromatids is prevented. We reversibly arrested cells in metaphase using a methionine repressible <italic>CDC20</italic> allele (<italic>MET-CDC20</italic>) and induced <italic>MAM1</italic> and <italic>CDC5</italic> expression after cells had arrested in metaphase and had formed microtubule–kinetochore interactions.

The finding that transient disruption of microtubule–kinetochore interactions also suppresses the Lrs4 phosphorylation defect of <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells, furthermore suggests that Lrs4 hyperphosphorylation occurs not at the time of nucleolar release, but once Lrs4 localizes to kinetochores.</p><p>We next asked whether transient inactivation of microtubule–kinetochore interactions also suppresses the premature loss of centromeric cohesin observed in <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells. We used a similar protocol to the one described above, except cells were not arrested in metaphase I following release from the <italic>NDT80</italic> block, but were allowed to proceed into anaphase I to examine Rec8 localization.

This analysis revealed two major expression classes, one included kinetochore components that peak in expression prior to or during prophase I (early class), and the other contained components that instead show peak expression during the meiotic divisions (late class). The early class was enriched for inner kinetochore components (16 of 23), while the late class included primarily outer kinetochore components (13 of 18) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1 fig6s10 fig6s2 fig6s3 fig6s4 fig6s5 fig6s6 fig6s7 fig6s8 fig6s9">Figure 6—figure supplements 1–10</xref>).

We find that preventing microtubule–kinetochore interactions during premeiotic S phase and prophase I is essential for transforming mitosis into meiosis I. Meiosis I chromosome morphogenesis, including the assembly of cohesin protective structures around centromeres and sister kinetochore coorientation, occurs during prophase I. We propose that when microtubules interact with kinetochores prior to completion of this remodeling process, they establish a default attachment, biorientation, which is incompatible with establishing sister kinetochore coorientation and a cohesin protective domain around centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).

Eliminating both, by placing the gene under the control of the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter or the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter has dramatic effects on meiosis I chromosome segregation. <italic>CLB3</italic> expression from the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter, which leads to Clb3 levels comparable to those seen for wild-type cells in meiosis II, causes a significant suppression of the meiosis I chromosome segregation pattern. This defect is not further enhanced by overexpression of the protein (by expression from the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter), which further indicates that this phenotype does not emanate from expressing exceedingly high levels of the cyclin, but is a consequence of premature expression.</p><p>The consequences of premature <italic>CLB3</italic> expression are dramatic. It leads to premature microtubule–kinetochore interactions and prevents coorientation factors from associating with kinetochores. The observation that the transient disruption of microtubule–kinetochore interactions, either by inactivating the outer kinetochore or by microtubule depolymerization, allowed coorientation factors to associate with kinetochores, despite <italic>CLB3</italic> misexpression, led us to conclude that it is premature microtubule–kinetochore interactions that interfere with the establishment of sister kinetochore coorientation during meiosis I. It is currently unclear how preexisting microtubule–kinetochore interactions prevent monopolin association with kinetochores. Precocious attachment of microtubules to kinetochores could occlude the monopolin complex from binding to kinetochores. Alternatively, tension between sister kinetochores generated from stable microtubule–kinetochore interactions could induce a conformational change at the kinetochore and/or pericentric chromatin such that coorientation factors can no longer associate with the kinetochore.</p><p>In addition to preventing sister kinetochore coorientation, premature expression of <italic>CLB3</italic> interferes with protecting centromeric cohesin from removal during meiosis I. The same logic as outlined for coorientation factors applies to the conclusion that it is Clb3-CDK mediated premature microtubule–kinetochore interactions that lead to loss of centromeric cohesin protection in <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells; disrupting microtubule–kinetochore interactions by various means restores stepwise loss of cohesin in <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells. A simple interpretation of this result is that the centromeric-cohesin protective domain can be disrupted by tension between sister kinetochores at any meiotic stage prior to anaphase I. This does not appear to be the case. In cells lacking the coorientation factor <italic>MAM1</italic>, sister kinetochores come under tension in metaphase I, yet in these cells centromeric cohesin is not removed prematurely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Toth et al., 2000</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, the timing of microtubule–kinetochore interactions is of importance. It is tempting to speculate that the establishment of the centromeric-cohesin protective domain, which occurs during prophase I or perhaps even earlier, is sensitive to premature microtubule–kinetochore interactions and/or tension that promote biorientation of sister kinetochores. However, once this domain is established, its maintenance during meiosis I can no longer be disrupted by tension between sister kinetochores.</p><p>How premature microtubule–kinetochore interactions affect the centromeric cohesin protection machinery is not yet known. A defect in localization of the protective machinery to kinetochores does not appear to be the cause of this defect. Sgo1 and PP2A localize normally to kinetochores in <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells. Therefore, lack of cohesin protection upon premature microtubule–kinetochore engagement must either result from a defect in an unknown cohesin protection pathway or from a decrease in the activity of Sgo1 and/or PP2A. Premature association of kinetochores with microtubules could result in the untimely recruitment of a factor (e.g. Clb-CDKs themselves) to the pericentromere that inhibits the cohesin protective machinery. Alternatively, microtubule–kinetochore engagement could directly affect the activity of the protective machinery. Two mechanisms have been previously proposed whereby tension modulates the activity of the cohesin protective machinery. In mammalian cells, tension spatially separates centromeric cohesin from Sgo1-PP2A, perhaps leading to loss of protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). Tension has also been proposed to cause a deformation in PP2A, thus inhibiting its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grinthal et al., 2010</xref>). Irrespective of whether it is tension-dependent perturbation of Sgo1-PP2A and/or recruitment of inhibitory factors, it is clear that premature microtubule–kinetochore engagement is a bona fide modulator of the cohesin protective machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Regulated kinetochore assembly contributes to preventing microtubule–kinetochore interactions</title><p>Cyclin-CDKs regulate multiple aspects of microtubule–kinetochore dynamics.

Metazoan oocytes arrest for an extended period of time in prophase I. Multiple mechanisms keep cyclin-CDK activity low to maintain this arrest (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Von Stetina and Orr-Weaver, 2011</xref>). Similar regulation is observed in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Remarkably, inappropriate activation of <italic>Cyclin A</italic> or cyclin E during prophase I in fruit flies and worms, respectively, results in a mitosis-like division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sugimura and Lilly, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biedermann et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, restricting cyclin-CDK activity during premeiotic S phase and prophase I also appears to be required to establish a meiosis I-specific chromosome architecture in higher eukaryotes.</p><p>Restriction of cyclin-CDK activity during premeiotic S phase and prophase I appears to be the major mechanism preventing premature microtubule–kinetochore interactions, but our data indicate that regulation of outer kinetochore assembly serves as an additional mechanism to prevent this from occurring. <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> can only induce meiosis I sister chromatid segregation when expressed during premeiotic S phase/early prophase I, but fails to do so when expressed during late prophase I. This difference is likely due to the outer kinetochore being present only until early prophase I. When Ndc80, Hsk3 and Clb3 are coexpressed during late prophase I, sister chromatid segregation occurs in meiosis I. This result demonstrates that the presence of Clb3-CDKs alone during late prophase I is not sufficient to cause meiosis I sister chromatid segregation but that outer kinetochore components must also be expressed. Whether outer kinetochore disassembly solely occurs to prevent microtubule kinetochore interactions remains to be determined. Outer kinetochore disassembly could also serve additional purposes during prophase I such as enabling telomere-mediated chromosome movements. Further study of the kinetochore assembly/disassembly cycle during meiosis will provide insights into the full impact of kinetochore regulation on meiotic chromosome segregation.</p><p>In budding yeast, two essential components of the outer kinetochore, Ndc80 and Hsk3, are downregulated during prophase I.

This dissociation depends on the mating pheromone signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asakawa et al., 2005</xref>). Intriguingly, ectopic induction of meiosis without mating pheromone signaling (i.e. in <italic>pat1</italic> mutants), results in segregation of sister chromatids instead of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamamoto and Hiraoka, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamamoto et al., 2004</xref>). Perhaps this change in the pattern of chromosome segregation in <italic>pat1</italic> mutants arises from premature microtubule–kinetochore interactions due to a defect in outer kinetochore disassembly. Interestingly, in mouse oocytes, the Ndc80 complex is recruited to chromosomes only after nuclear envelope breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2011</xref>), raising the possibility that outer kinetochore assembly is also prevented in meiotic prophase I in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Proper segregation of the genome during gametogenesis is critical for the proliferation of sexually reproducing species.

Here, Miller et al. show that this is due to early development of bipolar spindles and present evidence that premature kinetochore-microtubule attachments disrupt normal morphogenesis of kinetochores and pericentric cohesion. That these connections must be at least transiently disrupted to allow development of monopolar kinetochores and in particular a protective cohesin domain formed around the centromeres is an important and new discovery. This is a typical tour de force effort from the Amon lab, with cleverly designed and well-executed experiments and several novel observations. The data are for the most part impeccable. However, the simple message is perhaps lost by emphasis on other points that are either overstated or speculative without careful comment to these issues. Furthermore, certain novelty claims are unwarranted and need rewriting (see point 1). Substantial points that must be addressed in a revision are given below in no particular order with regard to significance.</p><p>1. The paper of Asakawa et al. (MBC 2005) should be discussed earlier and more comprehensively. Presenting this information in the discussion section as it now reads is confusing. This paper demonstrated meiosis-specific disassembly of the outer kinetochore (the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Nif2-Ndc80 complex) and indicated that this is required for reductional segregation at MI. Moreover, Asakawa also showed that this process requires the Pat1 kinase, the Mei2 regulator of meiotic transcript stability, and mating-pheromone signaling. The current study in this regard is an advance in important ways, that this is critical in part for connections, but does not supersede it.</p><p>2. It's surprising that there is no figure at the beginning of the Results showing westerns of CLB overexpression. It is important to see timing and know how the overexpression compares to the levels that normally form in WT. There are such figures for Clb3 later, e.g., in panels of Fig 2B and Fig S2B, but there is no explicit discussion of what's seen with respect to timing or levels, and the other CLBs are not shown. It would be interesting to know if the differences in phenotypes detected for the specific cyclins were because of kinase protein levels or activities? One of the most interesting points developed in the present story was that Clb4 expression was only capable of disrupting SPB but not cohesion – is this specificity or levels?</p><p>3. Most of the data are superb, but the recombination Southern and quantification are not (fig S1E): FigureS1E shows that recombination is not normal in GAL-CLB3 cells - the crossovers form earlier (at least 1 hr and with biphasic kinetics) and at lower levels than seen in wild type. However, the authors claim that recombination is normal when CLB3 is prematurely expressed. This is a contradiction that needs to be addressed. In fact, it is hard to believe that the quantification is accurate since it indicates that products are showing up at high levels already at 3 hr in the GAL-CLB3 strain, even though no products are obvious on the Southern at this time point. Also, it seems a bit odd to include DSBs along with recombinant DNA molecules as “recombination products”.</p><p>4. We are concerned about the physiological relevance of a number of experiments. While the phenomena described here are fascinating, how relevant is the pathology associated with very early, very high expression of Clb3 for understanding wild-type meiosis? This needs some discussion and balance with regard to proof versus speculation. The introduction section does not make a link to how over-expression might be used to learn about the normal process. Further some conclusions remain speculative with the approach and should be stated as such.</p><p>A) For example, with respect to the physiological role of outer-kinetochore disassembly during prophase, the authors' interpretation is that this process is redundant with suppression of cyclins in preventing premature kinetochore-spindle connections. But it seems that prevention of prophase spindle assembly completely overrides any need to disassemble the outer kinetochore; bipolar spindles never form in prophase I (Figure 1).</p><p>B) Moreover, artificial assembly of the outer kinetochore in prophase I (CUP-NDC80 CUP-HSK3) does not influence MI segregation unless CLB3 is also artificially expressed. This is an important paradox that must be addressed. It remains completely unproven whether the physiological role of outer kinetochore disassembly in prophase I is to prevent premature spindle-kinetochore connections. It seems equally possible that SPB-kinetochore connections must be dissociated for normal execution of prophase I events, e.g. telomere-nuclear envelope attachment, chromosome movement, etc.</p><p>5. For most experiments, CUP-CLB3 is induced so early that cells may still be in S phase. FACs analysis for representative time courses should be shown. The induction of Ndt80 expression at 4.5 hrs is also questionably early - has a majority of the culture reached the ndt80 arrest point at 4.5 hrs? The concern is that early, non-physiological expression of Cdc5 is also occurring in these experiments and may actually be required for the observed phenomena. What happens if Ndt80 is expressed later? There isn't a single time-course in this paper to demonstrate when MI occurs in a typical wild-type culture. The time-course in FigureS1E shows that crossovers don't form until 7 hrs making it unlikely that cells were in mid/late pachytene at 4.5 hrs.</p><p>6. Similarly it is an overstatement to write categorically that the work shows two independent mechanisms for timely engagement of the microtubules with the kinetochore. Manipulating the synthesis of the outer kinetochore proteins enhances the Cdk effects, but perhaps this is because the unknown kinase targets are not completely modified? One might suggest that the transcription or translation of the kinetochore proteins is regulated by a repressor whose activity is ablated by Cdk function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00117.057</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1.

It's surprising that there is no figure at the beginning of the Results showing westerns of CLB overexpression. It is important to see timing and know how the overexpression compares to the levels that normally form in WT.

One of the most interesting points developed in the present story was that Clb4 expression was only capable of disrupting SPB but not cohesion – is this specificity or levels</italic>?</p><p>Several points are of importance here. First, Clb3 produced from the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter (and driven by estrogen induction) is expressed at similar levels as endogenous Clb3. This was demonstrated in Carlile and Amon (2008) and is now mentioned in the text. Thus, when Clb3 is driven from the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter the protein is not overexpressed, just prematurely expressed. Expression from the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter results in a 5-fold overexpression compared to the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter. This is now shown in Figure 1B. Importantly, the degree of expression has no effect on the phenotype. The percentage of cells segregating sister chromatids during meiosis I is similar in <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> and <italic>GAL-CLB3</italic> cells (shown in Figure 1C). This result indicates that degree of ectopic expression is irrelevant for the phenotype. The only aspect that matters is <italic>premature</italic> expression. This is now explained in detail in the text.</p><p>The reader may further wonder why we did not use the <italic>GAL-CLB3</italic> construct but instead used the <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> fusion for most of our experiments, if the former only leads to premature expression but the latter to premature expression and overexpression. This is now also explained. Figure 1A shows that estrogen addition during early stages of sporulation interferes with meiotic progression, precluding the analysis of the meiotic products.</p><p>Finally, as requested by the reviewers we have compared protein levels and kinase activity of the various cyclins expressed from the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter. Figure 1D shows that the various Clb cyclins are expressed at similar levels when driven from the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter. Figure 1F shows that there is no correlation between the amount of kinase activity produced by the various cyclins expressed from the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter and the ability to induce sister chromatid segregation during meiosis I. Thus cyclin specificity, not quantity, is responsible for the differences in phenotype.</p><p><italic>3. Most of the data are superb, but the recombination Southern and quantification are not (fig S1E): FigureS1E shows that recombination is not normal in GAL-CLB3 cells - the crossovers form earlier (at least 1 hr and with biphasic kinetics) and at lower levels than seen in wild type. However, the authors claim that recombination is normal when CLB3 is prematurely expressed. This is a contradiction that needs to be addressed. In fact, it is hard to believe that the quantification is accurate since it indicates that products are showing up at high levels already at 3 hr in the GAL-CLB3 strain, even though no products are obvious on the Southern at this time point. Also, it seems a bit odd to include DSBs along with recombinant DNA molecules as “recombination products”</italic>.</p><p>We re-quantified the recombination products by taking the ratio of R2 over P1. The new graph displayed in Figure 2 – Figure Supplement 5 shows no significant impact of prematurely expressed <italic>CLB3</italic> on recombination.</p><p><italic>4. We are concerned about the physiological relevance of a number of experiments. While the phenomena described here are fascinating, how relevant is the pathology associated with very early, very high expression of Clb3 for understanding wild-type meiosis? This needs some discussion and balance with regard to proof versus speculation. The introduction section does not make a link to how over-expression might be used to learn about the normal process. Further some conclusions remain speculative with the approach and should be stated as such</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are concerned that our analyses solely rely on experiments that overexpress <italic>CLB</italic>s and that the “pathology” described here has no bearing on the effects of <italic>CLB</italic>s in wild-type meiosis. We fundamentally disagree with this assessment.</p><p>First, as described in Carlile and Amon (2008) and now explicitly mentioned in the revised manuscript, expression of <italic>CLB3</italic> from the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter does not lead to non-physiological levels of Clb3. The levels produced from the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter during meiosis I are the same as observed in wild-type cells during meiosis II. More importantly, Figure 1C shows that amount of premature Clb3 expression does not impact the phenotype. The degree of meiosis I sister chromatid segregation is similar in <italic>GAL-CLB3</italic> and <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> cells. This is discussed extensively in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Second, one must ask whether there is a method other than expressing <italic>CLB3</italic> from a heterologous promoter to determine why so many mechanisms, namely transcriptional and translational inhibition, are in place to keep Clb3-CDKs low during meiosis I. To our knowledge, expression from a heterologous promoter is the only way to effectively override such control mechanisms and examine the consequences of loss of these controls.</p><p><italic>A) For example, with respect to the physiological role of outer-kinetochore disassembly during prophase, the authors' interpretation is that this process is redundant with suppression of cyclins in preventing premature kinetochore-spindle connections. But it seems that prevention of prophase spindle assembly completely overrides any need to disassemble the outer kinetochore; bipolar spindles never form in prophase I (Figure 1)</italic>.</p><p>Of course, without a spindle chromosomes cannot segregate. As spindle formation is a prerequisite for the observed phenotype, Clb-CDK expression is an absolute must. However three observations indicate that both, a cyclin-CDK induced bipolar spindle and a functional kinetochore must be present during prophase I in order to cause premature microtubule-kinetochore interactions that ultimately result in meiosis I chromosome segregation defects.</p><p>First, <italic>CLB3</italic>-induced meiosis I chromosome segregation defects are completely dependent on a functional kinetochore during prophase I (Figure 5 and Figure 5 – Figure Supplement 5). Second, whereas early <italic>CLB3</italic> misexpression causes defects in meiosis I chromosome segregation, <italic>CLB3</italic> misexpression during late prophase I has no effect on chromosome segregation (Figure 6A). This difference is likely due to the outer kinetochore being present during premeiotic S phase and early prophase I but not late prophase I (Figure 6E). Most importantly, during late prophase I, only both, <italic>CLB3</italic> and outer kinetochore component expression, are able to induce meiosis I sister chromatid segregation (Figure 8G, Figure 9). This result demonstrates that the presence of cyclin alone during late prophase I is not sufficient to cause sister chromatid segregation during meiosis I, and that both pathways must be repressed during prophase I to establish the meiosis I-specific chromosome segregation pattern.</p><p>These arguments have been added to the discussion to ensure that the reader understands the contribution of Clb-CDK induced premature spindle formation and outer kinetochore assembly to the observed phenotype.</p><p><italic>B) Moreover, artificial assembly of the outer kinetochore in prophase I (CUP-NDC80 CUP-HSK3) does not influence MI segregation unless CLB3 is also artificially expressed. This is an important paradox that must be addressed</italic>.</p><p>Ectopic expression of Ndc80 and Hsk3 alone does not affect meiosis I chromosome segregation, but neither does <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> when expressed only during late prophase I. The only point we are trying to make here is that in addition to formation of the spindle early in prophase I, a functional kinetochore must be present to observe a phenotype. Our data clearly show that outer kinetochores are disassembled during prophase I and that this disassembly precludes <italic>CUP-CLB3</italic> from interfering with meiosis I chromosome segregation. As mentioned above, we extended the discussion of these points to make this conclusion clearer.</p><p><italic>It remains completely unproven whether the physiological role of outer kinetochore disassembly in prophase I is to prevent premature spindle-kinetochore connections. It seems equally possible that SPB-kinetochore connections must be dissociated for normal execution of prophase I events, e.g. telomere-nuclear envelope attachment, chromosome movement, etc</italic>.</p><p>It is entirely possible that disassembly of the outer kinetochore serves additional purposes. This possibility is now mentioned in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>5. For most experiments, CUP-CLB3 is induced so early that cells may still be in S phase. FACs analysis for representative time courses should be shown. The induction of Ndt80 expression at 4.5 hrs is also questionably early - has a majority of the culture reached the ndt80 arrest point at 4.5 hrs? The concern is that early, non-physiological expression of Cdc5 is also occurring in these experiments and may actually be required for the observed phenomena. What happens if Ndt80 is expressed later? There isn't a single time-course in this paper to demonstrate when MI occurs in a typical wild-type culture. The time-course in FigureS1E shows that crossovers don't form until 7 hrs making it unlikely that cells were in mid/late pachytene at 4.5 hrs</italic>.</p><p>New Figure 1E shows progression of wild-type cells through sporulation. By 2:15 hours, 43.2 percent of cells have replicated their DNA, by 4.5 hours all cells are in G2. Using very similar conditions a recent publication by Blitzblau et al. (PLOS Genetics 2012) has reported even faster kinetics with bulk DNA replication being completed by 3 hours. Sporulation kinetics vary significantly between experiments and in earlier experiments we observed divisions as early as 4 hrs in an unperturbed meiosis. These fast kinetics are most likely due to the fact that most of the strains we used for these studies were prototrophs. It should also be noted that the strains used in old Figure S1E (new Figure 2 – Figure Supplement 5) are not prototrophic which results in slower meiotic kinetics. However the reviewers are correct in that not all cells have replicated their DNA yet by 2:15 hours. Thus we modified the text to indicate that the bulk of cells are in S phase or early prophase I.</p><p>The reviewers were also concerned that premature expression of <italic>NDT80</italic> and its target <italic>CDC5</italic>, 4.5 hours after transfer into sporulation medium could contribute to the observed phenotypes. We have addressed this concern by examining chromosome segregation when <italic>NDT80</italic> was expressed substantially later, 6, 7 or 8 hours after induction of sporulation. At these times all cells had arrested in pachytene as judged by FACS analysis. The data in new Figure 9 show that concomitant expression of <italic>NDT80</italic> from the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter and <italic>CLB3</italic>, <italic>NDC80</italic> and <italic>HSK3</italic> from the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter after 6, 7, or 8 hours in sporulation medium leads to a similar phenotype as expression of the genes after 4.5 hours in sporulation medium. Thus, expression of <italic>NDT80</italic> early during meiosis, 4.5 hours after transfer into sporulation medium, is not responsible for the observed phenotypes. Furthermore, meiosis I sister chromatid segregation is also seen in cells lacking the <italic>NDT80</italic> block release system (Carlile and Amon, 2008, Figure 1C).</p><p><italic>6. Similarly it is an overstatement to write categorically that the work shows two independent mechanisms for timely engagement of the microtubules with the kinetochore. Manipulating the synthesis of the outer kinetochore proteins enhances the Cdk effects, but perhaps this is because the unknown kinase targets are not completely modified? One might suggest that the transcription or translation of the kinetochore proteins is regulated by a repressor whose activity is ablated by Cdk function</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers’ assessment is only accurate when Clb3-CDKs are expressed during premeiotic S phase/early prophase I. As mentioned above, when the outer kinetochore is fully disassembled, by late prophase I, Clb3-CDK misexpression alone is insufficient to cause MI sister chromatid segregation (Figure 6A, 8G, and Figure 9).</p><p>A scenario where outer kinetochore assembly is under Clb-CDK control is possible, but unlikely. Such a mechanism is not expected to be sensitive to when Clb3-CDKs are expressed during prophase I.</p></body></sub-article></article>
