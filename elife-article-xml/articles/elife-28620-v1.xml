heterochromatic chromatin domains that sequester the OR gene clusters. Within these domains, intergenic transcriptional enhancers evade heterochromatic silencing and converge into interchromosomal hubs that assemble over the transcriptionally active OR. The significance of this nuclear organization in OR choice remains elusive. Here, we show that transcription factors Lhx2 and Ebf specify OR enhancers by binding in a functionally cooperative fashion to stereotypically spaced motifs that defy heterochromatin. Specific displacement of Lhx2 and Ebf from OR enhancers resulted in pervasive, long-range, and <italic>trans</italic> downregulation of OR transcription, whereas pre-assembly of a multi-enhancer hub increased the frequency of OR choice in cis. Our data provide genetic support for the requirement and sufficiency of interchromosomal interactions in singular OR choice and generate general regulatory principles for stochastic, mutually exclusive gene expression programs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>enhancers</kwd><kwd>olfactory receptors</kwd><kwd>promoters</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM108474</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monahan</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lomvardas</surname><given-names>Stavros</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lomvardas</surname><given-names>Stavros</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical and genetic experiments show that Ebf and Lhx2 cooperate to specify olfactory receptor enhancers, which cooperate to drive olfactory receptor expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian main olfactory epithelium (MOE) provides an extreme example of cellular diversity orchestrated by the seemingly stochastic, monogenic, and monoallelic expression of a single olfactory receptor (OR) gene. Each mature olfactory sensory neuron (mOSN) in the MOE expresses only one OR that is chosen from a pool of more than two thousand alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buck and Axel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chess et al., 1994</xref>). The basis of the regulation of OR gene expression is chromatin-mediated transcriptional silencing followed by the stochastic de-repression and, thereby, transcriptional activation of a single OR allele that prevents the de-repression of additional OR genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dalton and Lomvardas, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Monahan and Lomvardas, 2015</xref>). OR gene clusters are assembled into constitutive heterochromatin at early stages of OSN differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Magklara et al., 2011</xref>), a process that represses OR transcription and preserves the monogenic and stochastic nature of OR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lyons et al., 2014</xref>). Heterochromatic silencing is reinforced by the interchromosomal convergence of OR loci to OSN-specific, highly compacted nuclear bodies that assure complete transcriptional silencing of ORs in mOSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clowney et al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, OR gene activation requires de-silencing by lysine demethylase Lsd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lyons et al., 2013</xref>) and spatial segregation of the single chosen OR allele towards euchromatic nuclear territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armelin-Correa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clowney et al., 2012</xref>). Translation of the newly transcribed OR mRNA activates a co-opted arm of the unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalton et al., 2013</xref>) and induces a feedback signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lewcock and Reed, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Serizawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shykind et al., 2004</xref>) that turns off <italic>Lsd1</italic>, preventing the de-silencing and activation of additional OR genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lyons et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the context of this repressive chromatin environment, OR gene choice requires the action of intergenic enhancers that escape heterochromatic silencing and activate the transcription of their proximal ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Khan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Markenscoff-Papadimitriou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Serizawa et al., 2003</xref>). These euchromatic enhancer âislandsâ, which we named after Greek Islands, engage in interchromosomal interactions with each other, and with the transcriptionally active OR allele, forming a multi-enhancer hub for OR transcription outside of the repressive OR foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clowney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lomvardas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Markenscoff-Papadimitriou et al., 2014</xref>). The convergence of multiple Greek Islands to the chosen OR allele suggests that strong, feedback-eliciting OR gene transcription may be achieved only in the context of a multi-enhancer hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Markenscoff-Papadimitriou et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, the molecular mechanisms that specify Greek Islands in the context of OR heterochromatin and, thus, enable their elaborate interactions during OSN differentiation remain unknown.</p><p>Here, we present a detailed molecular characterization of the Greek Islands, which revealed a common genetic signature and occupancy by shared sequence-specific transcription factors, allowing us, for the first time, to incapacitate them as a whole. ChIP-seq studies of FAC-sorted mOSNs revealed that most of the previously characterized Greek Islands, and several newly identified islands, are bound by two transcription factors: Lhx2 and Ebf. Computational analysis of the co-bound ChIP-seq peaks from Greek Islands revealed stereotypically positioned Lhx2 and Ebf binding sites that together constitute a âcompositeâ binding motif that affords cooperative binding in vivo. This motif is highly enriched in Greek Islands relative to OR promoters and Lhx2/Ebf co-bound sites genome-wide. Considering the prevalence and specificity of this composite motif in Greek Islands, we designed a synthetic âfusionâ protein that binds to this consensus sequence and not to individual Lhx2 or Ebf motifs in vitro. We found that overexpression of this fusion protein in mOSNs eliminated chromatin accessibility at most Greek Islands, and resulted in strong transcriptional downregulation of every OR, regardless of their genomic distance, or even their chromosomal linkage to a Greek Island. Finally, partial pre-assembly of a Greek Island hub in cis, by insertion of an array of 5 Greek Islands next to the Greek Island Rhodes, significantly increased the frequency of expression of Rhodes-linked OR genes. These manipulations provide genetic support for the requirement of <italic>trans</italic> enhancement in OR gene expression, and are consistent with the sufficiency of a multi-enhancer hub formation for OR gene choice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Greek Islands are co-bound by Lhx2 and EBF</title><p>Greek Islands share a characteristic chromatin modification signature and in vivo footprints for transcription factors Lhx2 and Ebf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Markenscoff-Papadimitriou et al., 2014</xref>). To test the predicted binding of Lhx2 and Ebf, we performed ChIP-seq experiments using crosslinked chromatin prepared from FAC-sorted mOSNs, the neuronal population that stably expresses ORs in a singular fashion. To isolate mOSNs we FAC-sorted GFP<sup>+</sup> cells from the MOEs of <italic>Omp-IRES-GFP</italic> knock-in mice, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Magklara et al., 2011</xref>). The Ebf antibody we used for these experiments cross-reacts with all 4 Ebf proteins, Ebf1-4, (data not shown), which are all highly expressed in the MOE. Because of the genetic redundancy of the Ebf genes in the MOE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), and because the 4 Ebf members form homo- and hetero-dimers with identical sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 1997</xref>), we did not attempt to further distinguish between the 4 paralogues. For Lhx2 ChIP-seq studies we used a custom-made antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Roberson et al., 2001</xref>). The specificity of these antibodies is supported by motif analysis of the Lhx2 and Ebf ChIP-seq experiments, which revealed that the Lhx2 and Ebf binding sites are the most highly enriched motifs respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Genome-wide, we identified 9024 peaks for Ebf and 16,311 Lhx2 peaks, with 4792 peaks being co-bound by both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Despite the in vivo recognition of an essentially identical motif in pro/pre-B cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">GyÃ¶ry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Treiber et al., 2010b</xref>), where Ebf acts as master regulator of B-cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mandel and Grosschedl, 2010</xref>), there is little overlap between the genome-wide binding of Ebf in mOSNs and B-cell progenitors (data not shown). Genes proximal to Lhx2 and Ebf co-bound sites in mOSNs are statistically enriched for functions related to olfactory transduction and axonogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with a combinatorial role of these transcription factors in OSN differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hirota and Mombaerts, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 1997</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28620.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Greek Islands represent Lhx2 and Ebf co-bound regions residing in heterochromatic OR clusters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The top sequence motif identified for mOSN ChIP-seq peaks is shown above sequence motifs generated from previously reported Lhx2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Folgueras et al., 2013</xref>) and Ebf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2010</xref>) ChIP-seq data sets. mOSN ChIP-seq peaks were identified using HOMER and motif analysis was run on peaks present in both biological replicates.

Specifically, there are 63 peaks that are co-bound by both Lhx2 and Ebf, 2 Ebf-only, and 51 Lhx2-only peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) in theÂ ~36 MB of OR clusters, a significantly higher rate of overlap than the rate observed genome-wide (p=1.5e<sup>â15</sup> and p=5.7e<sup>â9</sup>, respectively, Binomial test). Notably, most Ebf and Lhx2 co-bound sites in OR clusters have much stronger ChIP signal than singly bound sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Several of these co-bound sites within OR clusters are among the regions of highest ChIP-seq signal in the genome, suggesting that they are bound in a large fraction of mOSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2BâC</xref>), whereas individually bound peaks barely pass our peak-calling threshold. Co-bound sites within OR clusters coincide with 21 of the 35 previously characterized Greek Islands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For example, visual inspection of three Greek Islands, <italic>Crete</italic>, <italic>Sfaktiria</italic> and <italic>Lipsi</italic>, revealed strong Lhx2 and Ebf binding despite the high levels of flanking H3K9me3 on these OR clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). ATAC-seq analysis in the same cellular population revealed increased chromatin accessibility at the exact genomic location of the Lhx2 and Ebf ChIP-seq peaks, but very little accessibility across the rest of the OR cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Each of these sites also exhibits a reduction of the heterochromatic modifications, H3K9me3 and H3K79me3, over the body of the element, and locally increased levels of the active enhancer mark H3K7ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). Overall, this chromatin signature is shared by the full set of Ebf and Lhx2 co-bound sites within OR gene clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B</xref>). Thus, Lhx2/Ebf co-bound sites that do not correspond to the original Greek Islands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) likely represent additional, less frequently active Islands that were only detected here due to the increased sensitivity of our mOSN-specific analysis (<italic>Anafi</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref> for comparison between old and new Islands). In contrast, Greek Islands from the original set that lack Ebf and Lhx2 binding in mOSNs also deviate from the characteristic âepigeneticâ signature obtained from whole MOE experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Thus, these sites are likely to be functionally distinct or active in a different population of cells within the MOE, and are not included within our revised set of Greek Islands.</p><p>OR gene promoters are also significantly enriched for predicted Lhx2 and Ebf binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clowney et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Michaloski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Plessy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Young et al., 2011</xref>), and mutations of individual Ebf and Lhx2 sites have been shown to reduce OR expression in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rothman et al., 2005</xref>). However, as a whole, OR gene promoters are inaccessible and not bound by these transcription factors in mOSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Specifically, only 10 OR promoters show significant binding of Ebf and Lhx2 within 500 bp of the TSS.

Very few Greek Islands display significantly different accessibility in the three OSN populations when compared to mOSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), and most fluctuations represent small but uniform shifts in Greek Island accessibility.

Recent observations suggested that the relative positioning of DNA binding motifs compensates for the fluctuation of individual nucleotides in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farley et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, the positioning of transcription factors on the face of the DNA double helix, as determined by the spacing between transcription factor binding sites, is more important than the relative strength of individual binding sites for the assembly of the <italic>IFN beta</italic> enhanceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Merika et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thanos and Maniatis, 1995</xref>). Thus, we asked if composite motifs with lower scores, which, predominantly, have degenerate Ebf motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), still meet these stereotypic constraints. Indeed, despite increased fluctuation in the nucleotide level, the stereotypic distribution between purines and pyrimidines is retained in composites with score above 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref> bottom panel), with a new total of 55 out of 63 Greek Islands having a composite motif under this less stringent cutoff. Moreover, of the 28 Greek Islands that lack a strong composite, 20 have an Ebf site that is juxtaposed to an Lhx2 site. The distance between Ebf and Lhx2 sites in these Greek Islands is significantly shorter than the distance between Ebf and Lhx2 sites in OR promoters and in co-bound peaks outside of OR gene clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In total, 61/63 islands contain a composite motif and/or very proximal Lhx2 and Ebf binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Thus, although Lhx2 and Ebf frequently bind at the same genomic targets genome-wide, their binding on Greek Islands is restricted to stereotypically proximal Lhx2 and Ebf motifs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Lhx2 is essential for Ebf binding on Greek Islands</title><p>An immediate prediction of our computational analyses is that Lhx2 and Ebf bind cooperatively to composite DNA binding motifs. In addition, Lhx2 and Ebf binding to these stereotypically spaced motifs may result in synergistic recruitment of coactivators that cannot be recruited by the individually bound proteins. In either case of functional cooperativity, deletion of either Lhx2 or Ebf should abolish the binding of the other transcription factor on Greek Islands. To test this we deleted <italic>Lhx2</italic> from mOSNs, using a conditional <italic>Lhx2</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mangale et al., 2008</xref>) that we crossed to <italic>Omp-IRES-Cre</italic> mice.

Furthermore, upon <italic>Lhx2</italic> deletion the Lhx2 ChIP-seq signal is depleted genome-wide and from the Greek Islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Importantly, deletion of <italic>Lhx2</italic> in mOSNs, results in loss of Ebf binding from Lipsi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and from nearly all other Greek Islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). ATAC-seq on the <italic>Lhx2</italic> KO OSNs also shows strong reduction of ATAC-peaks from Greek Islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting that Lhx2 and Ebf co-binding on Greek Islands is essential for their sustained accessibility in this heterochromatic environment.

We reasoned that if we could fuse Lhx2 and Ebf DNA binding domains (DBD) at a proper distance, we could generate a DNA binding peptide that has high affinity for the composite but not for individual motifs. Because the DNA binding specificity of homeobox genes is low and is influenced by their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Passner et al., 1999</xref>), the Lhx2 DBD could be easily incorporated in this design. Ebf, however, has high affinity and specificity for its cognate palindromic motif, where it binds as a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hagman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Travis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang and Reed, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 1997</xref>). Crystal structure of an Ebf1 homodimer bound to DNA revealed that each DBD monomer contacts both halves of the palindromic motif and forms a clamp-like structure that likely stabilizes DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Treiber et al., 2010a</xref>). Thus, in order to reduce Ebf affinity for DNA without affecting its sequence specificity, we fused only one Ebf DBD to the Lhx2 DBD with various flexible linkers. Fusion of the two DNA binding domains with a 20aa protein linker generated a protein with affinity for the composite motif but not for individual Lhx2 and Ebf sites in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Competition experiments demonstrate that only unlabeled oligos containing the composite, and not individual Lhx2 or Ebf motifs, can compete off the binding of the fusion protein to the composite motif at up to 100x molar excess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Remarkably, insertion of only 2 DNA bases between the Lhx2 and the Ebf binding sites on the composite motif impairs its ability to compete with the wild type composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Further increase of the distance between the two sites essentially eliminates any competitive advantage the composite motif had over the individual Lhx2 and Ebf sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, the fusion of the Lhx2 DBD to a single Ebf DBD creates a novel DNA binding protein that recognizes the composite motif with sensitivity to the stereotypical distance of the two individual DNA binding sites.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28620.035</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Displacement of Lhx2 and Ebf from Greek Islands shuts off OR transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) for binding of in vitro translated protein to DNA probes containing either an Ebf site, an Lhx2 site, or a composite site.

This transgene includes a bi-cistronic mCherry reporter using the 2A peptide(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), which allows isolation of the transgene-expressing OSNs by FACS. We analyzed two independent founders, which we crossed to <italic>Omp-IRES-tTA</italic> knock-in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gogos et al., 2000</xref>), to obtain expression of the fusion protein specifically in mOSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). We hypothesized that the fusion protein will compete with endogenous Lhx2 and Ebf for binding on composite motifs, acting as a repressor of the Greek Islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Indeed, ATAC-seq analysis shows strong reduction of ATAC-seq signal from the Greek Islands upon expression of the fusion protein in mOSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>), suggesting the displacement of the heterochromatin-resisting transcription factors from OR enhancers. Unfortunately, both the Lhx2 and the Ebf antibodies we used in our ChIP-seq experiments cross-react with the DBD domains of the fusion protein (data not shown), thus we could not confirm by ChIP-seq their displacement from the Greek Islands. However, RNA-seq analysis of the FAC-sorted mCherry+Â cells revealed significant reduction of OR transcription as a whole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,G</xref>). Although the repressing effect of the fusion protein does not extend to non-OR genes residing outside of OR clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), it has a ubiquitous repressive effect on OR transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In fact, of the 500 most significantly downregulated genes 482 are ORs (p&lt;1e-313, hypergeometric test). In agreement with this, genome-wide analysis shows that while ORs are homogeneously repressed by the fusion protein, genes containing Ebf-, Lhx2-, or Ebf and Lhx2-bound promoters are, on average, transcriptionally unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>). Consistently, the effects of fusion protein overexpression on the ATAC signal of promoters bound by Lhx2 and/or Ebf are much weaker than the effects on Greek Islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, it is worth noting that similarly to the effects of the Lhx2 deletion, the repressive effects of the fusion protein on OR transcription does not depend on the presence of Ebf and Lhx2 motifs on OR promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>), supporting the Greek Island-mediated repressive effects of the fusion protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Multi-enhancer hubs activate OR transcription</title><p>The widespread downregulation of OR gene expression detected in <italic>Lhx2</italic> KO and fusion protein expressing mOSNs suggests that the effects of Greek Island inhibition extend over large genomic distances, or even across chromosomes.

To test this prediction, we introduced, by homologous recombination, an array of 5 Greek Islands (<italic>Lipsi, Sfaktiria, Crete, H and Rhodes</italic>, hereafter termed <italic>LSCHR</italic>) next to the endogenous <italic>Rhodes</italic>, a Greek Island from chromosome 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

We chose Rhodes for this manipulation for two reasons: First, the ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq signals on <italic>Rhodes</italic> are among the strongest between the 63 Greek Islands, which combined with the almost complete H3K9me3 local depletion suggest that it is accessible and bound by Lhx2 and Ebf in the majority of mOSNs. Thus, any transcriptional changes observed by this manipulation would not be attributed to increased Lhx2 and Ebf binding on this locus. Second, there are no additional Greek Islands within a genomic distance of over 80 MB on chromosome 1, thus formation of a Greek Island hub over this cluster requires recruitment of unlinked OR enhancers. We, therefore, reasoned that Rhodes-proximal ORs would be more responsive to the insertion of additional enhancers next to their local Greek Island, than ORs residing on chromosomes with multiple Greek Islands.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28620.053</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Multi-enhancer hubs activate OR transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Targeted insertion of 5 Greek Islands (<italic>LSCHR</italic>) adjacent to <italic>Rhodes</italic>.

Various studies suggest that the majority of genomic interactions are restricted within topologically associated domains (TADs) that show little variation between different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). Specific genomic interactions between TADs are infrequent, and interactions between different chromosomes are even less prominent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). However, in certain biological contexts, specific interchromosomal interactions are readily detected by imaging and genomic approaches, or have been inferred genetically. For example, during X chromosome inactivation, there is a âchromosome kissingâ step that occurs just before one of the two chromosomes is inactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bacher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Masui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). During T and B cell differentiation interchromosomal interactions regulate antigen receptor choice and cellular differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hewitt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Spilianakis et al., 2005</xref>). The stochastic induction of the human <italic>IFN beta</italic> gene by virus infection requires the formation of interchromosomal interactions between the <italic>IFN beta</italic> enhancer and NF-kappa B-bound Alu repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apostolou and Thanos, 2008</xref>). Finally, stochastic photoreceptor choice in drosophila omatidia is determined by DNA elements that, genetically, appear to communicate in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnston and Desplan, 2014</xref>). Thus, although interchromosomal interactions may not be involved in gene regulation in most cell types, their stochastic and infrequent nature may be ideal for the execution of non-deterministic, and mutually exclusive regulatory processes like OR gene choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dekker and Mirny, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The involvement of interchromosomal interactions in OR gene choice was first postulated by the demonstration that the prototypical OR enhancer, the <italic>H</italic> enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Serizawa et al., 2003</xref>), interacts in trans with transcriptionally active ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lomvardas et al., 2006</xref>). The significance of these interactions was questioned as deletion of the H enhancer affected the expression of only three proximal ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fuss et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nishizumi et al., 2007</xref>). Subsequently, however, additional OR enhancers, the Greek Islands, were discovered to a current total of 63 elements. The striking similarities between these elements in regards of the transcription factors that bind to them, combined with the demonstration that Greek Islands form a complex network of interchromosomal interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Markenscoff-Papadimitriou et al., 2014</xref>), suggested that extensive functional redundancy may mask the effects of single or even double (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Khan et al., 2011</xref>) enhancer deletions in trans. The non-redundant role of Greek Islands for the expression of certain ORs in cis may be attributed to the inability of some OR promoters to recruit enhancers from other chromosomes, making them completely dependent on the presence of a proximal enhancer for this function. In other words, even if <italic>trans</italic> enhancement is required for the activation of every OR gene, a fraction of them may depend on the assistance of a local Island for the recruitment of <italic>trans</italic> enhancers. Such qualitative promoter differences are consistent with the observation that enhancer deletions affect only some ORs in a cluster, and by the fact that certain ORs can be expressed as transgenic minigenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vassalli et al., 2002</xref>), while others can be expressed as transgenes only in the presence of an enhancer in cis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Serizawa et al., 2003</xref>). The proposed redundant function of Greek Islands as <italic>trans</italic> enhancers may have facilitated the rapid evolution of this gene family, which expanded dramatically during the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Niimura and Nei, 2007</xref>). Activation of OR transcription by Greek Islands in trans allows the functional expression of newly evolved OR alleles in mOSNs, without a requirement for physical linkage to an enhancer- a property fully compatible with gene expansion through retrotransposition, segmental duplication, and chromosomal translocation. Thus, OR gene activation through non-deterministic genomic interactions in trans may provide a mechanism that âshuffles the deckâ and assures that a newly evolved OR allele will be expressed at a frequency similar to that of the existing OR repertoire.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Global and <italic>trans</italic> action of OR enhancers</title><p>A correlation between the formation of interchromosomal Greek Island hubs and OR transcription was previously established by ectopic expression of Lamin b receptor (Lbr) in mOSNs, and by conditional deletion of transcriptional co-activator Bptf, either of which caused reduction of Greek Island interactions in trans and pervasive OR downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clowney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Markenscoff-Papadimitriou et al., 2014</xref>). However, these manipulations have more general consequences that extend beyond the regulation of Greek Island interaction. For example, ectopic Lbr expression in mOSNs caused a general rearrangement of nuclear topology and disrupted the aggregation of OR clusters, making difficult to distinguish between the effects on interchromosomal OR clustering and interchromosomal Greek Island interactions. Deletion of <italic>Bptf</italic> on the other hand, although it only disrupted interchromosomal associations between Greek Islands, also caused a developmental arrest in the OSNs that may, or may not, be related to the failure to activate OR expression.</p><p>To minimize indirect effects that may confound the interpretation of these manipulations, we targeted a common and highly specific genetic signature among Greek Islands, the composite motif. This DNA sequence constitutes a remarkable example of highly constrained and stereotypically distributed transcription factor binding motifs that is shared between most Greek Islands, and is highly enriched relative to OR promoters and co-bound sites genome-wide. Overexpression of a âsyntheticâ fusion protein that specifically recognizes the composite motif eliminated ATAC-seq signal from Greek Islands in mOSNs, suggesting that it displaced the endogenous Lhx2 and Ebf proteins on most OR enhancers. Similar observations were made for the conditional Lhx2 deletion, which also reduced the chromatin accessibility of Greek Islands and abolished Ebf binding from these elements. The strong and specific downregulation of the OR transcriptome in both <italic>Lhx2</italic> knock out and in fusion protein expressing mOSNs, clearly reveals the critical and ubiquitous role of the Greek Islands as key regulators of OR expression. The fact that these transcriptional effects extend to ORs that have neither a Greek Island in cis nor Lhx2/Ebf motifs on their promoters, is consistent with the role of Greek Islands as <italic>trans</italic> OR gene enhancers. However, it should be noted that we cannot exclude alternative interpretations of our data. For example, it is possible that there are additional intergenic OR enhancers with <italic>bona fide</italic> composite sites that are only utilized in neurons that express specific OR genes. Although our analysis in the 3 purified OSN populations expressing ORs Olfr1507, Olfr17 and Olfr171 does not support the existence of OR-specific Greek Islands, we cannot exclude the possibility that Greek Islands with such restricted activity exist in other OSN sub-populations. Furthermore, although our ATAC-seq analysis suggests that fusion protein overexpression affects predominantly Greek Islands, indirect effects on OR transcription cannot be excluded. Taking all these caveats into account, the fact that distinct genetic manipulations that target the Greek Islands, and their genomic interactions, cause widespread downregulation of OR expression, provides strong genetic support for the requirement of interchromosomal interactions in OR gene choice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Same transcription factors different chromatin states</title><p>The experimental demonstration that every Greek Island is co-bound by Lhx2 and Ebf, the same transcription factors predicted to bind on most OR promoters, is unexpected because of the fundamentally different chromatin states of the two types of regulatory elements in mOSNs. OR promoters are inaccessible in the mixed mOSN population, and only upon FAC-sorting cells that express the same OR, could we obtain evidence for OR promoter accessibility. In contrast, the enhancers of OR genes appear accessible and bound by Lhx2 and Ebf in a large fraction of mOSNs. The stereotypically proximal positioning of Lxh2 and Ebf motifs on OR enhancers emerged as the key determinant for these differences, since the functionally cooperative binding of Lhx2 and Ebf on proximal motifs in vivo appears to counteract the propagating properties of the surrounding heterochromatin. Notably, cooperative binding between âphasedâ Lhx2 motifs was recently proposed as an explanation for the increased frequency of expression of OR transgenes under the control of an artificial promoter(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Hulst et al., 2016</xref>), although in this case the local chromatin state is not known. Interestingly, the composite Lhx2/Ebf motif that we identified on Greek Islands is structurally very similar to the numerous heterodimeric motifs identified by an in vitro screen for sequences that are co-bound by a variety of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jolma et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the solution that was adopted by intergenic OR enhancers to generate heterochromatin-resistant binding sites, may be generally utilized by other transcription factors in a variety of genomic contexts and regulatory needs. In support of this, the striking stereotypy of Lhx2 and Ebf motifs in Greek Islands, also known as ârigid motif grammarâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Long et al., 2016</xref>), is reminiscent of the constraint spacing of transcription factor binding sites in the <italic>IFN beta</italic> enhanceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Panne et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thanos and Maniatis, 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A multi-enhancer hub for robust and singular OR expression</title><p>The concept that Greek Islands may have stronger affinity for Lhx2 and Ebf than OR promoters, immediately provides a molecular solution for the need of a multi-enhancer hub for stable and robust OR transcription. In the event that an OR promoter becomes de-silenced and occupied by Lhx2 and Ebf, singular or weak binding by these transcription factors will be unstable, due to the competing forces of flanking heterochromatin. However, if an OR promoter is surrounded by multiple strong sites of cooperative binding, like the ones we detect in high frequency on the Greek Islands, then every time Lhx2 and Ebf fall off an OR promoter they will be sequestered by local, high affinity sites, which may also act as a replenishing source for these transcription factors. In other words, inter-chromosomal Greek island hubs may create local regions of high Lhx2 and Ebf concentration that is essential for continuous binding on the low affinity sites of a chosen OR promoter and high transcription rates.</p><p>Thus, we propose a model whereby the deployment of multiple, individually weak components that function in a coordinated and hierarchical fashion to activate OR transcription. According to this model, first, cooperative interactions between Lhx2 and Ebf result in stable binding to Greek Islands, which prevents flanking heterochromatin from spreading and silencing these intergenic elements. Because composite motifs are specifically enriched on Greek Islands similar cooperative interactions between Lhx2 and Ebf cannot protect OR promoters from heterochromatic silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Second, cooperative interactions between Greek Islands assemble numerous Lhx2 and Ebf elements into a multi-chromosomal enhancer hub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). When this hub forms stable interactions with a stochastically chosen OR allele in trans, then heterochromatin is displaced, and cooperative enhancer-promoter interactions mediate stable Lhx2 and Ebf binding on the promoter, and therefore, transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). These cooperative interactions may be direct, homotypic interactions between Lhx2 and Ebf or facilitated by coactivator or mediator proteins that are recruited by these transcription factors. In either scenario, the same fundamental principles of cooperativity and synergy that govern the genetic switch between lysis and lysogeny in the lambda bacteriophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ptashne, 2009</xref>), and promote the formation and function of the human <italic>IFN beta</italic> enhanceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thanos and Maniatis, 1995</xref>), may also regulate the formation of a 3-dimensional enhanceosome responsible for OR gene choice.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28620.055</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A Hierarchical Model for OR gene choice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lhx2 and Ebf bind in a functionally cooperative fashion on the composite motifs of the Greek Islands.

It also may explain why 63 OR genes, one for each Greek Island, are not simultaneously expressed in each mOSN: if numerous enhancers must cooperate for OR transcription, individual promoters, and even individual enhancer-promoter combinations, may not be sufficient for OR transcription. But what prevents the formation of numerous multi-enhancer hubs, which could then activate more than one OR allele at a time? The answer to this critical question may be found in the transcriptional phenotype of the Rhodes knock-in mice, whereby 6 Greek Islands reside in tandem. In these mice, we detect a significant increase in the frequency of OR choice, that is not caused by increased occupancy by Lhx2. Thus, the increase frequency of local OR choice is likely explained by a mechanism subsequent to transcription factor binding; either through the more efficient recruitment of an unknown limited coactivator,Â or by recruitment of additional <italic>trans</italic> enhancers, culminating at the assembly of more complex, transcription-competent Greek island hub. Regardless of the mechanism by which <italic>LSCHR</italic> increases the frequency of OR choice within the <italic>Rhodes</italic> cluster, the local ORs remain silent in the vast majority of the mOSNs. This implies the existence of a strong âthresholdingâ mechanism in the ability of Greek Islands to activate OR transcription, such that even 6 Islands acting together are inadequate to drive ubiquitous expression in most mOSNs. Thus, even if multiple enhancer hubs were to form in an mOSN nucleus, only the ones that surpass a critical number of interacting Greek Islands would lead to the activation of OR transcription. These non-linear properties are reminiscent of âsuper-enhancersâ (SE), which exhibit steep concentration threshold requirements attributed to phase transition processes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hnisz et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, an attractive model suggests that Greek Island hubs may undergo phase transition when they exceed a steep threshold of interacting Greek Islands. If this phase transition is required for OR transcription, hubs with lower complexity will not be transcriptionally competent, providing an elegant molecular solution of the singularity of OR gene choice.</p><p>Such thresholding mechanism may be less strict in immature OSNs and progenitors, where low level OR co-expression is detected by single cell RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hanchate et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Saraiva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Similar low level co-expression is detected in Lbr-expressing mOSNs, where the nuclear aggregation of OR clusters is prevented and the chromatin accessibility of OR genes is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clowney et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the differentiation dependent silencing and aggregation of heterochromatic OR clusters into condensed nuclear foci contribute to this âall or noneâ transcriptional paradigm. In other words, the extreme silencing forces imposed by mOSNs on OR genes may result in extraordinary requirements for OR transcription, which can only be met by an activating multi-enhancer assembly of unprecedented complexity and possibly unique biochemical properties. Thus, even if more than one multi-enhancer hub could form in a nucleus, the number of transcription-competent hubs would be extremely limited if not singular. Combined with the kinetic restrictions imposed by the OR-elicited feedback signal, and a recently reported post choice refinement process(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdus-Saboor et al., 2016</xref>), our model provides a mechanistic solution for the singular choice of one out ofÂ &gt;2000 OR alleles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Contact for reagent and resource sharing</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Stavros Lomvardas (sl682@columbia.edu)</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice were treated in compliance with the rules and regulations of IACUC under protocol number AC-AAAI1108.

Motif searches were run on Ebf and Lhx2 consensus peak sets for the 200 bp region around the center of the peak, with repeat masking. The top de novo identified motif for Lhx2 and Ebf ChIP-seq was converted to TRANSFAC format, and plotted using Weblogo v3.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crooks et al., 2004</xref>), together with motifs derived from published Ebf (GEO: GSE21978, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2010</xref>) and Lhx2 (GSE48068,Â [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Folgueras et al., 2013</xref>]) ChIP-seq data.</p><p>HOMER was used to search Greek Island sequences for motifs with a variety of settings. A search for long motifs that allowed up to 4 mismatches (-len 18,20 -mis 4) recovered a sequence motif that was highly enriched relative to random background sequences (p=1e-59). HOMER was then used to optimize this motif against a background set of all mOSN Ebf and Lhx2 co-bound sites. This optimized motif is reported as the composite motif in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. The HOMER derived composite motif was converted to TRANSFAC format and plotted using Weblogo v3.5.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, HOMER was used to analyze sets of sequences and identify the highest scoring match to the composite motif in each sequence. The cumulative distribution of scores for each set were plotted in R.

Bedtools was then used to identify all instances of Ebf motifs that occur within Greek Islands with a composite motif score of 10 or above. Greek Islands without an Ebf motif were excluded from further analysis. For the remaining islands, Bedtools2 was used to identify the closest Lhx2 motif to each of Ebf motif. For Greek Islands with multiple Ebf motifs, only the closest pair was retained. Additional sets of sequences were analyzed in the same manner, and the distribution of motif distances was plotted in R. An identical analysis centered on Lhx2 motifs rather than Ebf motifs yielded similar results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-9"><title>Quantitative analysis of normalized ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data</title><p>Normalized ATAC-seq and Ebf ChIP-seq data were generated in R using the Diffbind package (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_012918">SCR_012918</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ross-Innes et al., 2012</xref>). Diffbind was used to generate a read count for each peak for each data set. Count data was normalized using the âDBA_SCORE_TMM_READS_EFFECTIVEâ scoring system, which normalizes using edgeR and the effective library size. After normalization, counts for biological replicates were averaged, and then counts were log transformed for plotting.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Yin Shen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Lomvardas and colleagues carried out a series of experiments to test the hypothesis that cooperative binding of the Lhx2 and Ebf transcription factors to OR enhancer elements is required for the singular OR gene expression in olfactory sensory neurons. The authors present compelling data demonstrating the enrichment of contiguous Lhx2 and Ebf binding motifs in the &quot;Greek Island&quot; elements linked to OR gene loci and their association with open chromatin as assayed by ATAC-seq; and likely cooperative binding of these two transcription factors to the combined motif as evidenced by the diminished binding of Ebf's in the Lhx2 conditional knockout. To demonstrate necessity of the proposed cooperative interaction, the authors then devised an ingenious experiment in which they first designed a linked Ebf-Lhx2 fusion protein that shows preferential binding to the combined motif and then use it to block OR expression through its transgenic expression in neurons in vivo. Sufficiency was inferred by observing an increase in expression of locus-specific ORs in a knock-in mouse in which a tandem repeat of Greek Island elements was inserted into the OR locus containing Rhodes.</p><p>This work provides genetic insight for the stochastic mono-allelic OR gene expression program, and offer support to the model of inter-chromosomal interactions via the Greek Island elements in OR gene regulation. In addition, the results presented here suggest that cooperative binding of Lhx2 and Ebf transcription factors is involved in OR gene choice, an aspect of OR gene regulation that thus far has remained somewhat elusive by comparison to data supporting mechanisms of negative feedback regulation and stability of OR expression.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>Reviewers raised the following points for further improvement of the manuscript:</p><p>a) The Greek Island insertion experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> showed an increase in expression of linked ORs. In order to make this a stronger case, it would be nice to show that the ectopic Greek Islands also exhibit open chromatin by ATAC-seq and Lhx2 and Ebf binding by ChIP-seq.</p><p>b) The authors ought to be more open-minded when interpreting their results in the context of their model in which the Greek Islands mediate inter-chromosomal interactions required for high level, singular OR expression. It remains to be determined whether and how Lhx2-Ebf binding plays a role in such complexes. Indeed, if anything the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> clearly show an effect of the Greek Island array in cis but not in trans. It is a not an unreasonable leap to infer meaning to trans interactions, but again a more circumspect discussion would seem more appropriate. Discussion of alternative models would be important.</p><p>c) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors show expression of Lhx2 DBD and Ebf DBD fusion protein affect the chromatin state at Greek island and affect OR gene expression. Though non-OR gene expression is not affected globally, it will be nice to show whether such fusion protein could affect the chromatin states outside of the Greek islands.</p><p>d) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, KI of an array Greek islands increases the frequency of OR gene activation (Rhodes OR genes). This suggests that having the insertion of Greek island is not sufficient for gene activation in all cells. What is the percentage of neurons that exhibit OR gene activation? Could they authors discuss why such insertion can only achieve gene activation in a subset of the mature olfactory neurons? What are the other possible players for controlling OR gene activation?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28620.068</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>Reviewers raised the following points for further improvement of the manuscript:</p><p>a) The Greek Island insertion experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> showed an increase in expression of linked ORs.

Thus, we have no way to differentiate the state of the ectopic and endogenous enhancers in these mice. However, we reasoned that if the tandem insertion of 5 Greek Islands next to Rhodes increases occupancy by transcription factors we would see an in increase in the ChIP enrichment. ChIP-qPCR comparing Lhx2 occupancy on the 5 Greek Islands in wild type and homozygote knock-in mice does not show significant changes in Lhx2 enrichment on the 5 Islands between the two genotypes (except of a small increase of Lhx2 binding on Lipsi). These results, together with various normalization methods that take into account the existence of extra enhancer alleles, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A-C</xref>. These data are consistent with our initial prediction that the insertion of additional enhancer elements will not increase the accessibility and transcription factor occupancy of a locus that is already accessible in most olfactory neurons. Thus, the increased frequency of choice of proximal OR alleles is most likely due to effects subsequent to transcription factor binding (either more efficient recruitment of a limited co-activator or increased interactions with other Greek Islands in trans, both of which are discussed in the text).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors ought to be more open-minded when interpreting their results in the context of their model in which the Greek Islands mediate inter-chromosomal interactions required for high level, singular OR expression.

Thus, the main point of this experiment is that in each section of the olfactory epithelium the majority of the OSNs do not express the ORs from the Rhodes cluster. In other words, insertion of 5 strong transcriptional enhancers next to Rhodes does not result in the transcriptional dominance of the neighboring ORs. Determining the exact frequency of olfactory neurons expressing these ORs in an accurate fashion is beyond the point, since in both wild type and mutant mice they are expressed in less than 1% of the total population.</p><p>Finally, we split the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> into two figures: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> for the computational analysis of the effects of Lhx2 deletion and fusion protein overexpression; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> for the description of the 5 Island insertion next to Rhodes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
