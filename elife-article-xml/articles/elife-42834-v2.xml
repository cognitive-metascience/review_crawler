pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42834.001</object-id><p>To follow the dynamics of meiosis in the model plant Arabidopsis, we have established a live cell imaging setup to observe male meiocytes. Our method is based on the concomitant visualization of microtubules (MTs) and a meiotic cohesin subunit that allows following five cellular parameters: cell shape, MT array, nucleus position, nucleolus position, and chromatin condensation. We find that the states of these parameters are not randomly associated and identify 11 cellular states, referred to as landmarks, which occur much more frequently than closely related ones, indicating that they are convergence points during meiotic progression. As a first application of our system, we revisited a previously identified mutant in the meiotic A-type cyclin <italic>TARDY ASYNCHRONOUS MEIOSIS</italic> (<italic>TAM</italic>). Our imaging system enabled us to reveal both qualitatively and quantitatively altered landmarks in <italic>tam</italic>, foremost the formation of previously not recognized ectopic spindle- or phragmoplast-like structures that arise without attachment to chromosomes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42834.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In plant cells, as in other cells, genetic information is stored within structures known as chromosomes. Most of the cells in a plant contain a duplicated set of chromosomes that the plant needs to survive. However, plants also produce some cells known as sex cells that only have a single set of chromosomes. This ensures that, when plants sexually reproduce, a male and female sex cell will fuse together and eventually grow into a new plant that carries a doubled set of chromosomes.</p><p>Cells known as meiocytes make sex cells by dividing through a process known as meiosis. Previous studies have identified several genes that regulate meiosis in plants. For example, a gene known as <italic>TAM</italic> is required to make sex cells in a small weed known as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, which is often used as a model plant in research studies.</p><p>During meiosis, meiocytes need to copy and move their chromosomes at precisely the right time to ensure that each sex cell they produce has a complete set of chromosomes. Studies of how chromosomes behave during meiosis in plants have so far almost exclusively relied on traditional microscopy techniques that kill the cells in the process of preparing them for imaging. Before being placed under a microscope, the dead cell material is often spread out to make it easier to see the chromosomes. These techniques provide snapshots of meiosis that provide good spatial resolution of chromosome behavior, but information about how chromosomes and other cellular components behave in the course of meiosis is lost.</p><p>Prusicki et al. developed a new microscopy approach to observe meiosis in living <italic>A. thaliana</italic> cells. The experiments found that the structure of all the cells changed during meiosis in several distinct stages (referred to as ‘landmarks’). Some of these landmarks were absent or happened at a different time in mutant plant cells that lacked the <italic>TAM</italic> gene. As a result, a structure called the spindle that is required to move chromosomes during meiosis formed at the wrong time in the mutant cells.</p><p>The findings of Prusicki et al. reveal new insights into the role of <italic>TAM</italic> in meiosis. The next step following on from this work is to use the same approach to study other mutant plants with defects in meiosis and analyze the effects of a changing environment on meiosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>reproduction</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>cyclin</kwd><kwd>spindle</kwd><kwd>phragmoplast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011102</institution-id><institution>European Union 7th Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ITN-606956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prusicki</surname><given-names>Maria A</given-names></name><name><surname>Wijnker</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name><name><surname>Schnittger</surname><given-names>Arp</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005711</institution-id><institution>University of Hamburg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prusicki</surname><given-names>Maria A</given-names></name><name><surname>Komaki</surname><given-names>Shinichiro</given-names></name><name><surname>Seifert</surname><given-names>Felix</given-names></name><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Katja</given-names></name><name><surname>Wijnker</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name><name><surname>Schnittger</surname><given-names>Arp</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Live cell imaging and the in vivo dissection into distinct stages, called landmarks, represents a new methodology for analyzing meiosis in Arabidopsis and likely in other species as well.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meiosis is essential for sexual reproduction by reducing the chromosome number to eventually generate gametes with half the genomic DNA content of the parental plant. Moreover, meiosis is central to the formation of genetic diversity by generating recombination between the homologous chromosomes (homologs) and by randomly selecting either the maternal or paternal homologs to establish a new set of chromosomes in the gametes. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying recombination and chromosome distribution are also of key interest for breeding to modulate meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crismani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hand and Koltunow, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lambing and Heckmann, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Entry into meiosis is tightly regulated in all organisms. In plants, it involves the reprogramming of somatic fate since plants, in contrast to animals, do not have a germline that is set aside early during embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>). Designated meiocytes have to repress stem cell activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>), and differentiate by adopting a characteristic shape that radically changes during the course of meiosis ultimately resulting in the formation of spores. These spores then differentiate into gametophytes that produce the gametes, which will fuse during fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dresselhaus et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, our understanding of meiosis in plants has been fostered by genetic approaches, mostly in the model plants <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Zea mays</italic> and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>. These studies have identified more than 80 meiotic genes, including those that control entry and progression through meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lambing et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mercier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wijnker and Schnittger, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou and Pawlowski, 2014</xref>). For instance, mutants in the A1;2 type cyclin <italic>TARDY AYNCHRONOUS MEIOSIS (TAM)</italic> were found to be required for entry into meiosis II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cromer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">d'Erfurth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Magnard et al., 2001</xref>). TAM is a <italic>bona fide</italic> cyclin and builds at least in vitro an active kinase complex with CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASEA A;1 (CDKA;1), which is of key importance for both mitosis and meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dissmeyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nowack et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2004a</xref>). However, the molecular targets of TAM have not been identified and a mechanistic understanding of its role in meiosis is missing.</p><p>Cytological studies of mutants defective in <italic>tam</italic> and other meiotic genes have so far exclusively relied on the analysis of fixed material by cytochemical methods such as chromosome spreads and the immuno-detection of proteins. While these techniques have been, and continue to be, very informative, they capture the underlying cellular dynamics only to a small degree. Importantly, these methods do not allow individual cells to be followed over time. Thus, conclusions about the course of meiocyte development and progression through meiosis have to be deduced from the analysis of different cell populations at different time points.</p><p>So far, only two approaches to observe meiosis in real time in plants have been described, revealing details about spindle dynamics and chromosome paring in maize meiocytes. First, the work of Yu et al. and its modification by Nannas et al. used fluorescence microscopy to observe isolated male meiocytes cultured for a maximum of 9 hr in liquid medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nannas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yu et al., 1997</xref>). The method of Nannas et al. combined the DNA dye Syto12 with the expression of β-tubulin fused to CFP, thereby allowing the concomitant observation of chromosomes and MTs. This revealed a spatially asymmetric positioning of the spindle at anaphase I and II, and chromosome-dependent phragmoplast deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nannas et al., 2016</xref>). The second approach involved imaging entire anthers of maize by exploiting the high depth of field of two-photon microscopy, as earlier proposed by Feijó et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feijó and Cox, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feijó and Moreno, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sheehan and Pawlowski, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheehan and Pawlowski, 2009</xref>). This method, which allowed imaging for periods of 24 hr, led to the characterization of three different movements and trajectories followed by the chromosomes during pairing in prophase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheehan and Pawlowski, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The studies in maize relied on visualizing DNA by chemical stains such as Syto12 and DAPI and the power of Arabidopsis as a molecular model, which enables the relatively fast generation of fluorescent reporter lines for different meiotic proteins, has largely not been exploited in combination with live cell imaging of meiosis. A first approach was made by Ingouff et al. who observed methylation changes during Arabidopsis sporogenesis and gametogenesis, albeit without resolving specific meiotic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ingouff et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we set out to develop a live cell imaging system for meiosis in Arabidopsis. To this end, we have generated an easy applicable microscopic set up, a combination of meiotic reporter lines covering central aspects of meiosis, and an evaluation system based on morphological characteristics that allowed the quantification of meiotic phases with high temporal resolution. This work gives insights into the robustness of meiocyte differentiation steps and provides important criteria to judge and/or re-evaluate mutants affecting meiosis. As a test case, we have re-analyzed <italic>tam</italic> mutants and find new phenotypic aspects that suggest that TAM is a central factor coordinating the cytoskeleton with nuclear events.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Specimen preparation</title><p>Live cell imaging can be performed at three general levels and all three have been applied to the analysis of meiosis in multicellular organisms. First, imaging can be performed on isolated cells as for instance seen in the case of mammalian oocytes where confocal microscopy was applied to analyze chromosome segregation: kinetochores could be tracked for over 8 hr, revealing that the bi-oriented attachment of homologs is established after a lengthy try-and-error process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kitajima et al., 2011</xref>); microtubule organizing centers (MTOC) and actin elements of the cytoskeleton have been shown to be relevant for spindle formation and correct segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holubcová et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mogessie and Schuh, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schuh and Ellenberg, 2007</xref>), as well as it was confirmed by live cell imaging of fetal mouse oocytes that cohesin establishment is maintained without detectable turnover and that its loss in older oocytes remains uncorrected, leading to formation of aneuploid and non-viable gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkhardt et al., 2016</xref>). This approach usually gives very high spatio-temporal resolution since there is no requirement for the laser beam to penetrate surrounding cells and very little laser power can be used reducing photobleaching and phototoxicity. However, since meiocytes in Arabidopsis are very small, that is 20 μm, and difficult to isolate, we did not explore this possibility further. Next, imaging can be carried out in the context of an entire organism, for example in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mullen and Wignall, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rosu and Cohen-Fix, 2017</xref>) with the benefit of perturbing the analyzed cells as little as possible by preparation procedures. However, this set up is limited to small organisms and/or short observation times due to size restrictions and the problem of movement of the sample and thus, cannot be used for Arabidopsis either. Finally, live cell imaging can be performed on isolated organs or tissues that are typically easy to obtain and that provide the appropriate developmental context for analysis of the selected individual cells, for example in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enguita-Marruedo et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mlynarczyk-Evans and Villeneuve, 2017</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Głuszek et al., 2015</xref>). As conventional confocal laser scanning microscopes can reach cells up to a depth of 70–100 μm, they are suited to observe the meiocytes in Arabidopsis that are covered by three cell layers in the anthers. Imaging of isolated organs has already been successfully applied to the analysis of organogenesis in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamant et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reddy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reddy and Meyerowitz, 2005</xref>). Since shoots could be maintained for several days without obvious perturbations of development, we decided to adapt and optimize this approach for our purposes.</p><p>First, we harvested inflorescences and removed all but one young flower primordium presumably containing meiotic stages as indicated by its round shape and an approximate diameter of 0.4–0.6 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), corresponding to stage 9 of flower development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smyth, 1990</xref>). Next, the upper sepal was removed giving access to two of the six anthers since the petals are shorter than the anthers at this floral stage. Finally, the bud along with the pedicel and a few millimeters of the stem was embedded into Arabidopsis Apex Culture Medium (ACM) and stabilized with a drop of agarose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In agreement with the previous analysis of the SAM, we found that the flower buds stayed alive on the ACM medium for up to seven days during which all the flower organs expanded, revealing that cells were able to undergo several divisions on the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42834.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Establishment of life cell imaging of male meiocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Microscope set-up for live cell imaging. An isolated flower bud is mounted on a small petri dish in ACM medium, stabilized with a drop of 2% agarose and submerged in sterile water.

Concomitant with the growth of the entire flower bud, we found that the microspores derived from imaged meiocytes underwent at least one more cell division giving rise to bi-cellular pollen as revealed by DAPI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming that meiocytes are still alive after imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Establishment of meiotic reporter lines</title><p>A generic set up for imaging of cell divisions includes a reporter that highlights DNA/chromatin coupled with a marker for cytoskeletal components, usually MTs, so that chromosome and spindle behavior can be visualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nannas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peirson et al., 1997</xref>). Since fusions of histones with fluorescent proteins have often been applied for this purpose, we first scanned through previously generated transgenic lines expressing different histone variants fused to fluorescent proteins, such H2B. However, while these labeled histones clearly marked DNA in somatic cells, the signal was often fuzzy in meiosis. Moreover, since all or most cells in an anther produced these fusion proteins, the identification of meiocytes was sometimes difficult, especially at early stages of meiosis when chromosomes are not condensed and meiocytes cannot easily be recognized by their size and shape. Therefore, we aimed for a meiosis-specific gene and generated a <italic>GFP</italic> fusion to <italic>REC8</italic>, the alpha kleisin subunit of the cohesin complex, also known as <italic>SYN1</italic> or <italic>DIF1</italic> in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Cohesin is key for chromosome segregation and its step-wise removal allows the segregation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I, followed by separation of sister chromatids in meiosis II.

Due to the dramatic changes in chromatin structure and the dynamics of chromosomes, and to its prolonged duration, prophase I is divided into the five sub-phases, that is leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene and diakinesis. These phases have been derived from observation of fixed material and chromosome spreads, leading to definitions mainly based on chromosome configurations, for example pachytene is defined by the presence of fully synapsed chromosomes.</p><p>Using the <italic>KINGBIRD</italic> reporter line, we were able to distinguish five parameters of meiocytes: cell shape, MT array, nucleus position, nucleolus position, and chromosome configurations (condensation and pairing/synapsis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Some of these parameters could be identified as a direct read-out of the reporters, for example cell shape and MT array are visualized by tubulin while chromosome configurations are revealed by REC8. Other parameters could be indirectly determined as for the nucleus position, which is defined by the absence of MTs, or the nucleolus position, which corresponds to the area of the nucleoplasm where REC8 is present. Each parameter can adopt different states, which have a distinct order. For instance, we observed that cell shape always changed from rectangular to trapezoidal, then to oval, to circular, to triangular and finally giving rise to tetrads composed of four triangular cells, among which typically only three can be identified on the same focal plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42834.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Identification of parameter states of male meiocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the different states of the five parameters observed during meiotic progression in the WT and <italic>tam</italic>. While nucleolus position, REC8/chromatin and tapetum cells do not change their patterns; cell shape and MT array adopt additional states in <italic>tam</italic>.

Numbers refer to the scheme in A.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-42834-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The MT array is the parameter with the largest number of states. At the onset of meiosis, MTs are homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm (state 1) and then progressively form an arc structure, hereby named <italic>half moon</italic>, which develops on one side of the nucleus, which moves at the same time towards a corner of the cell (states from 2 to 4). The <italic>half moon</italic> then develops into a full-moon-like structure surrounding the nucleus (state 5) and contracts to form a pre-spindle similar to what is observed in mitosis (state 6). At the moment of nuclear envelope break down, the pre-spindle is disrupted (state 7) and MTs rearrange to form the first meiotic spindle (states 8 and 9). States 10 and 11 are present during the transition between meiosis I and meiosis II, MTs reorganize radially around the two new nuclei while the central MTs broaden their disposition forming a phragmoplast-like structure. The second meiotic division resembles the first meiosis, with the formation of two pre-spindles (state 12) followed by two spindles (state 13) and phragmoplast-like structures (state 14) until the cells undergo cytokinesis and form a tetrad (state 15).</p><p>Nucleus and nucleolus are characterized by changes of their positions. At the beginning of meiosis, the nucleus is centrally located (state1). Around the time of the formation of the MT half moon structure, it then moves to one side of the cell (state 2) and at state 3 the nucleus is back to the center of cell. This state is distinguishable from state 1 due to the size of the nucleus, which is now enlarged. During the two metaphases (states 4 and 6), the nuclear structure disappears, to reappear as two and four smaller nuclei at the following states 5 and 7, respectively.</p><p>The nucleolus becomes visible at the onset of meiosis, together with the accumulation of REC8. It is initially positioned in the center of the nucleus (state 2) and moves to the nuclear periphery during the progression of prophase (state 3). At late prophase it disappears (state 4). Since the nucleolus is only visible when REC8 is expressed, its reappearance after chromosome segregation could not be noticed.</p><p>The last parameter obtained is the localization of REC8, which correlates with chromatin conformation during the first meiotic division. The states identified resemble the localization pattern of REC8 described by immunolocalization experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2003</xref>). At first, a diffuse fluorescence signal accumulates in the nucleoplasm (state 2), which then condenses to form threads that thicken over time (states 3 and 4) indicating the pairing of chromosomes. At state 5, the REC8 signal becomes fainter consistent with the onset of REC8 removal from chromosomes by the prophase pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Soon, the chromosome threads are unrecognizable but a faint diffuse REC8 staining persists (state 6) until small, distinct dots at state 7 are observed representing fully condensed chromosomes. State 7 is followed by the almost complete disappearance of REC8 (state 8), corresponding to the onset of anaphase I.</p><p>Importantly, our markers recapitulated previously described changes in nucleolus position, REC8 localization and MT cytoskeleton organization, corroborating that our imaging system does not disturb the overall progression of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peirson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stronghill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2004b</xref>).</p><p>Analyzing a first set of movies gave rise to the hypothesis that some of the parameter states are connected, for example the nucleolus apparently dissolves only after the nucleus has moved to one side of the meiocyte and returned to a central position. To assess the nature of these associations, we analyzed a subset of cells (n = 169 from 35 anthers) assigning a combination of numbers that represents each parameter state at every time point when a frame was taken, for example 1-1-1-2-2 describes a meiocyte that is rectangular in shape, has an evenly distributed MT array, a centrally located nucleus with a centrally located nucleolus, and with uncondensed, yet not paired chromosomes. In the following, we call a combination of all five parameter states a <italic>cellular state</italic>.</p><p>A subsequent analysis of 10,671 time points allowed us to judge which parameter states occur together and in which frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). By this method we could confirm that certain parameter states indeed co-occur with each other in a highly specific manner, for example cell shape state 1 is only found to be associated with nucleus position state 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, WT heatmap), while others parameter states are only more loosely associated.</p><p>This analysis also revealed that out of the more than 20,000 possible cellular states only 101 were actually present in our data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). However, their frequencies were distributed in a very broad range (from 0.01% to 21.14% of the total number of observations). Hence, the importance of a certain cellular state cannot be deduced from the absolute frequency of occurrence since this is highly biased by the duration of the respective state, that is combinations of parameters that depict long phases such as pachytene are present in higher number of time points than combinations depicting short phases, for example metaphase I. To identify biologically distinct cellular states from the observed data, we defined a local or <italic>neighboring score</italic>, which quantifies the occurrence of a certain cellular state compared to its neighboring states.</p><p>A neighboring state was defined as a cellular state that is one transition away (−1 or +1) for at least one, but at most two, parameter states compared to the cellular state analyzed. With this, 2-4-2-3-4, for example, is a neighbor of 2-3-2-3-4 and of 3-3-2-3-4, but not of the cellular state 2-2-2-3-4 and not 3-3-2-3-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Notably, we only took states into account that were actually observed.

A key feature of tapetum cells in many plant species, including Arabidopsis, is that they become poly-nucleated through endomitosis, that is a cell cycle variant in which cytokinesis is skipped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jakoby and Schnittger, 2004</xref>).

Nonetheless, we could, at least roughly, align our landmark-based classification with the traditional definition of meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We could attribute A1 to an interval between S-phase and early leptotene based on the starting expression of REC8 and its loading onto chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2003</xref>). A2 could be associated to late leptotene when chromosomes appear as thin threads, as recognized in our case by the REC8 reporter. In addition, the nucleolus, which can be detected by our system by the absence of REC8, moves to the periphery of the nucleus, which is marked by REC8, as described for leptotene cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong and Jones, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stronghill et al., 2014</xref>). A3 and A4 fall into zygotene as zygotene cells have previously been found to have the majority of organelles and MTs localized on only one side of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong and Jones, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peirson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stronghill et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, we observe a thickening of chromosome threads that would be consistent with the formation of the synaptonemal complex, which starts to be formed in zygotene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Higgins et al., 2005</xref>). Pachytene is characterized by the complete synapsis of homologous chromosomes and the re-positioning of the nucleus into the central area of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong and Jones, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore we could link landmarks A5 and A6 to pachytene. A7 is characterized by a diffuse signal of REC8, which is consistent with the release of synapsis in diplotene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross et al., 1996</xref>). A8 can be identified by the formation of a single spindle and five highly condensed chromosomes that align in the metaphase plate, hence representing metaphase I. In A9 two nuclei appear, still connected by MTs, revealing that this stage is telophase I/interkinesis, followed by the formation of two spindles in A10, which is metaphase II. Finally A11, where three to four distinct nuclei can be detected without being separated by cell walls, represents telophase II.</p><p>The assignment of landmarks to the classical stages allowed us then to compare the length of meiotic phases in our live cell imaging approach with the previously performed time course experiments in which the length of meiosis has been estimated by pulse-chase experiments applying either the modified thymine analog 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) or 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) to plants. After a given amount of time, meiotic spreads were prepared and tested for the appearance of these analogs in meiotic chromosome configurations. In these experiments, male meiosis in Arabidopsis was judged to last from G2 onwards approximately 32 to 33 hr with leptotene spanning between 6 and 7 hr, zygotene and pachytene together lasting between 12 and 16 hr. Notably, these previous pulse-chase experiments were not able to resolve stages after diplotene and the rest of meiosis (from diplotene onwards) were estimated to approximately persist for 3 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanchez-Moran et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stronghill et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42834.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Time course of male meiosis in Arabidopsis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Box plot illustrating the duration of each landmark in minutes as observed in WT plants. Outliers are illustrated with a dot.

However, long movies with more than 30 hr containing all meiotic stages could only occasionally be obtained and were rarely fully informative due to loss of the focal plane by sample growth. In contrast, 58 movies captured only subsections of meiosis, yet combined provided a complete coverage of meiosis I and II containing each landmark at least 4 times (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). To faithfully judge the duration of each landmark, the length of one movie had to be long enough to capture at least two transitions of two sequential landmarks in one individual meiocyte (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). The transition states between two landmarks were added to the observed time of the preceding landmark. Hence, the duration of diakinesis is included in A7, anaphase I in A8, prophase II in A9 and anaphase II in A10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Since we could not faithfully determined S-phase, the transitions between S- and G2-phase was excluded in our time estimates. We then tracked single meiocytes over time with up to 18 meiocytes per anther.</p><p>Our measurements of the meiotic phase lengths over all delivered a similar time frame as seen by the previous pulse-chase experiments and we determined the duration of meiosis from late leptotene till telophase II to be 26 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This value excludes the length of landmark A1 (8.5 hr in total), which is marked by the onset of <italic>REC8</italic> expression, since this time point is not clearly defined with respect to beginning of S-phase. Prophase I, as expected, resulted to be the longest phase (minimum 20 hr) with late leptotene (A2) lasting 1.5 hr, zygotene (A3-A4) 6 hr, pachytene (A5-A6) 9.5 hr and diplotene and diakinesis (A7) together 3 hr. Importantly, we could also resolve meiotic phases thereafter and determine metaphase I and anaphase I (A8) together with 1 hr, telophase I, interkinesis and prophase II (A9) with 1 hr and meiosis II (A10-A11) all together with 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">2</xref>).</p><p>Summing up, the here-presented landmark system allows a dissection of meiosis with unprecedented temporal resolution.

What has been reported for <italic>tam</italic> null mutants is that their meiotic progression is delayed in prophase I from pachytene onwards and that they eventually terminate meiosis after the first division. This termination is especially prominent on the male side with nearly 100% of all meiocytes producing dyads instead of tetrads.</p><p>We introduced the <italic>KINGBIRD</italic> construct into <italic>tam</italic> mutants and subjected the resulting plants to our live cell imaging procedure. A total of 31 movies capturing 143 male meiocytes were generated covering the entire meiosis in <italic>tam</italic>. We first asked which states of the five cellular parameters can be found in mutant plants and annotated the cellular states of 62 meiocytes. The same states for nucleolus position and chromatin condensation were found in <italic>tam</italic> in comparison to the WT. When looking into cell shape states, we found neither the triangular nor the tetrad configuration that are characteristic for meiosis II, consistent with the finding that <italic>tam</italic> terminates meiosis after the first meiotic division.

Strikingly, we discovered an additional state with aberrant MT configurations (state 6), which has not been recognized in previous analyses of <italic>tam</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This state is characterized by the formation of ectopic spindle-like or phragmoplast-like structures in the cytoplasm of meiocytes during diplotene, that is when chromosomes are already connected by chiasmata, but before nuclear envelope breakdown. The ectopic MT configurations were found to adopt different conformations, that is one large array on one side of the nucleus, two separate entities on one side of the nucleus or different clusters of MTs surrounding the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). As an additional feature, we also observed, albeit rarely, small dark areas in the cytoplasm occurring already before nuclear envelope breakdown but clearly visible after telophase I, possibly indicating micronuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42834.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Landmark scheme of <italic>tam</italic> and MT aberrations in <italic>tam</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison between the landmarks identified for the meiotic progression in WT (A1 to A11) and <italic>tam</italic> (<italic>t</italic>1 to <italic>t</italic>11). Corresponding landmarks are located on the top of each other.

The reason for the disappearance of the landmark corresponding to wild-type A3 in <italic>tam</italic> is not entirely clear. Likely linked to the disappearance of this landmark is the extension of landmark <italic>t2</italic> (corresponding to A2 in the WT) suggesting that TAM is required to organize the MT is one corner of the cell. Once this is achieved, <italic>tam</italic> mutant cells appear to quickly change their cell shape and proceed to state <italic>t3</italic> (corresponding to A4 in the WT). Since <italic>t2</italic> takes longer than A2 but then A3 is skipped, the total length of early prophase is very similar between the WT and <italic>tam</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, late prophase is extended in <italic>tam</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). This prolongation is linked to the appearance of the additional landmark <italic>t</italic>5 between the WT landmarks A5 and A6, as well as to the presence of the new landmarks <italic>t7</italic> and <italic>t8</italic> both between the wild-type landmarks A6 and A7.</p><p>When looking into the defects of late prophase I in <italic>tam</italic> in detail, we recognized the co-existence of two different populations (A and B) of meiocytes within the same anther. Population A (45.8% of cells, n = 155), develops the above-described spindle-like and phragmoplast-like structure in the cytoplasm while the nucleus is still intact, and proceeds from landmark <italic>t</italic>6 via <italic>t</italic>7 to <italic>t</italic>9, skipping landmark <italic>t</italic>8. In contrast, population B progresses through landmarks which largely resembled the ones seen in the WT, going from <italic>t</italic>6 via <italic>t</italic>8 to <italic>t</italic>9, that is skipping landmark <italic>t</italic>7, yet progressing through meiosis with a much slower speed than the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). The reason for the appearance for the two populations is as yet not clear and they have probably not been recognized before since population A also is slower that the WT. Thus, <italic>tam</italic> meiocytes proceed through meiosis at a similar speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), and do not show strong asynchrony in one anther prior to telophase (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our analysis assigns TAM the function of a major regulator of MT organization in meiosis. Likely, TAM acts already early in prophase I as seen by the extension of <italic>t2</italic>/A2 in leptotene. One major function appears to be then the repression of premature spindle and/or phragmoplast formation in diplotene.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Live cell imaging has promoted the understanding of many developmental and physiological processes. Examples from plants include live observation of double fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamamura et al., 2014</xref>), following the division pattern in the shoot apical meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gruel et al., 2016</xref>), the formation of leaf hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bramsiepe et al., 2010</xref>), and tracking of cell death in the root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fendrych et al., 2014</xref>). However, in contrast to following mitotic divisions and subcellular processes in the epidermis, live cell imaging of plant meiosis has been limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ingouff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nannas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheehan and Pawlowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yu et al., 1997</xref>). The reasons for this are foremost the small number of meiocytes and their subepidermal position. In addition, appropriate reporters need to be introduced into the organism to be analyzed. Here, we have developed a robust live cell imaging system for Arabidopsis male meiocytes based on conventional laser scanning microscopy. We show that this system does not lead to obvious alterations of meiotic progression when compared with previous time course analyses relying on pulse-chase experiments. Notably, our live imaging approach allows individual meiocytes to be followed; this overcomes the problem of asynchrony that occurs in late meiosis, which is likely the reason why the phases from diplotene to the end of meiosis II could not be resolved in the previous time course experiments. Along similar lines, our system allowed the identification of different cell populations in <italic>tam</italic>, which is barely possible without a live cell imaging system.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A landmark system</title><p>Our meiotic description is based on five morphological criteria of male meiocytes that we could distinguish with our reporter genes, that is, cell shape, position of the nucleus, position of the nucleolus, REC8 status and information about chromatin state, and MT array. Importantly, we found that these cellular parameters have two aspects, which make them suitable for a classification system. First, they change in the course of meiosis in a unidirectional manner, for example, cell shape changes from rectangular over trapezoidal and oval to circular. We never found an example where a WT meiocyte skipped one of these cell shape changes or changed back from a later stage to an earlier stage. Second, these parameters are linked with each other and build a matrix. For instance, <italic>full-moon</italic> MT array was never found to be associated with a rectangular cell shape of the meiocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis of cellular parameters allowed us to identify 11 prominent morphological states, called landmarks A1-A11. These differ from each other by at least one parameter state, and always occur in the same order in any cell progressing through meiosis. The pathway taken by an individual meiocyte to reach each landmark could differ slightly, presumably due to biological variation, and is described by a network of the transition states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It is an interesting question to what degree this developmental plasticity depends on meiotic genes and/or environmental factors such as temperature.</p><p>The 11 landmarks together with their transitions could be assigned to the classical phases of meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, it has to be noted that the alignment of our landmarks with the classically defined stages remains fuzzy for certain phases. For example, leptotene is defined by the beginning of the chromosome pairing process, with the appearance of the first thin threads, a cell feature that we could not clearly resolve in our analysis. However, as more meiotic reporter lines are generated, for instance for the lateral or central elements of the synaptonemal complex, pairing and synapsis will be resolved with enhanced resolution in future. In this regard, the landmark system is highly modular and expandable depending on the resolution needed by the researcher.</p><p>Already with the current setup, our system allows an accurate and robust determination of meiotic stages. This is important since not all cell characteristics can always be unambiguously resolved, for example when the fluorescent signal diminishes because of photobleaching. Hence, the combined parameter states together with the knowledge about the previous cell stages maximize the information gained.</p><p>Our landmark system provides a powerful novel platform to study meiocyte differentiation and quantify meiotic progression. The observation that some of the cellular parameters are connected possibly indicates a common regulatory base and/or regulatory dependency. While some associations were expected, for example changes in MT cytoskeleton and cell shape, and are possibly directly linked, other combinations are new and unexpected, for instance the correlation between nucleolus movement and the MT cytoskeleton. These correlations can of course be indirect, yet exploring these combinations in future and identifying which genetic factors underlie them opens a new perspective into meiosis. In turn, their potential uncoupling provides additional, qualitative criteria to describe meiotic mutants.</p><p>By observing more features in the future through the use of additional reporter lines and the analysis of mutants affecting meiosis, it will be possible to obtain a highly informative network of functional relationships, that is coupled and uncoupled parameters, within a meiocyte thus heading towards a system-biology understanding of meiosis. Importantly, it will be interesting to see to what degree these cellular parameters can be found and are coupled with each other in female meiocytes. Similarities and differences can further be compared with the behavior of meiocytes in other plant species.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A new view onto the function of TAM</title><p>Applying our technique to <italic>tam</italic>, a long-known and well-described meiotic mutant in Arabidopsis, revealed surprising new phenotypes and allowed us to quantitatively dissect this mutant. Most strikingly, we observed the formation of spindle or phragmoplast-like structures in the cytoplasm of meiocytes in diplotene, that is at a timepoint when chromosomes are still enclosed in the nucleus. Thus, spindle- and phragmoplast formation can be uncoupled from the presence of chromosomes. However, as soon as the nuclear envelope breaks down and chromosomes are accessible, the ectopic spindle-/phragmoplast-like structures are quickly disassembled and reorganized into a proper meiotic spindle consistent with the finding that chromosomes have a strong MT organizing force. We therefore conclude that one of the major functions of TAM is to prevent self-organization of MTs prior to the presence of highly condensed chromosomes.</p><p>These results possibly resemble a situation found in mitotic cells where high CDK activity inhibits the function of NACK1, a kinesin, and NPK1, a MAP3K. NACK1 together with NPK1 trigger a MAP kinase phosphorylation cascade that results in the activation of MAP65-3, a central MT organizing force that drives phragmoplast formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sasabe et al., 2011</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that TAM functions in addition to prevent cytokinesis after the separation of chromosomes in anaphase I in a similar manner. However, the targets of a meiotic CDK-TAM complex are not known and it remains to be seen whether a meiotic NACK1 and/or NPK1 homolog is subject to phospho-regulation by a CDK-TAM complex.</p><p>The second major finding when analyzing <italic>tam</italic> mutants was that there are two different populations of mutant meiocytes with only one of these populations developing ectopic spindle- and phragmoplastlike structures. The other population progressed through meiosis reaching landmarks that are also found in the WT, yet in a much slower fashion. This could indicate a crucial dose-dependency for kinase activity, that is cells that for unknown, stochastic reasons have very little kinase activity in addition to the loss of TAM develop ectopic spindle- and phragmoplast like structures while intermediate levels of kinase activity due to the loss of TAM are only slowed down. Alternatively, high kinase activity in diplotene might be needed to establish a special state, for example a spatial mark. In absence of TAM, the establishment of the state is less stable and causes the formation of ectopic spindle- and phragmoplast like structures in these cells. Clearly, additional work is required to unravel the complexity of TAM action in meiosis. However, the here unraveled phenotypes give a clear direction for future experiments and underline the power of life cell imaging without which the behavior of different populations of meiocytes is hardly possible to identify.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source <break/>or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top">REC8</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11706195">11706195</ext-link></td><td valign="top">AT5G05490</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top">TAM</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10072401">10072401</ext-link></td><td valign="top">AT1G77390</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain background (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top">WT; Wild- Type; Col0</td><td valign="top">NASC</td><td valign="top">Nasc stock number: N1093</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>rec8</italic></td><td valign="top">Syngenta via NASC</td><td valign="top">SAIL_807_B08; Syngenta stock name: CS874380</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>tam</italic></td><td valign="top">Syngenta via NASC</td><td valign="top">SAIL_505_C06; Syngenta stock name: CS836037, Nasc stock number: N836037</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>PRO<sub>REC8</sub>:REC8:GFP</italic></td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">plant line, Dep.

GFP was excited at λ 488 nm, and detected at λ between 498–550 nm. RFP was excited at λ 561 nm and detected at λ between 578–650 nm. Autofluorescence from chloroplasts was highlighted in blue using excitation at λ 488, and detection at λ between 680–750 nm. Time lapses were acquired as series of Z-stacks (six planes, 50 μm distance). Interval time was varying from a max of 15 to a min of 3 min depending on sample conditions. The functions ‘Autofocus’ and ‘Automatized positions’ were used to acquire images. Room temperature and sample temperature were controlled and stabilized at 18°C and 21°C respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image processing</title><p>First, the time lapses were converted into sequential images. The focal plane was then selected at each time point using the function ‘<italic>Review Multi Dimensional Data</italic>’ of the software Metamorph, version 7.8.0.0. The files were then exported and saved as. tiff. Image drift was corrected by the Stack Reg plugin (Rigid Body option) for Fiji (Fiji version 1.52b, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/Fiji">https://imagej.net/Fiji</ext-link>). Cell numbers were assigned manually.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantitative analysis of live cell imaging data: Data set description</title><p>The landmark system is based on the analysis of a subset of data on male meiocytes from WT and <italic>tam</italic> plants carrying the KINGBIRD reporter constructs. A subset of the analyzable male meiocytes was described at every time point by assigning manually a value for each of the five parameters assessed. For the WT, a total of 169 meiocytes from 35 anthers were annotated, leading to a total of 18,531 data points spanning 3,269 hr. For 7860 observations one or more of the parameters could not be annotated by a well-defined state, with 5893 observations not having a single parameter recognizable. The resulting dataset, consisting of 10,671 time points, was used to determine the co-occurrences of parameter states and the landmarks. For <italic>tam</italic> a total of 62 meiocytes from 19 anthers were annotated, leading to a total of 10,224 data points spanning 1,694 hr. For 4127 observations one or more of the parameters could not be annotated by a well-defined state, with 3109 observations not having a single parameter recognizable. The resulting dataset, consisting of 6097 time points, was used to determine the co-occurrences of parameter states and the landmarks.</p><p>For the analysis of the single reporters, the same data set derived from the observation of WT meiocytes was used. We subdivided it into two groups: the first group contained the annotations for the two parameters REC8/Chromatin and nucleolus position, while the second group included the annotations of the remaining three parameters: cell shape, nucleus position and MT array. Each group contained the annotations of the same cells at the same time points.</p><p>Two additional datasets were annotated using the landmark system directly, that is assigning the cellular states A1-A11 and <italic>t</italic>1-<italic>t</italic>12 respectively and were used for the calculation of the time course of WT and <italic>tam</italic> plants. The landmark attribution for each cell at each time point was done manually. Data were recorded in the CSV format and data analysis was done using the Python programming language (Version 3.6, Python Software Foundation, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/wurssb/arabidopsis-thaliana---landmark-analysis">https://gitlab.com/wurssb/arabidopsis-thaliana---landmark-analysis</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Rosmalen et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Landmark extraction: Data preprocessing</title><p>The manually created data set used for landmark extraction contains a description of the state of each of the five parameters (two parameters in the case of <italic>PRO<sub>REC8</sub>:REC8:GFP</italic> alone or three for <italic>PRO<sub>RPS5A</sub>:TagRFP:TUB4</italic> alone) that were recorded for individual cells at 15 min intervals. Missing data points were labeled by ‘n’, this was done to ensure that unmeasured periods are noted properly and to avoid assigning any unrealistic transitions. The combination of states of each of the cellular parameters makes up the cellular state. Transitions from one cellular state to another occur when one or more parameters change to a new state.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Landmark extraction: Cell state co-occurrence</title><p>To create the co-occurrence heat map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we counted the number of times a combination of two parameter states occurred. Since some time lapses were measured with different temporal resolution (e.g. 10 min intervals versus 15 min intervals), we first resampled the data points from all time lapses to have the same time between measurements. Co-occurrence counts were normalized by the total number of counts of the columns parameter state, including the counts where the state of the 2<sup>nd</sup> parameter could not be measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Landmark extraction: Bootstrapping</title><p>To assess the robustness of the selected landmarks and thus our theoretical framework, we performed a bootstrapping procedure on our data set. The total set of observations was randomly sampled with replacement to obtain a data set 1.5 times the size of the original data set. Scores for each state in this data set were calculated using the procedure described in the previous paragraph and in the section ‘A meiotic landmark system’ of the results. This process was repeated 1,000 times to obtain estimates for the mean value, standard deviation and quantiles of the score of each cellular state. Results of the bootstrap can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata4">4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Meiotic time course calculation</title><p>The duration of each landmark was automatically extracted from the CSV files (Material and methods, <italic>Quantitative analysis of live cell imaging data, Data set description)</italic> using custom software based on consecutive landmark transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seifert, 2019</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/LandmarkSummaryGenerator">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/LandmarkSummaryGenerator</ext-link>).

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Live cell imaging of meiosis in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> – a landmark system&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Meiosis is an essential process in the life of plants and animals, but due to it occurring in hidden tissues, it has been recalcitrant to study by live-cell imaging methods. Here Schnittger and co-workers develop an ex vivo anther system, a new live-cell imaging reporter and a framework for classifying the events of meiosis. Overall this is clearly explained, technically impressive and will provide a useful and needed technique. This study contains two important innovations for addressing the live imaging of plant meiosis. First, it establishes fluorescent reporter markers that highlight important cellular features for visualization of meiosis and describes detailed protocol for microscopic analysis of male meiocytes in the context developing flower. Second, by characterizing five cellular parameters and their behavior in the course of meiosis, the authors created a landmark system for describing meiotic progression assessed by live imaging.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As this work is being put forth as a novel technique that should enable the characterization of mutants or environmental perturbations, an example of the systems application to either one of these situations should be provided. In our reviewer discussions, it became clear that for widespread adoption, people would want evidence that it was capable of reporting deviations from WT before introgressing the reporters into their favorite backgrounds. Is the system robust enough for characterization of meiotic mutants as it is expected that disturbance of meiosis will affect cellular parameters used to define the landmark system?</p><p>2) Regarding the general applicability of the landmark system. As it is defined now, it relies on the <italic>KINGBIRD</italic> reporter line that contains both RFP and GFP. This, in fact, precludes utilization of the system for guiding temporal localization of other proteins of interest in the course of meiosis. It would be very useful to determine whether the 11 landmarks (or most of them) can also be detected without including either the REC8 or microtubule markers (simply by doing the analysis without one of these parameters).</p><p>3) There seems to be some dependency among state assignments based on other events. For example, in Figure 3, looking at nuclear position state 1 and 3 or 4 and 6 are indistinguishable, so my guess is something was defined as being 1 or 3 based on the results from the other markers. In Figure 5, things are nicely laid out with 11 distinct fates, but could A2 be the from stage 1 or stage 3 nuclear position? Why this issue isn't a problem needs to be explained more clearly in the main text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42834.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As this work is being put forth as a novel technique that should enable the characterization of mutants or environmental perturbations, an example of the systems application to either one of these situations should be provided.

Is the system robust enough for characterization of meiotic mutants as it is expected that disturbance of meiosis will affect cellular parameters used to define the landmark system?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have decided to revisit mutants in <italic>tardy asynchronous meiosis</italic> (tam), which encodes for CYCLIN A1;2. With at least 6 research publications focusing on this mutant, TAM is one of the best-characterized meiotic genes. The rationale was to challenge our system with the question whether we would find new phenotypic aspects in <italic>tam</italic> plants. Indeed, this was the case. The work is presented now in the subsection “A case study – analysis of <italic>tam</italic> mutants”.</p><p>In short, we find a striking new mutant phenotype, i.e. the formation of spindle-like/phragmoplast-like structures in <italic>tam</italic>. These structures are formed prior to nuclear envelope breakdown. Thus, these structures are formed without chromosomes serving a nucleation sites. A similar case has, to our understanding, not been reported in any other organism and experts in the field of microtubules dynamics and spindle formation whom we have consulted in this manner were very excited about these phenotypes. We conclude that TAM coordinates microtubule formation with nuclear events. This in turn offers a fundamentally new explanation why <italic>tam</italic> mutants exit meiosis after the first division, i.e. TAM likely represses cytokinesis by preventing the formation of an early phragmoplast after meiosis I. The power of our live cell imaging system became especially obvious by the finding of two populations of <italic>tam</italic> mutant cells that behave differently. The identification of these two populations would be hardly possible by analyzing fixed cells where the destiny of a single cell cannot be followed. Moreover, we can quantitatively describe the time course of these different <italic>tam</italic> mutant populations. Thus, we think that our system is a very valuable addition to the available toolset for the analysis of meiotic mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding the general applicability of the landmark system.

These results are provided in the subsection “Landmarks analysis can be performed with one marker only, yet less informative”.</p><p>In short, we find that both reporters deliver landmarks by themselves. As expected, the tubulin reporter provides a greater resolution in absolute terms as it highlights more cellular features. However, the combination with other fluorescently tagged proteins really depends on the research question and for some incidences it might still be interesting to use REC8, i.e. when processes in pachytene need to be analyzed. We also find that three out of eleven landmarks can only be observed through the combination of both the microtubule reporter and REC8 and thus, the use of REC8 is not superfluous. These results are presented in the new Figure 5 and in Figure 5—source data 1.</p><p>As an additional possibility, a third color could be introduced in the data acquisition, for example changing GFP to YFP and then adding mTurquoise. This would allow following three proteins at the same time although care has to be taken in case of co-localization due to the slightly overlapping emission spectra.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There seems to be some dependency among state assignments based on other events.
