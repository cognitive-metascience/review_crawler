In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, recently discovered synapse-level connectomes in the optic lobe, particularly in ON-pathway (T4) receptive-field circuits, in concert with physiological studies, suggest a motion model that is increasingly intricate when compared with the ubiquitous Hassenstein-Reichardt model. By contrast, our knowledge of OFF-pathway (T5) has been incomplete. Here, we present a conclusive and comprehensive connectome that, for the first time, integrates detailed connectivity information for inputs to both the T4 and T5 pathways in a single EM dataset covering the entire optic lobe. With novel reconstruction methods using automated synapse prediction suited to such a large connectome, we successfully corroborate previous findings in the T4 pathway and comprehensively identify inputs and receptive fields for T5. Although the two pathways are probably evolutionarily linked and exhibit many similarities, we uncover interesting differences and interactions that may underlie their distinct functional properties.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>visual system</kwd><kwd>motion detection</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>connectome</kwd><kwd>neuroanatomy</kwd><kwd>optic lobe</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plaza</surname><given-names>Stephen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Kazato Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Kazato Research Encouragement Prize</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shinomiya</surname><given-names>Kazunori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A complete connectome of the ON and OFF motion pathways of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic lobe is acquired using three-dimensional EM methods, and the similarities and differences of the two pathways are uncovered.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over half a century ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hassenstein and Reichardt (1956)</xref> working on the beetle <italic>Chlorophanus</italic>, and later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reichardt (1961)</xref> workingÂ on flies andÂ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlow and Levick (1965)</xref> studying rabbit retinal ganglion cells, all independently presented evidence for motion detection circuits that incorporate a delay-and-compare strategy. In both insect and mammalian modelÂ groups,Â two or more independent, parallel inputs from upstream neurons provide input to elementary motion detector (EMD) circuits. Both models use a similar mechanism to compute the direction of motion, butÂ they differ depending on how they produce a direction-selective response. The Barlow-Levick type circuit detects the preferred-direction signals by suppressing signals in the non-preferred direction; the Hassenstein-Reichardt detector generates an enhancement of signals in the preferred direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borst and Helmstaedter, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The flyâs optic lobe consists of four consecutive neuropils: the lamina, medulla, lobula, and lobula plate. Each of these comprises columnar units that correspond to the array of ommatidia in the retina. The motion pathway in the optic lobe arises from the photoreceptor cells (PRs), which receive light signals in the compound eye and extend their axons to the lamina. R1âR6 cells expressing rhodopsin rh1 provide signals to lamina monopolar cells in the lamina cartridges,Â which project to the distal medulla. The lamina neurons are presynaptic to various types of medulla neurons in the distal medulla. Among them, medulla columnar neurons including Mi, Tm, and TmY cells further provide inputs to the dendritic arbors of T4 in the M10 layer of the medulla and T5 in the Lo1 layer of the lobula.</p><p>The dendritic arbors of T4 cells receive parallel inputs from multiple columns, and a single arbor receives inputs from columns that signal different positions of the visual field, depending on the cell types of the input neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>). Recent developments in techniques for three-dimensional electron microscopy (3D-EM) have accelerated the identification of neurons and their synaptic circuits, or their connectome, in the brain of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meinertzhagen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meinertzhagen, 2018</xref>). In the visual system, motion detection pathways in the optic lobe have been a prominent goal for such connectomic approaches, which identify the component neurons using 3D-EM reconstructions of their arbors.</p><p>The medulla dendritic arbors of T4 cells provide a substrate for the elementary motion detector (EMD) in the ON-edge motion pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borst, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joesch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>). Using serial-section transmission EM (ssTEM), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takemura et al. (2013)</xref> identified Mi1 and Tm3 as major inputs to the T4 cell dendrites.Â A later approach using focused ion beam scanning EM (FIB-SEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>) comprehensively revealed other medulla neurons providing inputs to T4. These medulla neurons relay input to T4 from L1, the first of two repeated neuron classes in the first neuropil, or lamina; L1 in turn receives input from the terminals of photoreceptors R1âR6 in the overlying compound eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meinertzhagen and O'Neil, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rivera-Alba et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Complementary to the T4 cells, narrow-field T5 cells constitute the first output stage of the OFF-edge pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borst, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joesch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>), and some of T5âs input neurons have also been identified from their terminals reconstructed using ssTEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shinomiya et al., 2014</xref>). These inputs relay signals from L2 cells, which partner L1 in all columns, or cartridges, of the lamina and whichÂ also receive input from R1âR6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meinertzhagen and Sorra, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meinertzhagen and O'Neil, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rivera-Alba et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the separation between the ON and OFF motion pathways isÂ already established at the level of the lamina neurons.</p><p>Finally, T4 and T5 cell axons transfer motion information to the fourth neuropil, or lobula plate, where it is integrated and further processed to extract specific motion modalities, before being conducted to the central brain by visual projection neurons (VPNs).Â VPNs include various types of lobula plate tangential neurons (LPTCs) and lobula plate/lobula columnar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klapoetke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mauss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The ON and OFF motion pathways are similar in their function, component neurons, and patterns of synaptic connections. Both T4 and T5 cells are direction-selective neurons, and each is further grouped into four subtypes: T4 as T4a, T4b, T4c and T4d; and T5 as T5a, T5b, T5c, and T5d. TheseÂ T4 and T5 cells specifically signal motion in the four canonical directions. The subtypes aâd detect front-to-back, back-to-front, upward, and downward motion, respectivelyÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>). Each subtype projects its axon to one of the lobula plateâs four strata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</xref>), depending on the direction of motion thatÂ it signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>). Developmentally, both T4 and T5 are known to originate from the same subset of progenitor cells in the inner proliferation center andÂ to express a proneural gene, Atonal,Â uniformly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apitz and Salecker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oliva et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Given the dimensional constraints of the respective ssTEM and FIB-SEM datasets, however, theÂ T4Â and T5Â pathways, and their respective input neurons, have been reconstructed independently in separate reports using 3D-EM methods. Series of ultrathin sections have been used to identify medulla cell inputs to T4 cells; these included medulla intrinsic (Mi) and transmedulla (Tm) cells but not their terminals in the lobula, which were lacking from the EM dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, inputs to T5 terminals in the lobula arise from Tm cells, but the medulla arbors of these were also lacking from previous reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shinomiya et al., 2014</xref>). Subsequent reports that repeated the analysis of cells for seven medulla columns, using FIB-SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takemura et al., 2015</xref>), also failedÂ toÂ identify the lobula, but comprehensively identified additional inputs to, and connections between, T4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, results from these studies cannot be compared directly to the same field size and at the same resolution in a single dataset. This makes it difficult to recognize and resolve deep similarities in the inputs to both pathways, which might support further evolutionary comparisons between those inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shinomiya et al., 2015</xref>), and whichÂ might alsoÂ enable functional comparisons, especially for the inputs to T5 which toÂ date are known only for four main Tm cells: Tm1, Tm2, Tm4, and Tm9.</p><p>In this study, we exhaustively identified the synaptic inputs to T5 cells, and described their spatial layouts. We also assessed theÂ anatomical properties of the dendritic terminals of T4 and T5, after identifying all neurons that have synaptic contacts with the motion-sensing output cells in the medulla and lobula. As a result, our report concludes the connectomic analysis of both theÂ ON- and theÂ OFF- motion-sensitive pathways in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identifying the synaptic partners of T4 and T5 cells</title><p>The FIB-SEM dataset used in this study covers the entire depth of the medulla, lobula, and lobula plate, as well as the proximal depth of the lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and is large enough to include the motion pathways from the lamina cell inputs, through the medulla, to T4 and T5 cells in the lobula plate.

CT1 spans the opposing faces of M10 and Lo1 to form modular associations, thatÂ is one per column, with both T4 and T5 populations in both the medulla and lobula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). The dataset from the present study reveals that these columnar terminals of CT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) are both pre- and postsynaptic to the neurites of T4 and T5. In particular, the terminals in Lo1 are physically larger than those in M10, and the input synapses from CT1 to T5 are actually more numerous than thoseÂ to T4, making CT1Â one of the prominent input elements to the T5 cell. Each terminal of CT1 is tightly packed with the terminals of Tm1, Tm2, and Tm9, and forms regularlyÂ aligned columnar structures embedded in Lo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40025.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Input and output synapses of T4 and T5 cells in the medulla and lobula.</title><p>Histograms indicating the average numbers of synapses per connection for a single T4 or T5 cell, mean (+SD) for five representative cells selected and completely traced for each T4/T5 subtype.

First, they form repeated synaptic modules in each neuropil column of the medulla and lobula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), where they provide input to the dendrites of T4 and T5, at about 15 synapses per column to T4 and about 60 to T5Â (essentially equal numbers to subtypes a-d). Second, besides being presynaptic to the T5 cell dendrites, CT1 also receives inputs from Tm1 and Tm9 cells in Lo1 (7.0Â Â±Â 3.1 and 23.3Â Â±Â 2.6 synapses per CT1 terminal, respectively (nÂ =Â 7)), and provides outputs to Tm9 (14.9Â Â±Â 3.2 synapses per CT1 terminal (nÂ =Â 7)). Third, that input is GAD1 immunopositive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>) and therefore putatively inhibitory. Fourth, the modules are connected by long neurites that stretch across stratum M10 of the medulla and stratum Lo1 of the lobula, and also between these neuropils, from a soma in the central brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>). Fifth, the connecting neurites areÂ ~0.1 Âµm in diameter, in contrast to 0.5Â ~Â 1 Âµm in common Mi or Tm cell axons, and their average length (44 Âµm) is much longer than that requiredÂ to connect between columnsÂ (~5Â Âµm). We note that this need not be a general feature of lobula tangential neurons, and is not shown for example by LT33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3CâE</xref>).</p><p>Another cell type, TmY15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>), which has neurites in the medulla, lobula, and lobula plate and is also GAD1 positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>), is presynaptic to both the T4 and T5 cells in M10 and Lo1, respectively. Like CT1, this cell type is putatively inhibitory. It extends over areas of the medulla and lobula wider than ten columns, and the innervating areas in the two neuropils roughly overlap each other retinotopically. TmY15 does not receive direct inputs from lamina cells in the medulla but it receives inputs from several types of Mi, Tm, and TmY cells, most notably from Tm3 and Tm4 cells, at its arbors in both the medulla and lobula. In the lobula plate, the cell has input synapses predominantly in the second and third strata, where it receives inputs from the axon terminals of the T4b/T5b and T4c/T5c cells, respectively.</p><p>We also found that two types of Lo1-specific wide-field cells form synaptic inputs to the T5 terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3EâI</xref>). One of these has a wide tangential arbor covering the entire Lo1 stratum, and we name it LT (lobula tangential) 33, previously reported cells of the same class being LT1âLT10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</xref>), and LT11âLT12, and LT31âLT32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Otsuna and Ito, 2006</xref>). There is only a single LT33 cell inÂ each hemisphere, and the cell body is located in the central brain, near the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>), which is also near the cell body site of CT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shinomiya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>). LT33 also has some branches in the neuropil of the posterior lateral protocerebrum (PLP). The other type of cell is identified as a previously described neuron, Tm23, with a cell body in the medulla cortex, distal to the medulla neuropil, which after penetrating the medulla projects an axon to stratum Lo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3GâI</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</xref>). Tm23 seems to have no synapses in the medulla, and the projecting arbor of a single cell in the lobula covers an area of roughly 30 Ã 40 Î¼m. Both LT33 and Tm23 are postsynaptic at inputs from T5, Tm23 being postsynaptic only to cell T5a in Lo1.</p><p>The T2 cell is postsynaptic at a few contacts from each of the four T5 subtypes in the lobula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). T2 has its main terminal in the Lo2 stratum, but it touches the tips of the T5 cell dendritic arbors on its distal side and there forms synaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>The present dataset also reveals some novel minority connections thatÂ haveÂ a few synaptic contacts. Two types of neurons, Mi13 and TmY18, receive input from T4 cellsÂ butÂ lack direct output back to T4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). Interestingly, Mi13 is selectively postsynaptic to T4a (at 7.4Â Â±Â 3.6 synapses) and T4b (at 4.2Â Â±Â 1.3 synapses), whereas T4c (0.6Â Â±Â 0.5 synapses) and T4d (zero synapses) have fewer or no such synapses. InÂ addition, C3 is postsynaptic specifically to T4a (7.8Â Â±Â 3.4 synapses) but not to other T4 subtypes. C3 is widely reported to be GABAergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolodziejczyk et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sinakevitch et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that C3 inhibits theÂ detection or processing of motion by suppressing all subtypes of T4 cells when it receives front-to-back signals from T4a. This connectivity pattern is comparable toÂ thatÂ of Tm23 and T5 cells. Thus although the morphologies of C3 and Tm23 are quite different, they have similar connections with the T4 and T5 cell arbors,Â respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Spatial displacements of synaptic inputs to T4 and T5 cells</title><p>To identify candidate inputs to an EMD, we mapped the synaptic sites distributed over the dendrites of both T4 and T5 cells and compared these maps with plots for T4 made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takemura et al.

In the case of T5, input synapses from Tm1, Tm2, Tm4, and TmY15 were distributed specifically at the middle region of the dendrites, in a pattern similar to that forÂ inputsÂ from Mi1, Tm3, and TmY15 to T4. Synaptic inputs from Tm9, on the other hand, localized to the tip and CT1 to the base of the dendritic arbors, similar to the distribution patterns of Mi9 and Mi4/CT1 synapses on T4 dendrites. Input synapses from LT33 and Tm23 were distributed at the tips to the middle of the dendritic arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The dendritic arbors of T4/T5 cells have presynaptic organelles (âT-barsâ) in addition to postsynaptic sites. We plotted the distribution of T-bar sites, which were restricted to the middle regions of the dendritic arbors in both T4 and T5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). With few exceptions, connections between T5 neurites occur between the same subtypes, forÂ example from T5c to T5c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>) of subtype specificity among T4 cells. Like T4, T5 receives inputs from T5 of the same subtype localized to their dendritic tips.</p><p>Among the neurons providing inputs to T4 and T5 cell dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), TmY15, LT33, and Tm23 lack clear columnar structures in the lobula or medulla. It is therefore unlikely that they can contribute to the function of a classical EMD circuit, which requires multiple parallel inputs from upstream modular neurons. We therefore plotted the distribution ranges of theÂ columnar cell terminalsÂ âÂ namely Mi1, Mi4, Mi9, Tm3, C3, and CT1 terminals for T4; and Tm1, Tm2, Tm4, Tm9, and CT1 terminals for T5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For the Mi and Tm cell inputs to T4 and T5, the inputs from lamina cells (L1, L2, and L3) were omitted. Although Tm3 and Tm4 receive inputs from more than one column in the medulla, there is no evidence of spatial bias between the input columns and the location of Tm3 or Tm4 cells, and the contribution of Tm3 and Tm4 to the EMD circuit is relatively small compared with thoseÂ ofÂ other single-column cells, such as Mi1, Tm1, Tm2, and Tm9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takemura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>).

For this task, we initially identified both pre- and postsynaptic sites by recruiting an automated synapse prediction algorithm,Â which annotated hundreds of thousands of synaptic sites efficiently. To evaluate the quality of the prediction algorithm, and to check if such predicted synapses could be used for connectivity and functional analyses, we then exhaustively checked the predicted input and output synapses of representative T4 and T5 cells manually, and corrected them as required. Neuron-to-neuron synaptic connections that were identified on the basis of manually annotated synapses correlated strongly with the identified connections based on auto-predicted synapses, indicating that neuronal connections of the pathways could initially be predicted without comprehensive labor-intensive manual synapse annotations. Comparing input neurons to T4 with those to T5 then enabled us to identify similarities in the cell types and the numbers of their synapses that underlie common computational strategies. The validity of such comparisons rests, of course, on the assumption that transmission at each anatomical synapse generates a unit postsynaptic signal of fixed size.</p><p>To assess the quality of the prediction, we counted numbers of synapses (both presynaptic and postsynaptic contacts) before and after manual proofreading of the T4 and T5 dendrites. For both counts, the numbers of output and input synapses before proofreading (predicted synapses) are plotted against the numbers of synapses after proofreading (proofread synapses) for the input/output synapses of T4 cell dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), and T5 cell dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The numbers of synapses were counted for single T4 or T5 cells, whereas their synaptic partners were grouped together according to the cell type (e.g. Mi1, Tm1, CT1). For both T4 and T5, the numbers of predicted synapses almost always exceeded the numbers of proofread synapses, except for weak connections (&lt;10â20 predicted synapses/connection), indicating that the predicted synapses include more false-positive (over-predicted) synapses than false-negative (under-predicted) synapses. The regression lines for both T4 and T5 cells largely fit each other, indicating that the quality of the synapse prediction is approximately constant between different subsets of neurons and different parts of the dataset (M10 and Lo1). This result therefore shows that the number of actual synapses can be reasonably estimated by calculating the ratio of false-positive or false-negative synapses, without exhaustive manual proofreading but by verifying only a small fraction of synapses manually.</p><p>On the basis of this result, the spatial distributions of input neurons to T4 and T5 cells were mapped using predicted rather than manually proofread synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, right two columns) and the same method as usedÂ forÂ the left two columns. The results are consistent with the distribution patterns obtained using manually proofread synapses, although in some cases the input neurons failed to cluster clearly into three groups (e.g. T4d and T5c) because of a lack of spatial accuracy for the predicted synapses.</p><p>These analyses revealed that predicted synapses can be used directly for connectivity analysis without extensive manual proofreading, a great saving. In order to estimate the number of actual synapses from the predicted synapses, some of the predicted synapses still needed to be proofread to derive the ratio between the two values. In addition, we are aware that the spatial resolution is less reliable with predicted synapses than with manual proofreading, because the predicted synapses contain a number of false-positive or false-negative synapses, so that only strong neuron-to-neuron connections could be predicted with great accuracy, and that weak connections (about 10 true synapses/connection or fewer in this study; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>) may not be predictable with sufficient reliability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>EMD circuit models based on actual connections</title><p>Classical correlation models of the motion detection circuit, including the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hassenstein and Reichardt (1956)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlow and Levick (1965)</xref> models, consider only two independent upstream inputs in the detection of motion.

Previous studies, in particular, failed to include inhibitory inputs from CT1 to the T4 and T5 dendritic arbors. Although CT1 differs from theÂ other medulla neurons providing inputs to T4 or T5 insofar as it lacks a direct synaptic partnership with lamina cells, it still receives indirect inputs from those cells via Mi1 and Mi9 (in M10) and Tm1 and Tm9 (in Lo1). CT1 is the only inhibitory columnar input to the T5 dendrites, and also the only element that is displaced from the otherÂ two excitatory legs. In the ON-edge side, CT1, together with the other two GABAergic neurons, C3 and Mi4, provides a measurable input to the base of the T4 dendrites.</p><p>As a foretaste to our anatomy, a new EMD circuit model with three parallel inputs was recently proposed, based on the two classical motion detection models, on computer simulations, and on activity recordings from T4 and T5 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haag et al., 2016</xref>). Inputs to the motion-detecting unit include a non-delayed direct input, delayed enhancer input, and a delayed suppressor input (null direction suppression) located on the side opposite to the enhancer signal input, the two inputs bracketing the direct input (FigureÂ 5aÂ in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haag et al., 2016</xref>). The direction from the enhancer signal input to the suppressor signal input corresponds to the preferred direction (PD), and is opposite to the non-preferred direction (ND).

Applying this model to T4: a) Mi1 and Tm3, which provide inputs to the center of the dendritic arbor, would be direct inputs; b) Mi9 innervating the tip would be an enhancer input; andÂ c) CT1, Mi4, and C3, which innervate the base, would be suppressor inputs.

As all neurons providing inputs to the base are putatively GABAergic, and all neurons to the center putatively cholinergic, the connections of the ON- and OFF-edge pathways partially match the three-way EMD circuit model.</p><p>Both Mi9 and Tm9 cells relay signals from L3, and send inputs to the tip of the T4/T5 dendritic arbors. They both produce slow and sustained responses that serve as low-pass filters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Serbe et al., 2016</xref>). AlthoughÂ Tm9 is putatively cholinergic and provides excitatory signals to T5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Serbe et al., 2016</xref>), putatively glutamatergic signals from Mi9 to T4 are supposed to be inhibitory on the basis of behavioral response assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strother et al., 2017</xref>). This possibility is also suggested by the observation that T4 expresses a glutamate-gated chloride channel, GluClÎ±, which mediates inhibitory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strother et al., 2017</xref>). Tm9 shows an increased response during OFF stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisher et al., 2015</xref>), and Mi9 is also thought to be activated similarly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strother et al., 2017</xref>) but provides input to the T4 pathway. These neurons may therefore modulate T4 and T5 using independent but opposing respective mechanisms. Mi9 may function as a temporal low-pass filter of the OFF signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borst, 2018</xref>) and may cancel noise during an OFF stimulus by suppressing T4, whereas Tm9 could enhance OFF signals to T5 along with the direct inputs from Tm1 and Tm2 (see panel (C) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Besides Mi9 and Tm9, the tips of the T4 and T5 dendrites also receive excitatory inputs from T4 and T5 of the same cell type, a-d, which could alsoÂ enhance signals to the EMD circuits by themselves, although these inputs are fewer in number and presumably would be far weaker than those from Mi9 or Tm9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>CT1, which innervates the base of T4 and T5 dendrites, is an interesting wide-field cell that receives signals from the lamina cell pathways indirectly via other medulla neurons, including Mi1, Mi9, Tm1, and Tm9. The other inputs to the base of T4, Mi4 and C3, likewise lack direct inputs from lamina cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that inhibitory signals from CT1, Mi4, and C3 are delayed by an additional synapse relative to those from the direct inputs.</p><p>We can summarize the connectivity diagrams of ON- and OFF-edge EMD circuits that have now been demonstrated anatomically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). A schematized and simplified EMD circuit diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), summarizes three downstream pathways from the photoreceptors (R1âRï»¿6). Among the lamina cells, L1 signals to ON pathways selectively, whereas L2 and L3 both signal to OFF pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strother et al., 2017</xref>). None of the inputs to the base of T4 and T5, thatÂ is from CT1, Mi4, and C3, receives direct inputs from lamina interneurons. CT1 terminals in M10 receive only indirect input from L1 and L3, via Mi1 and Mi9, whereas those in Lo1 receive information from L2 and L3 only via Tm1 and Tm9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâB</xref>). Mi4 also receives inputs from L1 and L3, through L5 and Mi9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>). The transfer of information to these neurons may be delayed at additional synaptic relays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Mi4, Mi9, and Tm9 themselves show delayed and sustained calcium responses against white-noise stimuli whenÂ compared with the responses of Mi1, Tm3, Tm1, Tm2, and Tm4, suggesting that theÂ responses ofÂ Mi4, Mi9, and Tm9Â serve as delayed arms in the EMD model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenz et al., 2017</xref>).Â TheÂ response properties of CT1 are still unknown. We suggest that the anatomical pathways of the two EMD circuits have now been reported in sufficient detail in this and previous accounts, butÂ their physiological correlates, including the neurotransmitters and receptors of some constituent neurons, as well as temporal delays at each cell, all still need further analysis to complete the picture of how the T-cells signal motion information.</p><p>On the basis of the neuronal connectivity depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, speculative timing diagrams against ON- and OFF-edge signals to motion in the preferred and non-preferred directions are shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>. Among the lamina cells, only L1 activates the downstream cells during ON-edge signals. The direct inputs (Mi1 and Tm3) and suppressor inputs (CT1 and Mi4) to the T4 dendrites may therefore contribute to detecting ON-edge signals at the level of the EMD circuit. During OFF-edge signals, on the other hand, all three input legs to T5 as well as Mi9, which provides inhibitory inputs to T4, are activated. In both ON- and OFF-edge circuits, excitatory inputs provide signals to T4 or T5 cells first, before delayed inhibitory inputs suppress theÂ responses of these cells to stimuli in the preferred direction. For signals in the non-preferred direction, T4 and T5 cells are inhibited by the suppressor inputs and will not be excited. Besides these, T4 is also likely to be suppressed by Mi9 not during ON-edge signals but during OFF-edge signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strother et al., 2017</xref>), presumably cutting off spontaneous noise from responses to non-preferred stimuli. Such a mechanism is lacking in the T5 pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Similarities and differences between the ON and OFF pathways</title><p>Inputs to T4 and T5 from their upstream neurons reveal significant anatomical similarities between the ON- and OFF-edge EMD circuits. The Mi1 cell in the ON pathway, for example, is similar to the Tm1 and Tm2 cells in the OFF pathway, insofar as all these cells provide inputs to the center of the T4/T5 cell dendrites and use acetylcholine as their neurotransmitter, and differ only in the neuropil of their termination. Like T4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strother et al., 2017</xref>), T5 expresses transcripts of two different nicotinic cholinoceptors, as well as those of an A-type muscarinic cholinoceptor, suggesting that T5 receives cholinergic Tm inputs by means of both ionotropic and metabotropic cholinoceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shinomiya et al., 2014</xref>). Additional neurons, CT1 and TmY15, innervate both M10 and Lo1 and form synapses there with T4 and T5, respectively. On the other hand, three types of GABA-positive neurons provide inputs to the base of T4 dendrites, whereas only one type of GABAergic neuron (CT1) sends inputs to the base of T5. Inputs from CT1 make up a much larger proportion of the total input to T5Â cells thanÂ to T4Â cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This difference might compensate for the lack of other inhibitory inputs to the base of T5. There are also two tangential elements in Lo1 (LT33 and Tm23) that make synapses with T5 dendrites, and counterparts are not found in M10. These then constitute differences betweeen the inputs to T5 and T4 cells. AsÂ the cell body site and projection trajectory of LT33 are both similar to those of CT1, a GABAergic cell, and as the cell is both presynaptic and postsynaptic to the T5 cell dendrites, it is possible that LT33 is also inhibitory and inhibits the activity of T5 regardless of the direction specificity. Even so, theÂ T4 and T5 motion stimulus responses are very similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haag et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The T4 and T5 cells not only share functional characteristics, but also correlate closely in their development and are suggested evolutionary siblings. T4 and T5 are produced from the same lobula plate neuroblasts, and the expression of Notch specifies the generation of these two morphologically similar cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pinto-Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>). Assuming that, during the course of evolution, T4 and T5 arose as duplicates from an ancestral cell population, as has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shinomiya et al., 2015</xref>), the neurons that provide their synaptic partnerships, most notably Mi and Tm cells, could also have been duplicated, possibly in an event that was induced by the duplication of T4/T5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shinomiya et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>T4 and T5, or morphologically similar optic lobe neurons, have been found in a broad range of arthropod species, including various Diptera, the honeybee, butterfly, and crab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bengochea et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buschbeck and Strausfeld, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cajal and SÃ¡nchez, 1915</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strausfeld, 2012</xref>), suggesting that the origin of these cells can be traced back to the Cambrian, when pancrustacean ancestors are thought to have given rise to hexapod and crustacean species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rota-Stabelli et al., 2013</xref>). Anatomical and functional differences in the T4 and T5 pathways of the flyâs brain may therefore have accumulated during the course of evolution, adapting ancestral forms to their living environments, by changes in the synaptic connections of their partner neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Possible roles for CT1 and TmY15</title><p>The two novel cells describedÂ in our report, CT1 and TmY15, share important similarities: both are putatively inhibitory, and both provide input to both T4 and T5. They differ chiefly in their anatomical field size. TmY15 is narrow-field, spanning at least 10 columns, whereas CT1 spans the entire field. The architecture of the connecting networks also differs. Thus, both are anatomically qualified to provide an inhibitory surround to the field of T-cellsÂ that they innervate.</p><p>In addition to its similarity to TmY15, CT1 may support a local computation of the inhibitory elements of a Barlow-Levick circuit. Calculations of the space constant for the CT1 arbor suggest that a delay between adjacent columns is sufficient to allow local inhibition, in addition to any global inhibitionÂ that this cell may mediate. Such local computation has both the right sign and location (on the leading edge of the anti-preferred direction) in both the ON-pathway of T4 in the medulla, where CT1 is excited by Mi1 and Tm3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>), and the OFF-pathway of T5 in the lobula, where the inputs are instead Tm1 and Tm9. The latter,Â in turn, derive their inputs from L1 (to T4) and L2 (to T5).</p><p>The functional significance of TmY15 in motion processing must remain speculative. Not only does this cell receive a wide range of inputs from various types of cells in the medulla, lobula, and lobula plate, butÂ it also has much weaker synaptic contacts with T4 and T5 in M10 and Lo1 whenÂ compared with other Mi or Tm cell inputs. It specifically innervates the second and third strata (Lop2 and Lop3) in the lobula plate, and preliminary observations show that it receives inputs from cells T4b, T4c, T5b, andÂ T5c, suggesting that TmY15 may also work as a feedback loop to suppress responses in T4 and T5 during regressive and upward motions.</p><p>In summary, our report comprehensively identifies input and output neurons of the dendritic arbors of T4 and T5 cells, and uses a single dataset toÂ revealÂ (at synapse level) the detailed similarities between the connections of these two motion-signaling output cells.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Comparative connectivity analysis of the ON- and OFF-edge motion pathways in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Alexander Borst as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors used a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) to acquire high resolution images of a large fraction of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic lobe. The dataset is superior to previous EM datasets because it is of higher isotropic resolution and encompasses the complete pathway from the lamina to the lobula plate. From this dataset they reconstructed five T4 and T5 neurons â elementary motion detectors in the fly visual system â detected all their synaptic contacts (pre- and postsynaptic, with the exception of the lobula plate) and traced and identified the connected cell types. While the circuitry in the ON-selective pathway had already been described in detail previously, the authors were able to demonstrate for the first time the spatial distribution of the presynaptic elements to OFF-selective T5 cells, namely inputs segregated into distal, central, and basal dendritic inputs. In addition to confirming already published findings (columnar cell types Tm9, Tm2, Tm1, and Tm4 as major inputs to T5), they describe a new potential key-player in the T5-circuit, CT1.</p><p>The data presented here by Shinomiya and colleagues, especially the new evidence for the spatial distribution of T5 inputs, is convincing and with no doubt of great interest for the scientific community. In particular, the manuscript aims at constraining the possible circuits for direction selectivity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system with EM data, and, thus, is a timely and interesting addition to this field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>General criticism:</p><p>The quality of the writing as well as the structure of the manuscript are very unsatisfying. Overall poor referencing. The figures are poorly linked to the text. The order of figures and the Results part of the manuscript do not follow a consistent logic.</p><p>Section-by-section criticism:</p><p>A) Title: I would propose to focus on the new finding, and not on the comparison with the T4 inputs. I would propose the following title: Connectivity analysis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> OFF-edge motion pathway.</p><p>B) Introduction: There are some abrupt jumps from modeling (first section) to anatomy without introducing the optic lobe structure at all, pointing out the roles of the described elements in the context of the motion vision circuitry. I would propose to restructure the introduction: 1) Models for motion detection. 2) General architecture of the optic lobe. 3) Functional evidence; split ON v. OFF (L1,L2; T4,T5). 4) Anatomical evidence already published (presynaptic elements to T4 and T5). 5) Functional evidence.</p><p>C) Results: The figure referencing in the Results part does not follow any logic. Every part of every figure should be referenced in the text before the next one. I would suggest to rearrange the figures in the beginning of the Results: 1) Change the order of Figures 2 and 3. 2) First describe the inputs to T4 and T5 and then their anatomy. 3) Move Figure 6 to supplements. 4) The last two sections (about CT1 and TmY15) would better fit to the corresponding section where anatomy and connectivity is described.</p><p>D) Discussion: The second paragraph of the subsection âThree-way EMD circuit modelâ is largely confusing and does not contribute to the understanding of the subject. I would suggest removing this section from the manuscript. The Discussion would profit from referencing the corresponding figures more regularly.</p><p>Another concern is that the interpretation of the connectomics data is exclusively done through the lens of the three-arm model from Haag et al., 2016, which incorporates both Hassenstein-Reichardt style preferred direction enhancement and Barlow-Levick style null direction suppression. This is an important model but there is, however, no consensus at the moment on how direction selective signals emerge, with studies reporting both/either preferred direction enhancement and/or null direction suppression (Fisher et al., 2015; Salazar-Gatzimas et al., 2016; Leong et al., 2016; Strother et al., 2017; Gruntman et al., 2018). While it is tempting to focus on the three-arm model, because of their and previous findings that the inputs are separated into three clusters, it also seems overly restrictive. It is important to mention alternative models, and how this connectomics data might inform these.</p><p>Loosely related to this point, there is no mention of silencing experiments performed by various groups (Strother et al., 2017; Ammer et al., 2015; Serbe et al., 2014; Silies et al., 2013). Even though these are not always conclusive, they are directly relevant to the final model put forward in Figure 7.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Comparisons between the ON- and OFF-edge motion pathways in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The revised manuscript has improved substantially, both in its structure as well as in the writing. However, before it can go to press, the authors should fix the following things:</p><p>1) Writing:</p><p>Some sentences are still too long and need to be shortened. In general, the manuscript would profit from one of the authors smoothing out the language.</p><p>The following sentences from the Introduction might serve as an example: âFunctionally, both T4 and T5 cells are direction-selective, and each is further grouped into four subtypes: T4 as T4a, T4b, T4c and T4d, and T5 as T5a, T5b, T5c, and T5d. T4 and T5 cells specifically extract motion in the four canonical directions. The subtypes a-d, detect front-to-back, back-to-front, upward, and downward motion, respectively one each (Maisak et al., 2013).â</p><p>In a similar way, the last paragraph of the Introduction justifies the present study because previous data sets used different methods and are each lacking specific parts of the optic lobe. But then it diffuses again in details like: âThe latter are paired Tm1 and Tm2 cells with multiple Tm4 cells that all receive L2 input, and a fourth cell Tm9 (Shinomiya et al., 2014), a medulla target of L3, the third lamina neuron in each cartridge. Thus Tm1 and Tm2 provide input from a single column while Tm4 cells provide input originating from multiple columns. Tm9 in turn provides a candidate substrate for L3's combinatorial action with L2 (Silies et al., 2013).â I would simply delete these sentences, focusing on the main point made above.</p><p>2) Other major point:</p><p>In the third paragraph of the subsection âIdentifying the synaptic partners of T4 and T5 cells2â, it states Tm1, Tm4, and Tm9 as CT1 input. The first and sixth paragraphs of the subsection âEMD circuit models based on actual connectionsâ, state only Tm1 and Tm9, while in the second paragraph of the subsection âPossible roles for CT1 and TmY15â, the authors write that Tm1 and Tm4 are presynaptic to CT1. In Figure 6 only Tm1 and Tm9 are depicted as CT1 inputs. Please also clarify where these data come from and how strong these inputs are (synapse numbers).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40025.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>General criticism:</p><p>The quality of the writing as well as the structure of the manuscript are very unsatisfying.

A major merit of our work is, however, we suggest, that both pathways, those to T5 (which is new) and to T4 (which is an extended update) have now been made from the same FIB-SEM dataset using identical methods without biases, and discuss motion processing models by referring to previous works on both ON and OFF pathways. These use some of the same pathways. So, while we agree to the need to underemphasize the T4 pathway, we think there is still merit in referring to its comparison. We therefore now use the following title: âComparisons between the ON- and OFF-edge motion pathways in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Introduction: There are some abrupt jumps from modeling (first section) to anatomy without introducing the optic lobe structure at all, pointing out the roles of the described elements in the context of the motion vision circuitry.

However, before it can go to press, the authors should fix the following things: 1) Writing: Some sentences are still too long and need to be shortened. In general, the manuscript would profit from one of the authors smoothening the language. The following sentences from the Introduction might serve as an example: âFunctionally, both T4 and T5 cells are direction-selective, and each is further grouped into four subtypes: T4 as T4a, T4b, T4c and T4d, and T5 as T5a, T5b, T5c, and T5d.

We hope the entire article now reads smoothly.</p><p>We admit that the part (âThe latter are paired Tm1 and Tm2 cells â¦â) was off the topic and also redundant. We therefore now removed this part from the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Other major point:</p><p>In the third paragraph of the subsection âIdentifying the synaptic partners of T4 and T5 cells2â, it states Tm1, Tm4, and Tm9 as CT1 input. The first and sixth paragraphs of the subsection âEMD circuit models based on actual connectionsâ, state only Tm1 and Tm9, while in the second paragraph of the subsection âPossible roles for CT1 and TmY15â, the authors write that Tm1 and Tm4 are presynaptic to CT1. In Figure 6 only Tm1 and Tm9 are depicted as CT1 inputs. Please also clarify where these data come from and how strong these inputs are (synapse numbers).</p></disp-quote><p>Including Tm4 as a major CT1 input was our mistake. While both CT1 receives inputs from both Tm9 and Tm1 with substantial numbers of synapses (23.3 Â± 2.6 and 7.0 Â± 3.1 synapses per CT1 terminal, respectively (n=7)), Tm4 has virtually no synapses with CT1 (0.4 Â± 0.8 synapses per CT1 terminal (n=7)). So we have removed Tm4 from these statements and added synapse numbers for Tm9 and Tm1. We apologize for the confusion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
