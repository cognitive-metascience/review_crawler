transcriptional coactivator β-catenin is regulated by its phosphorylation in a complex that includes the scaffold protein Axin and associated kinases. Wnt binding to its coreceptors activates the cytosolic effector Dishevelled (Dvl), leading to the recruitment of Axin and the inhibition of β-catenin phosphorylation. This process requires interaction of homologous DIX domains present in Dvl and Axin, but is mechanistically undefined. We show that Dvl DIX forms antiparallel, double-stranded oligomers in vitro, and that Dvl in cells forms oligomers typically &lt;10 molecules at endogenous expression levels. Axin DIX (DAX) forms small single-stranded oligomers, but its self-association is stronger than that of DIX. DAX caps the ends of DIX oligomers, such that a DIX oligomer has at most four DAX binding sites. The relative affinities and stoichiometry of the DIX-DAX interaction provide a mechanism for efficient inhibition of β-catenin phosphorylation upon Axin recruitment to the Wnt receptor complex.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Stem cells can give rise to many types of specialized cells through a process called differentiation, which is partly regulated by changes in the levels of a protein known as β-catenin. On one hand, a ‘destruction complex’ can keep β-catenin levels low; this complex includes a protein called Axin and an enzyme known as GSK-3, which can tag β-catenin for degradation. On the other hand, when β-catenin levels need to increase, another protein called Dishevelled is activated. By binding to Axin, Dishevelled can bring the destruction complex in contact with other proteins, which leads to the deactivation of GSK-3.</p><p>Dishevelled and Axin interact via a region that is similar in the two proteins, called DIX in Dishevelled and DAX in Axin. Studies of DIX and DAX have shown that both regions can form polymers – that is, a high number of similar units can bind together to form larger structures. However, these experiments were at higher concentrations than would be found in the cell. It was thought that, when combined, DIX and DAX might form these long chains together, preventing Axin from carrying out its role in destroying β-catenin. Kan et al. set out to better understand this process by studying how DIX and DAX behave separately, and how they interact.</p><p>The proteins were examined using a technique called cryo-electron microscopy, which allows scientists to dissect the structure of large proteins. When there was a high concentration of DIX in the sample, the molecules attached to one another to form long double-stranded helices. Similarly, DAX also formed helices, but these were shorter and only single-stranded. When the two proteins were combined, DAX bound only to the ends of short DIX chains, so that there are not more than four DAX chains attached to each DIX double helix.</p><p>To see if this behaviour happens naturally, Kan et al. attached fluorescent tags to Dishevelled proteins and followed them in living cells: this showed that Dishevelled forms smaller chains with fewer than ten molecules. Together these results highlight how Dishevelled binds to Axin to deactivate GSK-3, to prevent the enzyme from promoting β-catenin destruction.</p><p>Mutations in the genes that encode β-catenin or its regulators are associated with cancer. Ultimately, a better understanding of how β-catenin is regulated could help to identify new opportunities for drug development.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway mediates cell fate specification during embryogenesis and tissue renewal in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>). In this pathway, secreted Wnt proteins activate growth control genes by stabilizing the transcriptional co-activator β-catenin. In the absence of a Wnt signal, a cytosolic pool of β-catenin is bound in a ‘destruction complex’ that contains the scaffold protein Axin, the kinases GSK-3 and CK1, and the adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC); phosphorylation of β-catenin leads to its ubiquitylation and destruction by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stamos and Weis, 2013</xref>). Wnt binding to its cell surface receptors inhibits β-catenin destruction, and the stabilized β-catenin translocates to the nucleus and activates Wnt target genes through association with TCF/LEF transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cadigan and Waterman, 2012</xref>). Inappropriate activation of the pathway by mutations that inactivate β-catenin destruction is associated with a number of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacDonald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Wnt binding to two co-receptors, the 7-transmembrane helix receptor Frizzled (Fzd) and the single pass transmembrane receptor LDL receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MacDonald and He, 2012</xref>), brings the receptors into close proximity. A current model for signal transduction is that ligand-bound Fzd recruits the cytosolic protein Dishevelled (Dvl), which then binds to Axin and thereby recruits the destruction complex to the activated receptor complex. In this complex, Axin-bound GSK-3 phosphorylates proline/serine-rich motifs in the LRP5/6 cytoplasmic tail, which then inhibit GSK-3 and hence β-catenin phosphorylation and destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MacDonald and He, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stamos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stamos and Weis, 2013</xref>). Dvl self-association may contribute to formation of a multimeric and possibly phase-separated ‘signalosome’ containing multiple copies of the receptor complex and its associated cytoplasmic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gammons and Bienz, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schaefer and Peifer, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The Dvl-Axin interaction is essential for Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction and is mediated by a DIX (Dvl and Axin interacting) domain present in each protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fiedler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Julius et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kishida et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smalley et al., 1999</xref>). Dvl has an N-terminal DIX domain, as well as a PDZ and a DEP domain; the DEP domain mediates the interaction with Fzd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gammons et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tauriello et al., 2012</xref>). Axin contains binding sites for APC, GSK-3, β-catenin and CK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrens, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hart et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ikeda et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kishida et al., 1999</xref>) and a C-terminal DIX domain. In this paper, we call the Axin DIX domain DAX in order to distinguish it from Dvl DIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bienz, 2014</xref>). In crystal structures, DIX domains from Axin and Dvl form head-to-tail helical polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Madrzak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamanishi et al., 2019b</xref>), and Dvl DIX has been seen to form filaments in negative stain electron microscopy (EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007a</xref>). Mutations that disrupt the head-to-tail interactions in either protein interfere with signaling, indicating that the DIX-DAX interaction is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fiedler et al., 2011</xref>). Overexpression of fluorescently tagged Axin or Dvl produces large puncta visible by optical microscopy, and these puncta are lost when these mutations are introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fiedler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007b</xref>). Based on these findings, it has been proposed that Axin self-associates via DAX in the destruction complex. Upon Wnt signaling, it is thought that Dvl self-associates via its DIX domain as well as dimerization of its DEP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gammons and Bienz, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gammons et al., 2016a</xref>), and subsequently recruits Axin by co-polymerization of the DIX and DAX domains into a filamentous oligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bienz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe et al., 2003</xref>). It has also been suggested that the interaction with Dvl may compete with APC for Axin, thereby disrupting the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fiedler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mendoza-Topaz et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The extent of filament/oligomer formation by endogenous Dvl and Axin, and how their relative stoichiometries in signaling complexes control GSK-3 activity and β-catenin destruction, are essential but unresolved questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gammons et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we examine the interaction of Axin and Dvl DIX domains, using structural and biochemical analyses of purified DIX and DAX domains, and assessing the role of these domains when the proteins are present at endogenous levels. We found that purified Dvl DIX in solution forms antiparallel, double-stranded filaments whose stability depends on the inter-strand interactions in the double helix. At endogenous expression levels in HEK293T cells, Dvl forms oligomers on the order of 10 molecules. Unlike Dvl, Axin DAX does not form a double-stranded structure, and forms only modestly sized oligomers even though its self-association is approximately 10x stronger than that of DIX. Our evidence indicates that DAX caps the ends of DIX oligomers, such that a DIX oligomer has at most four DAX binding sites. These data suggest molecular mechanisms for efficient inhibition of GSK-3 mediated β-catenin phosphorylation upon Axin recruitment to the Wnt receptor complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DIX forms an antiparallel double helix that stabilizes filaments</title><p>We produced DIX filaments by cleaving purified maltose-binding protein (MBP)-DIX fusion protein, which does not polymerize, with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

The LS:dRI ratio for DIX filaments is large relative to that of MBP, so the LS and dRI signals have been normalized to show the near congruity of LS and dRI traces for DIX filaments.

MBP-Dvl2 DIX at the indicated concentrations was digested with TEV protease, centrifuged, and the supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions run on SDS-PAGE. The five highest concentration samples were diluted prior to loading to prevent overloading; since the TEV concentration is constant in each sample, this dilution makes the TEV band intensity different in these lanes.

The head-to-tail interface within each strand is similar to that observed in crystal structures. For example, Y27 packs against F56 and K68 of a neighboring protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). The mutation Y27D is known to disrupt filament formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), and the purified Y27D mutant runs predominantly as a monomer on SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and see below). We next tested the role of the inter-strand contacts that form the antiparallel double helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). These contacts are formed between two opposing protomers, principally by the β3-β4 (residues 60–66) and β4-β5 (residues 82–84) loops. Some residues on the β3-β4 loop (e.g., D63) participate in intra- and inter-strand interactions, whereas others appear to be involved solely in inter-strand contacts, including M60, G65 and N82. Mutating each of these last three residues individually reduced the apparent size of the DIX oligomer on SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), but they run larger than the monomeric Y27D, consistent with their ability to form intra-strand head-to-tail interactions. The G65D mutant, however, runs smaller than the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the unique conformation of the loop at this position may not tolerate substitution with another residue, or that the mutation might affect head-to-tail interactions as well. Several of these inter-strand mutants were reported earlier, based on antiparallel strand-strand interactions in Dvl1 Y17D crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2011</xref>) that are very similar to those observed in the present filament structure.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Point mutations disrupt double stranded filament formation and Dvl signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of TEV-cleaved Dvl2 DIX variants run on a Superose 6 size-exclusion column.

Sequence and structure alignments revealed that relative to DIX, DAX contains a two-residue insertion, D796-C797, in the β3-β4 loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In Dvl2, this loop (residues 60–66) packs against the opposing strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4c</xref>). The insertion, which occurs between the equivalent DIX residues 64 and 65, would therefore be expected to sterically disable formation of the inter-strand contacts needed for double helix formation. We produced a chimeric protein, designated DIX<sub>64*DC*65</sub>, with this insertion. Dvl2 DIX residues 60 and 61 also form part of the inter-strand interface, so we prepared DIX<sub>60*DE*61</sub> that contains a two-residue insertion between residues 60 and 61 that would expand this loop into and disrupt the inter-strand interface. Neither of these mutant Dvl2 DIX domains formed filaments, and each sized at roughly 2–4 monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). While we cannot rule out the possibility that the insertion of DC after F64 disrupts the head-to-tail interactions centered on V67 and K68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), the chromatograms show that DIX<sub>64*DC*65</sub> runs larger than the corresponding monomer mutant, DIX<sub>64*DC*65</sub>/Y27D, as does DIX<sub>60*DE*61</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Combined with the presence of a distinct 'tail' (likely reflecting an equilibrium among oligomers of different length) in the DIX<sub>64*DC*65</sub> chromatogram that is absent in the DIX<sub>64*DC*65</sub>/Y27D chromatogram, these data suggest that the head-to-tail interactions are at least partially intact in the DIX<sub>64*DC*65</sub> mutant.</p><p>Next, we used the DIX structure to predict changes that would enable human Axin1 DAX to form filaments. We changed two acidic residues to their equivalent positions in DIX (E815N/E816G), alone or in combination with changing two charged residues in the β3-β4 loop to their neutral equivalents (D793N/E794Q). These DAX mutants (‘NG’ or ‘NQ/NG’) formed double-stranded filaments as assessed by SEC and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,d</xref>).The E815 change appears to be critical, as the equivalent N82 in DIX forms an inter-strand hydrogen bond with D63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4c</xref>), and a negative charge introduced at N82 destabilizes double-stranded filament formation in DIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Overall, the data indicate that the inter-strand interactions in the double helix stabilize the DIX filament once a certain number of monomers are incorporated in a single strand, and that the DAX oligomer is small due to the inability to form inter-strand contacts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Binding of Axin DAX results in capped Dvl DIX oligomers</title><p>To test directly whether DAX and DIX can co-polymerize, as proposed in Axin recruitment models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bienz, 2014</xref>), we mixed purified DAX with pre-formed DIX filaments in different ratios and asked whether DAX would co-sediment with DIX.

Both mutants were able to solubilize the DIX filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). However, DAX mutated in both the head and tail interfaces, Y760D/V800A/F801A, failed to solubilize the DIX filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). These results indicate that Axin DAX solubilizes Dvl DIX via its head-to-tail interface. With an input concentration of 10 μM DIX, the half-maximal loss of sedimentation occurred at approximately 15 μM DAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). This concentration dependence was also observed in the native gel shift experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data indicate that the DAX-DIX interaction is at best comparable to the homotypic DIX-DIX interaction, and weaker than the DAX-DAX interaction, observations consistent with previous NMR analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fiedler et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The ability of the head or tail mutants to solubilize DIX filaments suggests that DAX does so by capping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). FRAP measurements of Dvl-GFP expressed in cells indicate that Dvl polymers are highly dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007b</xref>). These findings suggest that DAX can incorporate into a dynamic DIX filament by its head-to-tail interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Because DAX cannot form the inter-strand interaction, this locally destabilizes the DIX filament, resulting in severing of large filaments in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). The fact that approximately 40% of the DIX still sediments even with a fivefold molar excess of DAX is likely due in large part to the relatively weak DIX-DAX K<sub>D</sub> of 10–20 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamanishi et al., 2019a</xref>). Furthermore, DAX insertions near the ends of DIX filaments would consume DAX while only shifting a small portion of the DIX contained in that filament from the pellet to the supernatant. Likewise, DAX insertion into a DIX oligomer that is already too small to sediment (the likelihood of which would increase as the number of severed DIX oligomers increased) would consume DAX without shifting any DIX from the pellet to the soluble fraction.</p><p>The role of oligomer stability in determining the DAX-DIX interaction was examined further by assessing the role of a continuous electronegative groove that runs along the DIX filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3a</xref>). The acidic residues that form this groove are strongly conserved in most Dvl proteins, but not Axin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We hypothesized that this feature is important to Dvl2 function and mutated two of the acidic residues, E22 and E24, to either glutamines (‘QQ’) or lysines (‘KK’), to reduce the negatively charged character of the groove. These residues do not contribute to the head-to-tail interaction in the DIX filament structure, and both the QQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3b</xref>) and KK mutants (data not shown) formed double helical filaments. Remarkably, neither mutant could be solubilized by DAX in the sedimentation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3c</xref>). Also, the mutants showed nearly 100% sedimentation, vs. 80% in the WT case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3c</xref>), suggesting that they are more stable. Both pairs of mutations significantly impaired Dvl2 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3d</xref>). We hypothesize that the acidic residues tune DIX oligomer stability such that it allows incorporation of Axin DAX; the QQ or KK mutations hyperstabilize the double stranded oligomer and thereby prevent binding of Axin indirectly by making the energetic penalty for incorporation much higher than in wild-type DIX. We cannot rule out that the mutations directly affect DAX affinity for DIX, as a recent structure of a non-filament forming DIX-DAX heterodimer revealed that E24 interacts with K789 on DAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamanishi et al., 2019a</xref>). In this scenario, replacing E24 with lysine would be expected to disrupt this interaction, but the glutamine substitution would be tolerated. However, as the QQ and KK mutants display significant and identical TOPFLASH signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3d</xref>), it seems more likely that the E24-K789 interaction does not contribute significantly to the DIX-DAX interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Avidity enables Axin recruitment by Dvl2 to drive signaling</title><p>We hypothesized that the DIX oligomer produced by double strand formation provides avidity (<italic>i.e.</italic>, multiple binding sites) that compensates for the intrinsically weak DAX-DIX interaction. To test this hypothesis, we assayed the ability of Dvl2 constructs bearing varying degrees of affinity and avidity for Axin binding to restore TOPFLASH signaling in Dvl TKO cells. The DIX insertion mutants DIX<sub>60*DE*61</sub> and DIX<sub>64*DC*65</sub> that disrupted the inter-strand interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) also ablated signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Based on this observation, we expected that Dvl2 with its DIX domain replaced by Axin1 DAX, which likewise cannot form double-stranded oligomers, would behave similarly. Remarkably, however, the DAX swap more than quadrupled the signal relative to wild-type DIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We suggest that this result reflects the higher affinity of the DAX-DAX interaction, which can compensate for the loss of avidity resulting from the formation of single-stranded oligomers. This idea is consistent with several observations. First, replacing the Dvl2 DIX domain with the DAX NG or NQ/NG variants, which can form double-stranded oligomers, reduces signaling relative to the WT DAX swap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Also, the hyperstabilized Dvl2 DIX QQ and KK mutants reduce signaling relative to WT DIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). These data indicate that there is a balance between the avidity provided by the double stranded oligomer and the energetic penalty that it produces for binding WT DAX.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Wnt-dependent β-catenin signaling by Dvl2 constructs containing.</title><p>DIX mutants affecting either the intra- (Y27D) or inter- (DC, DE) strand interactions (dark gray); replacement of DIX with wild-type or mutant DAX domains (pink); or addition of heterologous oligomerization domains (Sm1, light gray; Tankrase2 SAM, green) expressed at near-endogenous levels in Dvl triple knockout (TKO) HEK293 cells, as measured by TOPFLASH. Schematic diagrams of the constructs are shown to the left: the portion of Dvl C-terminal to the DIX domain is shown in black, the Dvl DIX domain in blue, the Axin1 DAX domain in pink, the Sm1 heptamerization domain in light gray, and the Tankyrase2 SAM domain in green.

Dvl2 with Sm1 but lacking a DIX domain did not restore signaling, nor did a construct with Sm1 and the non-polymerizing Y27D DIX domain, which can bind DAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamanishi et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, Dvl2 containing both Sm1 and a wild-type DIX domain signaled at ~3 fold higher levels than wild-type Dvl2.

However, while replacing the Dvl2 DIX domain with the non-polymerizing Axin1 DAX Y760D significantly reduced signaling, combining Sm1 with DAX Y760D restored signaling to the same level as that of wild-type Dvl2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). As Y760D can only form a single DAX-DAX interaction with endogenous Axin, this result indicates that Sm1 oligomerization provides a means to recruit a sufficient number of Axin molecules for wild-type level signaling.</p><p>The correlation of signaling with improved Axin recruitment is also supported by the replacement of Dvl2 DIX with the Tankyrase2 SAM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Like DIX domains, SAM domains form head-to-tail assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bienz, 2014</xref>). Although the SAM domain does not bind to Dvl or Axin, it does oligomerize Tankrase2, which in turn binds Axin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mariotti et al., 2016</xref>).

Binding to each end of each strand would result in at most 4 Axin protomers associated with a given Dvl multimer. The TIRF data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>), however, may not distinguish binding of Axin to the ends of a short, pre-existing DIX oligomer versus severing of small oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) in a subpopulation of molecules. These scenarios are not mutually exclusive. Severing would be consistent with the weakened signaling of the E22Q/E24Q and E22K/E24K mutants, which appear to form hyperstabilized filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Severing might also explain the observation that mild overexpression of Dvl did not significantly affect wingless signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>). Crucially, capping and/or severing are distinct from models in which the Axin interaction with Dvl occurs by co-polymerization of DAX and DIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bienz, 2014</xref>), which would not limit the number of Axin molecules associated with Dvl.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Dvl DIX oligomerization in Axin recruitment upon Wnt signaling.</title><p>(Upper left) Schematic diagram of Dvl primary structure and association of Dvl DIX into an oligomer. A Dvl DIX oligomer provides up to four binding sites for Axin, one at each end of each paired strand. (Lower left) In the absence of Wnt signaling, self-association of the Axin DAX domain and multivalent interactions of Axin with APC create a crosslinked, possibly phase separated, destruction complex with multiple copies of the constituent proteins. (Right) The Dvl DEP domain (green oval) binds to Fzd and the Dvl oligomer associates with up to 4 Axin DAX domains. GSK-3 bound to Axin generates its own inhibitor by phosphorylating the LRP5/6 cytoplasmic tail. Axin DAX binding to the ends of the DIX oligomer provides an optimal relative stoichiometry of GSK-3–bound Axin and LRP5/6 to enable efficient inhibition of GSK-3. Some bound Axin molecules as well as DEP domains from the Dvl oligomer may interact with other receptor complexes, thereby producing a crosslinked signalosome.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55015-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Wnt binding results in recruitment of Axin to the receptor complex in a Dvl-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe et al., 2003</xref>), and prior models have postulated that Wnt binding to Fzd and LRP5/6 promotes Dvl oligomerization needed for Axin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gammons et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gammons et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>). However, our TIRF data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>), as well as those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2020</xref>, indicate that there is not a major change in the oligomeric state of Dvl at the membrane upon Wnt activation. Thus, how Wnt binding to its receptors ‘activates’ Dvl for Axin recruitment remains unclear. Although we did not detect a statistically significant effect of Wnt stimulation on Dvl2 oligomer size, we do not rule out a change in oligomeric state that retains the same total number of Dvl molecules in a diffraction-limited spot. We also cannot formally rule out that a much larger Dvl oligomer forms transiently upon Wnt signaling and is subsequently severed by Axin. Improved imaging with high time resolution may allow us to address these possibilities.</p><p>The DIX-DIX interaction has a K<sub>D</sub> in the 5–20 μM range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamanishi et al., 2019a</xref>), and our data are consistent with this estimate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>). Attempts to measure DAX-DAX or DAX-DIX affinities have employed head-to-tail mutants with the goal of isolating the affinity of a single interface. These experiments have suggested K<sub>D</sub> values much weaker than that of DIX-DIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fiedler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamanishi et al., 2019a</xref>). The filament disruption experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) indicate that the affinity of the heterotypic DIX-DAX interaction is on the same order as that of DIX-DIX. However, our SEC-MALS data indicate that the DAX-DAX interaction is roughly an order of magnitude stronger than that of DIX-DIX or DIX-DAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). The mutants used in the other studies of DAX-DAX interactions may have effects beyond the presumed simple disruption of the head-to-tail interface; for example, interfaces may be energetically coupled, rather than independent of one another as is assumed in the mutational experiments.</p><p>The β-catenin destruction complex is thought to be assembled by oligomerization of Axin through its DAX domain and binding of Axin to APC. The complex may be a phase-separated structure that enables efficient β-catenin destruction due to the high local concentration of its enzymes and substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schaefer and Peifer, 2019</xref>). Scaffold proteins with multiple binding sites for each other can crosslink to form phase separated structures; if one component is in excess, however, the crosslinking probability is diminished and phase separation does not occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banani et al., 2016</xref>). Imaging of Axin and APC overexpressed in mammalian cells has revealed roughly equal amounts of the two proteins in destruction complex puncta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>). Given that APCs contain multiple Axin-binding SAMP repeats and a conserved self-association region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kunttas-Tatli et al., 2014</xref>), the limited DAX oligomerization observed in vitro seems well-matched to the number of Axin binding sites in APC, consistent with the proposed phase separation. The ability of β-catenin to bind to both APC and Axin simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ha et al., 2004</xref>) also introduces a third component potentially capable of crosslinking these structures. Axin is present at about 150 nM in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tan et al., 2012</xref>), which would predict no DAX oligomerization based on our estimated K<sub>D</sub> for DAX-DAX association. However, the ability of other regions of Axin and APC to interact, as well as the effects of the crowded cellular environment, may enhance the effective DAX-DAX affinity. The amount of Axin in endogenous destruction complex puncta in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos is estimated to be in the 10’s-100’s of molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>). An in vivo analysis in which Axin was overexpressed approximately 4x indicated that DAX is not absolutely essential for destruction complex function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peterson-Nedry et al., 2008</xref>); perhaps the multiple Axin-binding sites in APC, combined with the elevated concentration of Axin and the ability of β-catenin to bind both Axin and APC, provided sufficient crosslinking to enable destruction complex function in that case. Also, in the absence of Wnt signal, overexpression of Axin or APC has little effect on β-catenin destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>), which may indicate that the system is sufficiently efficient that increasing either component beyond normal level has no significant effect on destruction.</p><p>Although the DAX domain may not be absolutely necessary for destruction complex function in vivo, it is essential for turning off destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peterson-Nedry et al., 2008</xref>), highlighting the importance of the Axin-Dvl interaction. The stronger DAX-DAX homotypic interaction compared to DIX-DAX may prevent disruption of the destruction complex by cytoplasmic Dvl in the absence of a Wnt signal. Dvl DIX oligomerization likely confers increased avidity on Dvl binding to Axin, which would be needed to overcome the stronger homotypic DAX-DAX interaction and thereby recruit the destruction complex to the activated receptors. This is consistent with the observation that modest (~3x) overexpression of Axin can be tolerated during fly development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peterson-Nedry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), whereas higher (8-9x) levels will turn off signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Willert et al., 1999</xref>). Upon signaling, activation of Dvl results in the high-avidity binding of DAX to DIX needed to effectively recruit the destruction complex to the receptor complex and disrupt the function of the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Such a model explains the observation that substituting DAX for DIX in Dvl greatly enhances signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), as the higher self-affinity of Axin DAX would more readily recruit Axin to the receptor complex. Conversely, the loop insertion mutants that disrupt DIX oligomerization, and the inter-strand Dvl DIX mutants, which do not oligomerize to the same extent as wild-type DIX, may reduce signaling by lowering the effective avidity for Axin, although we cannot rule out that they directly impair the Axin-binding interface, particularly the loop insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The observation that the Sm1 heptamer can rescue signaling in a non-oligomerizing Dvl2 mutant (Sm1-DAX<sub>Y760D</sub>-Dvl2), which can still form a single head-to-tail heterodimer with Axin, also supports the notion that avidity has an important role in recruiting Axin to the receptor complex. The equivalent fusion with DIX Y27D does not rescue, which can be attributed to the much weaker DIX-DAX interaction.</p><p>The limit of four Axin-binding sites per activated Dvl oligomer in a single receptor complex may provide an optimal stoichiometry for inhibition of GSK-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The cellular concentrations of Axin and GSK-3 have been reported to lie in the tens–hundreds of nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tan et al., 2012</xref>). We have measured the affinity of GSK-3 and Axin to be K<sub>D</sub> = 8 nM (MDE and WIW, manuscript in preparation), implying that essentially all Axin brought to the activated receptor complex will be bound to GSK-3. A single phosphorylated LRP6 motif can inhibit GSK-3 with a K<sub>i</sub> of 2 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stamos et al., 2014</xref>). Five inhibitory motifs in the LRP5/6 tail cooperate in Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacDonald et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wolf et al., 2008</xref>), and it is not known how many GSK-3 molecules can be stably inhibited by one phosphorylated tail. Multiple motifs could be needed to ensure high rebinding probability of GSK-3 to achieve highly effective inhibition; alternatively, each motif could inhibit a GSK-3 molecule. In any case, there cannot be a great excess of GSK-3 relative to LRP5/6 for efficient inhibition of GSK-3. Therefore, a limited number of Axin/GSK-3 complexes associated with a single Fzd-LRP5/6 complex could maximize the GSK-3 inhibitory activity of an activated receptor complex.</p><p>The preceding analysis considered the relative stoichiometry of a single LRP5/6–Fzd/Dvl complex with Axin-GSK-3. However, multiple phosphorylated LRP5/6 molecules may be needed to stabilize enough β-catenin molecules to trigger target gene activation. It has been suggested that the activated ‘signalosome’ is a crosslinked, perhaps phase separated, structure that would include multiple copies of the receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gammons and Bienz, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schaefer and Peifer, 2019</xref>). The presence of &lt;10 Dvl molecules in the puncta observed in our and other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2020</xref>) TIRF experiments, and the binding of Axin DAX to the ends of Dvl DIX oligomers, indicates that there are likely to be roughly matched numbers of Axin and Dvl associated with the activated receptors. This would provide the appropriate relative stoichiometry to optimize crosslinking needed for a functional signalosome. It is important to note, however, that understanding the precise connection of the properties of the isolated DIX and DAX domains to the behavior of Dvl and Axin will require experiments using purified, full-length proteins. For example, both proteins have large unstructured regions and are also regulated by post-translational modifications, features that could contribute to phase separation behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Owen and Shewmaker, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Snead and Gladfelter, 2019</xref>). Moreover, it is possible that other regions of the Dvl protein affect the extent of DIX domain oligomerization, and likewise there may be intramolecular regulation of the Axin DAX domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, 10’s-100’s of Axin molecules were found in puncta present in Wnt stimulated <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryo cells when Axin was expressed at about 4x endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>). The reason for the difference with our measurements is not clear, but it may indicate a significant concentration dependence of oligomerization, or perhaps that different regulatory mechanisms operate in the fly and mammalian systems. Moving forward, it will be essential to determine experimentally the relative numbers and regulatory states of receptors, Dvl and Axin in a signalosome.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Harvested cell pellets were washed with ice cold 1x PBS and collected to be frozen with liquid nitrogen for storage at −80°C. Prior to lysis, for every 2L of culture, DNAse I (12 units; MilliporeSigma D5025) supplemented with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> was added to cells resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Hepes pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 4 mM dithiothreitol (GoldBio). Lysis was performed using an Emulsiflex homogenizer (Avestin, Toronto ON) with two passes through ice water-chilled tubing at a target pressure of 15,000–20,000 psi. Clarified lysate was collected after 50,000 x g centrifugation for 30 min and batch-bound for 1 hr under gentle rotation onto a pre-equilibrated agarose column at 10 mL bed resin per 1L culture. The loaded column was then washed with the same lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mM EDTA and 500 mM NaCl under gravity flow and re-equilibrated. Amylose agarose (New England BioLabs, Ipswich MA) and glutathione agarose resin (Pierce, Waltham MA) were used for purifying MBP-tagged and GST-tagged proteins, respectively.</p><p>All purification steps were carried out at 4°C or on ice.

An additional filter cube (679 nm/41 nm, 700 nm/75 nm for Alexa Fluor 647 imaging; 470 nm/40 nm, 495 nm LP, 525 nm/50 nm for GFP imaging) was included before the camera in the light path. All analyzed images were taken at 100 ms exposure time using the full chip of a Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4.0 camera (chip size 2048 × 2048 pixels). The average background in different ~20 μm boxes varied ~10% over the field of view.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>TIRF imaging of purified DIX filament severing by DAX</title><p>For fluorescent labeling of DIX at Cys80 (the only Cys in the MBP-DIX construct), 500 μL of His<sub>6</sub>-MBP-DIX at ~10 mg/mL was exchanged into buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 4 mM TCEP using a 2 mL 7,000 MWCO Zeba spin desalting column (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham MA). The protein was incubated with 40 μL of 10 mM AlexaFluor-647 C<sub>2</sub> maleimide (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham MA) (stock dissolved in DMSO) overnight at 4°C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of DTT to a final concentration of 10 mM, and the protein was cleaved for one hour at room temperature by adding 0.5 mg/mL TEV protease at 1:35 v/v. Labeled filaments were further purified using size-exclusion chromatography with a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL gel filtration column in lysis buffer containing 1 mM EDTA. Functionality of labeled DIX filaments was verified by negative stain EM, resistance to serial dilution and DAX solubilization assays (data not shown). Dye coupling efficiency to DIX Cys80 was &gt;50% based on the relative extinction coefficients of the protein and dye.</p><p>A total of four replicate imaging experiments were performed, two per day, using two separate preparations of DIX filaments and a single DAX preparation. For each experiment, Alexa 647 labeled DIX filaments were incubated with (experimental) or without (control) DAX at room temperature for ~1 hr (sample 1) or ~1.30–2 hr (sample 2) before the start of imaging. Samples were placed in 35 mm glass bottom dishes with 14 mm micro-wells (#1.5 cover glass) from Cellvis. Each micro-well was prepared by first washing with DIX gel filtration buffer (‘DIX buffer’) at least three times, then filled with 100 μl DIX buffer. A 1 μl sample containing 10 μM DIX with or without 50 μM DAX was diluted 1:100 with DIX buffer and immediately added to the micro-well for a final dilution of 1:200. After a 30 s incubation, the micro-well was washed at least six times by two-fold dilution with buffer to wash away free proteins in solution and left in 100 μl buffer before placing the micro-well on the microscope. Imaging started 1–5 min after washing and was completed within 1–5 min. Most of the images were taken by walking the stage diagonally across from one corner of the coverslip to the other, avoiding regions that had been previously bleached. For replicate 1, we imaged the control before the experimental sample and did the reverse for replicate 2. Imaging was performed at laser powers out of the objective of 0.44 mW (day 1) and 5.1 mW (day 2). The results from the two days were similar, so we concluded the data are not strongly dependent on laser power over this range.</p><p>Images were processed in FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Each pair within a replicate had 18 to 63 image frames. The mean gray values MGVs of each frame were recorded. We compared the distribution of MGVs using the Mann–Whitney U test, which gave p&lt;0.05 for each replicate. A bootstrapping test was run to reject the null hypothesis that the means were not different. We resampled data points for each condition within a pair and recorded the difference of means 5000 times. The distribution for each replicate indicated a positive difference of means (experimental case with higher background) for the middle 95% of each replicate.</p><p>We recorded the ratio of the means for each replicate. We used bootstrapping (resampling 5000 times) to get a distribution for the means that was fit to a Gaussian. The standard deviation of each mean was propagated to produce error values for each ratio of means. The 4 values of the ratio of means were then averaged to get the mean ratio of means with errors from the previous step propagated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Immunofluorescent staining for β-catenin accumulation</title><p>Dvl2-GFP/dsRed-Axin1 HEK293 cells were seeded at ∼60% confluence in Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc 177380) that were pre-coated with 0.1 mg/mL poly-D-lysine (Sigma P6407). The following day, the cells were washed with Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Gibco 24020117) and then treated at 37°C with L cell control or Wnt3A-containing conditioned media for 2 hr. At the end of treatment, cells at room temperature were fixed for 10 min with 2% formaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences 15710), and permeabilized for one hour with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Biorad 1610407) supplemented with 1% BSA (Sigma). Cells were then stained overnight at 4°C with AlexaFluor 647-conjugated anti-β-catenin antibody L54E2 at 1:300 dilution supplemented with 3% BSA (2677S, Cell Signaling). Between and after each of these steps, cells were washed three times with HBSS, which was also used to make up each reagent. Sample mounting was achieved using ProLong glass antifade mountant with NucBlue (Invitrogen P36983), and each chamber was sealed with a glass coverslip. Cell epifluorescence was imaged at 60x and AlexaFluor647 was detected on the Cy5 channel. For every condition, 5–7 fields of view, each with ~100 cells, were acquired under the same exposure. Mean gray values (MGVs) at the center of each frame were measured and tallied per condition for comparison as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1d</xref>.</p><p>The collection of the MGVs in the center (1000-by-1000 pixels) of each frame in the ±Wnt conditions were significantly different as assessed by the Mann-Whitney U test (p&lt;0.05).

The middle 95% of the resulting mean difference distribution was positive indicating a significant rise in β-catenin levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Cell culture for live cell imaging</title><p>For the short-term epifluorescent live cell imaging and the apical single molecule localization microscopy assay, HEK293T Dvl2-GFP/Axin1-RFP cells were passaged no more than two times after expansion, incubated in sterile-filtered DMEM media containing phenol red (15 mg/L), high glucose (4500 mg/L), L-glutamine (584 mg/L) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11965092), with added 10% FBS, Sodium Pyruvate (110 mg/L), and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15140122). Cells were passaged through splitting by cell dissociation using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, 25200056) and subculturing. L control conditioned media, and L Wnt3A-conditioned media are described above in the Wnt signaling assay section. For the long-term epifluorescent live cell imaging, the cells were passaged 3 to 4 times in DMEM based media with same supplements as above but with HEPES based CO<sub>2</sub>-independent buffering (5958 mg/L) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 21063045) instead of phenol red.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Epifluorescence microscope</title><p>An inverted Nikon Ti-E microscope was controlled using Micromanager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edelstein et al., 2014</xref>). The microscope was connected to a pre-equilibrated heating chamber set to 37°C and equipped with a Perfect Focus System, a Heliophor light engine (89 North) and an Andor sCMOS Neo camera. We utilized two objective lenses: a CFI Plan Apo Lambda x40 0.95 air objective lens; and a CFI Plan Apo Lambda x60 1.40 air objective lens.

Before imaging, we changed one well each from the passaging or L control media into L Wnt3A-conditioned media. Multiple regions of the Wnt-stimulated cells were imaged at 60x magnification at 10–20 min and 40–50 min. We also imaged multiple regions of the control cells at the start and end of the experiment. All fluorescence images used for manual counting were acquired with 300 ms exposures.</p><p>For long-term epifluorescence imaging (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), cells were seeded overnight in a 24-well glass bottom plate (FisherScientific NC0397150).

Two sets of experiments were run. In the first set, cells were imaged before and after stimulation with Wnt3A conditioned media, whereas the second set were replicates using only Wnt3A stimulated cells. In the first set, cells were seeded overnight in passaging media on the outer facing part of the filter of transwell inserts (12 mm Transwell, 0.4 µm Pore Polyester Membrane Insert, Corning, 3460). The transwells were kept inverted in 6-well flat bottom plates to ensure cell settling (Corning CoStar, 3506) and incubated in ~200 μL media for 1–2 days. The empty wells were filled with media for humidity. Whenever needed, the 6-well plate lid was placed and removed with care to avoid perturbing the media sandwiched between the lid and the transwell tops. Before imaging, a 35 mm glass bottom dish with 20 mm micro-well (#1.5 cover glass) (Cellvis, D35-20-1.5-N) was equilibrated at 37°C with 1.5 ml passaging media. The transwell in the experiment was inverted gently using tweezers into a 12-well flat bottom plate (Corning CoStar, 3512) that was used as a stable carrier for transfer to imaging room, with cells apical side down inside ~0.5 ml passaging media. Immediately after inversion, 1 ml passaging media was added to the inside of the transwell filters. A custom designed 3D printed holder allowed stable placement of the glass bottom dish on the microscope. After removal of the lids of the plate and the glass bottom dish, the transwell insert was quickly and gently transferred with sterile tweezers onto the micro-well, with cells still apical side down. The perfect focus system would not always work as desired with the transwell insert above the glass, and it was sometimes necessary to find the correct plane before placement of the insert onto the micro-well. Imaging commenced immediately following placement of the transwell insert. After imaging a number of regions, the transwell insert was gently lifted, the micro-well was spiked with 0.5 ml L Wnt3A-conditioned media equilibrated at 37°C, and the transwell insert was gently positioned back. Imaging continued for up to ~70 min.</p><p>In each of the five experimental pools, 4–11 analyzed fields of view with multiple cells were imaged, each for about fifty to a few hundred frames. We used multiple configurations: a) 2–3 different TIRF angles, b) focus centered as close to the coverslip as possible or slightly above (~200 nm), c) at two different blue laser powers (3 mW and ~5 mW out of the objective). Regions were not necessarily illuminated by the strongest part of the TIRF field due to separation from the cover glass, yet we were still able to image at high signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p>During this first set of experiments, we noticed that lifting the PET filter and flowing in Wnt3A-conditioned media into the microwell occasionally caused cell blebbing. We also sought to investigate the case where both sides of the cells were exposed to Wnt3A-conditioned media. Thus, the protocol was slightly altered for the second set of experiments. We seeded the cells on transwell inserts into media conditioned by control L cells instead of the passaging media. Before imaging, the glass bottom dish was filled with 1.5 ml L cell Wnt3A-conditioned media, and the inside of the transwell was also filled in with 1 ml L cell Wnt3A-conditioned media while in the 12-well carrier plate, with the time of first Wnt3A exposure noted. Within ~2 min, the transwell insert was gently placed on to the micro-well (filled with L cell Wnt3A-conditioned media), and then imaged.</p><p>We pooled data from videos according to the following criteria: The first 40 frames (100 ms exposure per frame) were pooled when belonging to movies recorded the same day, with the same laser power and approximate TIRF angle and condition (with or without L cell Wnt3A-conditioned media treatment). This produced 2 pools of data without and three pools with L cell Wnt3A-conditioned media treatment. When analyzing data from L cell Wnt3A-conditioned media-treated cells, we pooled all videos starting at 9 min after the addition of L cell Wnt3A-conditioned media.</p><p>The 40 frames for each region in a given pool were processed in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) to apply a rolling ball background filter (five pixel/325 nm diameter). We cropped out large empty regions where there were no cells in the TIRF field. We then used u-track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>) in Matlab in order to extract single particle trajectories. We optimized the detection and tracking parameters and confirmed reasonable tracking by eye. Specifically, for detection, we chose the single particle detection with Gaussian mixture model fitting option with a Gaussian standard deviation one pixel. We selected rolling window time-averaging of window size five and an alpha-value of 0.05 for comparison with local background. For tracking, the maximum gap to close was set to four frames.</p><p>The output from u-track was analyzed using custom Matlab code. For each pool, we extracted spot trajectories 10 frames or longer which was helpful in getting rid of the background from the media while keeping most of the true positives. We recorded the intensity at the starting frame of those trajectories. Theoretically, for the subpopulation of spots with <italic>n</italic> fluorophores, the background subtracted intensity distribution will be a single Gaussian, peaking roughly at <italic>n</italic> times the mean intensity of a single fluorophore. Thus, the intensity distribution from the ensemble of spots was fit to a Gaussian mixture model for one through N components using the built-in ‘fitgmdist’ function with 100 replicates and a maximum of 500 iterations, and the number of components minimizing Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was selected. N, the largest number of possible components tested for a given pool, was always set larger than the number of components eventually found to provide the best fit (all cases with BIC and some with AIC), or alternatively one less than the number of components that frequently resulted in ill-conditioned covariances in every replicate of a run (as sometimes occurred with AIC). While the criteria resulted in fits different in the number of mixture components and their means, they gave similar final normalized distributions (see below), with 90% of the spot intensities being within 10x of a single GFP intensity in both cases. The plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref> utilizes BIC for model selection.</p><p>Due to the observed cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the HEK293T Dvl2-GFP/Axin1-RFP cell line, the limitations of the GFP tag, and the possibility of the Dvl2 complex size having a highly skewed distribution, we did not focus on the proportions of different mixture components which would map to different proportions of complex sizes. Instead, we treated the difference of the two smallest mixture component means from the fit as the single GFP mean intensity value, subtracted the background value this implied from its difference from the minimum mixture component mean, and then normalized the intensity axis accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). The single GFP value for each pool was always smaller (within ~2 fold in the BIC case) than the smallest mixture component mean, which we attribute to imperfect background subtraction, and bleaching within camera exposures. We note that we expect a typical maturation efficiency of 90% for eGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cormack et al., 1996</xref>) to affect our estimations for numbers of molecules by ~10%.</p><p>Fluorescence images and FIJI macros are available upon request.

Using cryo-EM, the authors determined the oligomer structure of Dvl2 DIX and revealed that Dvl2 DIX form a two-stranded, antiparallel oligomer. The cryo-EM structure also reveals the molecular basis governing the inter-strand interactions that stabilize the double strand conformation of Dvl2 DIX. The authors went on to discover that the Axin DIX domain (DAX) can break/sever Dvl2 DIX oligomer via capping the ends of the Dvl2 DIX oligomer, which is a rather unexpected finding. The authors showed that formation of small Axin/Dvl2 DIX heteroligomer is critical for the transcriptional activity of Dvl2 in a cell-based assay. Finally, the authors provided evidence showing that in living cells the endogenous Dvl2 only form small oligomers (with 10 or less protomers) regardless of Wnt signal stimulation. With these findings, the authors proposed a new model showing how DIX domain-mediated Dvl/Axin oligomerization can transduce Wnt signaling.</p><p>The results presented in the current study are potentially interesting and valuable for understanding Wnt signaling. However, the manuscript contains a number of issues as detailed below. These issues dampen the rigorous of the conclusions drawn, and thus will need to be addressed.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) Figure 1B and C: the pellet fraction of Dvl2 DIX was observed to increase as a function of protein concentration decrease at the protein concentrations below 6.25 µM. Why could this occur? Related to the above point, the dilution experiment shown in Figure 1D is also strange. At the intermediate dilution folds (e.g. around the final concentration ~3.7 µM), one can see obvious depolymerizations of Dvl2 DIX oligomer. Such depolymerization seems to be less obvious at both high and low final concentrations of the dilution experiment.</p><p>2) Figure 2C: The labeling of the figure needs to be improved. It will be helpful for recognizing the head and tail of each subunit in Figure 2C if the secondary structure unit of one protomer (e.g. the brown one at the upper left corner) can be labeled. Similarly, it would help if the strand names containing Y27 and K68 in Figure 2D are labeled. Similarly, secondary structures in Figures 3B and D should be labeled for easy reading.</p><p>3) Figure 3 and 4: The SEC analysis in the two figures are complicated by the cleaved MBP in the mixtures. For example, the authors state that the Y27D mutant of Dvl2 DIX is a monomer, but the elution peak overlaps with the MBP tag, which is considerably larger than the monomeric Dvl2 DIX. The authors should remove MBP from the cleaved protein mixtures and re-analyze the elution behaviors of the mutants.</p><p>4) Figure 3: The G65D mutant is interesting as the mutation seems to disrupt both inter- and intra-strand protomer DIX interaction. This brings up two issues: the mutation cannot really be used to support the inter-strand interaction observed in the cryo-EM structure; and the mutation might have a large overall folding perturbation of the Dvl2 DIX protomer. The authors should check the folding of the G65D mutant. Additionally, the G65D mutant, though not capable of forming DIX oligomers, showed a comparable level of transcriptional activity to that of the M60A mutant (Figure 3C). This will need to be explained.</p><p>5) Figure 4 and paragraph describing data in Figure 4 (subsection “Axin DAX oligomerizes through a head-to-tail interface but does not form large polymers”) is confusing. If the pink elution profile was obtained for DAX at 180 µM, why the highest concentration tested was only 24 µM? Even for the lowest concentration (0.7 µM) analyzed, the peak would likely be an ensemble average of different oligomerization states of DAX instead of simple monomer/dimer equilibrium. If this is true, estimation of apparent Kd of 0.7 μm would not be appropriate. Consequently, a number of places in the manuscript concerning the affinity of DAX association will need to be re-written.</p><p>6) Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D (related to the question concerning Figures 3 and 4): It appears that each cleaved Dvl2 DIX mutant was eluted as an oligomer and a smaller multimer on SEC column. This is a bit odd. Do these two populations exchange? Or each population is trapped in their kinetically stable form?</p><p>7) Figure 5A: why ~40% of Dvl2 DIX was recovered in the pellet/filament form even in the presence of very high concentration of DAX? Related to this question, it would be informative to perform an SEC analysis of Dvl2 DIX with increasing concentrations of DAX (or Y760D DAX) to check the hetero-DIX oligomer formation status.</p><p>8) The data for the &quot;Avidity for Axin enhances signaling&quot; and Figure 4D is not convincing and interpretation is tentative. The data seem to indicate that as long as Dvl2 and Axin can form heteromer, the Dvl2 activity can be realized. Additionally, the enhanced heteromer formation between Dvl2 and Axin seems to promote Dvl2 transcription activity. The use of TNKS2-SAM potentially brings in another indirect binder to the system. The interpretation presented in the current manuscript based on the data at the present form is one of many possibilities. It would be nice to use a pair of small heterodimer forming protein domains to replace Dvl2 and Axin DIX domains, respectively, and then to repeat the transcription assay. This is a demanding experiment, the authors should at least consider similar line of assay or any assay that would provide a more definitive result to support their model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Wnt signaling is one of the handful of signaling pathways that play key roles in embryonic development, tissue homeostasis and which go wrong in cancer. While the field created an outline of the signaling pathway two decades ago, many unanswered questions remain. The key regulated effector is the protein β-catenin, which, in the absence of Wnt ligands, is targeted for phosphorylation and ultimate proteolytic destruction by the multiprotein destruction complex. One key open question involves the molecular mechanisms by which Wnt ligands turn down destruction complex activity. This requires the cytosolic effector Dvl, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. One critical issue is whether and how Dsh:Dsh, Axin:Axin, and Dsh:Axin multimerization regulate the balance of destruction complex activity. Here Weis and colleagues present the results of a multidisciplinary tour-de-force investigation, combining cryo-EM, powerful analytical biochemistry, and in vivo functional and imaging observations. They present some very intriguing new insights, revealing the polymerization of Dsh's DIX domain into anti-parallel double helical filaments, careful investigation of the parameters of polymerization in the presence and absence of Axin, clever structure-based mutational analyses that reveal important features of homo- and hetero-polymerization, combined with in vivo assays of function. These data provide a firm biochemical basis and important molecular constraints for previous speculative models for Dsh/Axin interactions, significantly advancing our understanding of this key signaling pathway. In general, their data are lovely, well controlled and quantitatively analyzed, and their conclusions well founded. As I lay out below, I think at times they are a bit to enamored with their in vitro data, making broad conclusions about events in vivo that could be presented in a more nuanced way by considering other data in the field. With these and some other minor modifications, I think this work will be of exceptional interest to cell, developmental and cancer biologists.</p><p>Data issues</p><p>Figure 1. This was lovely work but I found one thing puzzling. Why was the pelleting profile of Dsh biphasic, with significant pelleting at low concentrations (&lt;1µm)?</p><p>Figures 2-4. As I will note below in comments on the model, the authors come down very firmly on the idea that the &quot;active&quot; Dsh is in short polymers of less than 10 monomers. Their structural studies are stunning, and the revelation of a double-stranded filament exceptionally interesting. However, the cryo-EM images reveal long filaments and the SEC shows a broad peak of sizes. Further, the comparison with the DAX domain and its associated SEC-MALS data (7-8 monomers per polymer) suggest much longer filaments in solution for the DIX domain. Did they do SEC-MALS for the DIX domain? I imagine the answer is more nuanced than is currently implied, and the authors should discuss this more clearly.</p><p>Figure 4 and subsection “Axin DAX oligomerizes through a head-to-tail interface but does not form large polymers”. The current work contrasts in some important ways with recent published work from the Bienz lab and colleagues (Yamanishi et al., 2019). Both report affinities for DIX:DIX, DAX:DAX, and DIX:DAX interactions, but the results are different. In one case DIX:DIX affinities are highest and in the other DAX:DAX affinities are highest. This issue comes back again in the discussion of the work in Figure 5, which is interpreted to suggest that DAX:DIX interactions are weaker than either homomeric interaction, something not supported by the Yamanishi data. This is quite important for their modeling and while they do mention it, they don't offer any thoughts on this difference. More discussion of the Yamanishi data would inform the work.</p><p>Figure 5A,B. The authors state &quot;Surprisingly, addition of Axin DAX reduced Dvl2 DIX filament size to the point that they no longer sediment (Figure 5A,B).&quot; However, the data presented are much more subtle/nuanced. Even at a 5:1 DAX:DIX ratio, 40% of the DIX domain still pellets. These data contrast with their Yes/NO conclusion and with the data from TIRF. Their conclusion that DAX disrupts DIX filaments is solid but not as clear-cut as it is portrayed. This then is codified in speculative Figure 5D, which needs to be more clearly portrayed as one potential model of many, especially as it presents a quite different view than the section head which suggests filament &quot;capping&quot;, not insertion into an existing filament.</p><p>Subsection “Avidity for Axin enhances signaling”: Figure 4D. The experiments here are quite interesting but I'd suggest pulling the data out of Figure 4D and making a stand-alone Figure with diagrams illustrating the nature of the complex constructs tested here.</p><p>Figure 6 and subsection “The size of Dvl oligomers is limited in cells”. Here the authors try to bridge their lovely biochemical and structural data with imaging data in vivo. This is also a place where caveats are important. The authors clearly show that in this system, with Dvl expressed at near endogenous levels, that it does not form &quot;large&quot; cytoplasmic puncta. This is solid, though most current models would predict that biologically relevant Dvl puncta would likely be at the membrane. The TIRF experiments provide a means to search for these. Here there are clearly &quot;small&quot; spots, which the authors maintain contain &quot;small numbers of GFPs&quot;. Their use of single molecule tracking to estimate GFP number in particles was interesting, but needs to be better explained for the reader. Further, they are constrained to look at the apical surface and it is unclear, at least from this work, where Wnt receptor complexes are located and thus if these spots reflect &quot;active&quot; Dvl.</p><p>Places where models could be tempered or additional information included:</p><p>Introduction. The Introduction could be broadened, to more clearly set the stage of the new work. Given the participation of the Bienz lab and the subsequent focus of the paper on multimerization, I was surprised that the Introduction did not more clearly lay out the previous view that the &quot;signalosome&quot; is a multimeric entity, referencing in more detail the previous literature. On a more minor point they should mention that Axin the phosphorylated tail of LRP5/6 also participates in recruiting Axin into the signalosome. The other area that could be included is a contrast with the active destruction complex, highlighting work by the Bienz lab and others suggesting that APC and Dsh may compete for Axin binding, with APC promoting destruction complex assembly and Dsh its disassembly.</p><p>The authors in their title and Abstract emphasize the idea of &quot;Limited Dishevelled/Axin oligomerization&quot; and that &quot;Dvl forms oligomers typically &lt;10 molecules at endogenous expression levels.&quot; The degree to which the Wnt receptors and the active destruction complex form larger scale entities, perhaps biomolecular condensates, is an area of active discussion in the field, and, in interests of full disclosure, one in which our lab has a direct interest. I think a revised discussion that more directly addresses different views in the field in light of this new data would be appropriate. Some issues to address. 1) In support of their data, previous work by the Wehrli lab provided a surprising and often ignored data point-an Axin mutant lacking its DIX domain was still functional in mediating β-catenin destruction (at least as assessed by cell fates) but could not be turned OFF. This supports the idea that the DIX:DAX interaction is key to turning down the destruction complex. 2) As the authors note in the last paragraph of the Discussion and as the Bienz lab has previously argued, considerable data support the idea that activated Wnt receptors form a &quot;signalosome&quot;, perhaps by phase transition. By focusing so much on the limited size of Dvl oligomers, they miss a chance to discuss this work. These data now include imaging of endogenous Dvl puncta in Wnt-ON cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, and its co-localization in puncta in Wnt on cells with Axin which it is expressed at near-endogenous levels (3x wildtype; Schaefer et al., 2018). 3) One possibility that would reconcile different views is that oligomerization is both sharply concentration dependent and also regulated in vivo. Their work, while lovely, largely relies on in vitro studies of the isolated DIX and DAX domains, and does not include either other domains of the same protein or their in vivo partners. Work from the Bienz lab and our lab suggest, for example, that Dsh and APC exert contrasting effects on the &quot;stability&quot; of Axin polymers. Data from Schaefer et al., 2018, suggest that when expressed in vivo at 2-3 fold endogenous concentrations, Axin forms complexes containing tens to hundreds of molecules, and that Wnt signaling regulates this assembly state. The authors should be free to state their own views and argue their position, but I think a more complete discussion that lays out these contrasting views would be more informative for the reader.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55015.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this study, Kan et al., characterized the structural properties of the DIX domains from Dvl2 and Axin. Using cryo-EM, the authors determined the oligomer structure of Dvl2 DIX and revealed that Dvl2 DIX form a two-stranded, antiparallel oligomer. The cryo-EM structure also reveals the molecular basis governing the inter-strand interactions that stabilize the double strand conformation of Dvl2 DIX. The authors went on to discover that the Axin DIX domain (DAX) can break/sever Dvl2 DIX oligomer via capping the ends of the Dvl2 DIX oligomer, which is a rather unexpected finding. The authors showed that formation of small Axin/Dvl2 DIX heteroligomer is critical for the transcriptional activity of Dvl2 in a cell-based assay. Finally, the authors provided evidence showing that in living cells the endogenous Dvl2 only form small oligomers (with 10 or less protomers) regardless of Wnt signal stimulation. With these findings, the authors proposed a new model showing how DIX domain-mediated Dvl/Axin oligomerization can transduce Wnt signaling.</p><p>The results presented in the current study are potentially interesting and valuable for understanding Wnt signaling. However, the manuscript contains a number of issues as detailed below. These issues dampen the rigorous of the conclusions drawn, and thus will need to be addressed.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) Figure 1B and C: the pellet fraction of Dvl2 DIX was observed to increase as a function of protein concentration decrease at the protein concentrations below 6.25 µM. Why could this occur? Related to the above point, the dilution experiment shown in Figure 1D is also strange. At the intermediate dilution folds (e.g. around the final concentration ~3.7 µM), one can see obvious depolymerizations of Dvl2 DIX oligomer. Such depolymerization seems to be less obvious at both high and low final concentrations of the dilution experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been a concern of ours, and we believe that at low concentrations there is non-specific pelleting of the DIX protein, as we found that addition of 0.05% Tween reduced this background. However, the Tween affected the sedimentation of filaments at some intermediate concentrations (e.g. 25 μM) for reasons that are not clear, as points below and above this were essentially the same as what we observed without Tween. Although going to longer centrifugation times seemed to alleviate this problem, we did not have time to systematically vary different conditions (we are now shut down due to the COVID-19 restrictions). In any case, comparison of the formation assays run with (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and without (Figure 1) Tween show that the Tween does not significantly alter the concentration-dependence of filament formation. Thus, while we are including a plot quantifying the replicates done with Tween in this response (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), we feel confident in leaving the original data from the experiments done in the absence of Tween in the main text. This provides a more direct comparison with the DAX solubilization assays shown in Figure 6, which were also done without detergent. We have also removed the lowest-concentration data point in the formation assay from both the plot and the corresponding gel that was shown in the original submission, as the experiments done in the presence of Tween make it clear that the pelleting at that point is nonspecific.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of filament formation data in the presence of 0.05% Tween.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55015-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In contrast to the formation assay, the addition of Tween seems to affect the filament dilution assay substantially. We decided it would best to remove the dilution assay from the paper. While we can no longer compare the stability of the filaments to dilution with the concentration at which they form, we now note, based on other data, that large assemblies can form at concentrations only a few-fold above the dimerization KD, suggesting that the lateral contacts are reinforcing the head-to-tail oligomers as they form and allowing them to grow larger than they otherwise would be expected to at those concentrations.</p><p>We also note the rather crude nature of these assays, as well as the TIRF assay shown in Figure 6: we do not know what size of filament actually sediments, likewise when the size becomes so small that it gives background rather than distinct puncta in that TIRF assay. This is summarized in point #7 below and is now discussed in subsection “Axin DAX caps Dvl DIX oligomers” in the context of the DAX disruption assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2C: The labeling of the figure needs to be improved. It will be helpful for recognizing the head and tail of each subunit in Figure 2C if the secondary structure unit of one protomer (e.g. the brown one at the upper left corner) can be labeled. Similarly, it would help if the strand names containing Y27 and K68 in Figure 2D are labeled. Similarly, secondary structures in Figures 3B and D should be labeled for easy reading.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recommending this clarification. We have amended these figures (note that the old Figure 3D is now 4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3 and 4: The SEC analysis in the two figures are complicated by the cleaved MBP in the mixtures. For example, the authors state that the Y27D mutant of Dvl2 DIX is a monomer, but the elution peak overlaps with the MBP tag, which is considerably larger than the monomeric Dvl2 DIX. The authors should remove MBP from the cleaved protein mixtures and re-analyze the elution behaviors of the mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>While the relatively large height of the MBP peak (due to its extinction coefficient being 7-8x greater than that of a DIX domain) prevents us from seeing full baseline separation between the MBP peak and some of the DIX domains, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer’s assertion that this complicates interpretation for most of the traces. The SEC traces clearly show that while MBP exhibits a broad elution profile due to its high A280, its profile is still manifestly Gaussian, and its center is at the correct volume (18 mL on our Superose 6 or 11 mL on our Superdex 75 columns). The DIX and DAX peaks are well, if not completely, separated from the MBP peak. The WT DIX filament peak in Figures 1B, 3A and 4A, as well as the DAX NG and DAX NQ/NG peaks in Figure 4A, show complete baseline separation from the MBP peak. The WT DAX peak (Figures 4A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A) and DIX M60A and N82D peaks (Figure 3A) show nearly complete separation from the MBP peak, if not quite full baseline separation. The DIX Y27D, DIXDC, and DIXY27D+DC peaks in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B show less separation from the MBP peak, but are still clearly distinct, being centered at 13.8 mL, 13.1 mL, and 13.8 mL, respectively – a substantial shift from the MBP peak centered at 11 mL. Furthermore, the gels in Figure 3—figure supplement 1C also show clear separation between MBP and those three proteins, as well as between DIXDE and MBP (which is less clear in the chromatogram).</p><p>Nonetheless, we agree that the interpretation of the G65D DIX and DIXDE mutants was difficult given their strong overlap with the MBP peak, though the gel for the DIXDE peak does show substantial separation. We have therefore re-run these proteins, as well as the Y27D mutant and WT DAX, on SEC after depletion of contaminating MBP. As we show in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, these proteins separate from MBP and run at the same volume on Superdex 75 as before regardless of the amount of contaminating MBP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3: The G65D mutant is interesting as the mutation seems to disrupt both inter- and intra-strand protomer DIX interaction. This brings up two issues: the mutation cannot really be used to support the inter-strand interaction observed in the cryo-EM structure; and the mutation might have a large overall folding perturbation of the Dvl2 DIX protomer. The authors should check the folding of the G65D mutant. Additionally, the G65D mutant, though not capable of forming DIX oligomers, showed a comparable level of transcriptional activity to that of the M60A mutant (Figure 3C). This will need to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We are puzzled by the reviewer’s assertion that the G65D mutation completely disrupts oligomer formation. The fact that G65D DIX appears to run larger than MBP on the Superose 6 (Figure 3A) when injected at 180 μM, whereas monomeric mutants such as Y27D clearly run smaller, strongly suggests that its oligomerization is not completely ablated. In the new experiments, we ran partially purified G65D at 60 μM on the Superdex 75 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A), and it eluted later than MBP but earlier than DIXDE, DIXDC or the Y27D mutant (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and possessed the characteristic tail reflecting exchange among multiple oligomeric species, suggesting that it can still oligomerize. Furthermore, the fact that the G65D mutant signals substantially better than the known monomer mutant Y27D (Figure 3C) or the F43S mutation that likely unfolds the protein (see Figure 1C in Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007) indicates that it is neither monomeric nor unfolded. The fact that it runs as a moderately sized peak on gel filtration and not as an aggregate further argues against the G65D mutant being unfolded. Rather, the mutation more likely acts by forcing the repacking of the β3-β4 loop due to the native G65 occupying a Ramachandran space that would not be allowed for an aspartate.</p><p>Subsection “DIX forms an antiparallel double helix that stabilizes filaments”, third paragraph we note that we cannot rule out that there is some coupling between mutations in the inter-strand interface and the head-to-tail intra-strand interface, which might explain differences in the apparent sizes of the oligomers formed by these mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4 and paragraph describing data in Figure 4 (subsection “Axin DAX oligomerizes through a head-to-tail interface but does not form large polymers”) is confusing. If the pink elution profile was obtained for DAX at 180 µM, why the highest concentration tested was only 24 µM? Even for the lowest concentration (0.7 µM) analyzed, the peak would likely be an ensemble average of different oligomerization states of DAX instead of simple monomer/dimer equilibrium. If this is true, estimation of apparent Kd of 0.7 μm would not be appropriate. Consequently, a number of places in the manuscript concerning the affinity of DAX association will need to be re-written.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion. The two experiments refer to different concentration measurements. The 180 μM concentration refers to the initial loading concentration of the protein prior to injection onto the gel filtration; the subsequent run would dilute the protein roughly twelvefold (i.e., to approximately 15 μM). The 24 μM curve was indeed the highest concentration test for the separate SEC-MALS experiment and refers to the final concentration of the eluted protein in the peak as measured by its refractive index (and confirmed by A280). We have now clarified this in subsection “Axin DAX oligomerizes through a head-to-tail interface but does not form large polymers”.</p><p>Regarding the rough KD estimate, we agree that assuming that an absolute mass corresponding to 1.5 protomers/oligomer implied a 50:50 mix of monomer and dimer was inappropriate and thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We recalculated the KD including higher-order species and in so doing also discovered another error in our approximation; namely, we had assumed 710 nM to be the concentration of both monomer and dimer, whereas it is actually the total concentration of DAX protomers. A table summarizing the calculated Kd with higher-order species added is shown with the full calculation in Table 3. This shows that adding in higher-order species would not bring the Kd to even 1 μM, thus confirming that DAX-DAX is stronger than DIX-DIX or DIX-DAX, a key conclusion of the biochemical work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D (related to the question concerning Figures 3 and 4): It appears that each cleaved Dvl2 DIX mutant was eluted as an oligomer and a smaller multimer on SEC column. This is a bit odd. Do these two populations exchange? Or each population is trapped in their kinetically stable form?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if the reviewer was confused by our figures. As shown on the Figure 3—figure supplement 1C gels, the earlier peak (before the MBP) corresponds to uncleaved protein remaining after incomplete TEV digestion. These peaks also disappear when samples are run after depletion of MBP and uncleaved protein (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 5A: why ~40% of Dvl2 DIX was recovered in the pellet/filament form even in the presence of very high concentration of DAX? Related to this question, it would be informative to perform an SEC analysis of Dvl2 DIX with increasing concentrations of DAX (or Y760D DAX) to check the hetero-DIX oligomer formation status.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an explanation: “The fact that approximately 40% of the DIX still sediments even with a fivefold molar excess of DAX is likely due in large part to the relatively weak DIX-DAX KD of 10-20 μM (Yamanishi et al., 2019a). Furthermore, DAX insertions near the ends of DIX filaments would consume DAX while only shifting a small portion of the DIX contained in that filament from the pellet to the supernatant. Likewise, DAX insertion into a DIX oligomer that is already too small to sediment (the likelihood of which would increase as the number of severed DIX oligomers increased) would consume DAX without shifting any DIX from the pellet to the soluble fraction. “</p><p>The SEC experiment would be an excellent way to confirm the DAX-mediated solubilization of DIX filaments observed by sedimentation and TIRF. However, the 10-15x on-column dilution inherent in an SEC experiment requires extremely high input concentrations of each partner, which makes the experiment difficult. However, we note that the TIRF assay provides an orthogonal readout of the same phenomenon. Instead of SEC, we have added a new experiment using native gel shifts of labeled filaments (subsection “Axin DAX caps Dvl DIX oligomers” and Figure 5—figure supplement 2), which shows that at the same concentrations used for the sedimentation assay shown in Figure 5, a shift of the DIX oligomer population to a smaller, faster migrating species is apparent as DAX is added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The data for the &quot;Avidity for Axin enhances signaling&quot; and Figure 4D is not convincing and interpretation is tentative. The data seem to indicate that as long as Dvl2 and Axin can form heteromer, the Dvl2 activity can be realized. Additionally, the enhanced heteromer formation between Dvl2 and Axin seems to promote Dvl2 transcription activity. The use of TNKS2-SAM potentially brings in another indirect binder to the system. The interpretation presented in the current manuscript based on the data at the present form is one of many possibilities. It would be nice to use a pair of small heterodimer forming protein domains to replace Dvl2 and Axin DIX domains, respectively, and then to repeat the transcription assay. This is a demanding experiment, the authors should at least consider similar line of assay or any assay that would provide a more definitive result to support their model.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now Figure 6. We disagree with the reviewer’s assertion that formation of an Axin:Dvl2 heterodimer alone is sufficient for Wnt signaling. The Dvl2 Y27D can still bind Axin 1:1 (we now reference the Yamanishi et al., 2019 paper on this point; subsection “Avidity enables Axin recruitment by Dvl2 to drive signaling”) but is completely inactive in Wnt signaling. Furthermore, the Sm1-DIX Y27D Dvl2 should heptamerize and could bind up to one Axin per Dvl (i.e., 7 Axin per heptamer), but it is still completely inactive as well. Thus, an enhanced avidity for Axin mediated by oligomerization of the Dvl2 DIX domain appears to be absolutely essential for Wnt signal transduction.</p><p>We agree that being able to perturb both Axin and Dishevelled simultaneously would be ideal. However, we do not have a quintuple knockout cell line lacking all three Dvl isoforms and the two Axin isoforms that would allow us to express Axin variants as well as Dvl variants at nearendogenous levels without contaminating endogenous protein, as we have done here for Dvl2 using the TKO cells. Results with overexpressed proteins and the presence of the endogenous versions of the proteins would not be readily interpretable. We do plan to develop and use such cells in the future, but this is beyond the scope of this work.</p><p>Finally, we have rewritten the first paragraph of subsection “Avidity enables Axin recruitment by Dvl2 to drive signaling” to further clarify these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Wnt signaling is one of the handful of signaling pathways that play key roles in embryonic development, tissue homeostasis and which go wrong in cancer. While the field created an outline of the signaling pathway two decades ago, many unanswered questions remain. The key regulated effector is the protein β-catenin, which, in the absence of Wnt ligands, is targeted for phosphorylation and ultimate proteolytic destruction by the multiprotein destruction complex. One key open question involves the molecular mechanisms by which Wnt ligands turn down destruction complex activity. This requires the cytosolic effector Dvl, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. One critical issue is whether and how Dsh:Dsh, Axin:Axin, and Dsh:Axin multimerization regulate the balance of destruction complex activity. Here Weis and colleagues present the results of a multidisciplinary tour-de-force investigation, combining cryo-EM, powerful analytical biochemistry, and in vivo functional and imaging observations. They present some very intriguing new insights, revealing the polymerization of Dsh's DIX domain into anti-parallel double helical filaments, careful investigation of the parameters of polymerization in the presence and absence of Axin, clever structure-based mutational analyses that reveal important features of homo- and hetero-polymerization, combined with in vivo assays of function. These data provide a firm biochemical basis and important molecular constraints for previous speculative models for Dsh/Axin interactions, significantly advancing our understanding of this key signaling pathway. In general, their data are lovely, well controlled and quantitatively analyzed, and their conclusions well founded. As I lay out below, I think at times they are a bit to enamored with their in vitro data, making broad conclusions about events in vivo that could be presented in a more nuanced way by considering other data in the field. With these and some other minor modifications, I think this work will be of exceptional interest to cell, developmental and cancer biologists.</p><p>Data issues</p><p>Figure 1. This was lovely work but I found one thing puzzling. Why was the pelleting profile of Dsh biphasic, with significant pelleting at low concentrations (&lt;1µm)?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to reviewer 1’s point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 2-4. As I will note below in comments on the model, the authors come down very firmly on the idea that the &quot;active&quot; Dsh is in short polymers of less than 10 monomers. Their structural studies are stunning, and the revelation of a double-stranded filament exceptionally interesting. However, the cryo-EM images reveal long filaments and the SEC shows a broad peak of sizes. Further, the comparison with the DAX domain and its associated SEC-MALS data (7-8 monomers per polymer) suggest much longer filaments in solution for the DIX domain. Did they do SEC-MALS for the DIX domain? I imagine the answer is more nuanced than is currently implied, and the authors should discuss this more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not mean to give the impression that the ability of the DIX domain in isolation to form large polymers reflects the situation in vivo. A strength of the cellular counting presented here is the careful attention to maintaining labeled Dvl2 at near-endogenous levels. The formation of filaments in vitrodoes, however, reflect fundamental properties of DIX-DIX interactions: previously reported mutational data, as well as those presented here, make clear that the intraand inter-strand interactions observed in the structure are relevant. However, the size of oligomers <italic>in cellulo</italic> is considerably smaller than those observed with the purified DIX domains. This could reflect several things. The concentrations of Dvl and Axin estimated in cells (~150 nM) is much lower than those used in our biochemical experiments. Second, we discuss that other parts of Dvl may well contribute to limiting the size of oligomers in vivo.</p><p>We have examined the DIX filaments by SEC-MALS. As now shown in Figure 1B, the filaments elute in a broad distribution ranging from 4.9-9.5 MDa. Unfortunately, for reasons of detection this experiment cannot be done at near cellular concentrations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 and subsection “Axin DAX oligomerizes through a head-to-tail interface but does not form large polymers”. The current work contrasts in some important ways with recent published work from the Bienz lab and colleagues (Yamanishi et al., 2019). Both report affinities for DIX:DIX, DAX:DAX, and DIX:DAX interactions, but the results are different. In one case DIX:DIX affinities are highest and in the other DAX:DAX affinities are highest. This issue comes back again in the discussion of the work in Figure 5, which is interpreted to suggest that DAX:DIX interactions are weaker than either homomeric interaction, something not supported by the Yamanishi data. This is quite important for their modeling and while they do mention it, they don't offer any thoughts on this difference. More discussion of the Yamanishi data would inform the work.</p></disp-quote><p>This speaks to a key result of our work, that the DAX:DAX affinity is stronger than either DIX:DIX or DIX:DAX. Per reviewer 1’s point #5, we have more rigorously estimated the KD for DAX:DAX (See Table 3), and it is sub-μM. Regarding the Yamanishi et al. paper, we suspect that the M3 (I758A/R761D) DAX mutant that was used in place of the more typical M4 head mutant (Y760D) may have affected the measurements, which were made by fluorescence anisotropy. Specifically, they observed a substantial increase in anisotropy even for the two mutants that should not bind each other, and there was also a stark difference in the anisotropy changes for DIX:DIX (~700) and DAX:DAX (~800) as compared to DAX:DIX (~200) and DIX:DAX (~350). If the domains are all roughly the same size and shape, the anisotropy change would be expected to be roughly equal. Our data were derived from unmutated and unmodified protein, so we believe that our values are more reliable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5A, B. The authors state &quot;Surprisingly, addition of Axin DAX reduced Dvl2 DIX filament size to the point that they no longer sediment (Figure 5A,B).&quot; However, the data presented are much more subtle/nuanced. Even at a 5:1 DAX:DIX ratio, 40% of the DIX domain still pellets. These data contrast with their Yes/NO conclusion and with the data from TIRF. Their conclusion that DAX disrupts DIX filaments is solid but not as clear-cut as it is portrayed. This then is codified in speculative Figure 5D, which needs to be more clearly portrayed as one potential model of many, especially as it presents a quite different view than the section head which suggests filament &quot;capping&quot;, not insertion into an existing filament.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to reviewer 1, point 7. In the in vitroexperiments in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplements 1, 2 and 3, we start with preformed filaments and observe reduction in their size, implying severing is occurring. Figure 5D is meant to describe a model for what we see in vitroand reflects one of the possible models for what happens in vivo, but certainly not the only one. We do not mean to be dogmatic about whether, in cells, DAX caps DIX filaments or inserts into and severs existing ones. The capping model is perhaps simpler, but one possible interpretation of the effect of the groove mutants (Figure 5—figure supplement 3) is hyperstabilization, which would require insertion to be important (albeit potentially in addition to capping and not in place of it). While we never observed larger assemblies in the cell imaging, we cannot rule out the possibility that they formed transiently on a timescale faster than that of our image acquisition. We have tried to clarify these points in the Discussion (paragraph 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Avidity for Axin enhances signaling”: Figure 4D. The experiments here are quite interesting but I'd suggest pulling the data out of Figure 4D and making a stand-alone Figure with diagrams illustrating the nature of the complex constructs tested here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and it is now a standalone figure (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6 and subsection “The size of Dvl oligomers is limited in cells”. Here the authors try to bridge their lovely biochemical and structural data with imaging data in vivo. This is also a place where caveats are important. The authors clearly show that in this system, with Dvl expressed at near endogenous levels, that it does not form &quot;large&quot; cytoplasmic puncta. This is solid, though most current models would predict that biologically relevant Dvl puncta would likely be at the membrane. The TIRF experiments provide a means to search for these. Here there are clearly &quot;small&quot; spots, which the authors maintain contain &quot;small numbers of GFPs&quot;. Their use of single molecule tracking to estimate GFP number in particles was interesting, but needs to be better explained for the reader. Further, they are constrained to look at the apical surface and it is unclear, at least from this work, where Wnt receptor complexes are located and thus if these spots reflect &quot;active&quot; Dvl.</p></disp-quote><p>In our epifluorescent imaging (see supplementary information), which was done in addition to TIRF imaging, our depth of focus is on the order of the height of the cells – thus we mostly do not distinguish cytoplasmic from membrane associated puncta in that measurement and we now simply note that we do not observe the multiple large puncta reported in overexpression studies (subsection “The size of Dvl oligomers is limited in cells”). We have also expanded the description of the image analysis in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Places where models could be tempered or additional information included:</p><p>Introduction. The Introduction could be broadened, to more clearly set the stage of the new work.

On a more minor point they should mention that Axin the phosphorylated tail of LRP5/6 also participates in recruiting Axin into the signalosome.

Regarding the proposal that phosphorylated LRP5/6 tails can bind to Axin, we know of no direct rigorous demonstration that phosphorylated LRP5/6 tails can bind to Axin. The possible competition with APC was also noted at the end of the following paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors in their title and Abstract emphasize the idea of &quot;Limited Dishevelled/Axin oligomerization&quot; and that &quot;Dvl forms oligomers typically &lt;10 molecules at endogenous expression levels.&quot; The degree to which the Wnt receptors and the active destruction complex form larger scale entities, perhaps biomolecular condensates, is an area of active discussion in the field, and, in interests of full disclosure, one in which our lab has a direct interest. I think a revised discussion that more directly addresses different views in the field in light of this new data would be appropriate. Some issues to address. 1) In support of their data, previous work by the Wehrli lab provided a surprising and often ignored data point-an Axin mutant lacking its DIX domain was still functional in mediating β-catenin destruction (at least as assessed by cell fates) but could not be turned OFF. This supports the idea that the DIX:DAX interaction is key to turning down the destruction complex. 2) As the authors note in the last paragraph of the Discussion and as the Bienz lab has previously argued, considerable data support the idea that activated Wnt receptors form a &quot;signalosome&quot;, perhaps by phase transition. By focusing so much on the limited size of Dvl oligomers, they miss a chance to discuss this work. These data now include imaging of endogenous Dvl puncta in Wnt-ON cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, and its co-localization in puncta in Wnt on cells with Axin which it is expressed at near-endogenous levels (3x wildtype; Schaefer et al., 2018). 3) One possibility that would reconcile different views is that oligomerization is both sharply concentration dependent and also regulated in vivo. Their work, while lovely, largely relies on in vitro studies of the isolated DIX and DAX domains, and does not include either other domains of the same protein or their in vivo partners. Work from the Bienz lab and our lab suggest, for example, that Dsh and APC exert contrasting effects on the &quot;stability&quot; of Axin polymers. Data from Schaefer et al., 2018, suggest that when expressed in vivo at 2-3 fold endogenous concentrations, Axin forms complexes containing tens to hundreds of molecules, and that Wnt signaling regulates this assembly state. The authors should be free to state their own views and argue their position, but I think a more complete discussion that lays out these contrasting views would be more informative for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the Discussion to include these points, some of which were in the original version but not elaborated upon.</p></body></sub-article></article>
