A number of widely-conserved cell adhesion proteins are implicated in cell recognition between synaptic partners, but how these proteins act as a group to specify a complex neural network is poorly understood. Taking advantage of known connectivity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we identified and studied cell adhesion genes expressed in three interacting neurons in the mating circuits of the adult male. Two interacting pairs of cell surface proteins independently promote fasciculation between sensory neuron HOA and its postsynaptic target interneuron AVG: BAM-2/neurexin-related in HOA binds to CASY-1/calsyntenin in AVG; SAX-7/L1CAM in sensory neuron PHC binds to RIG-6/contactin in AVG. A third, basal pathway results in considerable HOA-AVG fasciculation and synapse formation in the absence of the other two. The features of this multiplexed mechanism help to explain how complex connectivity is encoded and robustly established during nervous system development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell adhesion protein</kwd><kwd>synaptic connectivity</kwd><kwd>neural wiring</kwd><kwd>synapse formation</kwd><kwd>axon fasciculation</kwd><kwd>connectomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM066897</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Emmons</surname><given-names>Scott W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001229</institution-id><institution>G Harold and Leila Y.

The effort to reconstruct synaptic connectivity in the nervous system of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> was undertaken in part to study the genetic specification of nervous system structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner, 1974</xref>). One central component of this process must consist of a molecular mechanism during development of synapses for specific cell-cell recognition. Knowledge of the complete connectome places certain requirements and constraints on the possible nature of such a mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Durbin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Emmons, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jarrell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">White, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">White et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">White et al., 1986</xref>). As one example, even in this small (&lt;400 neurons) nervous system, which comprises a sparse neural network, the number of different chemically and electrically coupled cell pairs is large, over 6000. It is therefore likely that a combinatorial mechanism of some kind is necessary to encode this complexity with a reasonable number of genes.</p><p>The mechanism has long been thought to depend on the molecular selectivity of ligand-receptor interactions between cell surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sperry, 1963</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, each neuron connects to multiple (10 or more) other cells — neurons, muscles, and other end organs. Since these sets of target cells intersect, each cell must express multiple such recognition molecules, a different set defining each cell type. The cellular architecture of the nervous system is reproducible, with each neuron process running in a small number of conserved neighborhoods, where it makes <italic>en passant</italic> chemical and gap junction synapses. As a neuron can only synapse onto a cell with which it is in contact, cell recognition events establishing and stabilizing neighborhoods likely play an important role in specifying the connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">White, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">White et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>Quantitative analysis showed the strengths of the connections made to different targets varies continuously over a wide range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jarrell et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests a mechanism that allows for a genetically-specified probability of synapse formation for each pair of cell types. One way to achieve this would be to employ multiple, parallel, pathways acting additively. A multiply over-determined system allows both for robustness and evolvability. It may explain why the overall mechanism remains obscure in spite of decades of forward genetic screens focused on the nervous system and behavior. Multiple additive signals might also account for another feature of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system, the prevalence of polyadic chemical synapses (69% in hermaphrodites and 66% in males). These might be accounted for if coincident signals from several appropriate postsynaptic target cells increase the probability of presynapse formation. Prior studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have implicated interactions with local, albeit non-neuronal, cells in increasing the probability of synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colón-Ramos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome contains 106 genes encoding transmembrane or secreted proteins with extracellular protein interaction domains — a structure expected for neural cell-surface recognition molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hobert, 2013</xref>). Many of these presumptive cell adhesion genes are conserved in higher animals and their counterparts have been shown to be involved in synapse formation or stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Wit and Ghosh, 2016</xref>).</p><p>We initiated our study by determining the expression of this set of 106 genes in the neurons and muscles of the neural network for male mating behavior (in preparation). Based on this expression analysis, here we have analyzed the functions of the cell adhesion genes expressed by a male-specific sensory neuron (HOA) and two of its postsynaptic targets, a sex-shared interneuron (AVG) and a pair of sex-shared sensory neurons (PHCL and PHCR). The neurons make up a part of the circuits for copulatory behavior in the male tail and are necessary for normal male copulatory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jarrell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu and Sternberg, 1995</xref>). We find that the mechanism promoting connectivity of HOA to AVG has precisely the properties proposed above. The neurons express multiple cell adhesion genes. Interactions between a subset of these, two pairs of conserved cell adhesion genes, act together with a basal pathway in three independent pathways that function additively to promote fasciculation of the three neurons, leading to synapse formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two cell adhesion genes, <italic>casy-1</italic> and <italic>rig-6</italic>, are required for patterning of a synaptic vesicle protein and axon fasciculation</title><p>For in-depth analysis of circuit formation, we focused on a male-specific circuit that consists of a male-specific sensory neuron, HOA, a sex-shared sensory/interneuron, PHC (a left/right pair of neurons, PHCL and PHCR), and a sex-shared interneuron, AVG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This circuit has two properties: (1) the axons of the three neurons are highly associated with each other to make a bundle within the male pre-anal ganglion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>); (2) in this region, the HOA axon forms <italic>en passant</italic> dyadic chemical synapses onto AVG and PHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). (In one animal reconstructed by electron microscopy, there are ~11 clusters of HOA presynaptic densities comprised of 44 synapses with AVG and 46 synapses with PHC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The PHC axon also forms dyadic synapses onto AVG and HOA.) Outside of this region, HOA has many other synaptic targets including male-specific neurons, PVZ, PCA, and some ray sensory neurons (WormWiring: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wormwiring.org">http://wormwiring.org</ext-link>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29257.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell adhesion protein genes <italic>casy-1</italic> and <italic>rig-6</italic> are required for axon fasciculation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the position of cell bodies and axons of three neurons HOA (red), AVG (blue) and a pair of PHC (green) in the male (ventral view).

To test whether these genes function for circuit formation, we visualized HOA synaptic output using a fluorescently tagged protein of presynaptic vesicles, mCherry::RAB-3, as a proxy for synaptic connections between HOA and AVG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and examined the effects of mutations on the distribution of the presynaptic puncta. We used null mutant alleles, <italic>casy-1(tm718)</italic>, <italic>rig-6(gk438569)</italic> and <italic>sax-3(ky123)</italic>. For <italic>rig-6</italic>, we also used a hypomorphic <italic>rig-6(ok1589)</italic> allele, which is predicted to affect three out of four isoforms of RIG-6. (Throughout the paper the hypomorph was used because of its ease of genetics. Its phenotypes were the same as the null [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>]). In wild type, multiple RAB-3 puncta were evenly spaced throughout the HOA process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). All mutations disrupted normal puncta distribution: mutants for <italic>casy-1</italic> and <italic>rig-6</italic> often exhibited gaps containing fewer or smaller puncta, whereas in mutants lacking <italic>sax-3</italic>, the number of RAB-3 puncta was increased due to extra branching of the HOA axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). SAX-3/Robo is a transmembrane protein with immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and is known to function in axon guidance of multiple types of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zallen et al., 1999</xref>). Thus it is likely that the extra branching phenotype we observed is one of the axon guidance defects in <italic>sax-3</italic> mutants, which we do not pursue further here.</p><p>GPI-anchored RIG-6/contactin belongs to the Ig superfamily and its loss leads to axon guidance defects of sensory and motorneurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Katidou et al., 2013</xref>). CASY-1/calsyntenin is a cadherin domain-containing transmembrane protein. One of its mammalian homologs, calsyntenin-3, has been shown to induce in vitro presynapse differentiation when overexpressed postsynaptically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pettem et al., 2013</xref>). As cell contact may be necessary for synapse formation, it was possible that the gap phenotype we observed in <italic>casy-1</italic> and <italic>rig-6</italic> mutants originated from defasciculation of HOA from its target axons. To test this possibility, we examined axon fasciculation between HOA and AVG, along with the HOA presynaptic puncta distribution in the mutants. Indeed, in <italic>casy-1</italic> and <italic>rig-6</italic> mutants, the HOA and AVG axons were frequently detached from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). Moreover, the axonal segments of HOA detached from AVG had smaller and fewer presynaptic puncta than those contacting AVG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,J and K</xref>). This phenotypic association of axon fasciculation and presynaptic pattern was not due to mutational effects, because in wild type animals we also observed, even though rarely, that detached axon segments contained smaller and fewer puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>). Therefore, the HOA presynapse puncta pattern is tightly associated with contacts between HOA and AVG axons, and the gap phenotype we observed in mCherry::RAB-3 labeled presynaptic structures originates most likely from frequent HOA-AVG defasciculation in mutant animals.</p><p>To further examine axon fasciculation among the three associated neurons, HOA, AVG and PHC, in <italic>casy-1</italic> and <italic>rig-6</italic> mutants, we generated transgenic animals whose neurons were labeled with mCherry, TagBFP and GFP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Then we used fluorescence images to measure fasciculation or defasciculation between the axons. This measurement was sensitive enough to detect subtle defasciculation events: in the wild type animal reconstructed by electron microscopy, the PHCL and PHCR axons, for example, are separated over 30% of their lengths by only one-neurite distance, and similar measurement of defasciculation was observed using fluorescence images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that the axon fasciculation defects of <italic>casy-1</italic> and <italic>rig-6</italic> mutants were distinguishable from each other: in mutants lacking <italic>casy-1</italic>, the HOA axon was frequently detached from the PHC-AVG axon bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and E</xref>), whereas in <italic>rig-6</italic> mutants (either <italic>ok1589</italic> or <italic>gk438569</italic>), both HOA and PHC axons were detached from AVG, but the fasciculation of HOA and PHC was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The double mutants of <italic>casy-1</italic> and <italic>rig-6</italic> showed an additive phenotype, in which all three axons were disassociated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). Taken together, the results indicate that <italic>casy-1</italic> and <italic>rig-6</italic> are required for proper wiring of the HOA-AVG-PHC circuit, but may function differently to achieve this goal.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29257.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Axon fasciculation defects of <italic>casy-1</italic> and <italic>rig-6</italic> are distinguishable.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) The axons of the three neurons were individually labeled with wCherry (HOA; red), TagBFP (AVG; blue), and GFP (PHC; green) in wild type (<bold>A</bold>), <italic>casy-1(tm718)</italic> (<bold>B</bold>), <italic>rig-6(ok1589)</italic> (<bold>C</bold>), or <italic>casy-1;rig-6</italic> double mutants (<bold>D</bold>).

Second, the double mutant phenotype of <italic>rig-6;sax-7</italic> animals was similar to that of <italic>rig-6</italic> or <italic>sax-7</italic> single mutants, suggesting that they act genetically in the same pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Third, in cell-specific rescue experiments, the short form SAX-7S expressed in PHC, but not in HOA, rescued axon fasciculation defects in <italic>sax-7</italic> mutants, whereas SAX-7L failed to rescue both in PHC and HOA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). It is currently unknown if there are differences in expression of SAX-7S and SAX-7L, as different regulatory elements for the two isoforms have not yet been described. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that Flag-tagged RIG-6 binds to V5-tagged SAX-7S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>We observed above that PHC ablation disrupted the HOA-AVG axon fascicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). We asked whether the loss of PHC could be compensated by restoring the interaction of SAX-7S with RIG-6 through expression of SAX-7S in HOA. SAX-7 protein was detected in PHC, but not in HOA or AVG, when we examined a fosmid-based reporter to better define the neurons expressing <italic>sax-7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, we found that the ectopic expression of SAX-7S in HOA rescued the fasciculation defects caused by PHC ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>). Moreover, a similar rescuing effect was observed in a <italic>casy-1</italic> mutant, but not in a <italic>rig-6</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>), further supporting the conclusion that SAX-7S binds to RIG-6 and this binding mediates axon fasciculation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Cell adhesion gene function is required for male behavior</title><p>What are the behavioral consequences of the connectivity defects in the circuit described above? The <italic>C. elegans</italic> male displays a stereotyped behavioral sequence during mating: it responds to contact with the hermaphrodite, backs with its tail pressed along the hermaphrodite body, turns at the end to the opposite side, locates its tail at the vulva, and inserts its copulatory spicules for insemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu and Sternberg, 1995</xref>). The male-specific HOA sensory neuron is required for the vulva location step of this sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu and Sternberg, 1995</xref>). Recently, it has been found that genetic or laser ablation of AVG or PHC also leads to defects in vulva location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oren-Suissa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017a</xref>). Thus, we anticipated that the cell adhesion genes required for the HOA-AVG-PHC circuit might affect the vulva location behavior of the male. We examined mating behavior of mutant males for <italic>casy-1</italic>, <italic>rig-6</italic>, <italic>bam-2</italic>, and <italic>sax-7</italic>, and all exhibited vulva location defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Double mutants (<italic>casy-1;rig-6</italic>, <italic>casy-1;bam-2</italic>, and <italic>rig-6;sax-7</italic>) also showed similar behavioral defects. Cell-autonomous expression of the cDNAs in the corresponding mutants partially restored vulva location behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These defects appear to be specific to the vulva location step, since the male’s ability to respond to hermaphrodite contact, the first step of the sequence, was not affected, with the exception of the <italic>sax-7</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). <italic>sax-7</italic> is thought to mediate multiple aspects of nervous system function including axon guidance, neuronal positioning, and dendrite development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zallen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sasakura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pocock et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Salzberg et al., 2013</xref>). In our expression analysis, <italic>sax-7</italic> was also expressed in some of the ray sensory neurons that are known to function in the response step (data not shown), raising the possibility that <italic>sax-7</italic> function in ray neurons is required for the response behavior. Interestingly, expression of SAX-7S in PHC partially rescued defects of <italic>sax-7</italic> mutants in the response to contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that response behavior also requires <italic>sax-7</italic> function in PHC.

A second involves another sensory neuron that is also postsynaptic to HOA, PHC, and interactions between cell surface proteins on PHC and AVG. A third pathway we did not identify by itself gives an approximately 50% level of fasciculation and synapse formation between HOA and AVG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Synapse formation between HOA and AVG takes place during the late period of the last, L4, larval stage, when HOA sends out a process along AVG. PHC grows a process fasciculated to AVG before HOA. The role of PHC in promoting HOA fasciculation to AVG is explained by an interaction between HOA and PHC, the molecular basis of which remains to be identified.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29257.024</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for function of cell adhesion protein interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three pathways additively act to achieve the wild type level of HOA-AVG axon fasciculation.

Epithelial cells of the vulva promote formation of neuromuscular junctions between the HSN motor neuron and vulval muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</xref>). The interaction involves binding between Ig-domain cell adhesion molecules SYG-2, expressed by the epithelium, and SYG-1, expressed by HSN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Özkan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shen et al., 2004</xref>). Glial cells promote connection between AIY and RIA interneurons through the UNC-6/netrin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colón-Ramos et al., 2007</xref>). The combined involvement of more than two cells may be a significant way that a combinatorial complexity can be introduced into the mechanism of synaptic specificity.</p><p>The features of HOA &gt; AVG connectivity we describe are in remarkable consonance with the features predicted in view of the complexity of the connectome and the structure of the nervous system. Each cell expresses multiple cell adhesion proteins. A subset of these are involved in formation of one particular synaptic connection. The cell adhesion proteins promote fasciculation, creating an extended neighborhood within which the neurons construct <italic>en passant</italic> synapses. Multiple pathways act independently and additively to create the wild type level of connectivity. We speculate that the pathway that can give rise to a 50% of wild type level of fasciculation even in the absence of the cell adhesion proteins we identified could be the cell lineage itself, which places cells at reproducible locations with reproducible sets of neighbors. As pointed out previously, unless a cell migrates away from its site of birth, it has a limited number of choices for process neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">White, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">White et al., 1983</xref>). Involvement of a third cell means lineage specification of that cell also contributes to specifying connectivity.</p><p>These features, which help to explain how the complex connectivity can be genetically encoded and robustly established, also explain why, in spite of decades of studies and analysis of thousands of mutations affecting the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system and its behavior, the problem of overall specification of the connectome remains opaque. For connection of HOA to AVG, simultaneous removal of two sets of adhesion protein interactions reduces the level of fasciculation and hence synapse formation by only 50%. It is perhaps telling that some of the earliest uncoordinated mutations identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which define the UNC-6/netrin guidance pathway and do in fact affect connectivity, affect cells that do not run in defined neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brenner, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hedgecock et al., 1990</xref>). Apart from these and some additional effects, in spite of the global role in guidance played by the UNC-6/netrin pathway, in UNC-6/netrin pathway mutants the nervous system remains intact and generally functional. Mutations in other widely-expressed genes for conserved pathways, such as the neurexin/neuroligin interaction and Slit/Robo signaling, have only mild effects on worm behavior. The nervous system is clearly a robust structure that is based on extensive genetic redundancy.</p><p>We surmounted this obstacle here by taking a candidate gene approach based on a comprehensive expression study. Two similar studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> based on identifying the expression patterns of Ig-domain transmembrane protein genes followed by examination of mutants found similar axon guidance and fasciculation defects, including additive effects of multiple mutations, similar to the results described here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aurelio et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwarz et al., 2009</xref>).

EM reconstruction shows that in one individual, HOA was fasciculated with AVG over 30 microns. In the fasciculated region 46 presynaptic densities occur in 11 clusters relatively evenly spaced at intervals averaging 1.7 microns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). They occur at swellings in the HOA process that contained a mitochondrion. These swellings could be observed with a cytoplasmic marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). What determines where these swellings, mitochondria, and presynaptic structures are located along the process?</p><p>We employed a fluorescently tagged protein of presynaptic vesicles, mCherry::RAB-3, to observe presynaptic structures. Absence of mCherry::RAB-3 puncta suggests that components of the presynaptic structure necessary to recruit synaptic vesicles are not assembled at discrete membrane locations. The formation of mCherry::RAB-3 puncta within HOA correlated with apparent fasciculation with AVG and required AVG contact, since in wild type they were absent or reduced in rare regions of process separation. For recruitment of presynaptic components, the contact signal did not require the cell adhesion genes involved in promoting fasciculation, since in the mutants for these genes, puncta appeared normal in regions of contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Of the 13 genes we examined, <italic>oig-1</italic> and <italic>oig-8</italic> may be necessary for the formation of puncta, because the mutants lacking them exhibited diffused puncta pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This diffused puncta phenotype is similar to that of animals lacking SYD-2/Liprin-α, which functions in formation of the presynaptic active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhen and Jin, 1999</xref>), suggesting that <italic>oig-1</italic> and <italic>oig-8</italic> may be involved in organizing presynaptic structures. The identity of the contact signal and how it triggers assembly of presynaptic materials remains elusive.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional conservation of cell adhesion protein interactions in synaptic partner recognition</title><p>We found that the cell adhesion genes required for promoting fasciculation between HOA and AVG are homologs of genes that have been shown to be involved in axon outgrowth and synapse formation in mammals. A similar finding has been made in wide-ranging prior studies of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system. Just as so much else of the molecular architecture of the nervous system is conserved across animals, so too, it appears, are the molecular tools that establish synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bargmann, 1998</xref>). Yet unlike many other aspects of neural function, such as the mechanisms underlying cellular electrical properties or synaptic transmission, connectivity differs profoundly from species to species and accounts for each species’ repertoire of behaviors. The resolution of this apparent paradox, of course, is the employment of these generic cell-recognition and adhesion tools with different combinations in different places. The process is analogous to the specification of diverse cell types by a conserved set of transcription factors.</p><p>Our results show that CASY-1/calsyntenin binds to BAM-2/neurexin-related in trans to promote axon-axon adhesion. A similar protein interaction between calsyntenin-3 and α-neurexin has been shown to regulate synapse formation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pettem et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, through domain analysis of CASY-1, we identified the LNS domain, but not the cadherin domains, is required for axon fasciculation, suggesting that the LNS domain may serve as a binding site for BAM-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A biochemical study has shown that the LNS domain of calsyntenin-3 alone is sufficient to bind α-neurexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, in contrast to CASY-1-BAM-2 interaction, we could not observe protein binding between CASY-1 and NRX-1 (a canonical neurexin in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) in the same experimental condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> BAM-2 may exist as a related but diverged form of neurexin to act as a functional binding partner of CASY-1/calsyntenin. The conserved function of CASY-1/calsyntenin-BAM-2/neurexin-related interaction in neural adhesion and synapse formation seems to be maintained throughout evolution.</p><p>Like CASY-1-BAM-2 interaction, protein binding between RIG-6/contactin and SAX-7/L1CAM appears to be molecularly and functionally conserved. A number of protein interactions between contactins (six members: contactin-1–6) and L1 family proteins (four members: L1, CHL1, neurofascin and NrCAM) have been found in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shimoda and Watanabe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gennarini et al., 2017</xref>).

Our domain analysis of RIG-6 indicates that the extracellular Ig domains, but not the FN[III] domains, are required for axon fasciculation, suggesting that RIG-6-SAX-7 interaction might be mediated via the Ig domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Recent studies have revealed the importance of interactions between Ig domains in cell-cell recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Özkan et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the Ig domains of RIG-6 interact directly with the Ig domains of SAX-7 to achieve adhesive function.</p><p>Direct in vivo evidence that these conserved adhesion factors have instructive roles in synaptic partner recognition is still lacking in any model organism.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript addresses the question of how neurons are able to make precise synaptic connections within complex circuits utilizing a limited repertoire of cell recognition molecules. The authors utilize a relatively simple three-neuron sensory circuit (AVG, PHC, and HOA) in male <italic>C. elegans</italic> to uncover that neural adhesion molecules with differential expression in neurons regulate fasciculation of their axons, which in turn impacts synapse formation between the neurons. Specifically, the authors define that the HOA neuron expresses BAM-2, which regulates axon fasciculation with AVG though interaction with CASY-1, and similarly, SAX-7S in PHC regulates axon fasciculation with AVG through interaction with RIG-6. The authors show an interesting neuronal hierarchy in regulation of axon fasciculation and perform cell-specific rescue experiments for the cell adhesion molecules in each neuron. The authors also identify the regions of the adhesion molecules required for the interactions they uncover, show direct binding using in vitro experiments, and lastly demonstrate that the cell adhesion molecules have an impact on a behavior relevant to the circuit. This work begins to elucidate the mechanisms by which neural adhesion molecules that seem to generally regulate synapse formation in neurons, are also able to promote precise synaptic connections between specific neurons.</p><p>However, there are a number of issues that the authors will need to address to strengthen their conclusion of the existence of a hierarchically acting, cell-type specific adhesion code.</p><p>Experimental:</p><p>1) The authors imply that the selective expression of these adhesion molecules in the three neurons instructs synaptic partnership. To demonstrate this point, they need to express these molecules in a neighboring non-synaptic partner neuron to show sufficiency of generating ectopic fasciculation and synapse. Loss of function effects could be due to many potential defects during development. Gain-of function manipulations make the model a lot stronger.</p><p>2) To solidify the argument of a hierarchical assembly of the PHC/HOA/AVG circuit, the authors need to also ablate AVG. Currently, they only ablate PHC and HOA.</p><p>3) The behavioral defects shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are difficult to interpret without cell autonomous rescue experiments. Since the authors have already built these rescuing strains, they should at least test some of the strains to see if the AVG-PHC-HOA phenotype is responsible for the behavioral phenotypes.</p><p>4) The presentation of the expression pattern of the 4 relevant adhesion molecules is insufficient. The authors refer to their own unpublished expression analysis which, as some hints in the text suggest, appear to be based on transcriptional reporters. Two of those are shown in the context of demonstrating that these transcriptional reporters are not dimorphically expressed; this finding is uninterpretable if it based on transcriptional reporters only. It could easily be envisioned that sex-specifically occupied repressor sites are located outside the 5' region. Better reporter reagents are also critical for a proper interpretation of the elegant HOA-ectopic SAX-7S expression experiments in a PHC(-) or casy-6(-) background. Is this expression really ectopic (i.e. SAX-7S is not normally expressed in HOA) or do the authors merely overexpress a highly adhesive homophilic adhesion molecule that can compensate for the loss of other adhesive mechanisms?

The distance between neighboring axons is well below the resolution of light microscopy. When two axons appear to be &quot;fasciculated&quot; with each other on a two color image, they are not necessarily fasciculated. This is not a problem for the wild type control because that has been validated by EM. We understand that EM reconstruction is a major undertaking and it would not be reasonable to ask the authors to do EM on all the mutants. But it would be reasonable to have a better understanding about how sensitive their assays are. If the authors have strains available that label two axons in the nerve bundles that are separated by 1, 2 or 3 neurites the authors could corroborate that they can use their fluorescence images to determine that these axons are not fasciculating with each other. This is an important issue because it affects the interpretation of the whole paper.</p><p>Requested changes relating to data presentation and text:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> showed about 12 puncta of HOA presynaptic terminals.

To demonstrate this point, they need to express these molecules in a neighboring non-synaptic partner neuron to show sufficiency of generating ectopic fasciculation and synapse. Loss of function effects could be due to many potential defects during development. Gain-of function manipulations make the model a lot stronger.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not mean to imply that expression of these adhesion molecules <italic>by themselves</italic> is sufficient to cause adhesion. Most likely it is not, but rather these molecules act in concert with other factors, possibly in complexes. Throughout the manuscript we use the word “promote” to describe their role in adhesion, which is simply to say they are necessary without saying how.</p><p>We do not feel that a gain-of-function experiment, showing an effect of expression in other neurons, changes this perspective. An effect in another pair of neurons might occur because the same set of necessary co-factors are present in those cells. Lack of effect could be because the other factors are not there. In other words, cellular context is undoubtedly important and interpretation of a “sufficiency” experiment is problematic. If expression in another context is not sufficient, that does not take away from the evidence that in the present context these proteins are necessary. Though undoubtedly there may be other explanations, the simplest explanation for their role in “promoting” adhesion is that they bind to each other.</p><p>Having said all this, we agree with the reviewer’s point that gain-of-function experiments strengthen our argument on the roles of cell adhesion proteins. To address whether the adhesion factors can instruct synaptic partnership, we initially tried to find a good candidate for a neighboring non-synaptic partner neuron, but we confronted two obstacles.</p><p>The first obstacle was to select an appropriate target neuron for “a non-synaptic partner” that is testable. As discussed in the response to the Experimental issue #5, closely running axons within 1~3 neurite distance frequently touch each other, making it difficult to interpret the results, that is, it could be difficult to see if these contacts were <italic>increased</italic>. As for axons normally separated by long distance, it is hard to assess whether some kinds of inductive effects work or not, if there are any, because we do not know the effective ranges of the adhesion proteins.</p><p>The second problem was the availability of specific promoters that can drive expression in the neurons we want to examine. We knew that many selective drivers known in hermaphrodites have additional expression in the male tail (e.g. a subset of male-specific neurons or muscles) through our extensive expression analyses on cell adhesion genes and many other genes. Even so although we may identify a certain target neuron that is testable (i.e. non-synaptic partner with a close neighborhood), it is challenging to find selective drivers showing unique expression in that neuron in the male tail.</p><p>We did find one promising candidate and performed a gain-of-function test, but it was unsuccessful. The technical difficulties described above are well exemplified in our preliminary test of ectopic expression in the HOB neuron in the hope of finding some recognizable inductive effects. HOB has synaptic partnership with HOA and PHC only in a restricted “&lt;”-shaped axonal region. The <italic>pkd-2</italic> promoter has been well known to drive expression selectively in HOB (additionally in the B-type ray neurons). In this experiment, we ectopically expressed CASY-1 and RIG-6 in HOB in a <italic>casy-1;rig-6</italic> double mutant background and looked for re-routing of the anteriorly-oriented axons of HOA and PHC toward the HOB axon instead of following the AVG axon. However, we could not see such effects (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29257-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>This result is not decisive. First, our initial prediction of the re-routing may be too rough. Even though the HOA and PHC axons have contacts with the HOB axons in one limited region, their anterior axons are still far from the HOB axon. Due to this long distance, the adhesion factors expressed in HOB may not reach factors on the presynaptic neurons, HOA and PHC. Second, the promoter utilized (<italic>pkd-2p</italic>) is very selective in expression, but is not specific to HOB. There remains the possibility that the adhesion factors ectopically expressed in a subset of the B-type ray neurons’ axons (e.g. R1B whose axon runs near and has significant contacts with the AVG axon) may have some effects. Taken together, we think that currently we do not have appropriate tools to assess this problem. We have described these difficulties briefly in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To solidify the argument of a hierarchical assembly of the PHC/HOA/AVG circuit, the authors need to also ablate AVG. Currently, they only ablate PHC and HOA.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted AVG ablation. There was no effect in HOA-PHC fasciculation after the ablation. We have added this result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and in the relevant text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The behavioral defects shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are difficult to interpret without cell autonomous rescue experiments. Since the authors have already built these rescuing strains, they should at least test some of the strains to see if the AVG-PHC-HOA phenotype is responsible for the behavioral phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have conducted cell-autonomous rescue experiments for the four mutants. The results show that vulva location defects in the mutants are partially rescued by cell-autonomous expression of the corresponding genes. Accordingly, we have incorporated these data into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The presentation of the expression pattern of the 4 relevant adhesion molecules is insufficient. The authors refer to their own unpublished expression analysis which, as some hints in the text suggest, appear to be based on transcriptional reporters. Two of those are shown in the context of demonstrating that these transcriptional reporters are not dimorphically expressed; this finding is uninterpretable if it based on transcriptional reporters only. It could easily be envisioned that sex-specifically occupied repressor sites are located outside the 5' region. Better reporter reagents are also critical for a proper interpretation of the elegant HOA-ectopic SAX-7S expression experiments in a PHC(-) or casy-6(-) background. Is this expression really ectopic (i.e. SAX-7S is not normally expressed in HOA) or do the authors merely overexpress a highly adhesive homophilic adhesion molecule that can compensate for the loss of other adhesive mechanisms? Taken together, the authors must use reporter strains in which the entire locus is tagged with gfp (either in the context of fosmid-based reporters or by CRISPR/Cas9 tagging).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this issue. For <italic>casy-1</italic> and <italic>rig-6</italic> expression, we agree with the reviewer’s point that it is not interpretable in terms of sexually dimorphic expression due to possible exclusion of repression sites. We have removed Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and are pursuing to generate CRISPR lines for endogenous expression of <italic>casy-1</italic> and <italic>rig-6</italic> in order to understand their sex-specific regulation.</p><p>For <italic>sax-7</italic> expression, we have used a <italic>sax-7</italic> fosmid reporter (ddIs290) to examine its expression in PHC, HOA, and AVG. The results indicate that <italic>sax-7</italic> is selectively expressed in PHC and are now presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is not clear how sensitive the visual assay is in determining a &quot;fasciculation&quot; phenotype.

It would be ideal if we could find two axons that run in parallel but are separated by one neurite in EM, and then examine those using fluorescence images. Unfortunately, it is hard to find such an axon pair in EM, because most axons that run close together (1~3 neurites distance) frequently “touch” and “detach” throughout their lengths. Instead, we have focused on the fasciculation of PHCL and PHCR axon pair, which defasciculate <italic>with one-neurite distance separation</italic> in EM over 30% of their length. We have compared this with fluorescence images and found similar levels of defasciculation (~29%).
