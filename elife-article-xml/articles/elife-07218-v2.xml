Chronic malaria exposure is associated with a large increase in atypical memory B cells (MBCs) that resemble B cells expanded in a variety of persistent viral infections. Understanding the function of atypical MBCs and their relationship to classical MBCs will be critical to developing effective vaccines for malaria and other chronic infections. We show that VH gene repertoires and somatic hypermutation rates of atypical and classical MBCs are indistinguishable indicating a common developmental history. Atypical MBCs express an array of inhibitory receptors and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is stunted in atypical MBCs resulting in impaired B cell responses including proliferation, cytokine production and antibody secretion. Thus, in response to chronic malaria exposure, atypical MBCs appear to differentiate from classical MBCs becoming refractory to BCR-mediated activation and potentially interfering with the acquisition of malaria immunity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07218.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07218.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07218.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human immune system works to protect individuals from harmful microbes, such as the parasites that cause malaria. One line of defense is to produce a large array of proteins called antibodies that specifically bind to microbes to mark them for destruction by the immune system. The immune system also produces long-lived memory B cells that are able to mount a quicker and more effective antibody response if the microbe enters the body again. This means that most people only become ill with a particular disease the first time they encounter the microbe that causes it.</p><p>However, malaria is unusual in that it can take many years of exposure to the parasite that causes it before an individual produces enough antibodies and memory B cells to be protected from the disease. There is also no vaccine that provides effective and long-lasting protection against malaria. Vaccinations rely on stimulating the body's natural defenses, and so understanding more about antibodies and memory B cells in relation to malaria may aid future efforts to develop a vaccine.</p><p>Researchers have discovered that many of the memory B cells that accumulate in people who have been exposed to the malaria parasite over long-periods of time are different from the normal memory B cells. But it was not clear what role these ‘atypical’ cells play in immunity to malaria. To address this question, Portugal et al. studied the genetics and activity of B cells collected from children and adults living in Mali who—by living in a region where malaria is common—had been repeatedly exposed to the parasite.</p><p>The experiments indicate that atypical and normal memory B cells both develop from the same precursor cells. However, the genes that are active in each cell type are different, resulting in the atypical cells being less able to respond to the parasite than the normal memory B cells. Portugal et al.'s findings suggest that the atypical cells develop from normal memory B cells during long-term exposure to malaria, which may delay the development of immunity to this disease.</p><p>Future challenges include understanding what drives the formation of the atypical memory B cells in malaria, and finding out why they are less active than the normal cells. This could aid the development of vaccines and/or therapies that restore their activity in patients.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07218.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07218.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>atypical memory B cell</kwd><kwd><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic></kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006492</institution-id><institution>Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01 AI000949-02 LIG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crompton</surname><given-names>Peter D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crompton</surname><given-names>Peter D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Atypical memory B cells (MBCs) appear to differentiate from classical MBCs during chronic exposure to the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, and may interfere with the acquisition of immunity to the disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is a mosquito-born parasite that causes approximately 200 million cases of malaria and 600,000 deaths each year, mostly among African children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">WHO, 2014</xref>). The development of a highly effective vaccine is widely viewed as a critical step toward defeating malaria, yet the vaccine candidate that is most advanced in clinical trials confers only partial, short-lived protection in African children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">RTS, S Clinical Trials Partnership, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Abs play a key role in naturally acquired immunity to malaria as demonstrated by the passive transfer of Abs from malaria-resistant adults to children with clinical malaria, resulting in a reduction in the levels of parasitemia and fever in these children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cohen et al., 1961</xref>). Individuals living in malaria endemic areas acquire protective Abs but the process is remarkably slow requiring many years of repeated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Portugal et al., 2013</xref>). The inefficient acquisition of humoral immunity that protects from malaria has been attributed, in part, to the extensive genetic diversity of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takala and Plowe, 2009</xref>) and the extraordinary clonal variation in the proteins the parasite expresses on the surface of the erythrocytes that it infects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scherf et al., 2008</xref>). However, accumulating evidence suggests that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> may also evade humoral immunity through dysregulation of B cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Portugal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Scholzen and Sauerwein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hviid et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, several studies, particularly in children, show that <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-specific Ab responses are short-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muller et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fruh et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramasamy et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taylor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavanagh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fonjungo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">John et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akpogheneta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weiss et al., 2010</xref>) and boost inconsistently upon antigen re-exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kinyanjui et al., 2007</xref>), even to conserved antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fonjungo et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, in areas of intense malaria transmission, <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-specific MBCs are acquired inefficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weiss et al., 2010</xref>) and their prevalence is relatively low (∼30–50%) even among adults with documented malaria exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dorfman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weiss et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wipasa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nogaro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ndungu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Altered B cell function is well described in other infections. For example, HIV and hepatitis C virus infection are associated with an increase in CD10<sup>−</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD20<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>−</sup>CD27<sup>−</sup> B cells that express the inhibitory molecule Fc receptor-like-4 (FcRL4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Charles et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moir et al., 2008</xref>), cells that are largely absent in the blood of healthy individuals. In HIV-infected individuals, these cells are hyporesponsive or ‘exhausted’, and because HIV-specific B cells are concentrated in this subpopulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kardava et al., 2014</xref>), they likely contribute to the humoral deficiencies associated with HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moir et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>An increase in a phenotypically similar subset of B cells has been described in malaria-exposed children and adults across genetically and geographically diverse populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weiss et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nogaro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Portugal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Illingworth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Muellenbeck et al., 2013</xref>). In the context of malaria, this B cell subset is referred to as ‘atypical’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weiss et al., 2009</xref>) rather than ‘exhausted’ because the function of these cells and whether they are beneficial or detrimental in malaria remains unclear. That <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection per se drives the expansion of atypical MBCs has been suggested by a positive correlation between atypical MBC expansion and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>), the differential expansion of atypical MBCs in age-matched children living under similar conditions in rural Kenya, with the exception of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Illingworth et al., 2013</xref>) and the appearance of atypical MBCs in the peripheral blood of healthy adults following experimental <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scholzen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>B cell memory is complex and encompasses distinct classes of MBCs, and at present the origins and functions of these MBC subsets are incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tarlinton and Good-Jacobson, 2013</xref>). In particular, in malaria the function of atypical MBCs and their relationship to classical MBCs remains to be established. Concerning function, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Muellenbeck et al. (2013)</xref> recently showed that V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> genes cloned from atypical MBCs from malaria exposed adults encoded broadly neutralizing <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-specific Abs. This observation led these authors to speculate that atypical MBCs contribute to malaria immunity by secreting Abs against blood-stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites, although Ab secretion by atypical MBCs was not directly demonstrated. Concerning the relationship between atypical and classical MBCs, two recent analyses of the V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> sequences of atypical and classical MBC led to different conclusions. A study in Gabon reported that classical and atypical MBCs were different in their expressed IgG V gene repertoires suggesting that they developed from different precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Muellenbeck et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, results from a more recent study in Mali indicated that the expressed IgG V gene repertoires of atypical and classical MBCs were remarkably similar suggesting a close relationship between the two populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zinocker et al., 2015</xref>). However, a relatively small number of V genes were analyzed in these two studies leaving the question of the relatedness of atypical and classical MBCs an open one.</p><p>Here, we sought to fill these important knowledge gaps by analyzing naïve B cells, classical MBCs and atypical MBCs isolated from Malian children and adults with lifelong <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exposure. Using next-generation sequence analysis of V<sub>H</sub> genes, we provide evidence that atypical MBCs share a common precursor with classical MBCs, on the basis of similar somatic hypermutation (SHM) rates and V<sub>H</sub> gene usage. By genome-wide expression profiling, we demonstrate that atypical MBCs upregulate multiple inhibitory receptors, particularly the Fc receptor-like-5 (FcRL5). Moreover, atypical MBCs exhibit reduced B cell receptor (BCR)-mediated signaling resulting in markedly impaired BCR-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization, proliferation and cytokine production. We show that atypical MBCs do not actively secrete Abs or differentiate into Ab-secreting cells (ASCs) in vitro. Thus, while atypical and classical MBCs appear closely related, atypical MBCs exhibit markedly reduced signaling and effector function, which may contribute to the inefficient acquisition of humoral immunity to malaria, findings that point toward the possibility of modulating B cell responses to enhance malaria vaccine efficacy in endemic areas.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Atypical MBCs are greatly expanded in malaria-exposed individuals</title><p>In this study we analyzed naïve B cells (CD10<sup>−</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD20<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>−</sup>), classical MBCs (CD10<sup>−</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD20<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>) and atypical MBCs (CD10<sup>−</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD20<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>−</sup>CD27) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) from the peripheral blood of 107 Malian adults with lifelong exposure to intense <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission, and 6 Malian children during acute febrile malaria.

To do so, we fractionated PBMC samples using two different negative B cell selection cocktails that only differed by the presence of CD43- and CD66b-specific Abs—proteins that are expressed exclusively on plasmablasts and plasma cells. This yielded from each sample two fractions: total B cells, and total B cells without plasma cells and plasmablasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). As expected, the B cell fraction that included plasma cells and plasmablasts contained ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), whereas the fraction from which plasma cells and plasmablasts had been depleted did not contain ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), thus confirming that atypical MBCs do not actively secrete Abs.</p><p>Because the recent study in Gabon analyzed atypical MBCs from adults with acute febrile malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Muellenbeck et al., 2013</xref>), it remained possible that atypical MBCs only secrete Abs during an active malaria infection. To test this hypothesis, we used the same negative selection procedures described above to isolate total B cells and B cells without plasma cells/plasmablasts from children during acute febrile malaria. With these fractions we found by ELISPOT that atypical MBCs do not actively secrete Abs during an active malaria infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we asked whether atypical MBCs could differentiate into ASCs in vitro when stimulated with CpG oligonucleotide, Protein A from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, pokeweed mitogen and IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weiss et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to classical MBCs, which readily differentiate into ASCs in response to these polyclonal stimuli, atypical MBCs did not differentiate into ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>Thus, malaria-associated atypical MBCs do not actively secrete Abs at rest or in response to a malaria infection in vivo. Moreover, atypical MBCs do not differentiate into ASCs when stimulated in vitro. Together these data indicate that atypical MBCs do not directly contribute to Ab-mediated protection from malaria.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Two features that distinguish the humoral immune response to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection in individuals living in malaria endemic areas are the inefficiency with which long-lived plasma cells and classical MBCs are acquired and the large expansion of atypical MBCs, even in young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Portugal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Scholzen and Sauerwein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hviid et al., 2015</xref>). As a consequence of the slow acquisition of malaria-specific MBCs and long-lived Abs, children in endemic areas are left susceptible to repeated bouts of clinical malaria that in about 1% of cases becomes severe and life threatening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">WHO, 2013</xref>). Although the expansion of atypical MBCs appears to be driven by malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Illingworth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Muellenbeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scholzen et al., 2014</xref>), we do not yet know the consequences of this expansion.</p><p>To gain insight into the developmental relationship between atypical and classical MBCs we carried out next generation sequencing of the expressed V<sub>H</sub> genes of each subpopulation and also determined the number of cell divisions cells that each subpopulation had undergone. Indeed, V<sub>H</sub> gene sequencing showed that V<sub>H</sub> gene usage and the rates of SHM in atypical and classical MBCs, predicted to occur in germinal center reactions, were indistinguishable. Notably, we observed a high degree of clonal connectivity between atypical and classical MBCs, indicating that a significant proportion of atypical and classical MBCs share a common precursor. By KREC analysis we also observed that atypical and classical MBCs appear to have undergone a similar number of cell divisions. Together the results of these analyses suggest that atypical and classical MBCs are closely related developmentally and have had similar antigen-driven germinal center experiences.</p><p>To obtain a more in-depth view of the similarities and differences between atypical and classical MBCs we analyzed and compared the transcriptional profiles of the two populations. This analysis revealed the differential expression of several inhibitory receptors including ones that we previously determined were upregulated in atypical MBCs by cell surface phenotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weiss et al., 2009</xref>). Two DEGs of particular interest are FCRL5 and FCRL3. By cell surface phenotyping we originally reported that atypical MBCs expressed FcRL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weiss et al., 2009</xref>). The FcRL4 expression was low and because of the absence of FCRL4 transcripts in atypical MBCs reported here we now conclude that the staining of B cells with FcRL4-specific mAb was likely due to cross reactivity of the mAb with FcRL5 or FcRL3. The best-characterized B cell populations that resemble atypical MBCs, namely tissue–like MBCs described in the mucosal lymphoid tissues of healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehrhardt et al., 2005</xref>) and exhausted MBCs described in HIV-infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moir et al., 2008</xref>), express FcRL4 at both the protein and transcript levels. These results suggest the interesting possibility that the differential expression of FCRLs by B cell populations may be dictated by the immune environment in which the cells arise.</p><p>How FcRL5 and FcRL3 contribute to the biology of atypical MBCs remains to be determined. In mice, FcRL5 expression is associated with innate-like B cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2014</xref>) and recent studies suggest that FcRL5, which contains both an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) within its cytoplasmic domain, may exert a binary, compartment-specific influence on B cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). In humans, FcRL5 expression has been linked to both inhibition and enhancement of B cell responses. FcRL5, through its recruitment of the phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2, inhibits BCR-dependent activation of human B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haga et al., 2007</xref>). In human naïve B cells, BCR crosslinking was shown to induce the expression of FcRL5 and crosslinking FcRL5 together with TLR9 activation enhanced B cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dement-Brown et al., 2012</xref>). FcRL5 has been recently shown to bind to Fc of Ig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson et al., 2012</xref>) and would be predicted to respond to environmental changes in the levels of immune complexes. Intriguingly, FcRL5 has also been shown to bind to an orthopoxvirus MHC-class I-like molecule secreted by infected cells suggesting a role of FcRL5-expressing cells in defense against poxvirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campbell et al., 2010</xref>). It will be interesting to explore whether FcRL5 binds to any <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-encoded products. The human FcRL3 also contains both ITIMs and ITAMs in its cytoplasmic domain and appears to be most highly related to FcRL5 in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies of human peripheral blood B cells provided evidence that FcRL3 expression increases as a function of differentiation and is highest among MBC subsets with innate-like features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2013</xref>). FcRL3 ligation augmented TLR9 mediated B cell proliferation but blocked plasma cell differentiation and Ab production. Thus, it is possible that both FcRL5 and FcRL3 serve to orchestrate adaptive and innate responses in atypical MBCs.</p><p>Importantly, we provide evidence here that atypical MBCs have lost two key adaptive immune B cell functions, namely the ability to signal through the BCR and to differentiate into ASCs. Attenuated BCR signaling was suggested by the microarray data that showed differential expression of key components of the BCR signaling pathway. A direct test of the ability of atypical MBCs to respond to BCR crosslinking showed that signaling was blocked at an early signaling event, the phosphorylation of the kinase Syk. It is reasonable to assume that this block is mediated by the several inhibitory receptors upregulated by atypical MBCs, including FcRL5, through their ability to recruit the phosphatases SHP1/SHP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2014</xref>). The inability of atypical MBCs to respond to antigen stimulation raises the question: to what, if anything, are atypical MBCs B cells sensitive? We recently demonstrated that the expression of FcRL4 similarly blocked BCR signaling but simultaneously enhanced responses to TLR9 ligands and we suggested that FcRL4 expression switched adaptive B cells to innate-like B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sohn et al., 2011</xref>). Although here we observed that atypical MBCs showed reduced responsiveness to TLR4 and TLR9 ligands and other polyclonal stimuli, the extent to which this is modulated by FcRL5 expression remains to be determined.</p><p>We also demonstrate that atypical MBCs do not spontaneously secrete Abs and moreover cannot be stimulated to secrete Abs under condition that induce classical MBCs to readily differentiate into ASCs. We observed a lack of spontaneous Ab secretion from both ‘resting’ atypical MBCs in Malian adults as well as from atypical MBCs isolated from children during acute febrile malaria. These results indicate that atypical MBCs do not directly contribute to Ab-mediated protection from malaria. Our findings are in contrast to a recent study of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected adults living in Gabon in which it was suggested that atypical MBCs actively secrete Abs, an assertion based on the expression of mRNA encoding secretory Ig, although Ig secretion was not measured directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Muellenbeck et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that under some conditions atypical MBCs may secrete Ig but what those conditions are remains to be determined. It will be of interest in future longitudinal studies to compare the biochemical and molecular features of atypical and classical MBCs within individuals before, during and after <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections and clinical malaria.</p><p>Profiling the antigen specificity of atypical MBCs will ultimately be necessary to fully understand the biology of these cells. Because atypical MBCs do not actively secrete Abs or differentiate into ASCs when stimulated, we could not directly assess their antigen specificity through conventional methods such as ELISA or ELISPOT. In ongoing efforts we are attempting to develop fluorescently labeled <italic>P. falciparum</italic> antigens to identify antigen-specific B cells by flow cytometry, although this approach is challenging due to the low frequency of any given antigen-specific MBC population in peripheral blood. Because unambiguous targets of protective Abs have yet to be identified in malaria, another approach involves cloning and expressing antibodies from bulk-sorted atypical and classical MBCs to compare their specificity profiles in an unbiased manner using protein microarrays that represent the entire <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteome of over 5400 gene products.</p><p>Whether atypical MBCs negatively impact the efficacy of vaccines in malaria endemic areas, particularly candidate malaria vaccines, also remains to be determined. This possibility was suggested by the observation that the TLR9 agonist CpG failed to enhance specific MBC responses to a candidate malaria vaccine in Malian adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Traore et al., 2009</xref>) but not U.S. adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crompton et al., 2009</xref>). It will be of interest to determine whether reduced BCR signaling and effector function in atypical MBCs can be reversed in vitro, and if so, whether this can be translated into strategies that enhance vaccine efficacy in malaria-exposed populations. Further insight into whether atypical MBCs negatively impact vaccine-induced or naturally acquired immunity to malaria and other pathogens would be facilitated by reagents that reliably identify antigen-specific B cells.</p><p>In summary, while atypical and classical MBCs appear closely related developmentally, atypical MBCs exhibit markedly reduced signaling and effector function, which may contribute to the inefficient acquisition of humoral immunity to malaria. These findings provide fundamental insights into the functional plasticity of the human B cell compartment, and also suggest that B cells could be modulated to enhance vaccine efficacy, particularly in malaria endemic areas.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study subjects</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Malian donors</title><p>For this study we focused on asymptomatic healthy adults (n = 107) aged 18–61 years with lifelong malaria exposure.

Three genes were selected based on three criteria: uniform mRNA expression in all samples, low CV across treatments, expression level and gene function. The three genes were tRNA 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridylate methyltransferase (TRMU), ubiquitination factor E4A (UBE4A), and lysine (K)-specific demethylase 5A (KMD5A), which were expressed from low to high level, respectively. All reference and validation gene TaqMan expression assays were ordered from Life Technologies. All TaqMan assays stated with ‘Best Coverage’ for RNA analysis by the company were selected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2C</xref>). QPCR amplification efficiency was tested for each constitutively expressed gene in combination with each target gene. The Invitrogen Express QPCR supermix universal with premixed ROX (Life Technologies) was used to perform the assays. The multiplex reactions were carried out in 20 µl reactions with 1× RT-PCR buffer, 1× TaqMan expression assay mix. The Q-PCR reactions were carried out at 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 2 min, and 55 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. Data was analyzed using 7900HT version 2.4 sequence detection system software according to manufacturer's recommendations (Life technologies). All three reference gene primers and probes performed at an efficiency of 85% or above in duplex QPCR reactions with the 10 target genes selected for validation, with the exceptions being IL4R and KMD5A. The UBE4A reference gene was selected due to its medium level of expression and consistent amplification efficiency across all 10 genes. 10 QPCR master mixes were prepared with each consisting of the target gene, UBE4A reference gene and TaqMan expression mix. Each mastermix was placed on a 96-well plate and ss cDNA sample template was added to each well in a 96-well plate. Each mastermix was combined with template cDNA on a single 384-well plate using Biomek NX<sup>P</sup> automated lab assistant (Beckman Coulter Inc.) to minimize well-to-well and plate-to-plate pipetting differences in cDNA template and master mix volumes. All QPCR reactions were prepared on the same day by one individual. Plates were frozen at −80°C, thawed one-by-one, and run on 7900HT TaqMan instrument, and analyzed following the comparative C<sub>T</sub>-method (Life Technologies). Spearman non-parametric correlation (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) was calculated between real-time PCR C<sub>T</sub>-values and quantile normalized GeneChip probe-set signals for the 10 target genes for all 60 samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Replication history of sorted B cell subpopulations</title><p>The Kappa-deleting Recombination Excision Circles (KREC) assay was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Zelm et al., 2007</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor) and four reviewers, one of whom, Urszula Krzych, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study seeks to increase our understanding on the role aMBCs in response to persisting or chronic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection (with a major contribution from the current authors). The study is both timely and important in enhancing our understanding of the origins and function of aMBCs. Specifically, the differential expression of FcRL5 and FcRL3 is interesting and suggests that atypical memory B cells acquire different phenotypes dependent on the specific type of chronic infection. It will be interesting to understand the differences in the phenotype and function of atypical memory B cells induced as a result of different chronic infections in the future. In summary, the manuscript provides a detailed comparison of atypical and classical memory B cells isolated from individuals living in a high transmission area. The data are likely to lead to further investigation into the function of these cells both during and after chronic exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> as well as other chronic infections. Although much has been reported previously by this and other groups, both in malaria and chronic viral infection, overall this is an interesting study and well conducted, analysed and presented.</p><p>1) The issue of antigen specificity is not addressed and it is quite imperative that results from experiments showing antigen-specific B cell responses are included.</p><p>2) The biochemical and molecular analyses are interesting but of limited scope. None of the experiments address the very interesting questions outlined in the Abstract regarding the potential relationship between aMBC and cMBC response to re-infection.</p><p>3) There was lower somatic hypermutations in B cells from malaria-exposed individuals compared to American adults.</p><p>A) How did these groups differ in age?</p><p>B) Would there be any difference between parasite negative and positive Malian adults? Although it is reported here that the Malian adults were asymptomatic, it is not clear if this is in terms parasite positivity, as asymptomatic simply means no symptoms.</p><p>4) Methodology:</p><p>A) Please indicate how many of either FACS or magnetic bead sorted cells were obtained and from what amount of blood, and how many cells were used for the specific experiments. This information must be included; otherwise it becomes difficult to appraise and critic the results presented. Furthermore, scientific methods ought to be presented in a way that others can replicate the experiments.</p><p>B) The purity of the sorted aMBC, cMBC, and naïve B cells ranged between 75–98%? Do the impurities include other B cell types? Was there a deliberate attempt to avoid plasmablasts?</p><p>C) Please include methods for proliferation.</p><p>D) Please justify and reference the use of TLR4 in human B cells stimulation.</p><p>E) Is LPS used for PBMC stimulation or is it targeted to the monocytes?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07218.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The issue of antigen specificity is not addressed and it is quite imperative that results from experiments showing antigen-specific B cell responses are included</italic>.</p><p>We agree that profiling the antigen specificity of atypical MBCs will ultimately be necessary to fully understand the biology of these cells. Importantly, we found that atypical MBCs do not actively secrete antibodies or differentiate into antibody-secreting cells when stimulated, thus precluding a direct assessment of their antigen specificity through conventional methods such as ELISA or ELISPOT.</p><p>In ongoing work we are taking two approaches to determine the specificity of atypical MBCs. First, we are optimizing flow cytometry protocols and reagents to directly quantify antigen-specific B cells by staining surface IgG with labeled antigen. Preliminary findings from our lab and collaborators indicate that currently available protocols and reagents lack the specificity required to generate interpretable data. In general, this approach has proved challenging for the field given the low frequency of any given antigen-specific MBC population in peripheral blood. In a second ongoing effort we are cloning and expressing antibodies from bulk-sorted atypical MBCs and classical MBCs to compare their specificity profiles using protein microarrays representing the entire <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteome of over 5,400 gene products. We embarked on this unbiased but laborious approach because the malaria field has yet to identify unambiguous targets of protective antibodies.</p><p>As noted in the Introduction, several lines of evidence suggest that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection per se contributes to atypical MBC expansion including a positive correlation between atypical MBCs and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission intensity; the differential expansion of atypical MBCs in age-matched children living under similar conditions in rural Kenya with the exception of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exposure; and the appearance of atypical MBCs in the blood of healthy adults following experimental <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection. Additionally, in the study described in our manuscript we found that malaria-associated CD21<sup>–</sup>CD27<sup>–</sup>-atypical MBCs express FcRL3 and FcRL5 but not FcRL4, in contrast to HIV-associated CD21<sup>–</sup>CD27<sup>–</sup> exhausted MBCs that express FcRL4. This important finding suggests that the quality of CD21<sup>–</sup>CD27<sup>–</sup> MBC expansion is not a generic response to chronic infection but varies by pathogen.</p><p>As noted by the reviewers, we anticipate that the conceptual advances in the current manuscript will likely stimulate others to further investigate the function and specificity of atypical MBCs both during and after chronic exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> as well as other chronic infections. We added text to the Discussion to emphasize these important points.</p><p><italic>2) The biochemical and molecular analyses are interesting but of limited scope. None of the experiments address the very interesting questions outlined in the Abstract regarding the potential relationship between aMBC and cMBC response to re-infection</italic>.</p><p>We examined the earliest events in B cell receptor signaling and the consequent downstream effector functions including proliferation, cytokine production and antibody production. The results of these experiments clearly point toward critical functional differences in atypical and classical MBCs. As the reviewers suggest, it will be of interest in future longitudinal studies to further compare the biochemical and molecular features of atypical MBCs and classical MBCs before, during and after malaria re-infection. We added text to the Discussion to underscore this important point.</p><p><italic>3) There was lower somatic hypermutations in B cells from malaria-exposed individuals compared to American adults</italic>.</p><p><italic>A) How did these groups differ in age?</italic></p><p>In the current study we generated B cell somatic hypermutation data only from Malian adults. In the Discussion we contrasted these data with published B cell somatic hypermutation data generated by others in U.S. adults. Although this informal comparison hints at different somatic hypermutation rates, we opted to remove this reference from the Discussion because of important methodological differences between the studies. It will be of interest in future studies to conduct head-to-head comparisons of B cell somatic hypermutation rates in age-matched individuals with and without a history of exposure to malaria and other pathogens.</p><p><italic>B) Would there be any difference between parasite negative and positive Malian adults? Although it is reported here that the Malian adults were asymptomatic, it is not clear if this is in terms parasite positivity, as asymptomatic simply means no symptoms.</italic></p><p>All subjects included in the IgH repertoire analysis, which generated the somatic hypermutation data, were <italic>P. falciparum</italic> negative by thick blood smear. We added text to the Results section to clarify this point.</p><p><italic>4) Methodology</italic>:</p><p><italic>A) Please indicate how many of either FACS or magnetic bead sorted cells were obtained and from what amount of blood, and how many cells were used for the specific experiments.

Furthermore, scientific methods ought to be presented in a way that others can replicate the experiments</italic>.</p><p>This information has been added to the Methods and Results sections.</p><p><italic>B) The purity of the sorted aMBC, cMBC, and naïve B cells ranged between 75–98%?</italic></p><p>We added text to the Results section and representative flow cytometry plots to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> to clarify the sorting methods and the levels of purity achieved. Specifically, the negative B cell selection kit removed all non-B cells and plasma cells/plasmablast and consistently yielded total B cells of &gt;98% purity. These negatively selected B cells were separated into subpopulations either by FACS sorting or magnetic columns. For sorting, we used conjugated monoclonal Abs specific for CD10, CD19, CD20, CD21 and CD27 and achieved the following purity: naïve B cells 96.4%, classical MBCs 93.9% and atypical MBCs 91.5%. For magnetic isolation, we assessed purity by flow cytometry using conjugated monoclonal Abs specific for CD19, CD21 and CD27 and achieved the following purity: naïve B cells 93.2%, classical MBCs 73.0% and atypical MBCs 81.9%.</p><p><italic>Do the impurities include other B cell types?</italic></p><p>As described above, the first step in all experiments involving B cell subpopulations was the isolation of total B cells with a negative selection kit that consistently yielded purity of &gt;98%. Therefore, contamination from non-B cells was negligible in all experiments. In the case of magnetic isolation, both classical MBC and atypical MBC contained a similar proportion of contaminating naïve B cells, which is expected given that naïve B cells comprise the largest subpopulation of total B cells. To clarify this point in the manuscript we added representative flow cytometry plots of purified subpopulations to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> and edited the manuscript to clarify that the B cell subpopulations were obtained from highly purified B cells.</p><p><italic>Was there a deliberate attempt to avoid plasmablasts?</italic></p><p>Yes, we deliberately removed plasmablasts unless the experiment required plasmablasts as a positive control for Ab-secreting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). As described above, all experiments that involved sorted B cell subpopulations began by removing all non-B cell and plasma cells/plasmablast from PBMCs using a kit that contained Abs specific for CD2, CD3, CD14, CD16, CD36, CD43, CD56, CD66b and glycophorin A, thereby removing plasma cells/plasmablasts that express CD43 and CD66b. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows that the removal of plasma cells/plasmablasts was highly effective.</p><p><italic>C) Please include methods for proliferation</italic>.</p><p>We added a description of the proliferation assay to the Methods section.</p><p><italic>D) Please justify and reference the use of TLR4 in human B cells stimulation</italic>.</p><p>To be convinced that atypical MBCs could not be activated to secrete Abs we tried a number of conventional B cell stimulants. Because these failed to activate atypical MBCs we considered alternatives. Although TLR4 is expressed at low levels on human resting B cells, it is upregulated on B cells in individuals with inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McDonnell et al., 2011</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ganley-Leal et al., 2010</xref>) and we considered that atypical MBCs may respond to LPS. We added text and references to the Results section to justify the use of LPS to stimulate human B cells.</p><p><italic>E) Is LPS used for PBMC stimulation or is it targeted to the monocytes?</italic></p><p>As described above in response to 4B all experiments, including those involving LPS stimulation, used B cells that had been negatively selected with a kit that consistently yielded purity of &gt;98%. Therefore, contamination from non-B cells, including monocytes, was negligible.</p></body></sub-article></article>
