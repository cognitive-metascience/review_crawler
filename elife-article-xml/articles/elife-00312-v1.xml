Particularly, the dentate gyrus (DG) is hypothesized to perform pattern separation by forming distinct representations of similar inputs. How pattern separation is achieved by the DG remains largely unclear. By examining neuronal activities at a population level, we revealed that, unlike CA1 neuron populations, dentate granule cell (DGC) ensembles activated by learning were not preferentially reactivated by memory recall. Moreover, when mice encountered an environment to which they had not been previously exposed, a novel DGC population—rather than the previously activated DGC ensembles that responded to past events—was selected to represent the new environmental inputs. This selection of a novel responsive DGC population could be triggered by small changes in environmental inputs. Therefore, selecting distinct DGC populations to represent similar but not identical inputs is a mechanism for pattern separation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00312.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00312.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00312.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Being able to keep memories of similar events separate in your mind is an essential part of remembering. If you use the same carpark every day, recalling where you left your car this morning is challenging, not because you have to remember an event from long ago, but because you have to distinguish between many similar memories.</p><p>Keeping memories distinct is one of the functions of a subregion of the hippocampus called the dentate gyrus. The process of taking complex memories and converting them into representations that are less easily confused is known as pattern separation. Exactly how the dentate gyrus achieves this, however, is unclear.</p><p>Computational models predict that a different population of dentate gyrus cells will be active when an animal is in different environments. However, previous experiments have instead shown that the same population of cells is active in multiple environments, and that cells distinguish between environments by firing at different rates.</p><p>Now, Deng et al. have added to our understanding of pattern separation. The researchers used a type of genetically modified mouse in which it is possible to identify or ‘tag' the activity of a population of hippocampal neurons at multiple time points. They placed each mouse in a box and noted which hippocampal neurons were active as the animal learned about its new environment. After several such learning episodes, the animal received a mild electric shock inside the box. When it was returned to the box the next day, the mouse remembered receiving the shock, enabling the researchers to note which neurons were active during the retrieval process.</p><p>Deng et al. found that in a subregion of the hippocampus called CA1, the particular neurons that were active during the initial learning episode were also likely to be active when the animals remembered receiving the shock. However, this was not the case for the dentate gyrus: in this subregion, distinct groups of cells were active during learning and during retrieval. Moreover, exposing the mice to two subtly different environments activated two distinct groups of cells in the dentate gyrus.</p><p>The work of Deng et al. reveals that memory retrieval does not always involve reactivation of the same neurons that were active during encoding. More importantly, the results indicate that the dentate gyrus performs pattern separation by using distinct populations of cells to represent similar but non-identical memories. Overall the findings add to our understanding of the mechanisms that underpin memory formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00312.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00312.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>learning and memory</kwd><kwd>dentate gyrus</kwd><kwd>pattern separation</kwd><kwd>CA1</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>James S.

The DG receives excitatory inputs from entorhinal cortex (EC) layer II neurons via the perforant pathway and relays the information to CA3 through mossy fibers. The CA3 in turn projects to CA1, which sends back-projections to deep layers of the EC, forming the classic tri-synaptic pathway (EC→DG→CA3→CA1). CA3 also receives direct inputs from EC through the perforant pathway and there are extensive interconnections among CA3 neurons via recurrent collateral fibers. In addition to inputs from CA3, CA1 receives inputs directly from EC layer III neurons through the temporoammonic pathway, forming a monosynaptic pathway (EC→CA1). In this complex neural network, each pathway and each subregion is likely to carry out specific functions during learning and memory.</p><p>Based on these network connections and the anatomical characteristics of each subregion, theories about specific functions of the individual hippocampal subregions in learning and memory have been proposed by computational modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rolls and Kesner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rolls, 2010</xref>). In particular, the DG is postulated to function as a pattern separator by de-correlating inputs from EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marr, 1971</xref>) because of its sparse activity and its considerably larger population of neurons compared to the EC and CA3. The pattern separation function of the DG is supported by accumulating evidence from behavioral studies, reporting that animals with lesions or blocked plasticity in the DG were impaired in discriminating similar spatial and contextual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilbert et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McHugh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goodrich-Hunsaker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nakashiba et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, how the DG achieves the pattern separation function remains elusive. In vivo physiological recordings of dentate granule cells (DGCs) have shown that changes in environmental inputs only evoke the rate remapping of DGCs but not the global remapping predicted by computational models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leutgeb et al., 2007</xref>). Through the powerful mossy fiber synapses, outputs of the DG are passed to the downstream recurrent network in CA3, which is hypothesized to be the site for memory storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Treves and Rolls, 1994</xref>). Computational studies have suggested that it is advantageous to have two extrinsic afferent systems for the autoassociative network in CA3—one with strong synapses for memory formation and the other with associatively modifiable synapses for memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Treves and Rolls, 1992</xref>). Therefore, it has been speculated that the mossy fiber inputs from the DG may be particularly suitable for memory formation, whereas the direct inputs from EC may be responsible for information recall. On the other hand, CA1 is considered to be a feed forward neural network and is the main output region for the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rolls and Kesner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rolls, 2010</xref>). Experimental evidence from genetic and physiological studies has demonstrated the importance of CA1 for both memory formation and retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Riedel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dupret et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goshen et al., 2011</xref>). Because the large size of the DGC population is a key factor for the computational hypothesis of pattern separation, we utilized TetTag transgenic mice to examine the population neuronal activity of the dorsal DG to test whether DGCs undergo global remapping at the population level. To examine the specificity of the responsiveness of the DGCs, population activity in CA1 was also analyzed. Our results revealed a novel mechanism for pattern separation in the DG: the selection of distinct DGC populations to represent different contextual information. In addition, we observed that memory recall preferentially reactivated the neuronal population involved in learning in CA1 but not in the DG, suggesting that, in a complex neural network, memory recall may not reinstate the activities in every pathway involved in memory formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Using TetTag transgenic mice to examine neuronal activity at a population level</title><p>We studied the population activity of neurons in the hippocampus by examining the transient expression of immediate early genes (IEGs, such as <italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Arc</italic> and <italic>Egr1</italic>), which is commonly used as an indicator of recent neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guzowski et al., 2005</xref>). To compare the activities in the same neuronal population in response to two events at sequential time points, we used TetTag bi-transgenic mice in which neuronal activities at a given time window can be persistently labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reijmers et al., 2007</xref>). In these mice, neuronal activity can activate the <italic>Fos</italic> promoter and induce the expression of tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) from the <italic>Fos-tTA</italic> transgene. In the absence of doxycycline (dox), a drug that binds to tTA and prevents tTA from binding to the tetracycline responsive promoter (<italic>tetO</italic>), the resulting tTA can activate the expression of the tau-LacZ marker from the transgene: <italic>tetO-tau-lacZ:tTA*</italic>. At the same time, a tetracycline-insensitive form of transactivator (tTA*: tTA containing H100Y point mutation) is also expressed, allowing the persistent tau-LacZ expression irrespective of dox treatment. Thus, if the mice are removed from dox treatment for an initial experience and euthanized shortly after a second experience, the activity of the same neuronal ensemble in response to these two sequential experiences can be assessed by examining the expressions of tau-LacZ and IEGs, which correspond to neuronal activities of the first and second experiences, respectively.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00312.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Induction of tag (tau-LacZ) expression by removing dox treatment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A brief cartoon illustrating the TetTag transgenic system.

In the presence of dox (left panel), tTA cannot induce the expression of either tau-lacZ or tTA* (mutated tTA i.e. insensitive to dox) (see Neuron A as an example). When mice were removed from the dox diet (middle panel), tTA, whose expression is induced by neuronal activity, can bind to the tetO promoter to activate the expression of the tau-lacZ marker gene and tTA*. tTA* and tetO form a transcription feedback loop that can sustain the expression of tau-lacZ even after mice are put back on dox treatment (see Neuron B). Putting mice on dox food will close the time window to mark the activated neurons with tau-lacZ (Neuron C).

We exposed mice to an enriched environment under either a dox-on or dox-off condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,E</xref>, see ‘Materials and methods') and found that removing dox treatment effectively induced tau-LacZ expression in neurons of the DG and CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>), with most of the LacZ-positive neurons displaying typical morphologies of granule cells and pyramidal neurons in the DG and CA1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Furthermore, many LacZ-positive cells also co-expressed FOS, with over 70% and 85% of LacZ-positive cells expressing FOS in the DG and CA1, respectively, suggesting that the expression of LacZ did not affect the expression of IEGs in the same neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). It was also notable that the efficiency of tagging was low, compared to the endogenous FOS labeling, particularly in the CA1 region. A low efficiency of tagging was also observed in basolateral amygadala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reijmers et al., 2007</xref>). This low and variable induction efficiency across brain regions was possibly caused by low penetrance and variable expressivity of the transgenes, a common problem for transgenic mice. To test if the tagged population represents activities in the general population, we measured the intensity of FOS staining in the LacZ-positive and LacZ-negative neurons. In both DG and CA1, the FOS intensity was similar between LacZ-positive and LacZ-negative populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B–E</xref>). Therefore, it was likely that LacZ tagged neurons were representatives of the activated population, although we could not formally rule out the possibility that only a specific population of activated neurons (e.g. the population with the highest activities) could be tagged. The induction efficiency was even lower in CA3 with few neurons tagged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), preventing further analysis in this region.</p><p>We next tested the activity-dependent expression of tau-LacZ markers in TetTag mice. After removing them from dox treatment, we exposed some mice to a fear conditioning chamber (ctxA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) and kept others in their home cage (HC) (‘Materials and methods'). While LacZ-positive neurons could be readily detected in both CA1 and the DG in the HC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), substantially more LacZ tagged neurons were observed in the ctxA mice in both CA1 and the DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>; t-test, in CA1, HC, 1.5 ± 0.5%, n = 4; ctxA, 5.1 ± 0.5%, n = 3; p&lt;0.007; in the DG, HC, 1.9 ± 0.7%; ctxA, 6.9 ± 1.0%; p&lt;0.016). Therefore, the dox-regulated and activity-dependent expression of LacZ in both the DG and CA1 suggested the feasibility of studying neuronal activities at a population level in these hippocampal subregions using TetTag mice.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00312.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Activity-dependent induction of tag (tau-LacZ) expression.</title><p>(<bold>A)</bold> and (<bold>B</bold>) The expressions of LacZ marker (green) in CA1 (<bold>A</bold>) and DG (<bold>B</bold>) of the mice in the home cage (HC) group.

We chose this task because the formation of the contextual memory, which is dependent on the hippocampus, can be temporally separated from the subsequent context-shock association, which presumably relies mostly on the function of amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rudy and O'Reilly, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rudy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reijmers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2009</xref>). With dox treatment removed, we pre-exposed one group of mice (preA, n = 12) to the fear conditioning chamber (context A) to tag the activated neurons (LacZ+) in contextual learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). After the last pre-exposure (on day 5), mice were put back on dox treatment to prevent further tagging. 2 days later, mice were subjected to immediate shock in the conditioning chamber and their conditioned fear memory was tested 1 day after immediate shock. Mice were perfused shortly after the memory test for neuronal activity analysis. For comparison, another group of mice (preC, n = 11) was subjected to the identical protocol except that they were pre-exposed to an environment (context C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) that was completely different from the conditioning chamber. Because the mice associated contextual information during pre-exposure with the subsequent aversive stimulus (i.e. foot shock) in this protocol, it was not surprising that preA mice but not preC mice displayed a high level of freezing behavior when the mice were tested for their conditioned response in context A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; t-test, t<sub>21</sub> = 3.424, p&lt;0.0026).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00312.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Memory recall preferentially reactivates the neuron population in response to learning in CA1 but not in the DG.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The pre-exposure-immediate shock paradigm for contextual fear conditioning.

We focused our analysis on the dorsal hippocampus, because this region has been shown to be tightly associated with learning and memory. For technical convenience, FOS and EGR1 were used as markers to assess the recall-activated neurons in CA1 and the DG, respectively, and we designated the percentage of IEG positive neurons in the total numbers of neurons quantified as the activation rate (‘Materials and methods'). To measure the proportion of the neurons that were activated by the recall test in the neuronal population that was previously activated during pre-exposure, we quantified the percentage of LacZ+IEG double positive neurons in the LacZ tagged population (designated as the reactivation rate).</p><p>We were not able to detect a significant difference in either CA1 or the DG in the percentage of LacZ positive neurons in the total numbers of neurons quantified between preA and preC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>; t-test, CA1: t<sub>21</sub> = 0.5005, p&gt;0.62; DG: t<sub>21</sub> = 0.8504, p&gt;0.40), suggesting that contexts A and C had equivalent simulating effects. To investigate how the neurons involved in memory formation responded to subsequent memory recall, we compared the reactivation rates to the corresponding activation rates. In CA1, whether or not the neurons that were activated during pre-exposure were preferentially activated again by the recall test in context A depended on the identity of the pre-exposure context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; ANOVA: group x activity rates interaction, F<sub>1,1</sub> = 11.60, p&lt;0.0027; main effect of activity rates, F<sub>1,21</sub> = 44.04, p&lt;0.0001; main effect of group, F<sub>1,21</sub> = 8.238, p&lt;0.0092). Because both groups of mice were tested in context A, there was no significant difference in the activation rate between preA and preC mice, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, Bonferroni post hoc test, p&gt;0.05). In contrast, the reactivation rate of preA mice was significantly higher than that of preC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, Bonferroni post hoc test, p&lt;0.001), indicating that a previous learning experience affected neuronal responses at the time of memory recall. In preA mice, which underwent pre-exposure and retested in context A, the reactivation rate was significantly higher than the activation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, Bonferroni post hoc test, p&lt;0.0001), suggesting that CA1 neurons that were activated during learning were preferentially reactivated by subsequent memory recall. By contrast, in preC mice, neurons responding to context C during pre-exposure were not preferentially activated by the subsequent test in context A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, Bonferroni post hoc test, activation rate vs reactivation rate in preC mice, p&gt;0.05), suggesting that recall-induced preferential reactivation of the CA1 neuron population involved in memory formation depended on retrieval of the same memory trace. We further quantified the degree of this reactivation preference by a reactivation index, which normalized the reactivation rate by the corresponding activation rate (‘Materials and methods'). In CA1, the reactivation index in preA but not preC mice was significantly above chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; one sample t-test, chance = 0: preA, t<sub>11</sub> = 12.12, p&lt;0.0001; preC, t<sub>10</sub> = 1.337, p&gt;0.20), with the index of preA mice being significantly higher than that of preC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; t-test, t<sub>21</sub> = 3.115, p&lt;0.0048). These data allow us to propose that the CA1 neuronal ensemble that is responsible for contextual learning is likely reinstated for the recall of the same memory trace. The consistency of this finding with previous reports that showed that CA1 is involved in both memory formation and retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Riedel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goshen et al., 2011</xref>) further validates our methodology of using TetTag mice for population neuronal activity study in the hippocampus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Selection of distinct populations of DGCs to represent different events in the DG</title><p>In contrast to CA1, memory recall did not induce the preferential reactivation of the population of DGCs that was activated during learning, as indicated by the similar activation rate and reactivation rate in preA mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; ANOVA: group x activity rates interaction, F<sub>1,1</sub> = 18.51, p&lt;0.0003; no main effect of activity rates, F<sub>1,21</sub> = 2.910, p=0.1028; main effect of group, F<sub>1,21</sub> = 6.213, p&lt;0.022; Bonferroni post hoc test, activation rate vs reactivation rate in preA, p&gt;0.05). To our surprise, in preC mice, the reactivation rate of DGCs was significantly lower than the activation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; Bonferroni post hoc test, p&lt;0.001), indicating that the DGC population responding to context C was significantly less likely to be activated by context A compared to the general DGC population. Compared to activation rates that were not significantly different between preA and preC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; Bonferroni post hoc test, p&gt;0.05), the reactivation rate of preC mice was significantly lower than that of preA mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; Bonferroni post hoc test, p&lt;0.001). Thus, rather than the DGC population responding to context C, preC mice activated a different population of DGCs in response to context A. These results were further confirmed by the analysis of reactivation indexes. The reactivation index was significantly higher in preA mice compared to that of preC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; t-test, t<sub>21</sub> = 5.032, p&lt;0.0001), with the index in preC but not preA mice significantly below chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; one sample t-test, chance = 0: preA, t<sub>11</sub> = 1.550, p&gt;0.14; preC, t<sub>10</sub> = 5.314, p&lt;0.0003). To substantiate these results, we re-analyzed the data in the DG by quantifying the activities in the entire z-series of confocal images and obtained similar results (see ‘Materials and methods', <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Given that the quantification of the entire z-series increased the sampling size, all subsequent analyses were carried out using this approach. Furthermore, we re-measured the activation and reactivation rates in a subset of preA and preC mice, using the expression of FOS as the indicator for DGC activities in the recall test. Similar results were obtained using either FOS or EGR1 as activity indicators in the same cohort of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In summary, these analyses of the population activities of DGCs demonstrated that neurons in the DG and CA1 responded differently during memory processing. Unlike CA1 pyramidal neurons, DGCs activated by learning an event were not preferentially reactivated by retrieving the same memory. Instead, distinct ensembles of DGCs were selected in response to different events.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00312.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Similar results are obtained in the activity analysis of DGCs using either FOS or EGR1 as IEG markers in the same cohort of mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Activity analysis using FOS as IEG marker and RBFOX3 as neuronal marker demonstrates the selection of different populations of DGCs to represent different environmental inputs (ANOVA: group x activity rate interaction, F<sub>1,1</sub> = 9.038, p&lt;0.017; Bonferroni post hoc test, reactivation rate vs activation rate, p&gt;0.05 for preA mice, p&lt;0.05 for preC mice; preA, n = 6; preC, n = 4).

Neurons that are responsive to both events are in yellow. When mice encounter a second event that is similar but not identical to event 1 (event 2 ≈ event 1), there is still a preference to activate the CA1 neurons that are activated by event 1. However, in the DG, another population of DGCs that does not respond to event 1 will likely be selected to respond to event 2. Hence, small changes in inputs can evoke a population code change in the DG but not CA1, providing a neural basis for the pattern separation function of the DG.

Moreover, the utilization of a separated DGC ensemble for encoding newly encountered events could be triggered by small changes in the environmental inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6F,G and 7</xref>). In contrast, CA1 network reactivation was not sensitive to the minor contextual alterations but could be affected by large input changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6F,G and 7</xref>). The notion that different populations of DGCs are used to represent different inputs has also been suggested by a computation model based on data obtained by cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity by fluorescence in situ hybridization (catFISH) of <italic>Arc</italic>, another IEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chawla et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with our results, studies have shown that lesions in the DG but not in CA1 caused a deficit in discrimination of spatial locations of low but not high separations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilbert et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goodrich-Hunsaker et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, blocking the plasticity in the DG resulted in a deficit in the discrimination of similar contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McHugh et al., 2007</xref>). Because DGCs are heavily innervated by local and hilar interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Houser, 2007</xref>), inhibition of DGCs by these interneurons can be a potential neural mechanism underlying the population selection; future studies are needed to test this possibility.</p><p>Our findings seem to disagree with previous results of physiological studies showing that the same ensemble of DGCs was active in multiple different environments despite displaying distinct firing patterns (i.e., rate remapping but not global remapping; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leutgeb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alme et al., 2010</xref>). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the physiological experiments and the experiments described here targeted different groups of neurons in the DG. Despite the fact that the identity of the neurons monitored by in vivo recording cannot be determined by simple histological analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012</xref>), it is postulated that the recorded neurons are likely to be newly born DGCs that are generated by adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alme et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012</xref>), because the newborn DGCs are more excitable compared to their mature counterparts and are more likely to be recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aimone et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, both mature and newly born DGCs were included in our analysis, with the mature DGCs representing the majority of the population (&gt;90%) due to the low rate of adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cameron and McKay, 2001</xref>). In a preliminary effort to test this possibility, we measured the distances of LacZ-tagged and EGR1-positive DGCs from the hilus and compared these distances to those of adult-born DGCs because adult-born DGCs tend to be located in the inner third of the granule cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mathews et al., 2010</xref>). While the majority of adult-born DGCs labeled by BrdU were located close to the hilus, the LacZ-positive and EGR1-positive DGCs were distributed throughout the granule cell layer and their locations were significantly further from the hilus compared to those of adult-born DGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), suggesting that they represented a DGC population different from the adult-born DGCs. Future studies are needed to investigate whether responses of adult-born DGCs in learning and memory are different from those of their mature counterparts, even though it has been shown that the adult-born DGCs are important for spatial discrimination in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clelland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Creer et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, the vast difference in kinetics between the in vivo recording studies and our study may also contribute to the inconsistency in the results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leutgeb et al. (2007)</xref> studied the responses of DGCs to events that occurred minutes apart; however, there was a three-day interval between pre-exposure and re-exposure in our experiments. It is possible that the same group of neurons is recruited to encode for events occurring within a short time interval. Neurons that responded to one event had elevated levels of CREB1 for a short period of time, making them more likely to be recruited by another event occurring in this time window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Silva et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, although the expression of IEGs can reflect general activation of neurons, it remains unclear what physiological changes the expression of IEGs is corresponding to. It is possible for firing patterns to vary within the IEG positive population. Hence, our findings, together with data from physiological studies, suggest that the DG can carry out pattern separation through both global remapping and rate remapping.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00312.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the location of the LacZ-positive and EGR1-positive DGCs with that of adult-born granule cells in the granule cell layer of the DG.</title><p>The distance of each cell from the hilus was measured using Metamorph.

Although this level of reactivation did not rise above chance we detected a weak but significant correlation between the reactivation index and behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This observation raises questions regarding which cortical-hippocampal pathway is reinstated by memory recall as well as whether reinstating the DG engram is sufficient and/or necessary for recall. A recent study showed that artificial reactivation of the DGCs involved in the acquisition of contextual fear conditioning was sufficient to induce the expression of fear memory in a neutral context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), but the extent of reactivation adequate for memory recall remains unknown. Our findings suggest the possibility that a mild increase in the reactivation by releasing a DGC ensemble from suppression seems enough to trigger the successful memory retrieval and expression. On the other hand, the chance level of reactivation of a learning-induced DGC population by recall suggests an alternative possibility: that preferential reactivation of the DG may not be necessary for memory recall. Because of the existence of multiple parallel pathways between the cortex and hippocampus, it is conceivable that memory retrieval may not necessarily rely on the EC→DG→CA3 pathway. Although this hypothesis remains to be tested directly, several lines of evidence support it. First, lesion of the DG affects encoding but not retrieval of spatial information, as indicated by behavioral studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lassalle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee and Kesner, 2004</xref>). Moreover, memory retrieval with the full set of recall cues is not affected by blocking the transmission between the DG and CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nakashiba et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, computational studies also suggest that, while the DG inputs to CA3 may be critical during learning, retrieval of memory may rely on direct pathways from EC to CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Treves and Rolls, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rolls, 2010</xref>). According to this theory, CA3 neurons involved in memory encoding are expected to be preferentially reactivated during memory retrieval. Unfortunately, we were unable to test this hypothesis in the current study due to technical limitations. However, we have demonstrated that CA1 neurons involved in encoding were preferentially reactivated by memory recall. In summary, our results suggest that, in a complex neural network, successful memory recall may not preferentially reactivate all the responsive pathways that are involved in memory formation.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00312.017</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Correlations between reactivation indexes and behavioral performance in the contextual fear conditioning experiments.</title><p>A weak but significant correlation between behavioral performance and the reactivation index was detected in the DG (r = 0.3641, p&lt;0.016) and no significant correlation was found in CA1 (r = 0.1379, p&gt;0.37).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00312.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00312.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00312-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>In contrast to the DG, CA1 neurons activated during contextual memory formation were preferentially reactivated upon retrieval of the memorized contextual information, even though the context was later associated with an emotional value (in our case, fear). This observation is in agreement with the notion that the hippocampus can automatically encode ongoing events, whereas the association of these events with an emotional value occurs in other brain structures, such as amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rudy and O'Reilly, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stote and Fanselow, 2004</xref>). Indeed, similar reactivations of CA1 neurons were observed when animals were re-exposed to a previously experienced environment without a change in emotional value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, ctxA/A group). Similar to our findings, equivalent levels of IEG induction were found in the hippocampus by subjecting mice to contextual fear conditioning training (context exposure plus foot shocks) or by exposing mice to the context without foot shocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ramamoorthi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, the role of the amygdala in the association of events with an emotional value is supported by the findings that neurons in the basal lateral amygdala activated during fear conditioning training are preferentially reactivated by the retrieval of contextual fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reijmers et al., 2007</xref>) and that post-learning elimination of amygdala neurons involved in fear learning erases the fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2009</xref>). Unlike in the DG, we were not able to detect a linear correlation between the CA1 reactivation and freezing behavior of mice under our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Particularly, in the experiment involving only small contextual changes, the reactivation index in CA1 did not change accordingly, although the alteration in environmental inputs seemed to be detected by mice, as reflected by their freezing behaviors. It is possible that the reactivation of CA1 may be necessary but not sufficient to drive the behavior under certain circumstance (e.g. when the input difference is detected by the DG/CA3 network). Given that remapping in CA1 is less sensitive to changes in environmental cues compared to CA3 and the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leutgeb et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2007</xref>), the small alteration in our experiment may not be significant enough to trigger a global remapping of CA1 neurons, although it remains possible that the firing patterns of activated neurons may be different. In addition, behavioral studies have shown that CA1 is dispensable for spatial pattern separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilbert et al., 2001</xref>). In summary, our findings are not only consistent with previous reports that CA1 is critically involved in both encoding and retrieval of spatial and contextual information but also suggest that the same CA1 ensemble used for memory formation is likely to be reactivated by recall of the same memory trace.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and treatments</title><p>The TetTag transgenic mice were obtained from Mark Mayford's lab and re-derived into a mixed background of C57BL/6 and balb/c.

We used a protocol that combined immediate shock with contextual pre-exposure to train mice for the contextual fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fanselow, 1990</xref>). We chose this protocol because the context learning phase can be well separated temporally from the memory recall phase to suit the slow kinetics in the TetTag system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reijmers et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, identical environmental inputs could be delivered at the pre-exposure and re-exposure.

Context C, completely different from context A, is located in another testing room, is modified from an open field chamber by inserting a dark box made of plexiglass and is scented with vanilla extract. The passage between the dark and light compartments is blocked, restricting the mouse within the light compartment. Subsequent to the pre-exposure procedure on day 5, all mice were put on a 1 g/kg dox diet to prevent the further tagging of activated neurons. On day 7, both groups of mice were subjected to the immediate shock protocol in context A', which was identical to context A except that the plastic floor was removed to allow the eliciting of shock through grid wires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The shock (0.7 mA, 2 s) was delivered 5 s after mice were placed in the chamber. 24 hr later, mice were re-introduced to context A for 3 min and were returned to their HC after the test.

All images used for quantification in the fear conditioning experiments that collected on Zeiss LSM scopes were acquired using 2 × 1 tiling except for those used for DG quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (no tiling). Typically, four to five images were analyzed for each animal in each region. The experimenter was blind to the behavioral history of the mice for all quantifications.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Quantification in CA1</title><p>Quantification was performed on one of the focal planes in the z-series. FOS staining was used for quantification in CA1 due to the relative low percentage (∼50%) of labeling of this IEG marker. Four types of cells were quantified in CA1 pyramidal layer in each image: RBFOX3 positive or DAPI positive cells, FOS-positive cells, LacZ-positive cells, and FOS+LacZ double-positive cells; the latter three populations were also positive for DAPI or RBFOX3. Each type of cell was counted using the ‘manually count objects' function of the Metamorph software. For double-positive cells, adjacent pictures in the z-series were used to validate the co-localization. The summations of cell counts in each category were obtained from four to five images along the rostral-caudal axis of the dorsal hippocampus. From these quantifications, we calculated the activation rate and reactivation rate according to the following formulas:<disp-formula id="eqn1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">activation rate</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">the number of FOS</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">cells</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">the number of RBFOX</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">cells</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="fx2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">reactivation rate</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">the number of FOS</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">LacZ</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">cells</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">the number of LacZ</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">cells</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Quantification in the DG</title><p>EGR1 staining was used for quantification in the DG due to the relatively high percentage (∼10–15%) of labeling of this IEG marker. In a subset of mice, the results were also confirmed by using FOS as the IEG marker and RBFOX3 as the marker for all neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Quantification in the DG was carried out by two methods to analyze the data in contextual fear conditioning experiment 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the first method, four types of cells were quantified in the granule cell layer on a single focal plane of each image: DAPI-positive cells, EGR1-positive cells, LacZ-positive cells, and EGR1+LacZ double-positive cells. Cells in the latter three categories were also positive for DAPI.

However, the between-group comparison should still be valid because the same estimation was applied for both experimental and control mice. Furthermore, data resulting from the second quantification approach were similar to those of the first approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We also measured the density of DGCs in TetTag mice. Brain sections (one-in-twelve series) from five mice were stained with anti-NeuN antibody. Three confocal z-series were taken from each section, with one each from the following DG areas: suprapyramidal blade, infrapyramidal blade and the vertex region. The z-series was taken at the thickness of 10 μm (with an interval of 1 μm) because the average diameter (width) of a DGC is about 10 μm. The number of DGCs was counted on the images resulting from maximum projection of z-series and the area of the dentate granule layer was outlined and measured using Metamorph. The volume of the granule cell layer in the image was the product of the image depth (10 μm) and the area of granule cell layer. The DGC density calculated from this measurement was 1.14 ± 0.02/1000 μm<sup>3</sup>. Because this value is very close to the reported DGC density by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kempermann et al. (1998)</xref>, we used 1.1/1000 μm<sup>3</sup> as the density to estimate the total number of DGCs in our quantification (see above).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports. General assessment and substantive concerns to be addressed during revision:</p><p>1. The authors use fear conditioning and active ensemble labeling (TetTag mouse and IEG IHC) in the CA1 and DG of the dorsal hippocampus to study how memory recall engages previously active neurons across these subregions. Their main findings are that recall leads to “reactivation” in CA1, but not in the DG. However, when faced with a novel context the DG actually remapped to a greater extent than would be expected by chance, which the authors suggest as a mechanism of pattern separation. First, the equivalent labeling observed in CA1 and the DG in the TetTag mice was surprising; as is obvious from this paper, this is not the case for endogenous FOS staining, which typically shows a 10x increase in CA1 compared to DG. Although their scoring tries to control for this, the authors should discuss how this artifact of the TG line could skew their results. In a similar vein, although they note the lack of FOS/lacZ overlap in Figure 1C, this should be quantified and noted in the table.</p><p>2. As the authors note, these data are in partial conflict with some earlier published results. First, physiology (Leutgeb et al 2007) has previously suggested no “global” remapping in the DG, which the authors suggest may be due to a bias towards sampling adults born GCs during recording. This is an interesting suggestion. As the authors should be able to partition their current dataset – a simple method could be distance from the hilus – to test if this bias is present in their study, it is not clear why it was not included. In addition, they raise the recent Liu et al (2012) study that demonstrated memory “reactivation” in the DG could drive fear behavior in a neutral context. It would strengthen the relationship between the current work and that paper if the authors could correlate the reactivation score and the freezing behavior of the individual mice to see if a correlation can be observed.</p><p>3. One surprising observation that is unaddressed in the discussion: in experiment 1, high freezing in the preA mice paralleled the increase in CA1 reactivation index, while low freezing in the preC mice paralleled a decrease in the DG reactivation index. In experiment 2, the behavioral result is similar: high freezing in A, low freezing in B. However, the CA1 reactivation index is identical in both conditions. This raises the question: why is there low freezing (on average) in B while there is equivalent reactivation in CA1? Is the CA1 ensemble independent of the behavior? This should be discussed in detail.</p><p>4. The main conclusions of the paper rely on comparisons between 2 populations of activated neurons, using measures that are very different from each other. lacZ expression is used to measure long-term activation of neurons (i.e., in response to the first experience, days ago) whereas c-fos or zif268 is used to measure recent activity (for the 2nd experience). In CA1 lacZ is expressed in ∼6% of neurons whereas c-fos is expressed in ∼50% of neurons, nearly a 10x difference. In the DG zif268 is expressed at about twice the lacZ levels (12% vs 6%). The dramatic differences in activity-dependent expression of these two markers make it difficult to understand how they can be compared. In other words, it seems that they don't represent activity equally at all. Granted, this problem is somewhat tempered by the fact that activation and reactivation measurements are both calculated as % of cells expressing IEGs zif or fos (% of the total population vs % of the lacZ population). Clearly these two populations of cells are differentially activated in some cases and maybe it's the case that lacZ expression does not identify a qualitatively different type of activity, but just identifies fewer activated cells (e.g., because it has a higher threshold?). It would be more convincing if this was demonstrated. Right now there are factors that make one wonder if they might just be detecting different types of activity.</p><p>5. Due to the slow onset of the tTA-tetO system, the authors remove Dox 3d before subjecting mice to experiences for activating neuronal ensembles. Thus, there is a significant amount of time (and therefore experience) during which DG neurons could be activated (and express lacZ) based on home cage experiences. It is shown that home cage lacZ expression is lower than context-induced activation but how do we know that, in the dual context experiments, lacZ expression is due to the brief context pre-exposure rather than home cage activity? This could be addressed by showing that there is very little IEG expression in lacZ cells when the mice are taken off Dox but not exposed to the first context. A related issue lies with presentation of the experimental design. In the figures (e.g., Figure 1b, Figure 3a, and Figure 5a) the “on Dox” arrows extend significantly into the portion of the experimental timeline where the animals are not on Doxycicline. This gives the impression that Dox is removed at the time of the 2nd experience when in fact it is removed much earlier, in the home cage situation.</p><p>6. It is not clear why the immediate shock contextual fear paradigm is used. Most previous studies that have examined the role of the DG in pattern separation have looked at activity in response to exploration of environments that are not associated with reward or shock. This doesn't necessarily have to be the case but for the current study the additional experiences associated with the learning process seem to confound interpretations. For example, to what extent does the 2nd experience activate neurons due to emotional content (recalling a memory of being shocked) vs. due to the fact that it's simply a different spatial environment? Also, why was the shock floor covered during pre-exposure and test but not during the shock? Why cover it at all? Thus, even animals that were exposed to the same context for both experiences (in order to see if the same population of DG neurons encodes re-experience of the same context) were also exposed to an additional similar context (one without the covered floor). So, what memory are the animals really recalling? Everything would be much cleaner if the mice were just exposed to one context and then a second context, with no intervening shocks or altered environments.</p><p>7. The cell quantification methods are poorly described. First, what is meant by “total number of DGCs (dentate granule cells)” and why was it, along with density, calculated? Some mention of calculations is made but not described so it may become clear if described better. Perhaps, since the proportion of DG neurons that are activated is quite low, the authors manually counted all IEG and lacZ expressing cells but did not want to manually count all the unactivated cells (NeuN and DAPI cells). So there was some calculation of local DG neuron density, which was then used to extrapolate to estimate the actual number of DG neurons that was sampled. Is this correct? In any case, there is some concern about these methods since this density-to-total-number-of-DG-neurons conversion can introduce biases. This is significant because the activation rate is based on this number (IEG/total number of DG neurons) whereas the reactivation rate is not (both numerator and denominator are based on manual cell counts with no density conversions) and many of the key comparisons are between activation and reactivation rates. CA1 analyses are also based on manual cell counts so comparisons there are also problematic.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00312.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1.

In the same TetTag mice, the low efficiency of LacZ induction has also been observed in basolateral amygdala in the original study by Reijmers et al. (Reijmers et al., 2007). To test the representativeness of the tagged population, we measured the intensity of FOS staining in the FOS+LacZ+ neurons and FOS+LacZ- neurons in mice that were perfused after an enriched environmental exposure during the dox-off window. In these mice, expressions of LacZ and FOS should theoretically be induced in the same population of neurons. We found equivalent intensity between the FOS+LacZ+ and FOS+LacZ- populations, suggesting that tagged neurons likely to be representative of the overall activated population. The data are presented in Figure 1–figure supplement 3b-e. However, we cannot formally rule out the possibility that the only specific population (e.g., neurons with highest activities) of activated neurons is tagged. In this scenario, our conclusions will only apply to this specialized population, though we think this possibility is unlikely. We discuss this issue in the revised manuscript. Contrary to the lack of cFos and lacZ overlap, we have noticed that “many lacZ-positive cells also co-expressed cFos” and, as suggested by the reviewers, we quantified the data and tabulated the results in Figure 1–figure supplement 3a.</p><p><italic>2.

It would strengthen the relationship between the current work and that paper if the authors could correlate the reactivation score and the freezing behavior of the individual mice to see if a correlation can be observed</italic>.</p><p>The possibility that those DG neurons responding to different environmental input by rate remapping are likely to be adult-born DGCs in the study of Leutgeb et al (2007) is raised not only by us but also by the authors in a follow up study (Alme et al., 2010) and by Knierim and colleagues in a recent study (Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012). As pointed out by the reviewers, the adult-born DGCs are likely located in the inner granule cell layer close to the hilus (Mathews et al., 2010). Therefore, it is possible to test whether the populations examined are different between the studies by determining the location of neurons. While it is difficult to determine the locations of the recorded neurons in physiological studies (Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012), we found that both LacZ+ and EGR1+ populations were distributed across the granule cells layer, significantly different from the distribution pattern of the BrdU labeled newborn DGC population. These new results are presented in Figure 8 and discussed accordingly. However, it remains possible that some newborn DGCs are included in our study and future studies are required to address the question as to whether the response pattern of the newborn DGC population is different from that of the mature DGC population in learning and memory.</p><p>Prompted by the reviewers, we have now included the result of a correlation analysis between the reactivation index and the freezing behavior of the individual mice in Figure 9. We found that the reactivation index in the DG was weakly correlated with the behavioral performance, whereas no linear correlation was found between the CA1 reactivation index and behavior. This observation is consistent with the postulation that the DG is more engaged in pattern separation compared to CA1, given that our behavioral protocol was designed for testing animals' ability in discriminating different environmental inputs.</p><p><italic>3. One surprising observation that is unaddressed in the discussion: in experiment 1, high freezing in the preA mice paralleled the increase in CA1 reactivation index, while low freezing in the preC mice paralleled a decrease in the DG reactivation index. In experiment 2, the behavioral result is similar: high freezing in A, low freezing in B. However, the CA1 reactivation index is identical in both conditions. This raises the question: why is there low freezing (on average) in B while there is equivalent reactivation in CA1? Is the CA1 ensemble independent of the behavior? This should be discussed in detail</italic>.</p><p>We discuss the involvement of CA1 in behavioral performance in the revised manuscript as suggested by reviewers. We find that the CA1 reactivation index is not linearly correlated with freezing behavior of mice under our experimental conditions (Figure 9). Particularly, in the contextual fear conditioning experiment 2, involving only small contextual changes, the reactivation index in CA1 did not change accordingly, though the mice were able to detect the alteration in environmental inputs as indicated by their behaviors. This observation is consistent with previous findings that small changes in the environmental inputs may not be sufficient to cause remapping in the CA1 (Leutgeb et al., 2004). Similarly, it is found that lesions in CA1 do not affect the spatial discrimination ability of animals (Gilbert et al., 2001). Finally, other than providing an indication for memory recall, the behavioral readout is the result of neurological processes that are carried out by the entire brain, including regions other than the hippocampus. For example, amygdala is also involved in contextual fear conditioning and contributes to the freezing behavior during the re-exposure. Hence, the activity in the hippocampus may not necessarily be linearly correlated with behavior under all circumstances.</p><p><italic>4. The main conclusions of the paper rely on comparisons between 2 populations of activated neurons, using measures that are very different from each other. lacZ expression is used to measure long-term activation of neurons (i.e., in response to the first experience, days ago) whereas c-fos or zif268 is used to measure recent activity (for the 2nd experience). In CA1 lacZ is expressed in ∼6% of neurons whereas c-fos is expressed in ∼50% of neurons, nearly a 10x difference. In the DG zif268 is expressed at about twice the lacZ levels (12% vs 6%). The dramatic differences in activity-dependent expression of these two markers make it difficult to understand how they can be compared. In other words, it seems that they don't represent activity equally at all. Granted, this problem is somewhat tempered by the fact that activation and reactivation measurements are both calculated as % of cells expressing IEGs zif or fos (% of the total population vs % of the lacZ population). Clearly these two populations of cells are differentially activated in some cases and maybe it's the case that lacZ expression does not identify a qualitatively different type of activity, but just identifies fewer activated cells (e.g., because it has a higher threshold?). It would be more convincing if this was demonstrated. Right now there are factors that make one wonder if they might just be detecting different types of activity</italic>.</p><p>As discussed earlier, the induced expression efficiency of the LacZ tag is significantly lower than that the endogenous IEG expression. We believe this is a general problem associated with the transgenic mice, since it is observed in different brain regions, including basolateral amygdala in the original study by Reijimer et al (2007), and CA1 and DG described here. Our interpretations are based on the assumption that LacZ tagged neurons are representative of the activated neuron population. As discussed above, supporting this assumption are the new data resulting from measuring the intensity of FOS staining in FOS+LacZ+ and FOS+LacZ- neurons in mice whose LacZ tagged and FOS labeled neurons were both responding to the same EE exposure (Figure 1–figure supplement 3). Realizing that the tagging efficiency is particularly low in CA1 (thus would most likely cause biases in this region), we quantified the activities by calculating the proportion of IEG+ cells in either the LacZ+ population or the total population instead of comparing the absolute numbers of IEG+ and IEG+LacZ+ cells to overcome the problem of the low tagging efficiency. Our results suggest that the CA1 neurons involved in memory encoding are preferentially activated by recall of the same memory trace, which is consistent with previous reports suggesting the role of CA1 in both encoding and retrieval (Riedel et al., 1999; Goshen et al., 2011). Similar to LacZ tagging, IEG labeling efficiency can vary depending on the marker used for examination. In the fear conditioning experiment 1, EGR1 and FOS labels about 14% and 7% activated DGCs in response to re-exposure, respectively. In the DG, the LacZ labeling efficiency is about two fold lower than that of the EGR1 labeling and is almost as high as that of the FOS labeling. Nevertheless, the reactivation indexes resulting from the analyses by these two different IEGs are similar (Figure 4), suggesting that using the percentage measures can help to normalize the difference in expression efficiencies of activity markers. However, it is realized that the possibility of LacZ tagging a specialized group of activated neurons (for example, the most active neurons) cannot be formally ruled out and we discuss this caveat in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>5. Due to the slow onset of the tTA-tetO system, the authors remove Dox 3d before subjecting mice to experiences for activating neuronal ensembles. Thus, there is a significant amount of time (and therefore experience) during which DG neurons could be activated (and express lacZ) based on home cage experiences. It is shown that home cage lacZ expression is lower than context-induced activation but how do we know that, in the dual context experiments, lacZ expression is due to the brief context pre-exposure rather than home cage activity? This could be addressed by showing that there is very little IEG expression in lacZ cells when the mice are taken off Dox but not exposed to the first context. A related issue lies with presentation of the experimental design. In the figures (e.g., Figure 1b, Figure 3a, and Figure 5a) the “on Dox” arrows extend significantly into the portion of the experimental timeline where the animals are not on Doxycicline. This gives the impression that Dox is removed at the time of the 2nd experience when in fact it is removed much earlier, in the home cage situation</italic>.</p><p>Neither LacZ nor IEG expression is induced only by the pre-exposed context or the re-exposed context because home cage activity is an unavoidable part of whole experiences at both pre-exposure and re-exposure. We performed a new experiment to address this concern by taking mice off dox followed by exposing one group to context A (ctxA group) and keeping the other group in their home cage (HC group) before the re-exposure to context A. As predicted, we found that significantly fewer LacZ+EGR1 double positive neurons in LacZ-positive population (i.e., reactivation rate) in HC mice compared to ctxA mice. The new data are reported in Figure 5. In addition, the concern could also be addressed by a comparison between preA and preC mice. Both groups not only have the same home cage experience but also have equivalent numbers of LacZ positive neurons induced in CA1; however, only preA but not preC mice can recall the experience of being exposed to context A. If home cage activity had played a key role, the effect of differential context pre-exposure would have been masked. Given that our results showed a clear difference between preA and preC mice, a significant number of the LacZ and IEG positive neurons should respond to context pre-exposure and re-exposure, respectively. We have also revised figures (Figures 1, 3, and 6) according to the reviewers' suggestion to make the illustration clearer and we point out in the figure legends that the dox treatment is illustrated by the blue shading.</p><p><italic>6. It is not clear why the immediate shock contextual fear paradigm is used. Most previous studies that have examined the role of the DG in pattern separation have looked at activity in response to exploration of environments that are not associated with reward or shock. This doesn't necessarily have to be the case but for the current study the additional experiences associated with the learning process seem to confound interpretations. For example, to what extent does the 2nd experience activate neurons due to emotional content (recalling a memory of being shocked) vs. due to the fact that it's simply a different spatial environment? Also, why was the shock floor covered during pre-exposure and test but not during the shock? Why cover it at all? Thus, even animals that were exposed to the same context for both experiences (in order to see if the same population of DG neurons encodes re-experience of the same context) were also exposed to an additional similar context (one without the covered floor). So, what memory are the animals really recalling? Everything would be much cleaner if the mice were just exposed to one context and then a second context, with no intervening shocks or altered environments</italic>.</p><p>The sequential exposure of animals to two contexts (same or different) is a commonly used design for this type of experiment; however, whether retrieval of the memories of the first exposure occurs during the second exposure cannot be determined using such a protocol. We therefore chose a contextual fear-conditioning paradigm to obtain an indication for recall of the pre-exposure experience during the second exposure. The immediate shock contextual fear paradigm is used because there were no extra stimuli (i.e., those elicited shock) in the pre-exposure compared to the re-exposure. The floor is covered during the pre-exposure because the wired floor is a very strong cue and will induce high freezing behavior in a similar context (i.e., context B). This rationale is now included in the Material and methods. Given that it is difficult for animals to form the context-shock association if shock is delivered soon after animals are introduced to the context (a.k.a. immediate shock deficit (Fanselow, 1990)), freezing behavior during the re-exposure is mainly a reflection of the memory of the pre-exposed context, though the recall of shock context may also occur. It is shown by both previous studies (Rudy and O'Reilly, 2001) and our data (Figure 3b) that animals without pre-exposure or pre-exposed to an irrelevant context do not display freezing behaviors to the conditioned context. However, we agree with the reviewers that the emotional value of the context altered after the immediate-shock; therefore, we performed a new experiment to address this issue by exposing mice sequentially to two contexts (either same or different) without the immediate-shock step (ctxA/A vs ctxA/C mice in Figure 5). The data are presented in Figure 5. Results of this experiment are similar to that of the contextual fear conditioning experiment (Figure 3), suggesting that changes in the emotional value of the context do not significantly influence the reactivation pattern of neurons in CA1 and the DG.</p><p><italic>7. The cell quantification methods are poorly described. First, what is meant by “total number of DGCs (dentate granule cells)” and why was it, along with density, calculated? Some mention of calculations is made but not described so it may become clear if described better. Perhaps, since the proportion of DG neurons that are activated is quite low, the authors manually counted all IEG and lacZ expressing cells but did not want to manually count all the unactivated cells (NeuN and DAPI cells). So there was some calculation of local DG neuron density, which was then used to extrapolate to estimate the actual number of DG neurons that was sampled. Is this correct? In any case, there is some concern about these methods since this density-to-total-number-of-DG-neurons conversion can introduce biases. This is significant because the activation rate is based on this number (IEG/total number of DG neurons) whereas the reactivation rate is not (both numerator and denominator are based on manual cell counts with no density conversions) and many of the key comparisons are between activation and reactivation rates. CA1 analyses are also based on manual cell counts so comparisons there are also problematic</italic>.</p><p>Estimation was used in the quantification of the total number of DGCs in the images, which could affect the interpretation of the results. Prompted by the reviewers' suggestion, we developed another quantification method without estimation and re-analyzed the DG data in the contextual fear conditioning experiment 1 by quantifying the four types of cells – DAPI+ cells, EGR1+ cells, LacZ+ cells, and EGR1+LacZ+ cells – in a single plane in the z-stack of the DG images. The results yielded from this new quantification approach, presented in Figure 3d, f, and g, are similar to data resulting from the original method involving estimation (which are presented in Figure 3–figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript). In addition, we also revised the description of the estimation methods to make it clearer and discussed our rationale, in response to the detailed comments from the reviewers.</p><p>Our original concern was that the LacZ+IEG+ double positive neurons were scarce in the DG and we thus quantified the entire z-stack of confocal images to increase our sample size. Due to the high density of neurons in the DG, the counting of total numbers of DGCs in the z-stack became very difficult (see DAPI image in Figure 3–figure supplement 1) and we thus used a compromise method to estimate DGC numbers by measuring the volumes of the DG region in the images. This method allows us to make legitimate comparison of activity rates between experimental groups in the DG, but, as pointed out by the reviewers, the comparison of the reactivation rates to the corresponding activation rates may be affected. We recognized that an over-estimation of the number of DGCs would not affect the data interpretation; however, under-estimation might result in overvalued activation rates. The data showed that the reactivation rate was almost half of the corresponding activation rate in preC or testB mice (Figure 3–figure supplement 2 and Figure 6), leading to the conclusion that distinctive population of DGCs is selected to represent a particular event. This interpretation would have been affected only if we had underestimated the DGC population by at least two fold, which is unlikely in our opinion. An underestimation of DGC population to a lesser extent would have resulted in the activation rate lower than the corresponding reactivation rate in the DG of preA or testA mice, leading to the interpretation that memory recall preferential reactivation of those DGCs involved in encoding the same memory (similar to CA1). Even in this case, the extent of the preferential reactivation in the DG would be still smaller compared to that of CA1. However, in light of the new analyses, these hypothetical situations are unlikely to happen because similar data were obtained using an alternative quantification method without estimation.</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><p>Alme, CB, Buzzetti, RA, Marrone, DF, Leutgeb, JK, Chawla, MK, Schaner, MJ, Bohanick, JD, et al. 2010.
