dendrites in neuronal cells depends in part on RNA localization. Previous studies have looked at which polyadenylated RNAs are enriched in neuronal projections or at synapses, but less is known about the distribution of non-adenylated RNAs. By physically dissecting projections from cell bodies of primary rat hippocampal neurons and sequencing total RNA, we found an unexpected set of free circular introns with a non-canonical branchpoint enriched in neuronal projections. These introns appear to be tailless lariats that escape debranching. They lack ribosome occupancy, sequence conservation, and known localization signals, and their function, if any, is not known. Nonetheless, their enrichment in projections has important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms by which RNAs reach distal compartments of asymmetric cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>intron</kwd><kwd>RNA localization</kwd><kwd>neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM53007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Melissa J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eddy</surname><given-names>Sean R</given-names></name><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Melissa J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Student Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saini</surname><given-names>Harleen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A systematic study of RNA localization unexpectedly finds a set of free circular introns with a non-canonical C branchpoint enriched in neuronal projections.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In polarized cells, such as neurons and oocytes, RNA localization to distinct subcellular compartments is important for spatial control of protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holt and Bullock, 2009</xref>). Known mechanisms for asymmetric distribution of RNA include active transport (e.g., <italic>Actb;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ross et al., 1997</xref>), spatially restricted capture by an anchor (e.g., <italic>Nanos;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forrest and Gavis, 2003</xref>), and control of RNA degradation (e.g., <italic>Hsp83;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bashirullah et al., 2001</xref>). In some cases, RNA localization depends on splicing. For example, a detained intron (i.e., an intron with regulated post-transcriptional splicing, as opposed to constitutive co-transcriptional splicing) restricts <italic>Srsf5</italic> mRNA export from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutz et al., 2015</xref>), and a retained intron (i.e., an alternative unspliced isoform) promotes dendritic localization of <italic>Calm3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharangdhar et al., 2017</xref>). The <italic>Robo3</italic> gene, which is important for commissural axon development in mice, expresses both a fully spliced mRNA and another retaining intron 26, and these isoforms encode different proteins that have opposing functions in axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Spatial and temporal control of protein expression from the intron-retaining <italic>Robo3</italic> isoform depends on its susceptibility to nonsense-mediated decay due to the presence of a premature termination codon in the retained intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colak et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Provocatively, some retained introns have been proposed to undergo splicing in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glanzer et al., 2005</xref>). For example, an intron in the calcium-activated potassium channel <italic>Kcnma1</italic> was reported to undergo splicing in dendrites of rat hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell et al., 2010</xref>), and this was suggested to be a mechanism for locally tailoring calcium-activated potassium currents. Because pre-mRNA splicing by the spliceosome is generally thought to be restricted to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steitz et al., 2008</xref>), this proposal has been controversial, and it has not yet been independently confirmed.</p><p>The interplay between intron retention and neuronal RNA localization has been studied in several individual cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buckley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khaladkar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ortiz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharangdhar et al., 2017</xref>). In this work, our aim was to systematically identify localized RNAs in primary rat hippocampal neurons by sequencing total RNA (rRNA depleted) as opposed to polyadenylated (polyA+) RNA, with a particular focus on the repertoire of projection-localized introns (both retained and excised). Our analyses identify hundreds of transcripts with retained introns. Unexpectedly, we also found a set of free circular introns localized to distal neuronal projections.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental design and validation</title><p>To physically separate cellular projections from cell bodies, we cultured dissociated primary rat hippocampal cells on membranes with 1 μm diameter pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Poon et al., 2006</xref>).

We refer to the projections as ‘neuro-glial’ projections because both neuronal (Map2-immunopositive) and non-neuronal (Gfap/Vimentin-immunopositive) projections extend through the pores and continue growing on the underside of the membrane, whereas cell bodies and nuclei are restricted to the top surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To distinguish retained introns from intronic polyadenylation (polyA) sites, we prepared polyA-site sequencing (PASseq) libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashar-Patel et al., 2017</xref>) from a subset of samples (three biological replicates each, six samples total).

Ribosomal RNAs and small (&lt;150 nt) noncoding RNAs (e.g., snRNAs, tRNAs) were depleted effectively. Larger abundant nonpolyadenylated noncoding RNAs were observed as expected, such as SRP (or 7SL, the RNA component of the signal recognition particle) and RMRP (the RNA component of mitochondrial RNase P); both were more prevalent in projection than in whole cell libraries. Reads mapping to the mitochondrial genome were also highly abundant and enriched in projection libraries, consistent with the abundance of mitochondria in neurons and neuronal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Palay, 1956</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To minimize spurious genome alignments due to expected abundant species, we filtered out reads mapping entirely to rRNA, SRP, mitochondrial genome, and repeat elements cataloged by RepeatMasker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jurka, 2000</xref>) before moving on to other analyses described below.</p><p>To qualitatively assess our success in separating projections from whole cells, we aligned filtered reads to the rat genome with TopHat2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) and visualized read density tracks of known nuclear and projection localized RNAs on a rat genome browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>).

RNA abundances (in TPM, Transcripts Per Million) of biological replicates were well correlated (Spearman’s correlation coefficient ≥ 0.83 in projection samples, ≥ 0.88 in whole cell) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), but comparisons between projection and whole cell datasets showed substantial differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). As expected, known nuclear noncoding RNAs, including <italic>Xist</italic>, <italic>Malat1</italic>, <italic>Meg3</italic>, snoRNAs, and scaRNAs, were among the 1486 genes significantly depleted (&gt;1.5 fold and q-value &lt;0.01) from projections.

Indeed, seventy annotated RP mRNA isoforms were enriched more than two-fold in projections (black dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Intron regions that show coverage in projections define a subpopulation that has similar read coverage in projections and whole cells. This population is interesting because of the restrictive way that we define ‘intron regions’: no annotated transcript isoform of a given gene shows these regions as exonic, but their abundance in projections suggests that they are either unspliced, excised but stable, or independent transcripts.

These have features indicative of a previously described class of RNAs called ‘stable intronic sequence RNAs’ (sisRNAs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gardner et al., 2012</xref>). SisRNAs are circular lariat products of splicing (i.e., free introns) that are inefficiently debranched in the nucleus and exported to the cytoplasm via an NXF1/NXT1-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Talhouarne and Gall, 2018</xref>). The most prominent examples in our projection libraries, such as <italic>Creld1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), <italic>Zc3h18</italic>, and <italic>Mov10</italic>, were devoid of exon-intron and intron-exon reads, with higher read density on the intron than on the flanking exons. Further, these species were not detected in polyA+ RNAseq and ribosome profiling data. We also observed a lack of read coverage over a 20–30 nt region at the 3’ end of the intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Spliceosome-mediated intron excision from pre-mRNA releases a lariat molecule in which the branchpoint nucleotide, predominantly an adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taggart et al., 2017</xref>), is linked 2’−5’ to the 5’ end of the intron. Reverse transcriptase can occasionally traverse a 2’−5’ linkage, so lariat branchpoints result in circularly permuted reads in RNAseq data. To test whether projection-enriched free intron species had characteristics of an intron lariat, we searched for circularly permuted reads within them using find_circ.py (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Memczak et al., 2013</xref>). For fourteen projection-enriched intron regions, we detected numerous circularly permuted reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), enabling us to identify the branchpoints. In all 14 cases, the branchpoint was a cytosine, C (<italic>n</italic> = 12), or guanine, G (<italic>n</italic> = 2), instead of the canonical adenosine, A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). The spliceosome can use C or G as a branchpoint nucleotide, but the lariat debranching enzyme is inefficient at hydrolyzing the 2’−5’ linkage at these residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacquier and Rosbash, 1986</xref>). Thus lariats with C or G branchpoints might be expected to be more stable than other introns. The lack of read coverage at the 3’ end of these introns could arise from failure to clone the short lariat tails (&lt; 50 nt) in the RNAseq libraries, so we do not know whether these stable introns exist as lariats (with the 3’ tail) or 2’−5’ circles (without the 3’ tail).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Free circular introns with a noncanonical branchpoint.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Projection RNAseq read density for linearly mapped (orange) and circularly permuted (gray) reads across Creld1 - intron5.

Mismatches in read alignments at the branchpoint and the relative scarcity of circularly permuted reads versus linear reads were consistent with the existence of a 2’−5’ linkage that the reverse transcriptase traverses with lower efficiency and accuracy. Other than conservation of 5’ and 3’ splice site sequences, none of the 14 free introns showed notable phylogenetic sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Because our main intent was to identify and characterize intron sequences in projections, we created rRNA-depleted total RNAseq libraries from rat hippocampal cells grown on membranes that provided physical separation between projections and cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As expected, 97% of the annotated intron regions that we could detect across all samples met our expression cutoffs in whole cells only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Of the 3% of intron regions that are also detectable in projections, the majority turned out to be attributable to incomplete annotation of alternative mRNA isoforms or to intron-encoded snoRNAs/scaRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Integration of layers of information – polyA+ RNAseq, ribosome profiling, and PASseq libraries – from parallel hippocampal cultures proved essential for us to characterize these regions.</p><p>Full-length introns present at high abundance in projections fell into two classes, one expected (retained introns) and one unexpected (free introns). As a class, retained introns displayed no strong tendency toward preferential projection localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, while some transcripts may contain localization elements in an alternatively retained intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharangdhar et al., 2017</xref>), this does not appear to be a general function of intron retention in neurons. Some retained introns clearly express alternative protein isoforms, as we observed for <italic>Sept3</italic> intron 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Notably, <italic>Kcnma1</italic> intron 23, previously proposed to undergo local splicing in primary rat hippocampal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell et al., 2010</xref>), had almost no coverage in our projection libraries in the same cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Further, the retained introns that we identified in neuro-glial projections exhibit almost no overlap with the set of ‘cytoplasmic intron sequence-retaining transcripts’ (CIRTs) previously reported to localize to rat primary hippocampal dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buckley et al., 2011</xref>). CIRTs and <italic>Kcnma1</italic> intron 23 were initially identified by sequencing RNA from 15 to 300 individually dissected dendrites. While the method was state-of-the-art at the time, the low amount of input RNA necessitates multiple rounds of RNA and cDNA amplification prior to sequencing. In contrast, we started with high RNA input, restricted cDNA amplification to ≤ 15 cycles, and sequenced deeply to capture even low abundance RNA species.</p><p>Our most surprising finding was the detection of free introns in projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which we infer to be lariat species containing a cytosine or guanine branchpoint instead of the canonical adenosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The most likely explanation for the persistence of such species is the inability of debranching enzyme to cleave the 2’−5’ bond at a C or G branch. That stable circular introns (or stable intron sequences, sisRNAs) can escape the nucleus and accumulate in the cytoplasm has already been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Talhouarne and Gall (2018)</xref>. In that study, the authors observed sisRNAs across diverse samples, including cell lines from multiple vertebrate species and mouse fibroblasts, red blood cells, liver, and brain. Despite this pervasiveness, these introns’ general lack of sequence conservation and absence of interspecies overlap with sisRNAs strongly disfavors any evolutionarily conserved function. Rather, it seems more likely that sisRNAs are gene expression byproducts, perhaps with little positive or negative influence on cellular function; they may simply be noise in the system. We hypothesize that substituting any intron branchpoint from a canonical A to C/G has little effect on splicing while making the excised intron resistant to lariat debranching, leading to a stable 2’−5’ circular RNA without much phenotypic consequence, and that such substitutions are tolerated at low frequency in any organism with spliceosomal introns in its genes.</p><p>Our study extends previous work on sisRNAs by the Gall lab by finding that sisRNAs are enriched in neuro-glial projections. If these free circular introns lack evolutionary signatures of function, why would they appear to be enriched in projections? We observe that because RNAseq experiments measure relative rather than absolute abundances, relative enrichment does not necessarily imply active localization. We hypothesize that mRNAs are typically occupied by polyribosomes in the cell body, whereas an untethered stable noncoding RNA may more freely diffuse throughout the entire volume of the cell, including distant projections. Unlike most mRNAs, free circular introns showed no evidence of ribosome occupancy. It has previously been observed for <italic>Actb</italic> mRNA in neurons that a lack of ribosomal engagement leads to faster mRNA diffusion kinetics than is observed for actively translating mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Katz et al., 2016</xref>). The intracellular environment of neurons and neuronal projections is full of highly motile proteins and organelles that are themselves actively transported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stępkowski et al., 2017</xref>), as indeed we see reflected by the prevalence of mitochondrial RNA in our projection libraries (&gt; half of all reads in our projection libraries were of mitochondrial origin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We imagine that the movement of large objects within the confines of narrow cellular projections mixes the surrounding cytoplasm and could well force unanchored molecules to move in both anterograde and retrograde directions. Thus, free stable circular introns may appear to be <italic>relatively</italic> enriched in projections simply because they are long-lived and more freely diffusing than other RNAs that are depleted in projections because they are less stable or tethered in the cell body (to polyribosomes, for example).</p><p>This hypothesis has implications for another long-standing puzzle in neuronal RNA localization. All transcriptome-wide studies of the mRNA content of dendrites, axons, or synapses, including ours, have observed an enrichment of the complete set of ribosomal protein (RP) mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moccia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Poon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zivraj et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cajigas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Puthanveettil et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ainsley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briese et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taliaferro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakayama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shigeoka et al., 2018</xref>, to cite a few). Ribosomes are assembled in the nucleus, so localization of RP mRNAs to distant projections is puzzling. Recently, ribosome protein synthesis and incorporation of some individual ribosomal proteins into assembled ribosomes in axons of Xenopus retinal cells has been shown to occur and to be important for axon development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shigeoka et al., 2018</xref>), however, only a subset of RP mRNAs in axons are translated. It has been previously shown that in quiescent or growth-arrested cells (such as neurons), 30–40% of RP mRNA molecules sediment in polysome profiles as free mRNPs, compared to only ~10% for non-RP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meyuhas et al., 1987</xref>). Thus, it appears that in neurons, a substantial fraction of RP mRNAs are not engaged with ribosomes, and like our free circular introns, unengaged RP mRNAs may be more free to diffuse about the cell. We propose that the relative enrichment of RP mRNAs in projections could simply be due to their low ribosome engagement, not to an active transport mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Primary hippocampal neuron culture</title><p>Animals were handled in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Massachusetts Medical School and Harvard University. All experiments were performed on primary hippocampal neurons of embryonic day 19 rat fetuses. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats purchased from Charles River Laboratories at 19 days of gestation were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation immediately followed by diaphragm puncture to ensure death of the animal prior to surgical removal of fetuses. Fetuses were transferred to pre-cooled dishes and placed on ice. Fetal brains were gently extracted under sterile conditions and submerged in ice-cold sterile HBSS (Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution, Gibco 14185052) for transport to the tissue-culture laboratory. The brains were transferred to ice-cold Hibernate E (BrainBits) for microdissection of the hippocampi in a sterile tissue culture hood. Isolated hippocampi were transferred to freshly prepared, pre-warmed pre-dissociation solution (comprising Hibernate E, EBSS, Papain and DNase from Worthington LK003176) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Pre-dissociation solution was replaced by 2 ml MEM complete media (containing 50 ml 10x MEM (Invitrogen 11430–030), 15 ml 20% glucose, 15 ml 7.5% sodium bicarbonate, 2 ml 1N HCl, 400 ml water, 5 ml 200 mM glutamax (Gibco 35050061), 50 ml heat inactivated horse serum, 5 ml penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco 15140122)) and the hippocampi were dissociated by gentle trituration, first with a regular and then a fire-polished (with reduced tip diameter) glass pipette.

DNase activity was tested beforehand to ensure DNA digestion. Total RNA was depleted of rRNA using the Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit (Illumina #MRZH11124), following manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was hydrolyzed using 5X first strand buffer (provided with Superscript III reverse transcriptase, ThermoFisher #18080044) at 94°C for 4 min and 50 s and immediately moved to ice. The fragmented RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamers (ThermoFisher #N8080127) and Superscript III to make single-stranded cDNA. To make strand specific libraries, the second strand complementary to the cDNA was transcribed with DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs #M0209S) using dUTP instead of dTTP. Illumina sequencing adapters were ligated to the double stranded cDNA. The dUTP-containing strand was degraded using Uracil-DNA Glycosylase (New England Biolabs #M0280S).

Intron regions were defined as the non-exon regions of each gene.

EI and IE regions span 50 nt, 25 nt from the exon and 25 nt from the intron. The EE region coordinates include the intron region and 50 nt of each flanking exon. To count reads crossing the EE junction, only those read alignments that started and ended at the EE coordinates were considered. Since EE regions are longer than 100 nt because they include the intron, the only way a 100 nt long read would start and end at the EE coordinates is if the alignment splits. In case of ribosome profiling and polyA+ RNAseq data, where the minimum read length is 24 nt, the EE regions included the intron region and 12 nt of each flanking exon.

introns with an unusual branchpoint in neuronal projections&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Peter Sudmant.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Saini and colleagues investigate RNA localization using RNA-Seq analysis of fractionated (cell body and projections) rat hippocampal neurons, with a focus on retained and excised introns. The most interesting finding is a population of stable, tailless lariat-introns in projections that involve non-canonical branch sites. Such RNA species have been reported previously, but not in neuronal projections. Their function, if any, remains unclear. The authors' analyses further indicate that these RNAs lack conservation and ribosome engagement. They propose that these circular introns are splicing by-products and that their accumulation in projections may be a consequence of inefficient debranching and subsequent diffusion. They also observe, as have others, that ribosomal protein mRNAs localize to projections, and propose that this phenomenon, like that of stable intronic circles, may be due to lack of ribosome engagement. While this study does not provide biological insight into stable intronic circles, it suggests how lack of engagement can passively lead to localization in neuronal projections. The study further provides useful RNA-Seq datasets and a resource of differentially localized transcripts that will facilitate future research efforts. As such, it is potentially suitable for publication in the Tools and Resources section of <italic>eLife</italic>. It is requested that the authors address the following comments in a revised manuscript:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This study is quite descriptive in nature and obviously would be considerably strengthened if the authors could provide functional insight into the stable circular RNAs they detect. While the reviewers appreciate the challenges associated with addressing function – also considering lack of apparent conservation of the lariat circles – it is requested that the authors minimally validate some of their novel findings in Figures 3-6, in particular the localization of intronic circles using smFISH. Moreover, lariat PCR should be performed to confirm the branch points of these RNAs.</p><p>2) The reviewers felt that the authors could do much more with their data. For example it is recommended that they correlate differential splicing of exons with differences in RNA localization. Related to this, are the ribosomal protein mRNAs localized to projections representative of distinct splice variants of these transcripts? Previous work has revealed that differential splicing in 5´UTRs can affect ribosome engagement (e.g. PMID 27820807) and may be relevant in this context.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47809.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This study is quite descriptive in nature and obviously would be considerably strengthened if the authors could provide functional insight into the stable circular RNAs they detect.

These data are in Figure 4—figure supplement 4. Because we failed to refer to this figure in the main text, however, the reviewers likely were unaware of these data. In the revision, we include a paragraph describing our smFISH observations (subsection “Circular introns with noncanonical branchpoints in projections”, first paragraph).</p><p>b) Lariat PCR: Considering that our RNAseq library preparation method uses the same reverse transcription and amplification steps that would be used for lariat PCR, we believe that it would be a redundant control. Instead, in the revision we have added Figure 6—source data 1 that provides details about the chromosomal coordinates of the circular species and their sequence, the location of the circular junction relative to the 3′ splice site, and the number of circularly permuted reads aligning to all free introns labeled in red in Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers felt that the authors could do much more with their data.

For this report, however, we deliberately chose to write a more focused paper, with our focus on analysis of intronic sequences in projections, as this has been a topic of debate in the field for many years. By thoroughly validating these libraries and submitting them to the public repository at NCBI GEO (GSE129924), we hope they will serve as an important resource for the broader community. We also have plans for future analyses ourselves.</p><p>Regarding the question about RP mRNA splice variants, we do not observe any differentially expressed alternative isoforms in projections. The differential expression analysis in Figure 2 included all annotated isoforms of RP mRNAs (black dots) and all isoforms expressed by these cells were significantly enriched in projections.</p></body></sub-article></article>
