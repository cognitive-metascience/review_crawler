many important functions and comprise a ‘mother’ and ‘daughter’ centriole surrounded by pericentriolar material (PCM). The mother centriole recruits and organises the PCM and templates the formation of the daughter centriole. It has been reported that several important <italic>Drosophila</italic> PCM-organising proteins are recruited to centrioles from the cytosol as part of large cytoplasmic ‘S-CAP’ complexes that contain the centriole protein Sas-4. In a previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>) we showed that one of these proteins, Cnn, and another key PCM-organising protein, Spd-2, are recruited around the mother centriole before spreading outwards to form a scaffold that supports mitotic PCM assembly; the recruitment of Cnn and Spd-2 is dependent on another S-CAP protein, Asl. We show here, however, that Cnn, Spd-2 and Asl are not recruited to the mother centriole as part of a complex with Sas-4. Thus, PCM recruitment in fly embryos does not appear to require cytosolic S-CAP complexes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08483.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08483.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>Sas-4</kwd><kwd>S-CAP complexes</kwd><kwd>pericentriolar material</kwd><kwd>PCM</kwd><kwd>centriole</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>105653/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conduit</surname><given-names>Paul T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104575/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wainman</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name><name><surname>Novak</surname><given-names>Zsofia A</given-names></name><name><surname>Raff</surname><given-names>Jordan W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000735</institution-id><institution>University of Cambridge</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG78799</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conduit</surname><given-names>Paul T</given-names></name><name><surname>Weil</surname><given-names>Timothy T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Conduit et al., 2014), and contrary to what was previously thought, it is shown that key centrosomal proteins are not recruited to centrosomes as part of large multi-protein assemblies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>The centrosomal recruitment of Sas-4, Cnn and Spd-2 differs in space and time</title><p>Centrosomes are crucial cell organisers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arquint et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chavali et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Reina and Gonzalez, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Stinchcombe and Griffiths, 2014</xref>). We previously showed that Cnn and Spd-2 are initially recruited around mother centrioles and then spread outward to form an extended pericentriolar material (PCM) scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Conduit et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2014b</xref>) (Note that we define ‘recruitment’ here as when a new protein molecule is added into the centrosome from the cytosol, irrespective of whether this molecule replaces an existing molecule or adds to the existing pool of molecules). Cnn has previously been identified as part of a multi-protein ‘S-CAP’ complex, which pre-assembles in the cytosol with the centriole protein Sas-4 before being recruited into the centrosome via a Sas-4–centriole interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>). We reasoned, therefore, that Cnn and Spd-2 molecules might initially be recruited to the centrioles in S-CAP complexes, but could then be released from the centriolar-Sas-4 to spread outwards through the PCM. To test this possibility we compared the spatiotemporal centrosomal recruitment of Sas-4 to Cnn or Spd-2 in living <italic>Drosophila</italic> syncytial embryos, where S-CAP complexes were initially identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2011</xref>). These embryos cycle rapidly between S- and M-phases with no gap phases, and the mother centrioles organise large amounts of PCM throughout both S- and M-phases; during S-phase, each mother centriole also assembles a new daughter centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08483.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The centrosomal recruitment of Sas-4, Cnn and Spd-2 differ in space and time.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic illustration of the centrosomal events that occur during S-phase in <italic>Drosophila</italic> syncytial embryos.

Prior to photobleaching, Sas-4-mCherry appeared as a single tight spot, presumably localising to the two centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fu and Glover, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mennella et al., 2012</xref>), which cannot be resolved with a standard confocal microscope; GFP-Cnn and Spd-2-GFP occupied a relatively broad area around the centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>; t = −30 s), consistent with their known PCM localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>). The centrosomal fluorescence of all three proteins recovered after photobleaching, but we noticed that the recovering GFP and mCherry signals were not aligned in the X-Y plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>; t = 60–180 s). We plotted the relative positions of the recovering signals after using fluorescent beads to adjust for any systemic shift between the green and red channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’), and calculated the average distance between the recovering signals: at 60 s post bleaching, recovering Sas-4-mCherry was offset from recovering GFP-Cnn by an average of ∼0.21 μm (<italic>blue</italic> dots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) and from recovering Spd-2-GFP by an average of ∼0.17 μm (<italic>orange</italic> dots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

We wondered, therefore, if the offset between the Sas-4-mCherry and GFP-Cnn or Spd-2-GFP recovering signals was a result of Sas-4-mCherry being largely recruited to daughter centrioles and GFP-Cnn and Spd-2-GFP being largely recruited around mother centrioles.</p><p>As an initial test of this hypothesis, we performed two-colour FRAP experiments in M-phase, when centriole duplication has been completed. After photobleaching, the centrosomal GFP-Cnn and Spd-2-GFP signals recovered immediately, while the Sas-4-mCherry signal only began to recover robustly after the centrosomes separated at the end of mitosis—when a new round of centriole duplication begins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3 media4">Videos 3, 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that Sas-4 molecules are only recruited to growing daughter centrioles, and they strongly suggest that the Cnn and Spd-2 molecules that are recruited around mother centrioles during M-phase are not recruited there as part of a complex with Sas-4.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08483.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cnn and Spd-2, but not Sas-4, are recruited to centrosomes during M-phase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic illustration of the centrosomal events that occur during M-phase (<italic>purple</italic> arrow) and the following S-phase (<italic>orange</italic> arrow) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> syncytial embryos.

Using 3D-SIM in living embryos, we could clearly distinguish two adjacent Sas-4-GFP foci at individual centrosomes during S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, t = −20 s), presumably representing mother-daughter centriole pairs. We combined 3D-SIM with FRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>) and found that the Sas-4-GFP signal only recovered at a single foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, t = 120 s to t = 280 s). We confirmed that this recovery occurred at the daughter centriole by performing a two-colour-3D-SIM-FRAP experiment in embryos co-expressing Sas-4-GFP and Asl-mCherry, as Asl forms a toroid around only the mother centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, t = −30 s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Novak et al., 2014</xref>). Strikingly, the recovering Sas-4-GFP fluorescence always lay outside of the Asl-mCherry toroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, t = 300 s), whereas control unbleached centrosomes still contained two Sas-4-GFP foci, one of which lay inside the Asl-mCherry toroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, t = 300 s). This suggested that new Sas-4 molecules are recruited only to the daughter centrioles. However, during acquisition centrosomes move in the x-y plane, and given that the green and red channels are acquired sequentially on this particular imaging system it is possible for the green and red signals to become misaligned. To be sure the recovering Sas-4-GFP signal represented the daughter centriole, rather than a mis-positioned mother centriole, we therefore measured the distance between the centre of the Asl-mCherry signal and the centres of the pre- and post-bleached Sas-4-GFP signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). This revealed that the average position of the post-bleached Sas-4-GFP signal closely matched the position of the daughter Sas-4-GFP signal, but not the mother Sas-4-GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), confirming that Sas-4 molecules are recruited only to daughter centrioles. As Asl molecules are known to turn over at the mother centriole at this stage in the cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Novak et al., 2014</xref>), their recruitment cannot occur as part of Sas-4 dependent S-CAP complexes.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08483.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Two-colour-3D-SIM FRAP reveals that Sas-4-mCherry is recruited only to growing daughter centrioles, while PCM proteins are recruited only around mother centrioles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 3D-SIM images show how during S-phase two adjacent Sas-4-GFP foci can be resolved at an individual centrosome (t = −20 s), and how the Sas-4-GFP fluorescence signal recovers only as a single foci after photobleaching (t = 120 s to t = 280 s).

We expressed a Sas-4-GFP construct at near endogenous levels in embryos lacking endogenous Sas-4—this construct is functional as it rescues the Sas-4 mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Novak et al., 2014</xref>). From these embryos we produced extracts where the centrosomes had been removed by centrifugation, immunoprecipitated Sas-4-GFP using anti-GFP coated beads and then examined the relative proportion of bound and unbound S-CAP complex proteins. This approach had two advantages over immunoprecipitating endogenous Sas-4 with anti-Sas-4 antibodies: (1) anti-GFP antibodies are less likely to perturb S-CAP complex assemblies; (2) we could perform negative controls using wild-type extracts that did not contain any Sas-4-GFP protein.</p><p>As expected, we saw a strong depletion of Sas-4-GFP from the Sas-4-GFP extract (compare lanes 2 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and a strong enrichment of Sas-4-GFP in the Sas-4-GFP bound sample (lane 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, the negative control showed no depletion of endogenous Sas-4 from the wild-type extract (compare lanes 1 and 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), or enrichment of endogenous Sas-4 in the wild-type bound sample (lane 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Cnn, γ-tubulin, pericentrin-like-protein (PLP) and Asl (the other characterised components of the S-CAP complexes), were not obviously co-depleted with Sas-4-GFP from the extract (compare lanes 2 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>), although we reliably detected small amounts of Cnn and γ-tubulin in the Sas-4-GFP bound samples (compare lanes 5 and 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). A small amount of Asl was also detectable in the Sas-4-GFP bound sample, but this was also seen in the control bound sample (compare lanes 5 and 6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We conclude that only a very small fraction of Cnn and γ-tubulin molecules form cytosolic complexes with Sas-4 in these embryo extracts, while any interaction between Sas-4 and Asl or PLP is undetectable with these methods. Thus, the previously described S-CAP complexes are either absent or present at very low levels in these embryo extracts.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08483.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Potential S-CAP complexes are of low abundance in Drosophila syncytial embryo extracts.</title><p>Panels show western blots of anti-GFP immunoprecipitation experiments from WT embryos (lanes 1, 3, 5) or embryos expressing Sas-4-GFP in the absence of endogenous Sas-4 (lanes 2, 3, 6).

In support of this conclusion, previous reports have shown that centrioles in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells lacking cytosolic Sas-4 can recruit PCM during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Stevens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Riparbelli and Callaini, 2011</xref>), and this also appears to be true in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kirkham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Leidel and Gönczy, 2003</xref>) and in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>).

Thus, the mechanism of mitotic PCM assembly in flies, worms and human cells does not appear to involve the pre-assembly of Sas-4-dependent cytosolic PCM complexes. Importantly, Sas-4 may have a more indirect role in mitotic PCM assembly in fly embryos as centriolar Sas-4 (as opposed to cytoplasmic Sas-4) is required to efficiently recruit Asl molecules around maturing mother centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dzhindzhev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Novak et al., 2014</xref>), and Asl has an important role in recruiting Spd-2 and Cnn around mother centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Conduit et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2014a</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> lines</title><p>Sas-4-mCherry and Asl-mCherry P-element-mediated transformation vectors were made by introducing a full length Sas-4 or Asl cDNA into a mCherry C-terminal Gateway vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basto et al., 2008</xref>) downstream of a 2 kb predicted promoter region.

Images shown are maximum intensity projections of 5 z-slices taken 0.5 μm apart. Photobleaching of individual centrosomes was carried out using a combination of a focussed 440 nm laser and a focussed 568 nm laser. ImageJ was used to calculate the distance between the centre points of the recovering green and red signals at 60 s post photobleaching. The images were first scaled up fivefold so that each pixel was divided into 5 × 5 pixels—this allowed a more accurate analysis. The X; Y location of the centre of mass of each signal was calculated by thresholding the image and running the ‘analyze particles’ (centre of mass) macro on the most central Z plane of the centrosome. To adjust for any residual shift in the green and red channels, we calculated the average distance and direction between the ‘green’ and ‘red’ signals coming from subresolution TetraSpeck beads (Life Technologies, United Kingdom) (total of 977 beads analysed from 12 images) and used this to correct the centrosome data for any microscope-induced channel misalignment; the green and red signals from the beads were offset by a distance of 0.058 μm ± 0.005 μm. Once corrected, we calculated the distance between the centres of the green and red signals from each centrosome, and then calculated an average distance from all the centrosomes.</p><p>ImageJ was used to calculate the 60 s fluorescence recovery profiles of GFP-Cnn, Spd-2-GFP and Sas-4-mCherry from the scaled (5 × 5) images described above. Using the previously calculated centre of mass of each signal, concentric rings (spaced at 0.028 μm and spanning across 3.02 μm) were centred and the average fluorescence around each ring was measured (radial profiling). After subtracting the average cytosolic signal and normalising so the peak intensity of the image was equal to 1, we mirrored the profiles to show a full symmetric centrosomal profile. For each profile, an average distribution from at least 10 centrosomes was calculated. The green and red profiles were plotted on the same graph after manually taking into account the previously calculated average distance between the centre of each signal.</p><p>To produce the images that represent the average fluorescent signals at 60 s post bleaching (inset into each graph described above), average projections of green and red images were initially generated separately (after being aligned using the centre of mass coordinates) and then overlaid manually after taking into account the previously calculated average distance between the centre of each signal.</p><p>To examine the rate of fluorescence recovery of GFP-Cnn, Spd-2-GFP and Sas-4-mCherry, we measured the green and red fluorescence signals at each timepoint in the pixels where the fluorescent signals overlapped. An ROI was drawn that included all Sas-4-mCherry pixels that had a value above 2 standard deviations from the mean image value, and the total value of the Sas-4-mCherry signal and of the GFP-Cnn or Spd-2-GFP signal within these pixels was calculated. Typically, the ROI was 10 × 10 pixels (1.05 μm × 1.05 μm). The local cytoplasmic background fluorescence was then subtracted from this value. An average value from at least 10 centrosomes was calculated and normalised by dividing it by the average initial pre-bleach value. These normalised average values were then used for each data point in the graph.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>3D-structured illumination (sub-diffraction resolution) microscopy</title><p>Living embryos were imaged at 21°C on a DeltaVision OMX V3 Blaze microscope (GE Healthcare, United Kingdom) equipped with a 60×/1.42 oil UPlanSApo objective (Olympus), 488 nm and 593 nm diode lasers and Edge 5.5 sCMOS cameras (PCO).

The embryos were dechorionated using 60% bleach, washed thoroughly with 0.05% Tween-20 in distilled water, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Centrosome free extracts were prepared by homogenising the frozen embryos in 2 ml per gram IP buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1× Protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) and centrifuging twice at 15,000 RCF. The extract was maintained at 4°C during preparation. Protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were covalently coupled to rabbit anti-GFP antibodies (this study) using the BS<sup>3</sup> crosslinker (ThermoScientific). The amount of antibody-bead conjugate required to pull out most Sas-4-GFP from the extract was calculated empirically, and equal amounts were used for both Sas-4-GFP and wild-type extracts. Before adding the beads to the lysates, a 10 μl ‘input’ sample was collected from the extracts and mixed with 10 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The beads were added and the reaction was incubated overnight at 4°C by rotation. At the end of the incubation, a magnet was used to separate the beads from the extract and a 10 μl ‘unbound’ sample was collected and mixed with 10 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The ‘input’ and ‘unbound’ samples were of the same volume to ensure that the protein levels in each sample could be directly compared. The beads were washed by re-suspension in PBT three times at room temperature, then washed a further five times with PBT for 10 min by rotation at 4°C. The beads were then boiled for 10 min in 50 μl Laemmli sample buffer to produce a ‘bound’ sample. 10 μl of each sample was run on a 3–8% Tris-Acetate NuPAGE gel (Life Technologies), western blotted and probed for Sas-4, Cnn, Asl, D-PLP, and γ-tubulin using appropriate antibodies: Primary antibodies: N-terminal rabbit anti-Sas-4 antibodies; N-terminal rabbit anti-Cnn antibodies; C-terminal rabbit anti-Asl antibodies; C-terminal rabbit anti-D-PLP antibodies; mouse anti γ-tubulin antibodies (Sigma); mouse anti-actin (Sigma).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior Editor) and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see, the reviewers felt that the experiments were carefully conducted and in general supported your conclusions, although they had some caveats. Reviewer 1 was more positive than Reviewer 2, but upon discussion they agree that it would be worth publishing an appropriately revised version of your paper in <italic>eLife</italic> as a means of alerting a general audience to the fact that cytoplasmic S-CAP complexes serving as preassembled centrosome building blocks are unlikely to exist in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. However, a negative result is always difficult to prove unequivocally, and some additional experiments have been suggested that would strengthen your conclusions. Please address the following major points in your revised version.</p><p>1) There are concerns raised about the imaging data by Reviewer 1 that need to be addressed.</p><p>2) Since you did not exactly repeat the protocols used by Gopalakrishnan et al., further discussion of how the methods differ is needed, and ideally you would run a side-by-side control. The use of sucrose gradients on extracts depleted or not of centrosomes would also be informative. Another possibility would be to use reversible crosslinking in an attempt to stabilize potential S-CAP complexes.</p><p>The reviewers have raised a number of other points that you should also consider in your revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>In this paper Conduit and colleagues use FRAP experiments in combination with 3D-SIM imaging to study the recruitment dynamics of Sas-4, Cnn, Spd-2 and Als. The authors begin by investigating the centrosomal recruitment of Sas-4, Cnn or Spd-2 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> syncytial embryos. Using two color FRAP experiments, in combination with 3D-SIM FRAP experiments, the authors find that Sas-4 is only recruited to growing daughter centrioles during S-phase and that Cnn and Spd-2 molecules are recruited to mother centrioles in the absence of Sas-4 during mitosis. Finally, the authors use biochemical means to immunopurify S-CAP complexes which have been proposed to contain molecules like Spd-2, Cnn, Asl and Sas-4 and have been proposed to be preassembled protein complexes recruited to centrioles using Sas-4 as a centriole targeting factor. Surprisingly, the authors using well controlled experiments show that preassembled S-CAP complexes are not prominent in these extracts and in combination with the FRAP experiments unlike to be recruited as functional unit to centrioles during the cell cycle.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting paper. It utilizes, FRAP in combination with 3D-SIM to study recruitment properties of various centrosome components, which is technically demanding and sets a new standard for the field (although already used previously by the authors). The work presented here by Conduit and colleagues also challenges the existence of S-CAP complexes, which were proposed, with arguably some surprise, in 2011 in a Nature Communication article by Gopalakrishnan and colleagues to be large cytoplasmic complexes containing several centrosome proteins recruited en masse to the centrosome during its assembly. This study is therefore timely and of broad interest to the field of centrosome biogenesis and function and to a broader extent, based on the methods used to the larger field of cell biology. The authors should address the following minor issues:</p><p>1) Some of the 3D-SIM images looks a little strange, in particular the Spd-2 signal. The authors should comment on the measures they have taken to ensure that no 3D-SIM reconstruction artifacts have trickled through. For example, have they run SIM-check on their data to rule out reconstruction artifacts? And ensure proper imaging conditions were used in all cases? Furthermore, the details relating to the 3D-SIM imaging are a little bit scant and would need to be bolstered prior to publication. For example, what was the S/N used, etc.? I do not doubt their results (nor would their conclusions be affected by minor reconstruction artifacts), but I would encourage the authors to add further details on their 3D-SIM imaging and image reconstruction protocols.</p><p>2) Concerning the isolation of S-CAP complexes. My understanding is that the protocol used here is different. How does this differ from the previous work from Gopalakrishnan and colleagues? Could it be that other large cytosolic complexes (e.g. S-CAP complexes) are removed during this process? Did the authors ever perform sucrose gradients on extracts depleted or not of centrosomes? It would seem important to clarify what the differences are between the two studies and perhaps include a side-by-side comparison. In the Methods section the authors mention: “however, we cannot rule out the possibility that S-CAP complexes are less stable and possibly fall apart under these conditions, perhaps explaining the difference between our findings and those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2011</xref>.” This disclaimer seems out of place...do S-CAP complexes exist or not?</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>Centrosomes are formed by the recruitment of microtubule-organizing pericentriolar material (PCM) to a pair of centrioles whose duplication once per cell cycle ensures the presence of two microtubule-organizing centers in mitosis. Centriole duplication occurs in a series of steps that have been well characterized at the molecular and latterly also structural level. Sas-4 (also known as CPAP/CENPJ in vertebrates) functions in this pathway at one of the later steps, the formation of the centriolar microtubule wall. Sas-4 has also been implicated in PCM assembly, largely on the basis of its presence in complexes (‘S-CAP complexes’) with key pericentriolar material proteins in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2012</xref>). Here, Conduit and co-workers re-examine the role of Sas-4 in PCM recruitment in the same experimental model. Based on distinct patterns of recruitment observed by high-resolution microscopy, the authors conclude that PCM proteins are not recruited to centrosomes as part of S-CAP complexes and that cytoplasmic Sas-4 is therefore not directly involved in PCM recruitment.</p><p>I find it difficult to assess the merit of this manuscript. On the one hand it is well executed and corrects a mistaken notion of Sas-4 as a direct participant in PCM assembly. On the other, this notion never found widespread acceptance in the field because it contradicted what we have known about Sas-4 function for many years from work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other experimental models. Further, as discussed below Sas-4 may still interact with PCM components in the context of the centriolar wall, something the manuscript does not address. It is therefore not clear to me that this work makes a significant enough contribution to our understanding of either Sas-4 function or PCM assembly to merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The key observation reported in the current manuscript is that Sas-4 is not coordinately recruited with the PCM components Cnn and Spd2. This indeed runs counter to the idea of cytoplasmic Sas-4-containing ‘S-CAP’ complexes functioning in PCM assembly. However, the best evidence against such a role for Sas-4 is the complete lack of a PCM phenotype in Sas-4-depletions, as reported already in the very first studies on this protein in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kirkham et al., 2003</xref>; Leidel et al., 2003) and in numerous other studies since, as also mentioned by the authors in the concluding paragraph.</p><p>2) The manner in which the spatial pattern of Sas-4/Cnn/Spd-2 recruitment was analyzed, by FRAP at standard resolution and centroid analysis similar to the way kinetochore protein localization was examined by Ted Salmon and colleagues (Wan et al., 2009) and by 3D-SIM FRAP, is indeed elegant and novel for centrosomes. However, the result comes as no surprise. We know at the very least from the original super-resolution studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mennella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fu and Glover, 2012</xref>) that PCM proteins including Cnn and Spd-2, but also Asl, localize exclusively around the mother centriole. We also know that Sas-4 on mother centrioles is stably incorporated and does not exchange with the cytoplasmic pool, while daughter centrioles incorporate Sas-4 during S phase (Leidel et al., 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Novak et al., 2014</xref>). Given those steady state distributions and incorporation patterns, how could the FRAP results be any different?</p><p>3) There is little to be gained from the immunoprecipitation data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, showing weak or no interactions between Sas-4 and Asl, Cnn and γ-tubulin. This is essentially a repeat of previous work by the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Conduit et al., 2010</xref>), although arguably conducted in a more careful manner. A negative result is always difficult to interpret, even if the authors were to present a positive control (i.e. a protein that does interact with Sas-4 under their conditions). Furthermore, ‘S-CAP’ complexes could represent only a small fraction of the total Cnn or γ-tubulin population, without invalidating the original model of Gopalakrishnan and co-workers.</p><p>4) Finally, it should be noted that the most recent work by Gopalakrishnan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>) proposes that the interactions between Sas-4, γ-tubulin and other PCM components occur in the context of the well-described role of Sas-4 as a centriole duplication protein and centriolar microtubule wall component. It is unclear how such interactions could be detected in cytoplasmic extracts, but there is thus a plausible explanation for at least some of the original findings without invoking a direct, coordinated recruitment of Sas-4 with PCM components.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>1) It should be clarified that the FRAP experiments in this manuscript do not distinguish between recruitment and cytoplasmic turnover.</p><p>2) Potentially explained by point 1 above, it is striking that the pattern of Cnn recovery reported here (constant across the cell cycle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) does not match the pattern of recruitment reported previously (continuous recruitment in S phase, stable levels in mitosis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Conduit et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>3) The authors should show that there is no residual shift between red and green channels by imaging the same protein (ideally Sas-4) in both channels.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Re-examining the role of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Sas-4 in centrosome assembly using two-colour-3D-SIM FRAP” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The use of sucrose gradients on extracts depleted or not of centrosomes would also be informative. Another possibility would be to use reversible crosslinking in an attempt to stabilize potential S-CAP complexes.</italic></p><p>You requested that we further discuss how our biochemical methods differed from those of Gopalakrishnan et al., and that we ideally should run a side-by-side control/comparison using the two methods; you also thought analyzing our extracts on sucrose gradients might be informative. Gopalakrishnan et al. only briefly describe their methods and so we cannot be certain of accurately comparing or reproducing their protocol. Moreover, including such a direct comparison might seem unusually aggressive, so we would prefer not to do this. As you will see, we believe our protocol would very likely detect S-CAP complexes should they be abundant in syncytial fly embryos.</p><p>Moreover, the crux of our argument is not whether S-CAP complexes exist or not, but whether S-CAP complexes load Asl, Spd-2 and Cnn into the PCM. Even if Sas-4 does form S-CAP complexes under certain conditions, our microscopy analysis reveals that Sas-4, Asl, Spd-2 and Cnn do not load into the PCM together, so the question over the existence of cytoplasmic S-CAP complexes is not central to the process of PCM assembly.</p><p>Regarding the sucrose gradients, we believe that running our extracts on sucrose gradients would not be very informative: Gopalakrishnan et al. detect S-CAP complexes, and they analyze the behavior of these isolated complexes on sucrose gradients; in contrast, we do not detect S-CAP complexes, so cannot analyze their behavior on sucrose gradients.</p><p><italic>The reviewers have raised a number of other points that you should also consider in your revisions.</italic></p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p><italic>1) Some of the 3D-SIM images looks a little strange, in particular the Spd-2 signal.

Thus, one could already infer that Sas-4 does not shuttle these proteins to the mother centriole. The Reviewers’ description of Sas-4 dynamics in fly embryos is, however, not quite correct. In the paper to which the reviewer refers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Novak et al. 2014</xref>) we showed (using a microscope with standard resolution) that an excess of Sas-4 builds up at centrioles during S-phase (when centrosomes are growing in size) and this excess is then gradually lost during mitosis (when centrosomes have reached their full size). Thus, although a significant fraction of Sas-4 molecules are clearly incorporated irreversibly into daughter centrioles, it was entirely possible that the excess Sas-4 molecules (that are not irreversibly incorporated into daughters) could have been shuttling S-CAP complexes to mother centrioles. Our super-resolution studies now prove that this is not the case. We clarify this point in the revised manuscript (subsection “The centrosomal recruitment of Sas-4, Cnn and Spd-2 differs in space and time”).</p><p><italic>3) There is little to be gained from the immunoprecipitation data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>, showing weak or no interactions between Sas-4 and Asl, Cnn and γ-tubulin.

We entirely agree that Sas-4 in the centriole is likely to play an important part in tethering the PCM, and our own experiments strongly support this idea, as we find that the Sas-4 already at the centriole helps recruit Asl to centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Novak et al., 2014</xref>), which then helps recruit the PCM (Conduit et al., 2014). However, this is a completely different concept from the S-CAP model proposed by Gopalakrishnan and colleagues – a model which is not disputed by Zheng et al.</p><p><italic>Other points:</italic></p><p><italic>1) It should be clarified that the FRAP experiments in this manuscript do not distinguish between recruitment and cytoplasmic turnover.</italic></p><p>The reviewer points out that we need to clarify that our FRAP experiments do not distinguish between recruitment and turnover. Given how the Reviewer uses the term “recruitment” in point 2 below, we suspect that he/she uses “recruitment” to mean the net accumulation of molecules at the centrosome and “turnover” to mean the exchange of centrosome molecules for cytoplasmic molecules. We agree that our FRAP data does not distinguish between these two phenomena. However, we use the term recruitment to include both of these phenomena (i.e. we count a molecule as being “recruited” to centrosomes every time a molecule is added to centrosomes from the cytoplasm, irrespective of whether this adds a new molecule to the centrosome or if it replaces an existing molecule). We now explicitly define how we use the term recruitment (Results, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Potentially explained by point 1 above, it is striking that the pattern of Cnn recovery reported here (constant across the cell cycle,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>) does not match the pattern of recruitment reported previously (continuous recruitment in S phase, stable levels in mitosis,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4"><italic>Conduit et al., 2010</italic></xref><italic>).</italic></p><p>The reviewer believes that the pattern of GFP-Cnn recruitment in the current study does not match that reported in our 2010 paper. This is not the case, and we believe this confusion arises from our different definitions of recruitment (see above). In our earlier paper we showed that the total number of GFP-Cnn molecules at centrosomes increases during S-phase (for the reviewer this is “recruitment”) and then stays constant during M-phase (so the reviewer concludes that no recruitment occurs during M-phase). We now show that GFP-Cnn fluorescence recovers after bleaching during both S- and M-phase. Using the reviewers’ definitions, this is due to both recruitment and turnover in S-phase, but only due to turnover in M-phase. However, by our definition, GFP-Cnn molecules are still being recruited to centrosomes during M-phase. Thus, the pattern of GFP-Cnn dynamics in the current study is fully compatible with our earlier analysis. We hope that defining our use of the term “recruitment” helps to clarify this point (Results, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) The authors should show that there is no residual shift between red and green channels by imaging the same protein (ideally Sas-4) in both channels.</italic></p><p>The reviewer thought that we should show that there is no shift between the red and green channels on our confocal microscope by imaging the same protein (ideally Sas-4) in both channels.

However, I fear that S-CAP complexes will persist in the centrosome literature no matter how definitively these complexes are shown not to exist.</italic></p><p><italic>With regard to the experimental data and clarifications in the revised manuscript, I'm generally satisfied with those revisions.

Correcting for chromatic shifts using TetraSpeck beads and then using those same beads to demonstate an absence of a shift is circular and does not exclude the possibility of small but significant shifts in the context of the live embryo. Imaging and quantitating the (preferably diffraction limited) signal for the same protein in both channels would eliminate this possibility and increase confidence in their measurements of Sas-4/PCM protein localization/recruitment, which are at the heart of their paper.</italic></p><p>Reviewer 2 thought that we needed to experimentally address the potential for shifts between red and green channels in our SIM/SIM-FRAP experiments, pointing out that the use of TetraSpeck beads does not exclude the possibility of small but significant shifts in the context of the living embryo. To eliminate this possibility, the reviewer suggested that we image the signal from the same protein in both channels to confirm that they align. From these comments we realize that we originally misunderstood the reviewers concern: we thought we needed to address whether the red and green channels were systemically misaligned (which is addressed by the TetraSpeck bead experiment), but the reviewer was actually asking us to address whether the two channels were misaligned because the centrioles have moved slightly during acquisition. The reviewer is correct that this is an important issue, and we apologise that we originally misunderstood this point.</p><p>The centrioles can indeed move slightly between the acquisition of the green and red channels (which, for technical reasons, have to be acquired sequentially). This slight movement does not, however, affect the interpretation of our data. To prove this point, we now measure the distance between the center of the Asl toroid (marking the center of the mother centriole acquired in the red channel) and the center of each Sas-4 dot (marking the center of both the mother and daughter centrioles, acquired in the green channel). Prior to photobleaching, one Sas-4 centriole (the presumptive mother) is on average ∼80nm from the center of the Asl toroid, while the other (the presumptive daughter) is on average ∼210nm from the center of the Asl toroid. Thus, the mother centriole shifts by an average of ∼80nm during the time between acquisition of the two channels. After photobleaching, the Sas-4 signal recovers at an average distance of ∼260nm from the center of the Asl toroid: statistically, this distance is significantly different from the average distance the mother centriole shifts during acquisition (∼80nm) but is not significantly different from the average distance between the Asl toroid and the daughter centriole (∼210nm). This new analysis (shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and 3E</xref>) strongly supports our conclusion that Sas-4 is recruited to daughter centrioles rather than mother centrioles.</p></body></sub-article></article>
