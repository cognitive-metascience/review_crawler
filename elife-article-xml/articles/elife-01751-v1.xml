The structure of many insect pheromones typically consists of a hydrocarbon backbone, occasionally modified with various functional oxygen groups. Here we show that sex-specific triacylclyerides (TAGs) are broadly conserved across the subgenus <italic>Drosophila</italic> in 11 species and represent a novel class of pheromones that has been largely overlooked. In desert-adapted drosophilids, 13 different TAGs are secreted exclusively by males from the ejaculatory bulb, transferred to females during mating, and function synergistically to inhibit courtship from other males. Sex-specific TAGs are comprised of at least one short branched tiglic acid and a long linear fatty acyl component, an unusual structural motif that has not been reported before in other natural products. The diversification of chemical cues used by desert-adapted <italic>Drosophila</italic> as pheromones may be related to their specialized diet of fermenting cacti.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01751.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01751.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01751.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For animals, the ultimate purpose of life is to have sex, as nothing is more important than passing down your genes to future generations. A wide range of strategies are therefore employed throughout nature to maximize the chances of sexual success, from ostentatious courtship rituals to the subtle subliminal signals sent out using chemicals called pheromones. Plants and animals release pheromones to influence the behavior of other plants and animals, often without the recipient being aware of it.</p><p>Hundreds of different insect pheromones have been discovered. Fruit flies release a number of different pheromones, all with similar chemical structures. Now, Chin et al. have discovered that male flies belonging to several species of fruit fly that live in the desert release chemicals called triacylglycerides (TAGs), which are commonly used for energy storage by many organisms as pheromones. During sex, the male fly rubs the TAGs onto the body of the female, which makes her less attractive to other male flies for several hours, thus increasing his chances of parenthood and passing his genes to future generations.</p><p>TAGs are also found in other insect species, but have been largely overlooked as pheromones. Moreover, the TAGs discovered by Chin et al. have an unusual structure, not previously seen in nature, which may result from the diet of fermenting cacti the desert-dwelling fruit flies enjoy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01751.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01751.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ozone-induced dissociation</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd><italic>D. arizonae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>D. mojavensis</italic></kwd><kwd>laser desorption ionzation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP0986628, DP120102922, CE0561607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blanksby</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Singapore National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-RF2010-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yew</surname><given-names>Joanne Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alexander von Humboldt Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yew</surname><given-names>Joanne Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EF-0723930</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Etges</surname><given-names>William J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Triacylglycerides found in the males of 11 species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> form a largely overlooked, novel, sex-specific class of pheromones that act to suppress courtship behaviour.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemical communication significantly influences many complex social behaviors, including aggression, kin recognition, and courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wyatt, 2003</xref>). The chemical structures and functions of insect pheromones have been intensely studied because of the fascinating diversity of behavioral properties and relevance to questions of speciation, reproductive isolation, and applications to pest control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Witzgall et al., 2010</xref>). Since the discovery of Bombykol in 1959 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butenandt et al., 1959</xref>), hundreds of insect pheromones have been identified, including straight chain and branched alkanes and alkenes, oxygen-containing derivatives such as wax esters, fatty alcohols, and aldehydes, sterols, and isoprene-based compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tillman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El-Sayed, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, pheromones are produced by oenocytes (specialized epithelial cells in both males and females) and the male ejaculatory bulb and subsequently secreted onto the cuticular surface and anogenital region, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Billeter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yew et al., 2009</xref>). Previous studies of <italic>Sophophora</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies identified alkanes, alkenes, and oxygen-modified hydrocarbons as the major lipids used as pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jallon and David, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenspan and Ferveur, 2000</xref>). Recently, triacylglycerides (TAGs), which are normally found in the fat bodies and used for energy storage, were observed on the cuticles of flies from the <italic>Drosophila repleta</italic> and <italic>Drosophila quinaria</italic> groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yew et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curtis et al., 2013</xref>). However, almost nothing is known about the structure, chemical diversity, conserved expression, and functional roles of these exogenously secreted TAGs.</p><p>To explore the role of TAGs as pheromones and the ubiquity of their expression in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> we used ultraviolet laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (UV-LDI MS) to analyze the cuticular profiles of flies from seven major <italic>Sophophora</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> groups.

Chemical derivatization of the long OAc fraction confirmed the presence of an acetyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Gas chromatography MS (GCMS) analysis of transesterified TLC fractions indicated tiglic acid, a 5-carbon branched unsaturated acid, as one of the fatty acyl moieties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). No other 5-carbon fatty acid methyl esters were detected. Tandem MS with low energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) analysis provided the chain length and degree of unsaturation of each of the acyl chains present in each TAG. A similar motif was revealed among each of the molecules: a single long-chain fatty acyl component, 16–18 carbons in length, together with 2 short-chain fatty acyl side chains, each 2–5 carbons in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). For several of the more abundant TAG molecules, the position of the acyl chains on the glycerol backbone could be deduced based on the relative abundance of the product ions in the CID spectra. As described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25 bib26">Hsu and Turk (1999 and 2010)</xref>, fragments reflecting the loss of substituent at the <italic>sn</italic>-2 carbon (middle of the glycerol backbone) are less abundant than ions reflecting losses at either the <italic>sn</italic>-1 or <italic>sn</italic>-3 carbons. Based on this observation, long-chain fatty acids are predominantly located at either <italic>sn</italic>-1 or <italic>sn</italic>-3 for the major TAGs at [M + Na]<sup>+</sup> 543 and 541 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>) and [M + Li]<sup>+</sup> 499, 501, and 527 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). It was not possible to distinguish between <italic>sn</italic>-1 and <italic>sn</italic>-3 positions. The position assignments on the backbone are supported by analysis of synthetic standards in which a long-chain fatty acid is placed at <italic>sn</italic>-1. The relative abundances of fragment ions are similar to those observed from crude extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6 fig3s7 fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 6–8</xref>). Notably, CID analysis of a fourth major TAG at [M + Li]<sup>+</sup> 487 resulted in low-intensity signals corresponding to loss of the C18:1 fatty acyl substituent, suggesting that this component is likely to reside at the <italic>sn</italic>-2 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Low-abundance signals for isobaric TAGs containing C18:2 and C18:1 fatty acids were also observed at [M + Li]<sup>+</sup> 501, 499, and 487 and are likely to represent minor components. In these cases, it was not possible to assign substituent positions.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01751.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Structural elucidation of sex-specific TAGs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The low energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectrum of a TAG-related signal from crude <italic>D. arizonae</italic> extract ([M + Na]<sup>+</sup> 543) shows fragments corresponding to losses of a 5 carbon fatty acid with a single double bond (C5:1) and an 18 carbon fatty acid with a single double bond (C18:1).

Individual TAG species were mass-selected within an ion-trap mass spectrometer where they were exposed to ozone vapor. The resulting gas-phase ion–molecule reaction facilitates targeted oxidative dissociation of carbon–carbon double bonds present in the acyl chains. Fragmentation of the ozonide leads to formation of characteristic aldehyde and Criegee ions with a mass indicative of the positions of each double bond. OzID analysis of the TAG fraction revealed numerous positional isomers, with double bond positions between C9-C10 (<italic>n</italic>-9) and C11-C12 (<italic>n</italic>-7), indicating oleic and palmitoleic acid side chains, and between C2-C3 (<italic>n</italic>-2), consistent with tiglic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).

The relative abundance of the aldehyde and Criegee ions for the molecules at [M + Na]<sup>+</sup> 543 and 541 are consistent with those of synthetic TAG standards synthesized with oleic acid and linoleic acid, both of which contain <italic>cis-</italic> double bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6 fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 6 and 8</xref>). In summary, MS analysis revealed considerable variation in the carbon chain length, degree of unsaturation, positions of fatty acyl chains, and double bond positions of both the short chain and long chain fatty acyl components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Copulation choice was similarly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Thus, courtship inhibition is not a generalized aversion to other compounds extracted from ejaculatory bulb tissue. Since virgin females were used, female rejection behavior was not a major contributing factor to copulation choice. Furthermore, it is unlikely that female rejection behavior was triggered by females’ sensory feedback from perfuming. <italic>D. arizonae</italic> males continued to avoid mating with perfumed females from which the major olfactory and gustatory organs have been removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).

At a dose of 37.5 ng per fly, none of the TAGs were effective by themselves. However, two combinations of TAGs reduced copulation: 1-steroyl-2,3-ditigloyl glycerol together with either 1-oleoyl-2,3-ditigloyl glycerol or 1-linoleyl-2,3-ditiglyoyl glycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Both combinations also inhibited courtship initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). Additionally, courtship initiation was affected by the combination of long OAcs with 1-palmitoleyl-2,3-ditiglyol and 1-oleyl-2,3-ditiglyol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). Thus, low amounts of several TAG species, inactive on their own, can act in synergy with each other to suppress male courtship and copulation. It is notable that none of the TAG combinations tested were effective without long OAcs despite our finding that a mixture of TAGs purified from extract was by itself sufficient to deter male attraction. It may be the case that a combination of several different TAG species is needed for courtship inhibition without the presence of long OAcs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Lipid and protein compounds transferred from male to female <italic>Drosophila</italic> during copulation are known to inhibit courtship from other males, trigger rejection behaviors in mated females, and serve as nutrition to aid in fertilization and oogenesis in the female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zawistowski and Richmond, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bownes and Partridge, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wigby et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yew et al., 2009</xref>). Our results show that TAGs are a novel class of mating-related pheromones that are used by males to manipulate the post-mating attractiveness of females. It remains to be determined whether sex-specific TAGs or their hydrolyzed side chains serve other functions such as nuptial gifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gwynne, 2008</xref>) or defensive compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Will et al., 2000</xref>). Earlier studies of <italic>D. arizonae</italic> and <italic>D. mojavensis</italic> cuticular lipids using GCMS found mostly linear and branched long-chain hydrocarbons, including dienes, trienes, and methyl-branched alkenes, 29–38 carbons in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Toolson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Etges and Jackson, 2001</xref>). TAGs were not previously observed likely due to analytical limitations; under standard GCMS conditions, heavier molecules such as TAGs are not detected. The presence of TAGs in cuticular extracts is usually attributed to fat leaking from internal stores due to cuticular rupture. However, several indicators make it clear that sex-specific TAGs are exogenously secreted. First, signals for specialized TAGs were detected only from the ejaculatory bulb housed in the anogenital region of males but not virgin females, indicating a discrete, sexually dimorphic site of secretion. Second, sex-specific TAGs are structurally distinct from conventional TAGs found in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carvalho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guan et al., 2013</xref>).

Conventional naturally occurring TAGs found in plant oils and animal fat typically consist of linear fatty acyl moieties that have 16, 18, or 20 carbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>). Although medium and short chain fatty acyls have been found in TAGs from, respectively, whale blubber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Litchfield et al., 1971</xref>) and bovine milk fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breckenridge and Kuksis, 1968</xref>), they are only in combination with linear and even-numbered carbon acyls. In contrast, sex-specific TAGs from flies exhibit an unusual combination of short and long chain acyl components with odd and even numbers of carbons. To what extent can these unconventional structures be attributed to diet? Previous and current work has shown that altering the diet of desert-adapted flies results in a quantitative change in hydrocarbons and sex-specific triglycerides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Toolson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Etges et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Etges et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yew et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, many of the substrates on which the drosophilids subsist and oviposit contain compounds that can be toxic for other animals. For example, desert-adapted <italic>D. arizonae</italic> and <italic>D. mojavensis</italic> feed on fermenting cacti, which have high levels of triterpene glycosides, medium chain fatty acids, and sterol diols, compounds which can serve as toxic plant defense chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fogleman and Danielson, 2001</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Drosophila subquinaria</italic> and <italic>Drosophila recens</italic> are found exclusively on mushrooms that are rich in secondary metabolites such as isoprenoids and fatty acids in a variety of lengths, from 4 to 26 carbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wandati et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pedneault et al., 2008</xref>) but also contain high levels of toxic compounds like alpha-amanitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaenike et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Courtney et al., 1990</xref>). Slime fluxes, on which <italic>D. virilis</italic> and <italic>D. robusta</italic> can be found, have large bacterial communities that can be inhospitable to other drosophilids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carson and Stalker, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Powell, 1997</xref>). Bacterial wetwood infections have been shown to produce acetate, butyrate, valerate, hexanoate, and propionate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ward and Zeikus, 1980</xref>), which could be directly incorporated into the TAGs or serve as precursors for branched or linear fatty acids, as has been observed for nitidulid beetles (<italic>Carpophilus</italic> spp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartelt and Weisleder, 1996</xref>). The ability of drosophilids that produce sex-specific TAGs to thrive on these specialized substrates alludes to the possibility that enzymes used for detoxification may have been adapted for TAG synthesis. Notably, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases have been identified in other insects as playing a crucial role in detoxification and cuticular lipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>). In bark beetles, it has been suggested that a key cytochrome P450 enzyme used in pheromone synthesis was previously used for detoxification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blomquist et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, conservation of TAG expression may be more related to phylogenetic effects than functional adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oliveira et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A second pathway for TAG synthesis relies on de novo production of precursors. Each of the desert-adapted drosophilids tested in this study are still able to produce TAGs despite being raised on standard laboratory fly media. Thus, desert-adapted drosophilids are capable of using precursors from the environment and synthesizing the components de novo though significant quantitative differences are found for some TAG molecules. Based on these observations, we expect that lab-raised flies are likely to have quantitative differences in lipid profiles compared to natural populations because of the differences between the natural diet and a highly simplified lab diet. Both pathways for precursor synthesis are used by numerous Coleoptera beetle species for the production of aggregation pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tillman et al., 1999</xref>). The ability to utilize different production pathways may enable insects to switch host plants while preserving conspecific signaling. Elucidation of the biochemical pathways underlying TAG synthesis is needed to better understand whether dietary sequestration or de novo production is preferentially used by desert-adapted drosophlids and to determine the ancestral state of TAG production.</p><p>In this study, we have identified an unusual chemical class of pheromones in the form of triacylglycerides and described their function as anti-aphrodisiacs. Specialized TAGs were prevalent across other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species and may also be found in other insect orders and have other functions. For example, triolein in the fire ant, <italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic>, acts as a brood pheromone and has application as bait when combined with toxicants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bigley and Vinson, 1975</xref>). The chiral 1,2-dioleyl-3-palmitolyl glycerol is also a brood pheromone in the honey bee, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koeniger and Veith, 1984</xref>). Taken together, triacylglycerides represent a broadly conserved and largely overlooked class of pheromones. Ultimately, to understand the evolutionary origin of these unusual molecules, it will be important to determine the behavioral function of sex-specific TAGs in other species and the underlying biosynthetic pathways. Using a broad range of analytical methods for chemical profiling will expand the detectable range of chemical classes used in communication. Correlating gene expression in the ejaculatory bulb across multiple TAG-expressing species will enable us to identify candidate biosynthetic enzymes and to provide molecular markers that will allow the evolution and function of this surprising chemical phenotype to be traced.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and husbandry</title><p><italic>D. arizonae</italic>, <italic>D. aldrichi</italic>, and <italic>D. navojoa</italic> in this study were wild caught from Las Bocas, Sonora, Mexico, in March 2009. <italic>D. mojavensis</italic> were caught from Santa Catalina Island, California and <italic>D. wheeleri</italic> from Punta Onah, Sonora, Mexico, in November 2007 by sweep netting over fermenting bananas.

Reaction of ozone with carbon–carbon double bonds in the TAG acyl chains produces fragment ions that identify their position within the chain. Location of each double bond is indicated by the traditional nomenclature ‘<italic>n-x</italic>’ where ‘<italic>n</italic>’ refers to the number of carbon atoms in the chain and subtracting ‘<italic>x</italic>’ provides the location of the double bond (i.e., <italic>x</italic> represents the position of the double bond with respect to the methyl terminus).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS)</title><p>Prepared extracts were re-dissolved in 60 µl of hexane and transferred into GCMS vials (Supelco). Analysis was run in a 5% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane (DB-5, 30 m length, 0.32 i.d., 0.25-μm film thickness, Agilent) column and GCMS QP2010 system (Shimadzu) with an initial column temperature of 50°C for 2 min and increment to 300°C at a rate of 15°C/min in splitless mode.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analysis of TLC fractions and dissected tissues by fly-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (FALDI MS)</title><p>Fly wings were detached and washed in a solution of chloroform/methanol (2:1, vol/vol) to ensure existing cuticular hydrocarbons were completely removed. The wings were then attached onto a MS customized sample plate with double-sided tape. The fraction-containing vials were re-dissolved with 20 µl of hexane each and 2 µl from each vial was pipetted onto different wings. The sample plate was placed into the UV-LDI MS instrument and the fractions analyzed using the same parameters for UV-LDI MS analyses of intact flies. For more details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yew et al., 2011</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART MS)</title><p>Analysis was performed using the following ion source settings: the gas heater was set to 200°C; the glow discharge needle was set at 3.5 kV. Electrode 1 was set to +150 V and electrode 2 was set to +250 V. Helium gas flow was set to 2.5 L/min. Under these conditions, TAGs were detected as [M + NH<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup> molecules and long OAcs were detected as [M + H]<sup>+</sup> molecules. Clean borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments) were used for sampling the solution. The capillary was placed in the DART stream for 5 s. Polyethylene glycol (Sigma–Aldrich) was used as calibrant. Analysis was done with MassCenter (version 1.3.0.1) (JEOL) program.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Courtship assays</title><p>To generate mated female targets in assays where males choose virgin or recently mated females, naive males were first paired with virgin females in 35 × 10 mm tissue culture dishes (Nunclon, Denmark) and observed for copulation. Immediately after copulation, the dish containing the copulated pair was placed on ice to anaesthetize the flies temporarily. In clean tissue culture dishes, a mated female and a virgin female are placed into each dish and allowed to recover for 45 min to an hour before performing the courtship assay. New socially naive males are aspirated into each dish and assayed for first courtship event lasting more than 5 s, including wing vibration, foreleg tapping, proboscis extension, and copulation. At least 20 trials of each set of experiments were performed.</p><p>For perfuming assays, virgin females were perfumed by lightly vortexing eight individuals in a 1.8-ml glass vial with Teflon-lined caps containing extract or evaporated solvent (control) for 3 bouts of 20 s each with 5–10 s rest between each bout. A fly from each vial was checked for perfuming efficiency using UV-LDI MS, whereas the other 7 were used for the courtship assay. Approximately, 20% of contents from the extract were transferred to all eight flies during perfuming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Billeter et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, each fly was perfumed with the equivalent of 2.5% of the total concentration from the vial.</p><p>In assays using synthetic TAGs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), an amount of 750 ng or 75 ng per fly was used. Where TAGs are paired, each female was perfumed with 37.5 ng of each TAG for a total 75 ng per fly. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref> shows the spectra of perfumed females, indicating that the amounts perfumed are moderate compared to mated females.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>The phylogram was generated using Mesquite 2.75 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maddison and Maddison, 2011</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mesquiteproject.org">http://mesquiteproject.org</ext-link>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers, both of whom, Wittko Franke and Leslie Vosshall, have agreed to reveal their identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that this well written manuscript described a significant expansion of our knowledge of pheromonal signaling in Drosophila. In brief the paper describes the use of sophisticated mass spectrometry techniques to characterize a small family of triacylglycerides (TAGs) that play a role in pheromonal communication in several species of Drosophila. In addition to defining the biological roles of this recently discovered family, the manuscript more generally illustrated the potential for new analytical chemical techniques to reveal previously overlooked biological phenomena.</p><p>This general enthusiasm for the manuscript was muted by some issues that are described below.</p><p>1) Both naturally occurring TAGs and synthetic TAGs are used in this study, and the failure to distinguish what has been definitively established about the structures of the two needs to be addressed. The synthetic TAGs, which are based on a 2012 paper with the Mori laboratory, have well defined structures. The naturally occurring TAGs are the issue, and the concerns are best illustrated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and 3I</xref>. The issue with the supplemental figure is that the structures shown on the right are not unequivocally established by the MS data shown on the left. For example, the first MS (A) shows that the structure is a triacylated glycerol with acyl groups containing 2, 5 and 18 carbon atoms, but it does not establish that they are connected to the glycerol in the order shown. In addition the ozonolysis experiments show that the C18 acyl group has a double bond at the position shown, but it does not establish whether it is <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic>. Thus the drawing implies a degree of structural specificity that is not established in this or previous papers. The authors make assumptions, admittedly plausible assumptions, about unknown structural features. The best way forward would be more careful characterization of purified materials. At a minimum, the substitution pattern of the glycerol should be established, and the <italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> stereochemistry could be left ambiguous – wavy lines – in the structural drawings. The substitution pattern could be established through synthesis as isolating enough material would likely prove difficult.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> establishes that synthetic TAGs and their mixtures can have similar biological effects to the natural TAGs, but that in itself does not establish the structures of the natural TAGs. The pheromone literature has many examples where compounds similar but not identical to the natural ones can have very similar biological effects.</p><p>Finally, the reviewers suggested that as sophisticated chemical analysis and synthesis play such an important role in this manuscript, the chemistry should be moved from the supplementary material into the main body of the paper. An important feature of <italic>eLife</italic> is the ability to have as many figures and as much space as necessary to tell the story.</p><p>2) The authors assume that male rejections of TAG-perfumed virgins is not due to female rejection behavior, but they did not explicitly test this. An alternative in which female chemosensory detection of TAGs on their own cuticle could switch them into a post-mating state. This admittedly less likely alternative explanation could be tested quickly.</p><p>3) The authors mention that the TAGs might have a dietary origin. While it might be challenging to test with wild flies, it should be possible to vary the laboratory diet, especially plus/minus cactus powder to note any effect on TAG amount or composition. Absent that kind of evidence, it would be best to curtail speculation about the source of TAG precursors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01751.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Both naturally occurring TAGs and synthetic TAGs are used in this study, and the failure to distinguish what has been definitively established about the structures of the two needs to be addressed.

The pheromone literature has many examples where compounds similar but not identical to the natural ones can have very similar biological effects</italic>.</p><p>We have established the substitution pattern for 8 of the TAGs based on the relative abundances of product ions in the CID spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3 – supplemental 4</xref>). It is well established that upon dissociation, loss of substituents at <italic>sn-1</italic> and <italic>sn-3</italic> of the glycerol backbone will be more abundant than at <italic>sn-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hsu and Turk, 1999</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2010</xref>). Hence, based on the relative intensities of peaks in the CID spectrum, it is possible to deduce backbone position. Using this principle, we were able to assign the long chain FA component to <italic>sn-1</italic> or <italic>3</italic> for 8 of the TAGs. The assignments for 4 of the TAGs are supported by CID analysis of the synthetic versions that produced nearly identical dissociation spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6 fig3s7 fig3s8">Figure 3–figure supplement 6-8</xref>).</p><p>With respect to <italic>cis-trans</italic> stereochemistry of double bonds, we are able to deduce the geometry of one of the TAG molecules. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poad et al. (2010)</xref> observed that <italic>cis</italic> vs <italic>trans</italic> double bonds differed in terms of overall abundance and relative abundances of OzID product ions since trans-alkenes react faster with ozone. OzID analysis of the natural TAG and a synthetic version (synthesized with <italic>cis</italic> double bond geometry) produced similar spectra in terms of fragment ion abundances, supporting the <italic>cis</italic> assignment. In all other cases, we have placed a wavy line to illustrate ambiguity of the double bond configuration. We agree that synthesis of TAGs with variant substitution positions will be highly valuable for structural elucidation. The Mori laboratory is currently in the process of synthesizing TAGs with different substitution patterns of the glycerol, a procedure that is likely to require between 2-3 months. Once completed, we intend to perform the CID analysis and publish the results in a separate paper. However, for the current paper, we believe that the substitution patterns for the major TAG species (particularly ones that appear to have functional significance) that we have established should be sufficient.</p><p><italic>Finally, the reviewers suggested that as sophisticated chemical analysis and synthesis play such an important role in this manuscript, the chemistry should be moved from the supplementary material into the main body of the paper. An important feature of eLife is the ability to have as many figures and as much space as necessary to tell the story</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their enthusiasm regarding the chemistry. We have included a much more detailed schematic of the product ions result from CID MS and OzID analysis for the TAG species highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. These schematics highlight the chemical analysis and are intended to illustrate spectral interpretation. However, we have elected to keep other supporting CID and OzID spectra in supplemental figures because the interpretation of the spectra is already summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The authors assume that male rejections of TAG-perfumed virgins is not due to female rejection behavior, but they did not explicitly test this. An alternative in which female chemosensory detection of TAGs on their own cuticle could switch them into a post-mating state. This admittedly less likely alternative explanation could be tested quickly</italic>.</p><p>We have addressed this intriguing possibility by testing females from which different sensory organs have been surgically removed (antennae, maxillary palps, and first segment of the foreleg; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5–figure supplement 6</xref>). In each case, males still preferred to court with unperfumed females indicating that females ‘ability to detect TAGs on their own cuticle does not trigger rejection behavior or contribute in a significant way to influencing male avoidance.</p><p><italic>3) The authors mention that the TAGs might have a dietary origin. While it might be challenging to test with wild flies, it should be possible to vary the laboratory diet, especially plus/minus cactus powder to note any effect on TAG amount or composition. Absent that kind of evidence, it would be best to curtail speculation about the source of TAG precursors</italic>.</p><p>We quantified levels of sex-specific TAGs from individuals raised on either standard fly media or media supplemented with cactus powder and banana. Thin-layer chromatography was performed on dissected ejaculatory bulbs from 10 flies for each condition. TAGs were quantified according to the intensity of the primuline-stained TLC band. The results indicate a significant reduction in several, but not all, of the sex-specific TAGs when flies are raised on standard media. We conclude that a laboratory diet has an effect on TAG production and likely contributes precursors or makes precursors more readily available for incorporation. We have added these data to the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>To further address this issue, we make reference in the Discussion to a previous publication that examined the effects of diet on overall cuticular lipid changes and found significant quantitative changes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
