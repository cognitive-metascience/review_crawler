We have found distinct regions of the Arabidopsis genome that are susceptible to DNA (de)methylation in response to hyperosmotic stress. The stress-induced epigenetic changes are associated with conditionally heritable adaptive phenotypic stress responses. However, these stress responses are primarily transmitted to the next generation through the female lineage due to widespread DNA glycosylase activity in the male germline, and extensively reset in the absence of stress. Using the <italic>CNI1/ATL31</italic> locus as an example, we demonstrate that epigenetically targeted sequences function as distantly-acting control elements of antisense long non-coding RNAs, which in turn regulate targeted gene expression in response to stress. Collectively, our findings reveal that plants use a highly dynamic maternal ‘short-term stress memory’ with which to respond to adverse external conditions. This transient memory relies on the DNA methylation machinery and associated transcriptional changes to extend the phenotypic plasticity accessible to the immediate offspring.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13546.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13546.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13546.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most plants spend their entire lives in one fixed spot and so must be able to quickly adapt to any changes in their surroundings. For example, high levels of salt in the soil – which can be toxic to cells – triggers stress responses in plants that help them to mitigate any damage. Once the stress has passed, plants are able to retain a memory of it, which allows them to respond more quickly if they face the same stress in future. Furthermore, plants may pass on this ‘stress memory’ to their offspring.</p><p>It is thought that stress memory is programmed by chemical modifications to DNA known as epigenetic marks. These marks do not alter the genetic information that is encoded by the DNA itself, but they can change the activity of particular genes. Environmental stress leads to changes in the epigenetic marks found on many plant genes, which can be directly passed on from the parent plant to its offspring. However, it was not clear whether the epigenetic marks that programme stress memory can be passed on in this way.</p><p>Wibowo, Becker et al. investigated how a model plant called <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> is able to remember periods of salt stress. The experiments show that high levels of salt can trigger changes in the patterns of epigenetic marks associated with particular regions of DNA. This memory is reinforced by repetitive exposure to similar salt stress and can be passed onto offspring, primarily through the maternal line. However, this stress memory is not fixed in future generations as the epigenetic marks can be reset to their original patterns if plants find themselves growing and reproducing under non-stress conditions.</p><p>In sum, the findings of Wibowo, Becker et al. show that epigenetic marks allow plants to inherit stress memory on a temporary basis while the stress is present, but to gradually lose the memory if the stress does not return. Future studies will focus on finding out if stress memory in crop plants works in the same way.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13546.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13546.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>environment</kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weigel</surname><given-names>Detlef</given-names></name><name><surname>Kageyama</surname><given-names>Jorge</given-names></name><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>Claude</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1101- Project C01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weigel</surname><given-names>Detlef</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ESF/RTD Framework COST action</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FA0903</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gutierrez-Marcos</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/F008082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gutierrez-Marcos</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EU FP7 Collaborative Project Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AENEAS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gutierrez-Marcos</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ERA-CAPS Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EVOREPRO</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gutierrez-Marcos</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IE150496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gutierrez-Marcos</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transient adaptation to environmental fluctuations in plants is mediated through discrete epigenetic changes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>While genetic variation is the primary source of long-term adaptation and evolution, numerous studies have pointed to induced epigenetic changes to facilitate rapid adaptation to short-term environmental fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Franks and Hoffmann, 2012</xref>). Because plants are sessile organisms, it has been suggested that they can efficiently integrate environmental signals into a ‘stress memory’ that is transmitted to the immediate progeny. This newly acquired information could allow populations to respond efficiently to repeated exposure to the same stress, a phenomenon known as 'priming' or 'acclimation' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crisp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Conrath et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Slaughter et al., 2012</xref>). It has recently been proposed that epigenetic marks could be induced depending on the consistency of the cues that individuals perceive directly from the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Uller et al., 2015</xref>). Yet it remains unclear how often this actually occurs in nature, and whether such adaptive responses can be transmitted over multiple non-stressed generations, a phenomenon termed “transgenerational stress memory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hauser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Paszkowski and Grossniklaus, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Stress memory in plants is believed to be mostly epigenetic in nature, because priming responses have been associated with changes in chromatin and DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hauser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ito et al., 2011</xref>). Genome-wide studies in plants have shown that environmental stress dynamically modifies the chromatin landscape, creating novel patterns of gene expression, and thereby affecting short-term adaptation to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sani et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, heritable traits resulting from environmental stress have been associated with DNA methylation changes in promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bilichak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Le et al., 2014</xref>), gene-coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bilichak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>), transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lang-Mladek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Molinier et al., 2006</xref>) and transposable elements (TEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Le et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Secco et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although TEs in plants are often mutagenic, they are nonetheless deemed to be potentially beneficial for regulating gene expression in response to a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses. For instance, pathogen attack in Arabidopsis can cause changes in DNA methylation primarily at TEs and repeats located proximal to genes associated with transcriptional defense responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dowen et al., 2012</xref>), while temperature stress can trigger specific TE activation that, when inserted near genes, can confer stress-mediated transcriptional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cavrak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Naito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yasuda et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly in rice, phosphate starvation alters methylation at TEs near environmentally induced genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Secco et al., 2015</xref>). These findings, which are reminiscent of the domestication of viral DNA for human immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chuong et al., 2016</xref>), support the view that TEs play pivotal roles in environmental stress-sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kalendar et al., 2000</xref>). The precise mechanism by which this occurs remains elusive. It is possible that the specific repetitive sequences present in transposons can generate and/or be recognised by stress-induced small non-coding RNAs that direct <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</xref>). Alternatively, DNA methylation could be affected by stress independently of small RNAs through the RDR6-RdDM pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nuthikattu et al., 2013</xref>) or be targeted and demethylated by DNA glycosylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim and Zilberman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang and Zhu, 2012</xref>), thereby imparting dynamic transcriptional changes at neighbouring genes. This is supported by observations of mutants defective for genes of these epigenetic pathways, and which have impaired biotic and abiotic stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Le et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Luna and Ton, 2012</xref>).</p><p>While the somatic stability of environmentally-induced epigenetic changes is well documented, robust evidence for their sexual transmission to the next generation is rare in both animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heard and Martienssen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Paszkowski and Grossniklaus, 2011</xref>). During the initial stages of sexual reproduction, an active epigenetic reprogramming takes place in plant gametes as a means of silencing transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gutierrez-Marcos and Dickinson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kawashima and Berger, 2014</xref>), but it is not known whether this process also affects the transmission of environmentally-induced alterations in DNA methylation.</p><p>Here we report that repeated hyperosmotic stress induces DNA methylation changes that primarily affect epigenetically labile regions of the Arabidopsis genome, i.e., regions that are susceptible to changes in methylation status. Some of these changes are transmitted to the offspring, where they affect the transcriptional regulation of a small group of genes associated with enhanced tolerance to environmental stress. In the absence of a renewed stress stimulus, the acquired epigenetic and phenotypic changes are gradually reset in subsequent generations. Further, newly acquired stress tolerance and associated <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation marks are preferentially transmitted through the female germline. Epigenetic inheritance relies on DNA methylation changes at sequences that function as distantly acting control elements of key stress-response regulators, including antisense long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Collectively, our data provide a new mechanistic model for the establishment and transient inheritance of plant stress adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Repeated hyperosmotic stress leads to transient phenotypic adaptation</title><p>To evaluate the extent to which stress-induced transgenerational adaptation occurs, we first exposed Arabidopsis plants (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> accession Col-0) to two different hyperosmotic conditions for over five generations (P0 of G1-G5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (see Materials and methods for details).

Therefore, to confirm that the adaptive responses seen in the offspring of stressed parents were due to newly acquired genome-wide epigenetic changes, we grew well-characterized epigenetic mutants that are defective in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) or in the active removal of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang and Zhu, 2012</xref>), and exposed them to hyperosmotic stress for two successive generations.

To ensure statistically robust results, we excluded inter-individual epigenetic variation that can arise over the course of several generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schmitz et al., 2011</xref>) by collecting duplicate samples of leaf tissue from 10 plants each from the G1, G3 and G5 generations for each treatment (control, 25 mM-, and 75 mM-NaCl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We sought to compare DNA methylation patterns for the different treatments in non-stressed P1 and P2 progeny derived from control or salt-stressed P0 parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Individual cytosines with a significantly altered methylation frequency, termed differentially methylated positions (DMPs), were first identified by pairwise comparisons between two samples. Because the three stressed generations had been grown and treated at different time points, we only compared samples belonging to the same treatment group, thus excluding methylation changes that were due to stochastic fluctuations in growth conditions. Single-site polymorphisms between any two samples were rare, with on average 6,866 DMPs (40% CG, 15% CHG and 45% CHH) detected per generation in all pairwise comparisons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) and complete linkage clustering of methylation frequencies grouped all stress-treated samples (P0), separating them from control, P1, and P2 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). This indicated that hyperosmotic stress had a small but noticeable effect on single methylated cytosines, and that this effect was largely transient. Overall we observed three times more methylation gains than losses in salt-treated P0 plants compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Because we found considerably fewer DMPs than recently reported for multi-generational hyperosmotic stress treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>), we re-analysed the published data. We found that only a small fraction of the DNA methylation changes reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jiang et al.

To identify stress-induced DMRs, we used a statistically robust Hidden Markov Model-based algorithm that supports the confident detection of differential methylation also in CHG and CHH contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagmann et al., 2015</xref>). We identified on average 24,700 methylated regions (MRs) per sample with a median length of 272 bp (mean: 856 bp). To identify generation-specific and treatment-dependent DMRs, we considered samples of the same generation (G1, G3 or G5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and treatment regime (control or salt-treated) as replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). For all three generations, DMRs mapped mainly to TEs and intergenic regions, and were three- to seven-fold over-represented in 2-kb regions upstream of transcription start sites compared with overall methylation in MRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

For G1, the cluster comprising the non-stressed samples did not have any clear substructure.

We confirmed our finding that the methylation changes in CHG and CHH correlated well with stress treatment, whereas changes in CG methylation did not, indicating that CG methylation patterns occur stochastically in treated and non-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Thus, hyperosmotic stress directs DNA methylation changes primarily at non-CG sites located in intergenic TE-related sequences, and these epigenetic modifications are associated with an acquired transient adaptation to stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Identification of epigenetically labile regions sensitive to abiotic stress</title><p>Although a large fraction of DMRs appeared to arise as a consequence of salt treatment, only a few recurred in G3 and G5, or overlapped between all three generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To determine the significance of these hyperosmotic-stress DMRs (HS-DMRs), we asked whether they were also responsive to other abiotic stresses, such as cold treatment. Comparing our data with a small set of DMRs in cold-stressed Arabidopsis seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Seymour et al., 2014</xref>), we did not detect any overlap between the two datasets. By contrast, 49% of HS-DMRs in stressed plants (P0) overlapped with or were in close proximity (&lt;500 bp) to DMRs that had been reported to arise spontaneously in mutation accumulation (MA) lines that had been grown over 30 generations under controlled conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagmann et al., 2015</xref>). These spontaneous MA-DMRs are often found in more than one individual, pointing to specific regions of the genome being particularly susceptible to epigenetic reprogramming. We compared pools of ten plants to identify HS-DMRs, while individual plants had been compared to define MA-DMRs. That there is nevertheless substantial overlap indicates that stress-triggered epigenetic reprogramming of specific genomic regions is not entirely random.</p><p>To determine whether the DMRs found in both the hyperosmotic stressed plants and MA lines differed from those others found in only one of the two populations, we performed complete linkage clustering on both sets. Overlapping and non-overlapping DMRs behaved similarly for G3 and G5 (but not G1), with stressed samples clustering in one group and control and untreated progeny in another. This indicated that overlapping and non-overlapping DMRs carried a similar hyperosmotic stress signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), but the two DMR classes differed in their association with adjacent annotated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). In particular, HS-DMRs that did not overlap with spontaneous MA-DMRs were enriched near genes with functions related to metabolic responses and ion transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).

We found that enhanced tolerance to hyperosmotic stress conditions was primarily conferred through the female germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As the epigenetic reprogramming of male gametes is mediated to a large extent by DEMETER (DME) DNA glycosylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calarco et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ibarra et al., 2012</xref>), we investigated whether hyperosmotic priming could be passed on through the male germline if DME-dependent reprogramming was disrupted.

Unlike in somatic tissue, hyperosmotic stress induced very few methylation changes in SC and VN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) such that only three DMRs became hypomethylated upon hyperosmotic treatment. This strikingly contrasted with the13,776 DMRs that distinguished SCs from VNs (SV-DMRs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Most of the SV-DMRs predominantly localized next to TEs and were particularly enriched in adjacent regions of coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Significantly, over three quarters of the HS-DMRs (76%) overlapped with SV-DMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and half of them with MA-DMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Further, when compared with somatic tissues, CHG methylation in SC was elevated in pericentromeric regions, while methylation in VN was depleted in all sequence contexts and reduced to the central centromeric region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Because siRNAs produced in the vegetative nuclei can silence transposons in sperm cells in a DME-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ibarra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martinez et al., 2016</xref>), we assessed the methylation state of HS-DMRs in <italic>dme</italic> mutants.

However, we observed similar methylation differences at non-DMR coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplemental 2</xref>), indicating that HS-DMRs are only a subset of loci that are under the control of DME.</p><p>In summary, DNA glycosylase activity in the male germline is pivotal for both the epigenetic silencing of transposons and for the resetting of epigenetic marks induced by environmental stress.

Unlike animals, plants present a fascinating model to examine this problem because their sessile nature makes it likely that parent and offspring will be exposed to similarly stressful conditions. Here, we have used a systematic approach to assess transgenerational stress adaptation in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Our main conclusion is that intergenerational priming responses to hyperosmotic stress are triggered by recurrent exposure to stimuli, but that this response is rapidly lost in the absence of stress. Whether stress memory is less transient in perennial plants, which are rooted in place over consecutive years, needs to be determined.</p><p>In animals that lack DNA methylation, the primary mechanisms involved in the acquisition and inheritance of new characters directed by the environment rely on histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ost et al., 2014</xref>) and small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>). In mammals such adaptation is usually associated with changes in DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Radford et al., 2014</xref>). In plants, environmentally-directed heritable traits have also been proposed to be associated with whole-scale changes in global DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dowen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). Bycontrast, using our highly controlled and replicated syste, and a strict method for detecting methylated regions, we found no clear evidence for such indiscriminate changes. Instead, we found that hyperosmotic stress directs DNA methylation changes primarily to discrete genome regions that are rich in TE-related sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). The dynamic DNA methylation changes are of functional consequence because the adaptive response is impaired in mutants defective in DNA methylation pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which are also known to regulate TE activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim and Zilberman, 2014</xref>). Mutants defective in DNA methylation and demethylation pathways displayed similar adaptive stress memory abilities, thus indicating that adaptive memory is controlled by complex processes that may not strictly rely on DNA methylation changes alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crisp et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A small fraction of acquired epigenetic changes is transmitted to the immediate offspring only after recurrent stress exposure, but in the absence of a renewed stimulus these are reset in subsequent generations. This implies that epigenetic stress memory in annual plant species may be transient in nature, however this response may differ in perennial plants that grow over longer periods of time before producing any offspring or in plants that reproduce asexually.</p><p>Half of the newly acquired methylation changes identified in our stressed plants overlapped with regions privileged for epimutation also found in near-isogenic greenhouse-grown populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagmann et al., 2015</xref>). This finding confirms that distinct regions of the plant epigenome are particularly labile, and it suggests that such acquired epimutations could modulate the ability of plants to respond to stress. Importantly, in our system, enhanced stress responses were only passed on after two consecutive generations of stress exposure, but not when plants were exposed to hyperosmotic stress for only one episode, which may be the reason why previous studies often failed to find clear evidence for inheritance of stress-induced epigenetic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eichten and Springer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Secco et al., 2015</xref>). One explanation for repeated stress exposure being required for induction of transiently heritable stress resistance may reside in the importance of poised epigenetic states for environmental priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jaskiewicz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sani et al., 2013</xref>), which in turn may facilitate the establishment of new epigenetic marks at discrete genomic regions that are sensitive to stress. This view is supported by the substantial overlap (&gt;30%) between HS-DMRs established in recurrently stressed generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and dynamic chromatin occupancy directed by hyperosmosis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Intriguingly, recurrent exposure to hyperosmotic stress did not significantly increase the number of newly acquired epimutations, suggesting that the extent of epigenetic plasticity elicited by the environment is limited to a few key genomic regions that may be under purifying selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hollister and Gaut, 2009</xref>). It is likely that certain genomic regions are epigenetically targeted, depending on the type of stress because the DNA methylation changes induced by hyperosmotic stress did not overlap with methylation changes reported for other abiotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Seymour et al., 2014</xref>). A direct comparison of the latter study to this study is however difficult to make due to inconsistencies in experimental methodology, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Seymour and colleagues (2014)</xref> did not investigate methylation changes in subsequent generations grown in the absence of stress.</p><p>While it is accepted that some epigenetic variation caused by the environment can be transmitted to the immediate offspring of plants and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Feil and Fraga, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heard and Martienssen, 2014</xref>), the importance of transmission through either the male or female germline has not been previously investigated. Our analyses revealed that hyperosmotic priming responses were transmitted primarily through the maternal germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We attribute this difference to differences in the meiotic transmission of newly acquired DNA methylation marks. In support of this hypothesis, most of the stress-associated methylation changes in leaves were largely absent in mature male gametes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that environmentally directed epigenetic marks are more efficiently reset in male rather than in female gametes. Indeed, not only do male gametes undergo an active reprogramming of DNA methylation at transposon sequences by the DNA glycosylase DME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borges et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ibarra et al., 2012</xref>), but also at stress-dependent DNA methylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, the enhanced tolerance to hyperosmotic stress in progeny of stressed <italic>dme</italic>-6 plants implicates DNA demethylation both in the active reprogramming of TEs and in the resetting of environmentally-directed epigenetic changes in male gametes. The male transmission of stress-associated adaptive responses is under the strict control of DME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Although the precise mechanism of DME in resetting HS-DMRs is unknown, it may be linked to the movement of RNA to sperm cells from the surrounding vegetative cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martinez et al., 2016</xref>). Why male and female gametes should differ in their ability to reset newly acquired epigenetic marks remains an enigma. One explanation is that female gametes reside on the mother plant where they are eventually fertilised by sperm from pollen that may have travelled a great distance from its male progenitor to produce seed. Given that seed dispersal usually occurs at a short distance from the mother, a solely maternal transmission of the newly acquired epigenetic marks would be an efficient way of retaining only the most relevant parental stress-associated adaptive responses in the progeny.</p><p>Our study has revealed that environmentally-induced priming responses involve DNA (de)methylation pathways that control the extent to which acquired epigenetic states are inherited and maintained in successive generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Previous studies have focused on these pathways because they mediate global stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhu, 2009</xref>). We now provide compelling evidence that stress can specifically alter methylation at the adjacent sequences of several key stress-response regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), a process that is mediated by the RdDM and DNA demethylation pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Targeted studies have revealed that some TEs proximal to upstream regions and sensitive to methylation changes directed by hyperosmotic stress have regulatory roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) and are associated with quantitative traits and adaptive behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baxter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busoms et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, both DNA methylation and demethylation activities are also tightly regulated by the action of adjacent upstream TEs that act as an epigenetic sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Williams et al., 2015</xref>). The epigenetic regulation of HS-DMRs is not always associated with upstream regulatory sequences and sense transcription; instead we found that they are preferentially associated with the transcription of antisense lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Although the functions of these HS-DMR-associated non-coding transcripts are largely unknown, antisense lncRNAs have been implicated in directing chromatin changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heo and Sung, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Swiezewski et al., 2009</xref>), and thereby in influencing transcription, splicing and transcript stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bardou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borsani et al., 2005</xref>). In this study,antisense lncRNAs were shown to be regulated by epigenetically labile control elements sensitive to stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Methylation changes in these genome regions could modulate transcription factor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhong et al., 2013</xref>) or chromatin regulatory loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariel et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13546.027</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Working model for stress-dependent epigenetic regulation of <italic>CNI1</italic>.</title><p>In wild type, demethylation of a DMR in response to hyperosmotic stress stimulates lncRNA expression (<italic>CNI1-AS1</italic>), which in turn causes downregulation of <italic>CNI1</italic> expression by an unknown mechanism.

Reverse transcription used At5g27420_ant, PP2AA3 Reverse and GAPDH Reverse oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 7</xref>) in the same reaction with SuperScriptIII Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). qPCR reactions used At5g27420 Forward and At5g27420 Reverse primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 7</xref>) following the same conditions described for the sense reactions. These experiments were performed using six technical replicates for each reaction.

PCR reactions were performed in duplicate and RT-minus controls were included to confirm absence of genomic DNA contamination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Bisulfite sequencing</title><p>For somatic tissue, rosette leaves were pooled from 10 plants for each treatment group. For male gamete analysis, sperm and vegetative nuclei were collected from 100 plants for each treatment group. gDNA was extracted from leaf samples with the DNAeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen), and from sperm and vegetative nuclei with MasterPureDNA Purification Kit (Epicentre). DNA libraries were generated using the Illumina TruSeq Nano kit (Illumina, CA, USA). DNA was sheared to 350 bp. The bisulfite treatment step using the Epitect Plus DNA Bisulfite Conversion Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was inserted after the adaptor ligation; incubation in the thermal cycler was repeated once before clean-up. After clean-up of the bisulfite conversion reaction, library enrichment was done using Kapa Hifi Uracil+ DNA polymerase (Kapa Biosystems, MA, USA). Libraries were sequenced with 2 x 101 bp paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument, with conventional gDNA libraries in control lanes for base calling calibration. Seven to eight libraries with different indexing adapters were pooled in one lane. For image analysis we used Illumina RTA 1.13.48.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Processing and alignment of bisulfite-converted reads</title><p>The procedure followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2011</xref>). In brief, the SHORE pipeline v0.9.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ossowski et al., 2008</xref>) was used to trim and quality-filter the reads. Reads with more than 5 (or 2) bases in the first 25 (or 12) positions with a base quality score of below 5 were discarded. Reads were trimmed to the right-most occurrence of two adjacent bases with quality values of at least 5. Trimmed reads shorter than 40 bases were discarded. Reads were then aligned against the Col-0 reference genome sequence using GenomeMapper implemented in SHORE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schneeberger et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Identification of methylated sites and differentially methylated positions (DMPs)</title><p>We used published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2011</xref>). The number of covered and methylated sites for each sample as well as the false methylation frequencies retrieved from read mappings against the chloroplast sequence can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. On average, 40.7 million cytosines were covered by at least 3 reads and with a quality score above 25 in more than half of the samples. Of these, 7.2 million cytosines were methylated in at least one sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 8</xref>). For DMP calling, we modified the approach from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2011</xref>), without removing sites classified as differentially methylated between replicates. We applied Fisher’s Exact test for all pairwise sample comparisons on cytosine sites with a methylation frequency difference to another sample of at least 30%. We used the same <italic>P</italic> value correction scheme as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Identification of methylated regions (MRs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs)</title><p>We first identified MRs in each sample separately using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagmann et al., 2015</xref>). MRs of replicates were merged into a common set of MRs. Whenever different samples were treated as a replicate group (e.g. control and salt-treated samples), their MRs were merged into a common set. Regions that showed statistically significant methylation differences between at least two sets of strains were identified as DMRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagmann et al., 2015</xref>). In brief, segmentations across the genomes of every sample served to set breakpoints of start and end coordinates of all predicted MRs. Each combination of coordinates in this set defined a segment to perform the test for differential methylation in all pairwise comparisons of the strains, if at least one strain was in a high methylation state throughout this whole segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagmann et al., 2015</xref>). Per pairwise comparison, between 30,000 and 50,000 segments were tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagmann et al., 2015</xref>). For tests within generations, we grouped P0 control, P1 control and P2 control samples as 'non-stressed'; P0 salt-treated samples as 'stressed'; P1 samples derived from salt-treated P0 plants as 'stressed-P1'; and P2 samples derived from salt-treated P0 plants as 'stressed-P2'. Tests for DMRs were then carried out between these four groups. In addition we separately tested without the respective remaining groups for 'non-stressed' vs. 'stressed', 'stressed' vs. 'stressed P1', 'stressed' vs. 'stressed P2', and 'stressed P1' vs 'stressed P2'. This latter step was done to assess the number of DMRs directly identified between two groups, without multiple testing correction for comparisons with and between other groups. DMRs from the MA lines were taken from a previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagmann et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Mapping to genomic elements</title><p>We used the TAIR10 annotation for genes, exons, introns and untranslated regions; transposon annotation was according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Slotte et al. (2013)</xref>. Positions and regions were hierarchically assigned to annotated elements in the order CDS &gt; intron &gt; 5’ UTR &gt; 3’ UTR &gt; transposon &gt; intergenic space. We defined as intergenic positions and regions those that were not annotated either as CDS, intron, UTR or transposon. Each position was assigned to the corresponding element that contained it. DMRs were assigned to annotated elements by basepair, i.e. each position in the DMR was assigned in the above-mentioned order. A DMR can stretch over several annotated elements. We tested the overlap of DMRs with other DMRs or with genes using bedtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>), either requesting a direct overlap or an overlap within a window of <italic>n</italic> bp downstream and upstream of the regions. For overlap between DMRs and TEs, we required either a direct overlap or an overlap within 2,000 bp windows downstream and upstream of the DMRs. Overlapping TEs were then sorted into their superfamilies according to TAIR nomenclature. The TE profiles for hypo- and hypermethylated DMRs were compared against the expected values taken from the whole genome TE profile. For each TE superfamily the expected values were calculated as: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>Se</italic> is the expected value for that superfamily in that sample (hypo or hyper), <italic>wgs</italic> is the number of transposons of that superfamily in the whole genome, <italic>wgt</italic> is the total number of transposons in the whole genome, and <italic>st</italic> is the total number of transposons in this sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Gene expression and ontology analysis</title><p>For the identification of genes regulated by HS-DMRs we first identified the genes within 2 kb upstream or downstream of DMRs and analysed their expression in shoots or roots exposed to hyperosmotic stress using AtGenExpress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kilian et al., 2007</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Sheila McCormick, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript investigates the potential for environmental stress, in this case hyperosmotic treatment, to cause heritable changes in phenotypes via epigenetic information, in this case DNA cytosine methylation, using the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. The role of epigenetic information in mediating such forms of 'soft inheritance' is of great general interest, though relatively few clear examples have been discovered so far in plants. Indeed, although several recent reports concluded that there is epigenome-mediated transgenerational memory of stress in plants, many of these studies were not rigorous in terms of design or analysis, or focused on effects at complex transgenic loci, the applicability of which to endogenous genes is unclear. By contrast, this study is carefully designed and analyzed. Detailed genetic experiments at the CNI locus support take home messages from the whole genome experiments. Overall, this is an impressive paper but certain key aspects need further clarification and/or experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The key phenotype observed is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; Col-0 plants were grown under control or hyperosmotic stress for five generations, then unstressed P1 or P2 generation progeny were tested for salt tolerance to assess transgenerational inheritance of stress adaptation. The assay used is survival rate of progeny seedlings grown on salt. Example survival plates should be shown to provide clear phenotypic evidence of the stress adaptation. Please also replot the figures in 1B (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) with the same Y-axis values, ideally 0-100%, which would make it easier to compare plots. A clear increase in progeny survival is seen in P1 generations, with effects lost in P2.</p><p>2) There are actually very few stress-induced DNA methylation changes that are transmitted to progeny (i.e., 0 HS-DMRs overlap between all three generations, and only 35 are present in two generations – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This should be made clearer in the summary and/or title, instead of focusing solely on the exceptional cases of inheritance of stress-induced methylation changes.</p><p>3) These phenotypes were then tested in a variety of epigenetic mutants that influence DNA methylation establishment, maintenance or removal. A subset are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, with a greater number in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. As showing genetic dependency of these effects makes this very convincing we suggest that the complete mutant set be shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Some of the mutants have different survival phenotypes in the control treatments – were statistical tests performed for these comparisons, e.g. Col vs. <italic>cmt3</italic>?</p><p>4) The authors then perform reciprocal crossing experiments to show that changes in methylation are differential via the male and female germ line; i.e. transgenerational adaptation is more strong in maternal than paternal crosses, but they further show that stress memory can be transmitted paternally if <italic>dme</italic> is mutated, and that there are almost no methylation differences between the VN and SC of control and hyperosmotic-treated plants. The implication is that the action of DME in the VN is responsible for erasing acquired methylation marks in wild type plants. Ideally this would be supported by data showing increased methylation at HS-DMR regions in the sperm cells of stressed <italic>dme</italic> plants. In the absence of these data the authors should compare the HS-DMRs with <italic>dme</italic> DMRs defined by Ibarra et al. Is there significant overlap?</p><p>5) It's surprising that both RdDM establishment mutants (<italic>drm2, rdr2, nrpd1a</italic>) and non-CG maintenance mutants (<italic>cmt3</italic>) and demethylation mutants (<italic>rdd, ros1</italic>) have the same phenotype with regard to survival under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> – progeny of stressed plants show no enhanced survival) given their opposing molecular functions. This could potentially be explained by reduced ROS1 activity in RdDM mutants, but ROS1 expression is not reduced in <italic>cmt3</italic>. The authors must reconcile or provide possible explanations for how these mutants, which would have quite different/opposite effects on DNA methylation, cause the same abolition of transgenerational stress inheritance.</p><p>6) To connect changes between DNA methylation triggered by stress and specific genes the authors then looked for genes that were in proximity to DMRs and which exhibit changes in transcription during stress treatment. Two such genes are analysed in detail. <italic>MYB20</italic> which shows hypermethylation caused by salt stress, and <italic>CNI1</italic> which is hypomethylated. Mutants are analysed, the results again somewhat confusing, as for <italic>MYB20</italic> the <italic>rdd</italic> and RdDM mutants both show reduced expression, yet should be having opposite effects on DNA methylation. An impressive experiment is performed using Cas9 that eliminates that <italic>CNI1</italic> DMR and alters its regulation in response to stress – perhaps <italic>CNI1</italic> should be made more of a focus in the manuscript and certainly should be described in the Abstract.</p><p>7) An extensive bisulfite sequencing experiment is then performed on the Col samples and differential methylation analysis performed both for individual cytosines (DMPs) and regions (DMRs). This section was quite hard to follow and to extract the 'take home message'. Statements like 'small but noticeable effect' and 'discovered our DMR regions were present.… but they were below our statistical cut-off' do not give the reader confidence. Surely, the point of a cut-off is that regions below that should not be considered? Is it worth reporting such effects, which seem more or less anecdotal? The complexity of this section is compounded by the fact that stochastic methylation change is observed between generations, as reported by the Weigel and Ecker labs. However, the authors do a good job of disentangling these effects from those caused by the stress. Gain of non-CG methylation at DMRs is the strongest effect caused by the salt stress, so that should be stated more clearly and earlier. The DMP analysis does not seem that relevant, as there is very little evidence that single methylation polymorphisms are biologically meaningful, and thus could be deleted from the manuscript.</p><p>8) Correlations are made between changes in DNA methylation and H3K27 methylation seen in a previously published study. How comparable are the stress treatments between that study and this, in addition to the tissues profiled? It is not clear what mechanistic relationship is being proposed. Is it possible to test P1/P2 transgenerational stress responses in mutants in the H3K27 pathway? This section didn't really add much to an already complex and data-rich paper.</p><p>9) Throughout the text it needs to be made clearer what experiments the authors performed and what experiments are from published data and were not performed under the same growth regime. Examples of this include the chromatin profiling from hyperosmotic stressed plants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and transcriptional profiling upon hyperosmotic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, the reasons why the salt treatments vary for different experiments should be explained – i.e. 25 or 75 mM for the initial experiments, for 6 weeks, but then 200 mM for the germination test but 150 mM for the survival test (for 14 days each), Chlorophyll content used 100 mM for 5 weeks, and the RNA analysis used 125 mM for 5 weeks. The authors might also mention which, if any, of these levels are considered reasonable for salt stress in nature.</p><p>10) Certain classes of transposons are identified as being enriched in DMRs associated with salt treatment. The locus-specific blow ups in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> were convincing, but the authors should consider providing some other specific loci and transposons that serve as representatives of the changes observed, alongside the summary graphs.</p><p>11) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, gain of non-CG methylation appears to be the strongest effect. Is the model that this is stress triggered de novo DNA methylation? The authors should consider repeating part of this experiment in a <italic>drm1drm2</italic> mutant, which should abolish these changes if they are mediated via the canonical RdDM pathway. Demonstrating the genetic dependence of this effect on de novo methylation would strengthen the argument.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13546.043</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The key phenotype observed is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; Col-0 plants were grown under control or hyperosmotic stress for five generations, then unstressed P1 or P2 generation progeny were tested for salt tolerance to assess transgenerational inheritance of stress adaptation.

Specifically, in title and Abstract, we have added “a limited set of regions”.</p><p><italic>3) These phenotypes were then tested in a variety of epigenetic mutants that influence DNA methylation establishment, maintenance or removal. A subset are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, with a greater number in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. As showing genetic dependency of these effects makes this very convincing we suggest that the complete mutant set be shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</italic></p><p>We have now included all the data for the different mutants tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>Some of the mutants have different survival phenotypes in the control treatments – were statistical tests performed for these comparisons, e.g. Col vs. cmt3?</italic></p><p>Because we are focusing on assessing only the transmission of adaptive stress responses in different epigenetic mutant backgrounds, we performed statistical tests only between treated versus untreated plants of the same genetic background.</p><p><italic>4) The authors then perform reciprocal crossing experiments to show that changes in methylation are differential via the male and female germ line; i.e. transgenerational adaptation is more strong in maternal than paternal crosses, but they further show that stress memory can be transmitted paternally if dme is mutated, and that there are almost no methylation differences between the VN and SC of control and hyperosmotic-treated plants. The implication is that the action of DME in the VN is responsible for erasing acquired methylation marks in wild type plants. Ideally this would be supported by data showing increased methylation at HS-DMR regions in the sperm cells of stressed dme plants.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this experiment would be very informative, but it would take two consecutive generations of hyperosmotic stress to generate this material. In addition, because <italic>dme-6</italic> plants can only be grown in heterozygosis, pollen samples will contain a mixture of wild-type and mutant sperm cells and vegetative nuclei, which will make the methylation analysis challenging. We hope that our results are sufficiently convincing even without these additional data, which we agree would be very interesting.</p><p><italic>In the absence of these data the authors should compare the HS-DMRs with dme DMRs defined by Ibarra et al. Is there significant overlap?</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have re-analyzed the <italic>dme</italic> BS-seq data from Ibarra et al. 2012. We compared DMRs present in <italic>dme</italic> sperm and vegetative nuclei to HS-DMRs and as control we also compared to non-DMRs. We found that both HS-DMRs and non-DMRs were similarly affected in <italic>dme</italic> pollen, indicating that genomic loci affected by salt are only a fraction of the total loci that are under the control of DME in the male germ line. These results are now displayed in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) It's surprising that both RdDM establishment mutants (drm2, rdr2, nrpd1a) and non-CG maintenance mutants (cmt3) and demethylation mutants (rdd, ros1) have the same phenotype with regard to survival under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> – progeny of stressed plants show no enhanced survival) given their opposing molecular functions. This could potentially be explained by reduced ROS1 activity in RdDM mutants, but ROS1 expression is not reduced in cmt3. The authors must reconcile or provide possible explanations for how these mutants, which would have quite different/opposite effects on DNA methylation, cause the same abolition of transgenerational stress inheritance.</italic></p><p>Adaptation to abiotic stress is a complex trait that is not only regulated epigenetically, but involves many other factors (e.g. immediate transcriptional responses, RNA stability, splicing, metabolites) (Crisp et al. 2016). Because we do not precisely know the effects that the different DNA methylation mutants tested have on these other factors, it is difficult to explain fully the adaptive phenotypes observed. We have included these points in the manuscript as suggested by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>6) To connect changes between DNA methylation triggered by stress and specific genes the authors then looked for genes that were in proximity to DMRs and which exhibit changes in transcription during stress treatment. Two such genes are analysed in detail. MYB20 which shows hypermethylation caused by salt stress, and CNI1 which is hypomethylated. Mutants are analysed, the results again somewhat confusing, as for MYB20 the rdd and RdDM mutants both show reduced expression, yet should be having opposite effects on DNA methylation. An impressive experiment is performed using Cas9 that eliminates that CNI1 DMR and alters its regulation in response to stress – perhaps CNI1 should be made more of a focus in the manuscript and certainly should be described in the Abstract.</italic> </p><p>We have included <italic>CNI1</italic> in the Abstract and described it in more detail in the text.</p><p><italic>7) An extensive bisulfite sequencing experiment is then performed on the Col samples and differential methylation analysis performed both for individual cytosines (DMPs) and regions (DMRs). This section was quite hard to follow and to extract the 'take home message'. Statements like 'small but noticeable effect' and 'discovered our DMR regions were present.… but they were below our statistical cut-off' do not give the reader confidence. Surely, the point of a cut-off is that regions below that should not be considered? Is it worth reporting such effects, which seem more or less anecdotal? The complexity of this section is compounded by the fact that stochastic methylation change is observed between generations, as reported by the Weigel and Ecker labs. However, the authors do a good job of disentangling these effects from those caused by the stress. Gain of non-CG methylation at DMRs is the strongest effect caused by the salt stress, so that should be stated more clearly and earlier.</italic></p><p>We have stated that non-‐CG methylation is strongly affected later in the text because previous studies have concluded that most methylation changes induced by hyperosmotic stress affect CG methylation. We have modified this section to make this point clearer.</p><p><italic>The DMP analysis does not seem that relevant, as there is very little evidence that single methylation polymorphisms are biologically meaningful, and thus could be deleted from the manuscript.</italic></p><p>We completely agree that the DMP analysis in almost all methylation studies has shown that single-‐site polymorphisms in plants are of limited biological relevance. Here, we wanted to make these points clear to show that the stress-‐related signal was much stronger for DMRs than for DMPs. We hereby also illustrate why a previous study, analyzing a similar dataset of single cytosines, came to the conclusion that salt stress altered methylation at CG sites (Jiang et al. 2014). As suggested by reviewers, we have reduced this section to a single paragraph and a single supplementary figure. Therefore, we would like to keep these data as they add significant value to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>8) Correlations are made between changes in DNA methylation and H3K27 methylation seen in a previously published study. How comparable are the stress treatments between that study and this, in addition to the tissues profiled? It is not clear what mechanistic relationship is being proposed. Is it possible to test P1/P2 transgenerational stress responses in mutants in the H3K27 pathway? This section didn't really add much to an already complex and data-rich paper.</italic> </p><p>It is possible to test the transgenerational stress responses in mutants affecting the H3K27 pathway, although the signal can be bit weaker with some mutants in this pathway having severe growth phenotypes. Nevertheless, we believe the association between methylation and H3K27me3 deposition at HS-DMRs will be an exciting area of future investigation.</p><p><italic>9) Throughout the text it needs to be made clearer what experiments the authors performed and what experiments are from published data and were not performed under the same growth regime. Examples of this include the chromatin profiling from hyperosmotic stressed plants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and transcriptional profiling upon hyperosmotic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, the reasons why the salt treatments vary for different experiments should be explained – i.e. 25 or 75 mM for the initial experiments, for 6 weeks, but then 200 mM for the germination test but 150 mM for the survival test (for 14 days each), Chlorophyll content used 100 mM for 5 weeks, and the RNA analysis used 125 mM for 5 weeks. The authors might also mention which, if any, of these levels are considered reasonable for salt stress in nature.</italic></p><p>We have included references to all the public datasets used. The levels of salt employed for the different experiments have been explained in the Methods section. In nature, the concentration of salt in soil could range from 5-‐600 nM but we decided to use treatments (25-‐75 mM) already shown to be efficient in inducing adaptive responses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Sani et al., 2014).</p><p><italic>10) Certain classes of transposons are identified as being enriched in DMRs associated with salt treatment. The locus-specific blow ups in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> were convincing, but the authors should consider providing some other specific loci and transposons that serve as representatives of the changes observed, alongside the summary graphs.</italic></p><p>Our detailed data analyses will be made publicly available through a web browser (EPIC-CoGe, supported by Araport and iPlant; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genomevolution.org/r/939v">http://genomevolution.org/r/939v</ext-link>). Thus, readers will be able to look up genomic loci of their choice and we avoid including additional supplemental data to an already data-rich manuscript.</p><p><italic>11) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, gain of non-CG methylation appears to be the strongest effect. Is the model that this is stress triggered de novo DNA methylation? The authors should consider repeating part of this experiment in a drm1drm2 mutant, which should abolish these changes if they are mediated via the canonical RdDM pathway. Demonstrating the genetic dependence of this effect on de novo methylation would strengthen the argument.</italic></p><p>We have performed this experiment. Salt-‐induced DMRs (in wild-type) do not show hyper-methylation in <italic>drm1 drm2</italic> mutants, supporting the notion that hyper-‐methylation depends on the RdDM pathway. Results have been included in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
