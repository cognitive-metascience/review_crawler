A consensus pause sequence that acts on RNA polymerases (RNAPs) from bacteria to mammals halts RNAP in an elemental paused state from which longer-lived pauses can arise. Although the structural foundations of pauses prolonged by backtracking or nascent RNA hairpins are recognized, the fundamental mechanism of the elemental pause is less well-defined. Here we report a mechanistic dissection that establishes the elemental pause signal (<italic>i</italic>) is multipartite; (<italic>ii</italic>) causes a modest conformational shift that puts γ-proteobacterial RNAP in an off-pathway state in which template base loading but not RNA translocation is inhibited; and (<italic>iii</italic>) allows RNAP to enter pretranslocated and one-base-pair backtracked states easily even though the half-translocated state observed in paused cryo-EM structures rate-limits pause escape. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for the elemental pause and a framework to understand how pausing is modulated by sequence, cellular conditions, and regulators.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40981.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The information a cell needs to create a specific protein is encoded in a sequence of precisely organized DNA ‘letters’. Unlocking these instructions requires an enzyme known as RNA polymerase (RNAP for short), which reads the DNA segment and faithfully copies the information to form a strand of RNA. This molecule then relays the genetic message to the machinery that pieces together a protein.</p><p>An RNAP works by reading a DNA segment and building a matching RNA strand at the same time. The enzyme clamps onto DNA, and threads it letter-by-letter through its reading and building site. For each DNA letter that RNAP reads, the enzyme adds a matching RNA building block onto the budding RNA strand, with DNA and RNA segments then being moved away from the active site.</p><p>However, RNAP does not usually read a whole gene in one go: there are several ‘pause sites’ in the sequence where it stops and waits for instruction. If the cell needs this protein immediately, it sends signals that encourage RNAP to carry on and even ignore further pause sites; if the protein is not needed at the time, the enzyme is instructed to terminate the RNA-making process. This mechanism is present in species across the tree of life, and is key so that a cell fine-tunes its protein production.</p><p>Once RNAP has stopped, several well-studied mechanisms kick in to stabilize the enzyme in its waiting position. Yet, it is still unclear how the enzyme, which normally reads 50 to 100 DNA letters per second, is able to come to a halt in the first place.</p><p>To dissect this mechanism, Saba et al. made targeted changes to RNAP or to the DNA segment it was reading, and then closely monitored the movement of the protein under these conditions. The experiments revealed that when RNAP interacts with multiple signals in the DNA, such as particular sequences just before or inside the segment being read, the enzyme changes its structure slightly, and loosens its grip on DNA and RNA. With the enzyme’s new shape, the RNA strand is ready to be extended, but the DNA segment is trapped and cannot move into the reading site. This prevents a new RNA letter to be added onto the growing strand, stopping RNAP in its tracks.</p><p>Knowing how RNAP pauses may help researchers to understand how its activity is regulated, for example by antibiotics. Ultimately, this could allow us to manipulate the activity of the enzyme so that we could control how and when a cell creates specific proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM38660</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Landick</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical analyses of transcription complexes, including kinetic studies and probes of translocational and conformational states, establish the elemental mechanism of pausing, which underlies regulation of gene expression in all organisms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the first step in gene expression, transcription by RNA polymerase (RNAP) at ~30 nt/s or faster is interrupted by ≥1 s pause events every 100–200 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Landick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).

An increasingly accepted view is that these initial interactions interrupt the nucleotide addition cycle by promoting entry of RNAP into a state termed the elemental pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Landick, 2006</xref>), creating an elemental paused elongation complex (ePEC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The ePEC can then rearrange into long-lived pause states by backtracking (reverse translocation of RNA and DNA), by pause hairpin (PH) formation in the RNA exit channel that alters RNAP conformation (at least in bacteria), or by interactions of diffusible regulators with the ePEC. Recent cryoEM structures of artificially assembled PECs suggest the ePEC is half-translocated with a tilted RNA–DNA hybrid, meaning that the RNA but not the DNA is translocated and the next template base is still sequestered in the downstream DNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vos et al., 2018</xref>).

Although earlier work establishes contributions of multiple pause signal components (upstream RNA, RNA–DNA hybrid, downstream fork junction, and downstream DNA) to hairpin-stabilized pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan and Landick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 1997</xref>), the definition of the consensus elemental pause signal has varied and it is unknown if the discrete components affect a common step in the elemental pause mechanism.</p><p>Additionally, questions remain about the structure and properties of the ePEC. A longstanding debate is whether the ePEC is an on-pathway state unable to translocate DNA or RNA in a largely unchanged RNAP due to the thermodynamic properties of the RNA–DNA scaffold (i.e., a pretranslocated pause; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bochkareva et al., 2012</xref>) or if it represents an offline state generated by conformational rearrangement of RNAP that forms in kinetic competition with the on-pathway steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Landick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herbert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kireeva and Kashlev, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Imashimizu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2018a</xref>).

We first asked if the pause signal always causes ECs to bifurcate into paused and rapidly elongating (bypass) fractions. We measured C17 pause RNA as a function of time when radiolabeled G16 ECs were extended with 100 µM each CTP and GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E,F</xref>). Most ECs (80% at 37°C) entered a paused state (lifetime 5 s; <italic>a</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref>), whereas some ECs (20%) transcribed past C17 rapidly (lifetime 0.1 s; <italic>bypass</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref>). Invariably, a minor ePEC population (typically 15%) escaped more slowly (lifetime 100 s; <italic>b</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref>), requiring double-exponential fitting of the escape rate. Pause bypass was evident from y-intercepts &lt;1 in the double-exponentials fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, the amounts of slow ePEC and bypass fractions varied among RNAP preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This kinetic malleability of ePECs differed from the reproducible kinetics typically observed for hairpin-stabilized pauses like the <italic>his</italic>PEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Toulokhonov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyzer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2018a</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that the ePEC is an offline state formed in competition with bypass nucleotide addition (i.e., in a branched kinetic mechanism; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), we performed three additional tests. First, we asked whether the fraction of ECs entering the ePEC state increased if GTP (the NTP required for pause escape) were withheld to allow more time for ePEC formation. Unlike for the hairpin-stabilized <italic>his</italic>PEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Toulokhonov et al., 2007</xref>), halting ECs at C17 for 15 s before GTP addition did not change the 10–20% EC that bypassed the pause (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). However, the bypass fraction was shifted from ~22% at 100 µM GTP to ~7% at 10 µM GTP, suggesting that GTP can affect a partition between the on-pathway EC and offline elemental pause state. Second, using data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larson et al., 2014</xref>, we found that the bypass fraction varied but appeared to plateau at high GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Because extrapolation of bypass from bi-exponential fits is an approximation, we next used numerical integration of rate equations as a third test to ask if reaction progress curves are better fit by an unbranched or branched kinetic mechanism at saturating GTP (10 mM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,F</xref>; Materials and methods). The unbranched (on-pathway pause) mechanism did not fit the data well, thus favoring a branched mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>We also used kinetic modeling to reexamine the proposed on-pathway pausing reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bochkareva et al., 2012</xref>. Using their optimal pause scaffold sequence, we replicated the reported high-efficiency pausing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). However, this scaffold positions the downstream DNA end (+17) within RNAP, so that forward translocation reduces downstream DNA-RNAP interaction. Consistent with a prior finding that downstream DNA truncation increases pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyzer et al., 2007</xref>), pause bypass was readily detected when the downstream DNA end was positioned outside RNAP as in natural ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). This result highlights why highly efficient pauses, even if they isomerize to an offline state, may appear to be on-pathway when bypass falls below ~5%. We confirmed the branched kinetic pause mechanism on the Bochkareva <italic>et al</italic>. scaffold at saturating GTP by kinetic modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

We wondered if the slow pause population could be explained by backtracking, an EC conformational change, or a subpopulation of chemically altered RNAP. Variation of the slow ePEC fraction among RNAP preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) seemed to favor a chemically altered subpopulation. We found that absence of neither the ω subunit nor the αCTDs changed the slow ePEC fraction (not shown). More definitively, transcription through tandem consensus pause sequences revealed formation of the slow fraction from all RNAPs arriving at the second pause site rather than a chemically altered, slow subpopulation of RNAP that would be filtered out by the first pause site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We next used GreA- or GreB-induced cleavage to ask if the minor slow ePEC fraction was backtracked. Either or both GreA or GreB had little effect on pause lifetimes, even though 2-nt cleavage products, indicative of a 1 bp backtracked state, appeared much faster than the rate of ePEC escape and 3-nt cleavage products, indicative of a 2 bp backtracked state, were detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B,D</xref>). Thus, even though the scaffold structure disfavors ≥2 bp backtracking due to a –12 rU–dG mismatch, ePECs may shift from the 1 bp backtracked state to ≥2 bp backtracked states, at least in the presence of GreA, GreB, or both. We next tested the effect on both pausing and intrinsic cleavage of a −11rU-dC mismatch that would disfavor even 1 bp backtracking using an RNAP that formed a high level of slow fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,K,J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E,F</xref>). The −11rU-dC mismatch virtually eliminated ≥2 nt cleavage indicative of backtracking, reduced 1-nt cleavage indicative of the pretranslocated register, and modestly decreased the slow pause fraction.</p><p>The relative ease with which ePECs entered backtracked registers is notable given the half-translocated state observed in ePEC cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vos et al., 2018</xref>).

Our GreA/B and intrinsic cleavage results establish that slow escape from a 1 bp backtrack state explains neither the major nor the minor pause fractions even though the 1 bp backtrack state is accessible. A parsimonious explanation is that the ePEC readily equilibrates among several active-site states, including half-translocated, pretranslocated, and backtracked, with the half-translocated state being the dominant species in which the kinetic block to pause escape is manifest. The slow pause state may be backtracked by ≥2 bp (since 0.007 s<sup>−1</sup> 3-nt cleavage is close to the 0.002 s<sup>−1</sup> escape rate; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>), but its persistence in the −11U mutant suggests other changes to the ePEC must also contribute (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The elemental pause signal is multipartite</title><p>Available NET-seq data have been interpreted to suggest an elemental pause signal involving just the upstream fork-junction (usFJ) and downstream fork-junction (dsFJ) sequences or a multipartite signal that additionally depends on the hybrid (Hyb) and downstream DNA (dsDNA) sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vvedenskaya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Imashimizu et al., 2015</xref>).

In this assay, the fluorescent guanine analog 6-methylisoxanthopterin (6-MI) is located in the template DNA (usFJ) or nontemplate DNA (dsFJ) such that an adjacent guanine unstacks from 6-MI upon translocation of the hybrid or the dsDNA; this unstacking increases 6-MI fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We compared translocation of the hybrid or the dsDNA leading to increased 6-MI fluorescence on ePEC scaffolds to a control scaffold previously found to translocate rapidly upon 3′-CMP addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malinen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hein et al., 2014</xref>).

Alternatively, –10 dG may unstack in our assay at 37°C but the pretranslocated and half-translocated hybrids may be in dynamic equilibrium (consistent with intrinsic hydrolysis readout; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). These results also confirm that most ePECs are not backtracked, which would not unquench 6-MI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

These data confirm that the dsDNA in the ePEC does not translocate. Since the dsDNA in the ePEC did not translocate, we used GTP binding to 3′dCMP-ePEC and control 3′dCMP-EC to assess translocation propensity.

RNAP interactions with the usFJ, Hyb, dsFJ, and dsDNA contribute to the key barrier to pause escape: template-base loading from a half-translocated state that involves clamp loosening and βR542 interactions.

When RNAP encounters an elemental pause signal, a modest shift in the mobile modules of RNAP that are in contact with RNA and DNA (the clamp, shelf, lid, rudder, switch regions, lobe, protrusion, fork loop 2, and βDloopII) occurs during translocation. This shift creates or reinforces an energetic barrier to completion of translocation from a half-translocated state in which the RNA transcript has translocated but the DNA template has not, corresponding to the tilted hybrid intermediate observed in cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vos et al., 2018</xref>). Comparison of ePEC and posttranslocated EC cryoEM structures reveals movements that slightly reposition these key mobile modules (compare green EC to magenta ePEC positions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

At least at the consensus pause, the half-translocated, pretranslocated, and 1 bp backtracked states equilibrate but these equilibria are biased toward the half-translocated state. This bias explains why we observed a fast translocation signal for the RNA:DNA hybrid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and why the half-translocated intermediate forms in reconstituted ePECs analyzed by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vos et al., 2018</xref>).

It is possible that GreA shifts the bias toward the 1 bp backtracked state, but mass action ‘pulling’ of ePECs into the 1 bp backtracked state is a sufficient explanation. Because the cleaved ePEC re-encounters a strong pause signal, we observed little effect of GreA cleavage on pause lifetime. Our Gre A/B cleavage data also suggest a much slower entry into ≥2 bp backtracked states, which may be related to the minor but variable slow fraction of ePECs (see below).</p><p>This multistate model of the elemental pause predicts that the pretranslocated and 1 bp backtracked states can contribute significantly to pause lifetime at some pause sequences despite being in rapid equilibrium with the half-translocated intermediate in which the kinetic barrier to pause escape (template-base loading) is manifest. If an ePEC spends only 50% of the time half-translocated and 50% pre-translocated or backtracked, then the pause dwell time will increase by a factor of ~2 relative to an ePEC that spends &gt;95% of the time half-translocated. This is true despite the rapid equilibria because only the half-translocated intermediate can escape the pause and the other states diminish its effective concentration. Shifting to 25% or 10% half-translocated would lengthen the pause by factors of ~3 or~9, respectively, for the same reason. Thus, an elemental pause signal that favors the 1 bp backtracked state, although different from the consensus signal we studied, would increase pause lifetime. These behaviors have been observed in vitro directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gabizon et al., 2018</xref>) or by biasing ePECs using opposing force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galburt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dangkulwanich et al., 2013</xref>), as well as in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Imashimizu et al., 2015</xref>). Further, multiple locations of the 1 bp backtracked RNA 3′ nucleotide have been observed or proposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sekine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sosunova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Turtola et al., 2018</xref>). From a mechanistic standpoint, possible entry into multiple 1 bp backtracked states means that their contribution to pause dwell times may be both increased and highly variable as a function of sequence. The multistate elemental pause model makes the distinction between backtrack pausing and non-backtrack pausing a matter of degree rather than a clear-cut division.</p><p>Our results do not address the important question of whether the half-translocated state also is a significant kinetic intermediate during on-pathway nucleotide addition, although other studies suggest this possibility. Translocation can affect overall elongation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Imashimizu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gabizon et al., 2018</xref>), and a half-translocated intermediate has been directly observed during <italic>in crystallo</italic> nucleotide addition by RNA-dependent RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shu and Gong, 2016</xref>). On-pathway translocation may proceed <italic>via</italic> initial RNA translocation then template DNA loading; the second step may be naturally slower at a pause signal, allowing time for formation of the ePEC conformation in which template-base loading becomes strongly inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gabizon et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The multistate model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) has important regulatory implications. Just as different regulators can exert distinct effects on the multistep mechanism of transcription initiation by stabilizing or destabilizing different intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hubin et al., 2017</xref>), the existence of multiple elemental pause states affords multiple targets for regulators even when these intermediates are in equilibrium. For example, ppGpp is known to stimulate pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kingston et al., 1981</xref>) and to promote backtracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamarthapu et al., 2016</xref>); ppGpp could stimulate pausing by stabilizing a pretranslocated or backtracked PEC. Further, ≥1 bp backtracking may become more significant for other sequence contexts, conditions, or RNAPs (e.g., eukaryotic RNAPII).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Multipartite RNAP contacts, not RNA-DNA energetics alone, drive elemental pausing</title><p>Our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) confirm that, like the hairpin-stabilized <italic>his</italic>PEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 1997</xref>), the elemental pause signal is multipartite and involves significant contributions from the usFJ, hybrid, dsFJ, and dsDNA.

The inhibitory contributions of the usFJ and dsFJ to hybrid unwinding and NTP binding, respectively, have been known since the earliest studies of pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilbert et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aivazashvili et al., 1981</xref>) but alone are inadequate to predict pause strength.</p><p>At least three factors may contribute to underestimation of the importance of hybrid and downstream DNA sequences in pausing. First, the widespread use of sequence logos to represent nucleic acid signals places undue weight on simple, independent interactions and underweights contributions of complex sequence interactions that affect energetics through nucleic-acid conformation or alternative side-chain contacts. Thus, a logo representing information content as single bp can cause complex, multipartite sequences to appear less important (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Although more sophisticated algorithms hold promise to characterize complex, multipartite signals like the elemental pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Siebert and Söding, 2016</xref>), direct analyses of sequence variants remain the most reliable way to define relevant contributions. Direct mutational analyses establish the key contributions of the hybrid and downstream DNA in the elemental pause signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bochkareva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palangat and Landick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Palangat et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Second, using NET-seq to identify a consensus pause signal requires rapid capture of PECs by quick-freezing actively growing cells in liquid N<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Churchman and Weissman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larson et al., 2014</xref>).

However, some studies that detected little if any hybrid or dsDNA contribution recovered cells by centrifugation before freezing, which may allow RNAP to escape all but the strongest pause sites and thus could over-represent contributions of the usFJ and dsFJ components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vvedenskaya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Imashimizu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the hybrid and dsDNA contact multiple RNAP modules (e.g., rudder, switch 2, clamp, <italic>etc</italic>.) and may principally affect the complex and modest conformational rearrangement into the ePEC state. Because this conformation is still incompletely understood, the contributions of the hybrid and dsDNA, which may involve specific duplex conformations, may be difficult to characterize.</p><p>Our findings taken together with earlier demonstrations of usFJ, hybrid, dsFJ, and dsDNA sequences that contribute to pausing should solidify a model of elemental pausing that depends on a multipartite pause signal.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Structure of the elemental pause</title><p>The elemental pause is a distinct offline state, not an on-pathway elongation intermediate. Our study uncovered evidence for a modestly rearranged multistate ePEC in which the clamp is loosened and template-base loading is inhibited as well as a slower ePEC state entered by a minor but variable fraction of ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The lack of effect of rapid GreA cleavage ruled out 1 bp backtracking as an explanation of the slow ePEC state, but the GreA/B experiments could not definitively rule out ≥2 bp backtracking because the maximal ≥3 nt cleavage rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sosunova et al., 2013</xref>) is too close to slow ePEC escape rate. Alternatively or additionally, the slow ePEC state could involve RNAP swiveling, which is observed in the hairpin-stabilized PEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2018b</xref>). Swiveling involves a near-rigid body rotation of the clamp, shelf, SI3, and jaw, and inhibits nucleotide addition by a factor of ~10 by interfering with TL folding. Interestingly, the lifetime of the minor slow ePEC is ~10 times that of the majority ePEC state. Variations in susceptibility to swiveling, ≥2 bp backtracking, or both could explain why the slow fraction varies among RNAP preparations. Further studies will be needed to establish the structure and importance of the slow ePEC fraction, including detection with non-reconstituted transcription complexes or in vivo.</p><p>The multistate model of elemental pausing involving small changes in RNAP conformation and half-translocated, pretranslocated, and multiple 1 bp backtracked states described here will be difficult to test fully using ensemble biochemistry, single-molecule biochemistry, or crystallography. These methods are encumbered by the perturbing effects of probes and experimental configurations, the number of intermediates involved, and the rapid time-scale of their interchange. Time-resolved cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frank, 2017</xref>) promises an attractive approach if methods to distinguish intermediates during particle classification can be developed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21λDE3</td><td>Novagene-EMD Millipore</td><td/><td>expression strain</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>6-MI-containing oligonucleotides</td><td>Fidelity Systems</td><td/><td>see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for sequences</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>DNA and RNA oligos</td><td>Intergrated DNA Technologies (IDT)</td><td/><td>see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for sequences</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Cystamine dihydrochloride</td><td>MP Biomedicals</td><td valign="bottom">Cat# ICN10049205</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">Dithiothreitol (DTT)</td><td>Gold Biotechnology</td><td valign="bottom">Cat# DTT100</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">Iodoacetamide</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat# I6125</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">Heparin, Na salt</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat# H-3393</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">Ribonucleotide triphosphates</td><td>Promega</td><td valign="bottom">Cat# P1221</td><td>grade I-A (181 USP units/mg)</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">Guanosine triphosphate (GTP)</td><td>GE Healthcare</td><td>Cat# 27-2076-01</td><td>Low background flouresence</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">[γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP</td><td>PerkinElmer Life Sciences</td><td>Cat# BLU002Z</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">[α-<sup>32</sup>P]CTP</td><td>PerkinElmer Life Sciences</td><td>Cat# BLU006H</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">[α-<sup>32</sup>P]GTP</td><td>PerkinElmer Life Sciences</td><td>Cat# BLU006H</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">Acrylamide-Bisacrylamide</td><td valign="bottom">Bio-Rad</td><td valign="bottom">Cat# 1610145</td><td>(19:1, 40% solution)</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">ImageJ</td><td valign="bottom">NIH (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>)</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">Kaleidagraph</td><td valign="bottom">Synergy Software</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">Excel</td><td valign="bottom">Microsoft</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">ImageQuant</td><td valign="bottom">GE Healthcare</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">KinTek Explorer v6.1</td><td valign="bottom">KinTek Corp.</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Phast gels</td><td>GE Healthcare</td><td valign="bottom">Cat# 17–067801</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>HiTrap Heparin HP column</td><td>GE Healthcare</td><td>Cat# 17-0406-01</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>HisTrap HP column</td><td>GE Healthcare</td><td>Cat# 17-5247-01</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Streptactin 5 ml High Capacity Column</td><td>IBA</td><td>Cat# 2-1238-001</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and materials</title><p>Plasmids and oligonucleotides are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

ECs, ePECs, and <italic>his</italic> PEC were formed by incubating 1 μM RNAP and scaffold (2 μM, based on RNA) in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 20 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, and 2.5 ug acetylated bovine serum albumin/mL for 15 min at room temperature (RT). For crosslinking reactions with NTP, 3′deoxyECs formed by reaction with 3′dNTP were incubated for 15 min at RT with 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mM GTP or ATP. Next, EC, ePEC, or his-PEC (final RNAP 0.8 uM and scaffold 1.6 uM) were incubated for 60 min with 2.5 mM CSSC and 0.05 mM DTT (E = –0.16) and stopped with 50 mM iodoacetamide. Samples were separated by native PAGE to verify reconstitution efficiency and by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE using 4–15% GE Healthcare PhastGel to quantify formation of crosslinks. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and imaged with a CCD camera. The fraction cross-linked was quantified with ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Pause assays with CPR RNAPs</title><p>For crosslinked CPR transcription assays, nucleic-acid scaffolds containing RNA and template DNA (1:2 ratio of RNA to DNA) were used to reconstitute ePECs or control <italic>his</italic>PECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2018a</xref>. The U15 ePECs containing limiting CPR RNAP (1 μM) were reconstituted on 2 µM scaffold (based on RNA) for 15 min at 37°C in Elongation Buffer (EB; 25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 130 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 0.15 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 25 μg acetylated bovine serum albumin/mL), followed by addition of 6 μM non-template DNA and further incubation for 10 min at 37°C to complete assembly of the transcription complexes. Wild-type RNAP was tested as a control side-by-side with CPR RNAPs. Crosslinking of 1 μM ePECs was performed in the presence of 1 mM cystamine as the oxidant and 0.8 mM DTT, for 15 min at 37°C. An aliquot of the crosslinking reaction was quenched with 15 mM iodoacetamide (final concentration) and analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE to confirm formation of the crosslink.</p><p>The crosslinked U15 ePECs were diluted to 0.2 μM with EB (without DTT, for crosslinked samples) and incubated with heparin (0.1 mg/mL final) for 3 min at 37°C. The U15 ePECs were then radiolabeled by extension with 20 μM [α-<sup>32</sup>P]GTP for 1 min at 37°C, to poise the complexes one nucleotide before the pause sequence. The resulting G16 ePECs were further diluted to 0.1 μM (based on RNAP) and assayed at 37°C for pause-escape kinetics at 10 µM GTP by addition of CTP in EB to 100 µM (without DTT, for crosslinked samples). Reaction samples were removed at various time points and quenched with an equal volume of 2X stop buffer. All active ePECs were chased out of the pause with 500 μM GTP and CTP, each, for 5 min at 37°C. RNAs in each quenched reaction sample were separated on a 15% urea-PAGE gel. Gels were visualized and quantified as described for in vitro transcription assays.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cys Triplet Reporter assays</title><p>For Cys triplet reporter (CTR) cross-linking assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,E and F</xref>), ECs and PECs were assembled on purified DNA and RNA scaffolds specified in the figure legend and as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2018a</xref>). Briefly, 10 μM RNA, 12 μM template DNA, and 15 μM non-template DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were annealed in RB. To assemble complexes, scaffold (2 μM) was mixed with limiting CTR RNAP (1 μM; CTR RNAP: β′1045iC 258iC, β843C) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 2.5 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin/mL, and added to mixtures of cystamine and DTT to generate redox potentials that ranged from −0.314 to −0.424. Complexes were incubated for 60 min at room temperature and then were quenched with the addition of iodoacetamide to 15 mM. The formation of cysteine-pair cross-links was then evaluated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (4%–15% gradient Phastgel; GE Healthcare) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nayak et al., 2013</xref>). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and imaged with a CCD camera. The fraction cross-linked was quantified with ImageJ software. The experimental error was determined as the standard deviation of measurements from three or more independent replicates.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Landick lab, Seth Darst, Jin Young Kang, and Georgiy Belogurov for many helpful discussions during the course of this work and preparation of the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jerry Workman as Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. One of the two reviewers has agreed to reveal their identity: Dong Wang.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This comprehensive study is focused on understanding the fundamental mechanism of the elemental paused state during bacterial transcription. Several longstanding unresolved issues related to elemental pausing include: whether the elemental paused elongation complex (ePEC) is an on-pathway state or an offline state; whether the elemental pause is non-backtracked or backtracked; what is the nature the elemental pause signal? Using multiple biochemical (kinetic) and biophysical approaches, the authors revealed that the RNAP elemental pause state is an off-pathway with a branched kinetic mechanism. While previous CryoEM structures showed that the ePEC is in a half-translocated state such that RNA is translocated but the template is not loading, the current authors found that this ePEC can easily enter pretranslocated and one base-pair backtracked states. Furthermore, the authors revealed that the RNAP elemental pause signal is multipartite. Taken together, the authors proposed a multistate model that provides an important framework to understand how transcriptional pausing is modulated. The data are solid and the manuscript is well-written. It will be of general interest for the transcription field and readers of e<italic>Life</italic>.</p><p>We only have a few minor comments:</p><p>&quot;the bypass fraction was shifted from ~22% at 10 μM GTP to ~7% at 100 μM GTP&quot;.

Bypass indeed increases at higher GTP, as shown in Figure 1G also. The sentence in question contained a typo reversing the GTP concentrations. It is now corrected in the revised manuscript to read &quot;the bypass fraction was shifted from ~22% at 100 µM GTP to ~7% at 10 µM GTP&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;upstream fork-junction (usFJ&quot; should be &quot;upstream fork-junction (usFJ)&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for catching this error and have made the suggested correction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Hybrid translocation is not rate-limiting for elemental pause escape”, first paragraph; please change to &quot;(Figures 3D-F)&quot;, as Figure 3F is not cited in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for catching this error and have made the suggested correction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Hybrid translocation is not rate-limiting for elemental pause escape”, first paragraph: the reference should be (Malinen et al., 2012) instead.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for catching this error and have made the suggested correction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;control EC (Figure 4C; (Malinen et al., 2014).&quot; should be &quot;control EC (Figure 4C; Malinen et al., 2014).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for catching this error and have made the suggested correction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;(compare to control EC; Figure 4C, D, E)&quot; it shall be Figure 5C, D, E instead?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for catching this error and have made the suggested correction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Clamp loosening but not extensive clamp opening accompanies elemental pausing”, first paragraph: &quot;Figure 5D&quot;. should be Figure 6D instead.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for catching this error and have made the suggested correction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;apparent H-bonds of R542 in fork loop 2 to the template dC that may hinder its translocation into the active site&quot;. Could the authors comment whether R452 can interact with other +1 template bases, is this interaction sequence-specific?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion from the reviewers. The low resolution of the ePEC cryo-EM structure (5.5 Å) makes discussion of details of the Arg-dC interaction speculative (we note this in the Results section). The interaction is potentially specific for the dC–dG as contact to the nontemplate G (H-bonds to O6 and N7) are possible, and this pattern is G-specific. The Arg contact to the WC face of template dC seen in the Murakami crystal structure or an initiation (5voi) also is cytosine-specific. Thus, it is possible that R542 may inhibit translocation by more than one type contact specific to a +1 dC in the template strand. Because of structural uncertainties, we have limited the description of the possible contacts to addition of a single sentence: “Notably the apparent R542 H-bonding contacts to the +1 dC–dG bp as well as to an unpaired but pretranslocated +1 dC in an initiation complex (Murakami et al., 2017) are not feasible for other +1 bases, possibly suggesting multiple ways R542 could inhibit template DNA translocation in an ePEC.”. We thank the reviewers for suggesting this addition, which should help readers better put our results into context. We also have edited the description of the R542 interaction in the results to refer to the dC–dG bp instead of simply to template dC and we have modified Figure 7B to include depiction of the potential H-bond to N7 (2.9 Å in 6bjs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;15% PAG&quot; should be &quot;15% PAGE&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) is the more commonly recognized abbreviation, although in this instance PAG was an abbreviation for polyacrylamide gel not including electrophoresis.
