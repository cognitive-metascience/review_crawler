Enhancer of zeste, and Trithorax) domain protein superfamily and plays important roles in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, muscle differentiation, and carcinogenesis. Previously, we identified SETD3 as the actin-specific methyltransferase that methylates the N3 of His73 on β-actin (Kwiatkowski et al., 2018). Here, we present two structures of <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-L-homocysteine-bound SETD3 in complex with either an unmodified β-actin peptide or its His-methylated variant. Structural analyses, supported by biochemical experiments and enzyme activity assays, indicate that the recognition and methylation of β-actin by SETD3 are highly sequence specific, and that both SETD3 and β-actin adopt pronounced conformational changes upon binding to each other. In conclusion, this study is the first to show a catalytic mechanism of SETD3-mediated histidine methylation on β-actin, which not only throws light on the protein histidine methylation phenomenon but also facilitates the design of small molecule inhibitors of SETD3.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>post translational modifications</kwd><kwd>β-actin</kwd><kwd>SET domain</kwd><kwd>N3-methylhistidine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31500601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liao</surname><given-names>Shanhui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31501093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Huijuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015M580547</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Huijuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UMO-2017/27/B/NZ1/00161</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drozak</surname><given-names>Jakub</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31570737</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31770806</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009076</institution-id><institution>University of Science and Technology of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018CXFX007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WK2070080001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural research, supplemented by biochemical experiments and enzymatic assays, unravels the sequence-dependent molecular mechanism by which SETD3 recognizes β-actin and methylates His73 of β-actin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microfilaments are the building blocks of the cytoskeleton and are made up of actin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">dos Remedios et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Theriot and Mitchison, 1991</xref>). There are six actin isoforms in mammalian cells that are characterized on the basis of their different expression profiles and cellular functions, including α<sub>skeletal</sub>-, α<sub>cardiac</sub>-, α<sub>smooth</sub>-, β<sub>cyto</sub>-, γ<sub>cyto</sub>-, and γ<sub>smooth</sub>-actins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gunning et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perrin and Ervasti, 2010</xref>). Among these, β-actin is ubiquitously expressed and plays critical roles in a wide variety of cellular functions, such as cytoskeleton formation, cell motility and maintenance of cell stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leterrier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nudel et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>Many different types of post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been found in actin proteins, including acetylation, methylation, SUMOylation and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Terman and Kashina, 2013</xref>). N<sup>3</sup>-methylation of His73 in β-actin has been of special interest since its identification in 1967 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnson et al., 1967</xref>), not only because of the extreme evolutionary conservation of this PTM–methylated His, which is present in almost all eukaryotic actins, but mainly because the methylation of H73 decreases the hydrolysis rate of the actin-bound ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kabsch et al., 1990</xref>), as evidenced by the greater ATP exchange rate in the actin-H73A mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nyman et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Although the presence of actin-specific methyltransferases was shown in rabbit muscles decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Raghavan et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vijayasarathy and Rao, 1987</xref>), the molecular identity of this enzyme has long been unknown. Recently, we and others identified SETD3 as the actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase that methylates actin at His73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kwiatkowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wilkinson et al., 2019</xref>). SETD3 is a member of the SET domain family, the SET domain being a ~ 130 amino acids (aa) motif initially identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins, with its acronym derived from three histone lysine methyltransferases: <bold><underline>S</underline></bold>u(var)3–9, <bold><underline>E</underline></bold>nhancer of zeste, and <bold><underline>T</underline></bold>rithorax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dillon et al., 2005</xref>). To date, most known histone lysine methyltransferases contain a SET domain, although there are some exceptions such as DOT1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Min et al., 2003</xref>), METTL12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rhein et al., 2017</xref>), and METTL21B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Malecki et al., 2017</xref>). Before SETD3 was identified as an actin-specific histidine methyltransferase, SET domain proteins were known to act as lysine methyltransferases, transferring a methyl moiety from the methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet) to the substrates to generate a methylated form of the substrate, with <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) as the co-product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dillon et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>As (i) SETD3 has been identified previously as a histone methyltransferase that methylates histone H3 at Lys4 and Lys36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eom et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wagner and Carpenter, 2012</xref>) and as (ii) the results of our preliminary experiments using isothermal calorimetry titration (ITC) and mass spectrometry had revealed that SETD3 binds to and methylates a β-actin peptide containing His73 (66–88) (but not H3K4 (1–23) or H3K36 (25–47) peptides), we crystallized and solved two structures of AdoHcy-bound SETD3 in complex with either the His73 peptide or the 3-methylhistidine (His73me) peptide to determine the molecular mechanism of SETD3-mediated histidine methylation of β-actin.</p><p>Having solved the two peptide-bound structures of SETD3, we reveal that SETD3 recognizes a fragment of β-actin in a sequence-dependent manner and utilizes a specific pocket to catalyze the N<sup>3</sup>-methylation of His73. Moreover, our comprehensive structural, biochemical and enzymatic profiling of SETD3 allows us to pinpoint the key residues in SETD3 that are important for substrate recognition and subsequent methylation. Therefore, our structural research, supplemented by biochemical and enzymatic experiments, not only provides insights into the catalytic mechanism of SETD3 but will also facilitate the design of specific inhibitors of the SETD3 enzyme.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SETD3 binds to and methylates β-actin</title><p>We and others had previously shown that SETD3 acts as an actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase, but the molecular basis for the selective histidine methylation catalyzed by SETD3 remained unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kwiatkowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wilkinson et al., 2019</xref>). We measured the binding affinity of the SETD3 core region (aa 2–502) to a His73-containing fragment of β-actin (aa 66–88) by ITC and found that SETD3 binds to the β-actin peptide with a Kd of 0.17 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The complex structure therefore reflects the image of the pre-methyl transfer state.</p><p>In both substrate-bound and product-bound structures, the SETD3 core region adopts a V-shape architecture and is composed of N-SET (N-terminal to the SET domain), SET, iSET (an insertion in the SET domain), and C-SET (C-terminal to the SET domain) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

The distance between the N<sup>3</sup> atom of His73 and the sulfur atom of AdoHcy is 3.7 Å, suggesting that this structure represents the pre-methyl transfer state well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>In the product complex, the residues Leu67-Lys84 and the main chain of Ile85 of the β-actin peptide are visible, with His73 methylated to His73me (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>). Despite the fact that the methylated peptide adopts a 3<sup>10</sup> helix at its C-terminal end, the substrate-bound and product complexes are highly similar, with an RMSD of 0.19 Å over protein Cα atoms and an RMSD of 0.32 Å over peptide Cα atoms, respectively. In the product-bound structure, His73me is inserted into the same pocket of SETD3 as in the substrate complex but the distance between the installed methyl group of His73 and the sulfur atom of AdoHcy is 3.2 Å, with its density map distinguishable from that of unmodified histidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Superposition of the substrate-bound and product complexes clearly indicates that the hydrogen bonds between the main chain of His73me and the main chain carbonyl of Tyr313 and the guanidino of Arg316 are intact after methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, the imidazole ring of His73me is rotated by ~90° relative to that of the unmodified His73, with its C<sup>4</sup>H pointing toward the ring of Tyr313 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–2C</xref>) and its N<sup>1</sup> atom hydrogen-bonded to the side chain carboxyl group of Asn256 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>When comparing SETD3 with the other SET-domain-containing lysine methyltransferases, we found that there are two main reasons that SETD3 is not likely to be a lysine methyltransferase. First, the histidine-binding pocket of SETD3 is too shallow to accommodate the aliphatic side chain of a lysine. Replacement of His73 with a lysine would not only disrupt the water-mediated hydrogen bond between N<sup>1</sup> of His73 and Arg316, but could also lead to a steric clash between the aliphatic side chain of lysine and the main chain of the bottom carbonyl cage residue, Asp275. Second, the phenylalanine of LSMT and SETD6, which creates a cation-π interaction with the lysine, is replaced by an asparagine (Asn256) in SETD3, and Asn256 is critical for substrate binding and histidine methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Therefore, this substitution establishes an imidazole ring-specific interaction with histidine by impairing the lysine-specific interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>SETD3 exhibits extensive interactions with β-actin</title><p>In both substrate-bound and product complexes, peptide residues flanking His73 or His73me of β-actin also interact extensively with the N-terminal lobe of SETD3, with Leu67-Glu72 and Gly74-Glu83 mainly contacting the SET and iSET motifs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Leu67 and Pro70 of β-actin make hydrophobic contacts with Ile284 of SETD3 and there are additional hydrophobic interactions between Tyr69 of β-actin and Pro259, Tyr288 and Leu290 of SETD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Two main chain hydrogen bonds are formed between Tyr69 of β-actin and Tyr288 of SETD3, and between Ile71 of β-actin and Thr286 of SETD3, inducing the shift of the two sheets (β4-β10-β9 and β3-β11) in SETD3, as mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). Ile71 of actin is positioned into a hydrophobic pocket of SETD3 that is formed by Ile258, Ile271, Trp274, Thr286, Tyr288, and Cys295 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, Leu283-Thr285 of SETD3 adopts a β strand in the structure of AdoMet-bound SETD3 without a peptide (PDB: 3SMT), but decomposes upon binding to the N-terminal side of β-actin, which shortens the β9 strand of SETD3 in the peptide-bound structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). The side chain carboxylate group of Glu72 forms one hydrogen bond with the guanidino group of Arg316, which is the only C-SET domain residue that contacts the N-terminal side of the β-actin peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the residues of the C-terminal to His73 of β-actin, the main chain amide group of Gly74 is hydrogen-bonded to the main chain carbonyl group of Gln255, while the side chain of Val76 stacks with the imidazole ring of His324 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast to Gly74 and Val76, the Ile75 side chain is solvent-exposed and is therefore not involved in the interactions with SETD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thr77 not only makes hydrophobic contact with Leu268, but also forms two hydrogen bonds through its hydroxyl group with the side chain amide groups of Asn154 and Gln255 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The side chain amide group of Asn154 makes another hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl of Asn78. The indole ring of Trp79 is inserted into an open hydrophobic pocket composed of Ile155, Val248, Val251 and Met252, with its main chain carbonyl H-bonded to the side chain amide of Gln216, while the carboxyl group of Asp80 is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain amide of Arg215 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Asp81 of β-actin forms three hydrogen bonds with SETD3: one with the side chain amide of Gln216 and two with the guanidino group of Arg215 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, the β-actin peptide sequence is also conserved in α-and γ-actin proteins, suggesting that SETD3 might also recognize and methylate other actin isotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Key SETD3 residues in β-actin binding and methylation</title><p>To evaluate the roles of the SETD3 residues around the active site in β-actin methylation, we made several single SETD3 mutants and quantitatively compared their affinities for binding to the β-actin peptide by ITC. All of the SETD3 mutants displayed weaker binding affinities toward the peptide, but R215A and R316A exhibited the most significantly reduced binding affinities: 21-and 42-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Our complex structures showed that both Arg215 and Arg316 make several hydrogen bonds with β-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), implying that they play a critical role in substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). N256A binds the peptide with a 12-fold lower affinity than wildtype SETD3, (Kd = 2.1 µM) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>); this is because the mutation disrupts not only the hydrogen bond to the main chain of the His73 Cα atom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) but also the one to the N<sup>1</sup> atom of His73me (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the substrate-bound structure, the imidazole ring of His73 stacks with the aromatic ring of Tyr313, with the N<sup>3</sup> atom of His73 in proximity to the hydroxyl group of Tyr313 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The hydroxyl group of Tyr313 partially neutralizes the charge of N<sup>3</sup>, as is verified by the fact that mutating Tyr313 to phenylalanine diminishes binding affinity 17-fold (Kd = 3.0 µM) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). A similar favorable charge–charge interaction has also been observed in the structure of Gemin5 bound to m<sup>7</sup>G base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Given that the β-actin peptide interacts with SETD3 through the sequences that flank His73, we performed β-actin mutagenesis and ITC studies to corroborate the roles of Tyr69, Ile71, Asp80, Asp81, and Met82. The Tyr69, Ile71 and Met82 of β-actin are involved in binding to SETD3 via hydrophobic interactions, and the replacement of any of them with alanine leads to a 5–90 fold reduction in the SETD3 binding affinity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Consistent with the fact that Asp80 and Asp81 of β-actin both form hydrogen bonds with SETD3, D80A and D81A cause a 20- and 11-fold decrease in SETD3 binding affinity, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The interactions between Asp81 and Met82 of β-actin and SETD3 also explain why truncation of the Asp81–His88 of the peptide reduces the binding to SETD3 ~17 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Taken together, the flanking sequences of His73 on the β-actin peptide, rather than His73 itself, are critical for binding to SETD3, suggesting that the recognition of substrate by SETD3 is highly sequence-selective.</p><p>To obtain further insights into how substrate recognition by SETD3 affects subsequent histidine methylation, we used mass spectrometry to compare the activity of the above-mentioned SETD3 mutants with that of the wildtype protein in the presence of AdoMet. The mass spectrometry data indicate that the peaks of products generated by the four SETD3 mutants (R215A, N256A, Y313F, and R316A) were much lower than that observed for wildtype SETD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting that these mutants displayed weaker histidine methylation activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Activities of the SETD3 enzyme and its mutant variants toward the β-actin protein</title><p>To verify the identification of the key catalytic residues of SETD3, and to analyze the roles of substrate recognition residues in catalysis, we determined the kinetic properties of wildtype and mutant variants of purified recombinant SETD3 in the presence of homogenous full-length recombinant human β-actin.

For AdoMet, N256A and Y313F both have a higher K<sub>M</sub> (~6- and ~58-fold, respectively) and lower k<sub>cat</sub> (~9- and ~6-fold, respectively) than the wildtype enzyme. We also examined the kinetic properties of N256D and N256Q, and found that, for both β-actin and AdoMet, the kinetic parameters of N256Q are comparable to those of wildtype SETD3, while N256D behaves similarly to N256A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Taking into account the fact that Asn256 and Tyr313 of SETD3 interact mainly with His73 of β-actin, and not with AdoMet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–2B</xref>), these results may imply that Asn256 and Tyr313 of SETD3 plausibly bind to His73 of β-actin by favorably orienting its imidazole ring to facilitate the efficient transfer of the methyl group from AdoMet to His73. The consequence of the N256A and Y313F mutations is thus a decrease in the rate of ‘successful’ methylation events, which could be partially overcome by an increase in AdoMet concentration.</p><p>In contrast to Asn256 and Tyr313, the Arg215 and Arg316 residues of SETD3 contact with the flanking sequences of His73.

The detectable activity of SETD3 at neutral pH is consistent with the fact that histidine deprotonation occurs at neutral pH, which facilitates the transfer of the methyl group from AdoMet to histidine. The increasing rate of the reaction with increasing pH to pH 9.0 could suggest, however, that the imidazolium pKa is perturbed (elevated) in the active site due to the active site environment or that proton transfer from the imidazole/imidazolium may not contribute to the rate-limiting step.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43676.020</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Effect of pH on SETD3 enzyme activity.</title><p>The pH-dependence of human SETD3 was determined with the use of a purified recombinant N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tagged SETD3 protein (aa 2–502).

For the first time, these SETD3 structures reveal the molecular mechanism by which a SET domain protein acts as the actin His73-specific methyltransferase.</p><p>Our structural analyses, assisted by mutagenesis and biochemical experiments, suggest that the recognition of β-actin and its subsequent catalysis by SETD3 are different from those observed for other SET-domain-containing lysine methyltransferases in the following respects: (i) the histidine recognition pocket of SETD3 is shallower than that of other SET lysine methyltransferases, and key residues of SETD3 that form hydrogen bonds with the His73 imidazole ring are not conserved in other SET proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>); (ii) in two solved SETD3 complex structures, the methylated histidine rotates its side chain by 90° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>); and (iii) the recognition of β-actin by SETD3 is highly dependent on the sequences flanking His73 of β-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with the high binding affinity between SETD3 and a β-actin H73A peptide (66–88) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although N<sup>3</sup>-methylhistidine is also found in other proteins, such as mammalian myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnson et al., 1967</xref>) and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Rpl3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Webb et al., 2010</xref>), the sequence preference suggests that SETD3 probably works only on His73 of β-actin, as well as on the corresponding histidines in α- and γ-actins. One implication is that no SETD3 ortholog has been found in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>Previously, we identified <italic>Carnosine N-methyltransferase 1</italic> (<italic>CARNMT1</italic>) as the gene that encodes carnosine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drozak et al., 2015</xref>). This enzyme catalyzes N<sup>1</sup>-methylation of the histidine imidazole ring of carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine), an abundant dipeptide in the skeletal muscle of vertebrates. Recently, the structures of CARNMT1 bound to analogs of N<sup>1</sup>-methylhistidine were also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cao et al., 2018</xref>), allowing us to compare N<sup>3</sup>-histidine methylation by SETD3 with N<sup>1</sup>-histidine methylation by CARNMT1 by studying the two complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and E</xref>). We found that SETD3 and CARNMT1 not only adopt different folds and AdoHcy-binding modes, but also display distinct histidine recognition and catalysis mechanisms. Asp316 of CARNMT1 forms two hydrogen bonds with the imidazole ring of the histidine to facilitate its deprotonation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cao et al., 2018</xref>). In the SETD3–substrate complex, His73 stacks with Tyr313 and is hydrogen-bonded to the main chain carbonyl group of Asp275 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which orients the His73 imidazole ring for efficient catalysis. As determined by the mutagenesis, ITC binding experiments and enzymatic assays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), Tyr313 of SETD3 plays important roles in substrate recognition and in subsequent histidine methylation. Finally, the 90° rotation of the His73me imidazole ring was not found in CARNMT1-mediated histidine methylation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications of conformational changes in actin upon binding to SETD3</title><p>In natively purified rabbit β-actin, His73 exists in the methylated form and it is localized close to the phosphate groups of ATP binding to actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kabsch et al., 1990</xref>). Although our complexes contain only a fragment of β-actin, they could still provide clues about the role of SETD3 in mediating actin functions. The residues 66–84 of β-actin consist of three β strands followed by an α-helix; however, the β-actin peptide adopts an extended conformation upon binding to SETD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that β-actin probably endures local structural remodeling during methylation. Given that SETD3 is found to be co-purified with other factors, such as the peptide release factor ERF3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kwiatkowski et al., 2018</xref>), SETD3 might require the assistance of other protein(s) to achieve the methylation of actin His73.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the current investigation, we have identified the molecular mechanism of β-actin methylation by SETD3 and have shown that the enzyme displays a very high substrate specificity toward β-actin His73.

The standard incubation mixture (0.06–0.11 ml) contained 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 10 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT and various concentrations of protein substrate and [<sup>1</sup>H+<sup>3</sup>H] AdoMet (≈300–700 × 10<sup>3</sup> cpm), as indicated in the legends to the figures and tables. When the effect of pH on recombinant enzyme activity was investigated, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) was replaced by 40 mM MES (pH 6.0 or 6.5), 40 mM Hepes (pH 7.0 and 7.5), or 40 mM Tris (pH 8.0, 8.5 or 9.0).</p><p>The incubation mixture was supplemented with recombinant AdoHcy nucleosidase and adenine deaminase to prevent AdoHcy accumulation, as indicated in the legends to the figures and tables. The reaction was started by the addition of an enzyme preparation and carried out at 37°C for 10 min. Protein methylation was linear for at least 15 min under all conditions studied. By analogy to assays of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drozak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Richardt et al., 2003</xref>), the incubation was stopped by the addition of 0.05–0.11 ml of the reaction mixture to 0.025 ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA) (1 mg) and 0.8 ml of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA). After 10 min on ice, the precipitate was pelleted and washed twice with ice-cold 10% TCA. The pellet was finally dissolved in pure formic acid.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Calculations</title><p>V<sub>max</sub>, K<sub>M</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> were calculated for the methyltransferase activity of the studied enzymes with Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, USA) using a nonlinear regression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>The coordinates and structure factors of AdoHcy-bound SETD3 with unmodified β-actin peptide and methylated β-actin peptide have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession numbers 6ICV and 6ICT, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the staff members at beam lines BL17U1, BL18U1 and BL19U1 at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility for their assistance in data collection.

Your article has been reviewed by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Paul R Thompson (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Guo et al. describes the molecular recognition of β-actin by SETD3. This methyltransferase has recently been reported to methylate the N3 atom in the side chain of H73 in β-actin. Crystal structures of SETD3 bound to a β-actin peptide illustrate extensive interactions between the enzyme and the residues surrounding H73 in the substrate. Mutations that disrupt these interactions diminish binding affinity and methylation of β-actin by SETD3. This work sheds new light on SETD3 recognition of β-actin and will likely be of broad interest to investigators in the cell biology, biochemistry, and PTMs field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The catalytic mechanism shown in Figure 5D developed based in part on the structure is highly problematic. Among the major concerns: Y313 as a catalytic base shown as a phenoxide anion is not well justified and is improbable. Much more work would be needed to establish this including detailed pH rate profiles, substrate analogs etc. That Y313F mutation has only a moderate effect (&lt;10-fold) on methyltransferase rate could readily be explained in other ways (substrate affinity, substrate orientation etc). It is quite possible that the imidazole side chain with its low pKa (ca. 7) would not need a catalytic base in any event. In addition, the proposed flipping of the N256 side chain (Supplementary figure S8) is inconsistent with the deposited structure of SETD3 (3SMT.pdb) wherein its carboxamide NH2 group hydrogen bonds with the R254 carbonyl oxygen. If the N256 carboxamide side chain were to flip, this would result in electrostatic repulsion between its oxygen and the R254 carbonyl oxygen. Additionally, N1 will be protonated whether the H73 imidazole group initially binds to SETD3 in a fully protonated state or an N3-deprontated state. Therefore, the N256 carboxamide oxygen should face toward the H73 imidazole ring and hydrogen bond to the N1 position. In sum, the N256 carboxamide ring-flipping discussion and Supplementary figure S8 should be removed from the paper and the N256 side chain in SETD3 should be modeled with proper hydrogen bonding in the deposited structures. Overall, our advice is to minimize discussion of catalysis and drastically simplify or remove the catalytic mechanism images unless and until much more extensive enzymologic work is performed.</p><p>2) The methyltransferase activity assay used here only measures relative rates. More detailed kinetic analysis is needed to discriminate binding effects from catalysis. If the substrate Km values are too high to determine, then this should be clearly indicated, and the limitations of the measurements stated more directly to readers. Furthermore, specific activities presented as V/E (velocity over enzyme concentration in min-1) should be shown.</p><p>3) The writing of the paper and its presentation needs major improvements. Key figures are placed in the supporting information whereas figures that minimally add value are included with the main figures. For example, Figure 2 could either be in the supporting info or be one panel of a multi-paneled figure. Figure 4 is of limited impact. The comparisons to LSMT and CARNMT1 could also be one panel of a multi-paneled figure.

Among the major concerns: Y313 as a catalytic base shown as a phenoxide anion is not well justified and is improbable. Much more work would be needed to establish this including detailed pH rate profiles, substrate analogs etc. That Y313F mutation has only a moderate effect (&lt;10-fold) on methyltransferase rate could readily be explained in other ways (substrate affinity, substrate orientation etc). It is quite possible that the imidazole side chain with its low pKa (ca. 7) would not need a catalytic base in any event. In addition, the proposed flipping of the N256 side chain (Supplementary figure S8) is inconsistent with the deposited structure of SETD3 (3SMT.pdb) wherein its carboxamide NH2 group hydrogen bonds with the R254 carbonyl oxygen. If the N256 carboxamide side chain were to flip, this would result in electrostatic repulsion between its oxygen and the R254 carbonyl oxygen. Additionally, N1 will be protonated whether the H73 imidazole group initially binds to SETD3 in a fully protonated state or an N3-deprontated state. Therefore, the N256 carboxamide oxygen should face toward the H73 imidazole ring and hydrogen bond to the N1 position. In sum, the N256 carboxamide ring-flipping discussion and Supplementary figure S8 should be removed from the paper and the N256 side chain in SETD3 should be modeled with proper hydrogen bonding in the deposited structures. Overall, our advice is to minimize discussion of catalysis and drastically simplify or remove the catalytic mechanism images unless and until much more extensive enzymologic work is performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referees for the constructive comments. We also admitted that Tyr313 is not absolutely required since Y313F mutant still catalyzes the methylation of the peptide, albeit with lower activity. We performed the pH profile of SETD3 activity towards full length recombinant β-actin and found SETD3 to display histidine methylation activity in a wide range of pH values, with a clear preference to the alkaline conditions (a new Figure 3 of the revised manuscript). That could be well explained by the fact that a majority of histidine deprotonates at high pH (pKa of the histidine imidazole moiety is approximately 6.0), which facilitates the transferring of methyl group from AdoMet to the substrate. Unlike lysine, histidine protonation/deprotonation occurs at neutral pH, the pH profiles implicates that a general base probably is not required for methylation. Thus, we agree with the Referee’s suggestion that SETD3 Tyr313 might play an important role in binding to and orienting the substrate (see response to comment 2).</p><p>We have now introduced a short paragraph into the Results section to provide information on the pH-dependence of SETD3 activity.</p><p>As for the orientation of Asn256, we noticed that in a determined AdoMet-bound SETD3 structure (PDB id: 3SMT), the side chain amide of Asn256 is hydrogen bonded to the main chain carbonyl group of Arg254. However, in our structure of AdoHcy-bound SETD3 with unmodified actin peptide, the side chain amide of Asn256 is hydrogen bonded to the main chain carbonyl group of Ala269 (Figure 2A). To validate the rigidity of the Asn256 side chain, we made two single mutants, N256D and N256Q. While N256Q bound to actin peptide 14-fold weaker than the wild type protein, N256D weakened the peptide binding affinity by ~130-fold. Thus, we agreed with the referees that the side chain of Asn256, which is rigidified by the hydrogen bond between Asn256 and Ala269, could not be flipped after catalysis. In our refined product-bound structure of SETD3, the carboxyl group of Asn256 faces toward the His73 imidazole ring, forming one hydrogen bond with the N<sup>1</sup> of His73 (Figure 2B).</p><p>We have now followed the referees’ suggestions by removing the catalytic mechanism figure and minimizing the discussion about the catalytic mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The methyltransferase activity assay used here only measures relative rates. More detailed kinetic analysis is needed to discriminate binding effects from catalysis. If the substrate Km values are too high to determine, then this should be clearly indicated, and the limitations of the measurements stated more directly to readers. Furthermore, specific activities presented as V/E (velocity over enzyme concentration in min-1) should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed more detailed kinetic analysis for SETD3 using full length recombinant human β-actin as the substrate and determined the V<sub>max</sub>, K<sub>M</sub>, and k<sub>cat</sub> (V/E) As shown in a new Table 3, all mutants display clearly lower catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) towards actin and AdoMet than the wild-type enzyme. Among them, R75A and N278A are almost catalytically inactive variants of SETD3, confirming the importance of Arg75 and Ans278 in binding to AdoMet binding.</p><p>Both Asn256 and Tyr313 of SETD3 are catalytic pocket residues and play an important role in catalysis as well as substrate binding. Taking into account that these residues interact mainly with His73 of <sub>β</sub>-actin, and not with AdoMet (Figure 2A-2B and Figure 1—figure supplement 2A), we suggest that Asn256 and Tyr313 of SETD3 are plausibly required to keep the imidazole ring of His73 in the optimal position to facilitate the efficient transfer of the methyl group from AdoMet to His73. The consequence of the N256A and Y313F mutations is thus a decrease in the rate of “successful” methylation events that could be partially overcome by an increase in AdoMet concentration, as evidenced by the much lower k<sub>cat</sub> values of both mutants (Table 3).</p><p>We have now introduced a short paragraph into the Results section to provide information about kinetic properties of the wild-type and mutant SETD3 proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The writing of the paper and its presentation needs major improvements. Key figures are placed in the supporting information whereas figures that minimally add value are included with the main figures. For example, Figure 2 could either be in the supporting info or be one panel of a multi-paneled figure. Figure 4 is of limited impact. The comparisons to LSMT and CARNMT1 could also be one panel of a multi-paneled figure. By contrast, the table that reports the effects of mutations on peptide binding is in the supporting info--this should be in the main section.
