Inhibition of IL, irrespective of its intrinsic neural activity, attenuates not only the ability of environmental cues predictive of reward availability to promote reward seeking, but also the ability of environmental cues predictive of reward omission to suppress this behavior. Here we report that such bidirectional behavioral modulation in rats is mediated by functionally distinct units of neurons (neural ensembles) that are concurrently localized within the same IL brain area but selectively reactive to different environmental cues. Ensemble-specific neural activity is thought to function as a memory engram representing a learned association between environment and behavior.

Such ensemble-specific brain activity is thought to function as the memory engram, each representing a unique learned association between environment and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cruz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mayford, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tonegawa et al., 2015</xref>). Based on the correlational evidence from electrophysiological and calcium imaging studies, it is commonly thought that multiple engrams concurrently exist within a single brain site at a single stage of learning. Previous studies have established the causal evidence that a single brain area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Warren et al., 2016</xref>) or ensemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Redondo et al., 2014</xref>) can represent two different engrams at two different stages of learning (e.g., before vs. after extinction training). However, the causal evidence supporting the concurrent existence of multiple engrams within a single brain site, each mediating different environmental actions on a learned behavior (e.g., a go/no-go task), is still lacking.</p><p>Here we present the causal evidence for the concurrent existence of two distinct engrams within the infralimbic cortex (IL) of rats, each mediating opposing environmental actions on a pre-established operant response. Our findings help reconcile the contradictory reports regarding the role of IL in the environmental control of appetitive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gourley and Taylor, 2016</xref><underline>)</underline>. Some reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koya et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bossert et al., 2011</xref>) indicate that non-selective disruption of IL, irrespective of neural activity, prevents promotion of reward seeking by cues signaling reward availability (e.g., reward contexts). However, other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Peters et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">LaLumiere et al., 2012</xref>) indicate that non-selective disruption of IL prevents suppression of reward seeking by cues signaling reward omission (e.g., extinction contexts). Yet other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Willcocks and McNally, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pfarr et al., 2015</xref>) indicate that the non-selective disruption of IL has no significant effect on either promotion or suppression of reward seeking.</p><p>These discrepancies could be the results of different IL neurons selectively reacting to different cues signaling reward availability and omission. We hypothesized that distinct neural ensembles – concurrently existing within IL but each selectively reactive to a discriminative stimulus predictive of reward availability (S+) or omission (S-) – differentially control promotion and suppression of reward seeking. To test this hypothesis, we developed an animal model for bidirectional environmental modulation of reward seeking, and utilized a neural activity-targeted disruption technique (Daun02 pharmacogenetic inactivation in <italic>Fos-lacZ</italic> transgenic rats) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Koya et al., 2009b</xref>) to inhibit neural ensembles in IL specifically activated by either S+ or S- cues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>All rats were trained to recognize three sets of cues predictive of rewards at varying probability: active lever and light-cue (50%), S+ (100%) and S- (0%). All rats were trained to lever-press for a sweet solution (containing 3% glucose and 0.125% saccharin) presented together with a light-cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and further trained to recognize distinct auditory cues (white noise and beeping tone) as S+ and S- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Each rat underwent three cue-tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) for bidirectional environmental modulation of reward seeking: (1) active lever and light-cue without S+ or S- (‘No S+/S-’), (2) active lever, light-cue and S+, (3) active lever, light-cue and S-. Glucose and saccharin were not available during these tests. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on active lever-pressing revealed a significant effect of cue-test (F<sub>(2,89)</sub> = 216.679, p&lt;0.001). The active lever and light-cue sufficiently initiated and maintained lever-pressing (see No S+/S-). In each animal, superimposing S+ significantly potentiated lever-pressing (p&lt;0.001), while superimposing S- significantly suppressed this behavior (p&lt;0.001). This bidirectional environmental modulation of reward seeking is presumably mediated by learning processes known as ‘conditioned excitation or inhibition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rescorla, 1969</xref>) or ‘positive or negative occasion setting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schmajuk et al., 1998</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21920.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Trainings.</title><p>(<bold>1A</bold>) Self-administration training to establish operant response for a palatable reward. The rats were subjected to once daily operant conditioning sessions (60 min, each) to press an ‘active lever’ for the purpose of gaining a sweet solution (3% glucose and 0.125% saccharin dissolved in water).

Each rat was first exposed to either S+ or S-, and then received a bilateral microinjection of Daun02 (2.0 µg/0.5 µl/side) or vehicle (0.5 µl/side) into IL. In <italic>Fos-lacZ</italic> rats, Daun02 (inactive compound) is catalyzed into daunorubicin (cytotoxin) by beta-galactosidase (enzyme) only in ‘activated’ cells expressing Fos (activation marker), thereby triggering apoptosis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pfarr et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, Daun02 cannot be catalyzed into daunorubicin in ‘non-activated’ cells lacking Fos expression (and thus beta-galactosidase), and cellular disruption is prevented. As such, Daun02 selectively inactivates Fos-positive ‘activated’ neurons without disrupting the surrounding Fos-negative ‘non-activated’ neurons. On the day of Daun02 disruption, both active lever and light-cue were not introduced. Thus, the rats were withheld from lever-pressing, as to not disrupt neurons activated by either active lever or light-cue.</p><p>Each rat then again underwent the three cue-tests for the bidirectional modulation of reward seeking by S+ or S- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Three-way ANOVA on active lever-press revealed significant effects of disruption-cue (F<sub>(1,86)</sub> = 8.839, p&lt;0.01), cue-test (F<sub>(2,172)</sub> = 313.899, p&lt;0.001), and significant interactions for disruption-cue and microinjection (F<sub>(1,86)</sub> = 5.87, p&lt;0.05), disruption-cue and cue-test (F<sub>(2,172)</sub> = 9.694, p&lt;0.001), microinjection and cue-test (F<sub>(2,172)</sub> = 22.936, p&lt;0.001), and disruption-cue and microinjection and cue-test (F<sub>(2,172)</sub> = 6.172, p&lt;0.01). In the two vehicle-treated control groups (‘S+ &amp; vehicle’ and ‘S- &amp; vehicle’), the bidirectional modulation of lever-pressing by S+ or S- was evident (p&lt;0.01–0.001). In the group that received Daun02 following exposure to S+ (‘S+ &amp; Daun02’), Daun02 disruption of IL neurons activated by S+ blocked the promotion of lever-pressing by S+ but spared the suppression of this behavior by S- (p&lt;0.01). In the group that received Daun02 following exposure to S- (‘S- &amp; Daun02’), Daun02 disruption of IL neurons activated by S- blocked suppression by S- but spared promotion by S+ (p&lt;0.01). For all cases, basal lever-pressing initiated and maintained by active lever and light-cue was not significantly altered by Daun02 disruption of IL neurons activated by S+ or S- (see No S+/S-). Thus, Daun02 disruption of IL neurons activated by either S+ or S- exclusively altered the cue-modulation of reward seeking uniquely linked to the targeted cue in a single animal.</p><p>Daun02’s effect on disrupting neural ensemble activity was verified by Fos immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) using previously established procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Koya et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bossert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pfarr et al., 2015</xref>). Each of the four groups prepared for the Daun02 disruption was further divided into three groups defined by the final Fos-induction conditions (‘S+’, ‘S-’ or ‘No S+/S-’). Each rat was subjected to one of these conditions. However, active lever and light-cue were not introduced in order to determine IL ensembles specifically reactive to S+ or S-. Three-way ANOVA on Fos-positive nuclei in IL revealed significant effects of microinjection (F<sub>(1,78)</sub> = 7.695, p&lt;0.01), Fos-induction (F<sub>(2,78)</sub> = 31.129, p&lt;0.001), and significant interactions for disruption-cue and Fos-induction (F<sub>(2,78)</sub> = 14.803, p&lt;0.001), disruption-cue and microinjection and Fos-induction (F<sub>(2,78)</sub> = 11.016, p&lt;0.001). In the two vehicle-treated control groups (‘S+ &amp; vehicle’ and ‘S- &amp; vehicle’), both S+ and S- significantly increased Fos-positive nuclei in IL (Ps &lt; 0.05–0.01). In the group that received Daun02 following exposure to S+ (‘S+ &amp; Daun02’), Daun02 disruption of IL neurons activated by S+ prevented the induction of Fos by S+ but spared the induction by S- (p&lt;0.05). In the group that received Daun02 following exposure to S- (‘S- &amp; Daun02’), Daun02 disruption of IL neurons activated by S- significantly reduced the induction of Fos by S- but spared the induction by S+ (p&lt;0.05).

Because Daun02 disruption of IL neurons activated by either S+ or S- exclusively altered the behavioral response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) as well as neural activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) uniquely linked to the targeted cue, mutually exclusive rather than overlapping neural ensembles in IL likely mediate the bidirectional environmental control of reward seeking. As is the case of recent studies that utilized similar activity-dependent procedures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Redondo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grosso et al., 2015</xref>), the current results demonstrate the functional significance of manipulating brain cells based on their activity in addition to other characteristics, such as locality and phenotype. We thus raise caution to the use of non-selective techniques that manipulate neural activity irrespective of intrinsic neural activity for determining the brain behavioral functions. Finally, our findings provide the causal evidence for the concurrent existence of multiple engrams, each mediating different and even opposing environmental actions on a behavior, in a single brain area. In light of recent studies implicating differential brain processes in differential environmental control of a learned response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ciocchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Trouche et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari et al., 2015</xref>), ensemble-specific neural phenotype as well as both local and brain-wide neurocircuitry involving each unique engram should be elucidated in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of one hundred nineteen male <italic>Fos-lacZ</italic> transgenic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kasof et al., 1995</xref>) on a Sprague-Dawley background were used (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014785">SCR_014785</ext-link>).

All rats were bred at The Scripps Research Institute, and genotyped by Laragen, Inc. (Culver City, CA). The rats were group-housed (two rats per cage) in plastic cages in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room, maintained on a 12 hr/12 hr reverse light/dark cycle (lights on at 20:00 hr).

General schematics and timeline are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. This model consisted of twelve experimental phases and lasted over six months. The rats were always trained and tested during the dark (active) phase in a dedicated operant conditioning chamber (‘chamber’) equipped with two retractable levers (one ‘active lever’ and one ‘inactive lever’), a ‘light-cue’ and a drinking well. At all times, insertion of both active and inactive levers signaled the start of a once daily operant conditioning session conducted under a fixed ratio 1 schedule of reinforcement. During this session, a press on the active lever resulted in a single delivery of 0.2 ml of either sweet solution containing 3% glucose and 0.125% saccharin dissolved in water (‘glucose &amp; saccharin’) or plain water (‘water’) into the drinking well. In our pilot experiments (data not included), this combination of glucose and saccharin produced more robust operant responding than solutions containing either glucose or saccharin alone. Each delivery of either sweet solution or water was paired with 5s illumination of the light-cue signaling a 5s time-out period. During the 5s time-out period, presses on the active lever were recorded but without a scheduled consequence. At all times, presses on the inactive lever were recorded but without a scheduled consequence. Throughout the course of this model, the rats were repeatedly subjected to habituation periods (both between-sessions and within-sessions) in order to minimize the neurobehavioral impact of environmental cues (e.g., experimenters and chambers) other than those manipulated experimentally (i.e., active lever, light-cue, S+ and S-). Three different cohorts of rats were subjected to the entire behavioral procedure (i.e., three biological replicates).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21920.005</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Experimental time course and schedule.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21920.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21920.005</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-21920-fig4-v2"/></fig></p><p>Detailed procedures for each experimental phase are described below:</p><sec id="s3-3-1"><title>Pre-training habituation (two weeks)</title><p>The aim of this phase was to minimize the neurobehavioral impact of environmental cues other than those manipulated experimentally.

Insertion of both active and inactive levers then marked the start of a 60 min session to self-administer glucose and saccharin. A press on the active lever delivered the sweet solution, and also illuminated the light-cue. Each rat was required to satisfy two pre-set training criteria: a minimum of five weeks of training (35 sessions), and a minimum of 100 deliveries of the sweet solution for three consecutive sessions. Three rats that did not satisfy these criteria within six weeks of training were excluded.

Each rat was subjected to alternating once daily sessions to self-administer the sweet solution (preceded and accompanied by the S+ auditory cue) or water (preceded and accompanied by the S- auditory cue). The rats were placed in the chamber and habituated for 30 min. One of the auditory cues was then introduced starting 30 min prior to the insertion of both levers, and maintained throughout a 30 min session to lever press for either the sweet solution or water. Each rat was required to satisfy three preset training criteria: a minimum of 13 weeks of training (i.e., 46 S+ sessions and 46 S- sessions), a minimum of 50 deliveries of the sweet solution for three consecutive S+ sessions, and a maximum of five deliveries of water for three consecutive S- sessions. Nine rats that did not satisfy these criteria within 14 weeks of training were excluded. During this phase, each experimentally manipulated stimulus was conditioned to predict the sweet solution at varying probability: active lever and light-cue (50%), S+ (100%) and S- (0%).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-4"><title>Post-training habituation (one week)</title><p>The aim of this phase was to minimize the neurobehavioral impact of environmental cues other than those manipulated experimentally.

The order of these conditions was randomly counterbalanced between subjects. For all cue-tests, a press on the active lever delivered water and illuminated the light-cue. The sweet solution was not available. For the No S+/S- test, each rat was placed in the chamber and habituated for 60 min.

All rats were placed in the chamber and habituated for 30 min. The disruption cue (S+ or S-) was then introduced. The rats remained in the chamber for additional 90 min in the presence of S+ or S-. This timing (90 min) was to optimally induce β-galactosidase and Fos in neurons activated by either S+ or S- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Koya et al., 2009b</xref>). In order to disrupt the neurons specifically activated by S+ or S-, both levers and light-cue were not introduced, and thus the rats were withheld from lever pressing. The rats then received a bilateral microinjection of Daun02 (2.0 µg/0.5 µl/side) or vehicle (0.5 µl/side) into IL, and returned to their homecages.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Distinct memory engrams in infralimbic cortex control opposing environmental actions on behavior&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Steve Ramirez (Reviewer #1), and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an exciting paper that uses cutting-edge pharmacogenetic and behavioral techniques to assess the role of infralimbic (IL) neuronal populations in mediating opposing environmental actions (i.e. reward availability and omission) on behaviour (e.g. promotion and suppression of reward seeking). The authors bi-directionally modulate reward-seeking behaviour by identifying and inactivating IL neurons previously active either during reward availability of omission. They further show that cells in the IL increase their activity in response to both reward availability and omission cues, and they go on to successfully inactivate these ensembles to block cue-specific increases in neuronal activity. Overall, the experiments are well thought out, the paper is well written, and I view the current manuscript as an outstanding bridge between cells that differentially process discrete experiences and their causal contributions to reward seeking behaviour.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please revise the paper to respond directly to the following reviewer comments and concerns:</p><p>1) If a control group in which a random set of cells of equal ensemble size (i.e. ~70 Fos-positive nuclei per mm<sup>2</sup>) is inactivated and the rats fail to show changes in lever-presses, then this result would greatly strengthen the claim that cells active during reward availability/omission per se are directly involved in modulating each behaviour. This experiment is important because an alternative interpretation of the data is that modulating any ensemble of equal size might thereby lead to behavioural changes in lever pressing without having to be directly tied to a defined c-Fos-inducing experience.

This experiment is important because an alternative interpretation of the data is that modulating any ensemble of equal size might thereby lead to behavioural changes in lever pressing without having to be directly tied to a defined c-Fos-inducing experience. I appreciate that this type of experiment has been performed previously (e.g. Koya et al. 2009) and, at the very least, warrants a brief discussion in the manuscript to convincingly argue that the behavioral perturbations observed are in fact tied directly to c-Fos-expressing cells during a defined epoch of time.</italic> </p><p>This is an important question regarding whether the observed effects of Daun02 on the bidirectional modulation of reward seeking by S+ and S- are due to the “quality” (those specifically activated by either S+ <underline>or</underline> S-) or “quantity” (any population of ~70 Fos-positive nuclei per mm<sup>2</sup>) of IL neurons that were selectively disrupted by Daun02. We have now clarified the issues raised here in the main text. In short, we believe that the original experimental design and results already provided sufficient evidence to reject the alternative interpretation that “modulating any ensemble of equal size might thereby lead to behavioural changes in lever pressing without having to be directly tied to a defined c-Fos-inducing experience”.</p><p>More specifically, we believe that a sufficient internal control to address the quality vs. quantity question was already implemented in the original study. In the current study, each animal was trained to recognize three sets of cues predictive of rewards at varying probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): active lever and light-cue (50%), S+ (100%) and S- (0%). In different animals, Daun02 was then used to selectively disrupt neurons specifically activated by S+ or S-. In the group of animals that received Daun02 into IL following exposure to S+, Daun02 disruption of “S+ activated” neurons blocked the promotion of reward seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) as well as neural activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) by S+, but spared the suppression of this behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) as well as neural activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) by S-. In the group of animals that received Daun02 into IL following exposure to S-, Daun02 disruption of “S- activated” neurons blocked the suppression of reward seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) as well as neural activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) by S-, but spared the promotion of this behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) as well as neural activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) by S+. Importantly, Daun02 disruption of IL neurons activated by either S+ or S- did not significantly alter basal reward seeking due to active lever and light-cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, Daun02 disruption of IL neurons activated by either S+ or S- exclusively altered the behavioral response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) as well as neural activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) uniquely linked to the targeted cue – thus establishing that the observed effects were due to the quality rather than quantity of neurons selectively disrupted. We thus believe that the current results sufficiently confirm that “the behavioral perturbations observed are in fact tied directly to c-Fos-expressing cells during a defined epoch of time (exposure to S+ or S-)”.</p><p>In addition, we would like to mention that the current results are in line with our previous findings that the quantity of cells silenced by Daun02 is not the critical factor behind Daun02’s effects on disruption of learned behaviors. For example, in rats with cocaine self-administration experience, exposure to novel contexts induces 3-fold more accumbens Fos than an exposure to a cocaine context. Yet, Daun02 disruption of neurons activated only by the cocaine context (but not novel context) disrupts context-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking (Cruz et al., J Neurosci 2014, 34: 7437–7446).</p><p><italic>2) Are cells active during S+ or S- preferentially reactivated during S+ or S- presentations, respectively?

In a pilot study leading up to the original publication of the Daun02/<italic>Fos-lacZ</italic> method (Koya et al. 2009, Nat Neurosci, 12: 1069-73), we found that this was not the case: the time-course of β-gal and cFos expression was very similar. Thus, unfortunately, the experiment suggested here is not technically possible in <italic>Fos-lacZ</italic> rats. Moreover, to our knowledge, no method currently exists to distinctly tag separate neuronal ensembles in rats. While such methods do exist for mice (e.g., TetTag mice, Reijimers et al., 2007, Science, 317:1230-3), replicating the current experiments in mice will be beyond the reasonable scope of the current study. However, we fully agree that this is an important issue that needs to be systemically addressed in a future study.</p><p>Nevertheless, based on the current results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), we speculate that a significant extent of the neuronal ensembles recruited by S+ and S- are mutually exclusive rather than overlapping. We thus believe that the answer to the question raised here (“Are cells active during S+ or S- preferentially reactivated during S+ or S- presentations, respectively?”) is “yes”. We have now clarified these issues in the main text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
