We developed fluorouracil-labeled RNA sequencing (Flura-seq) for in situ analysis with high sensitivity. Flura-seq utilizes cytosine deaminase (CD) to convert fluorocytosine to fluorouracil, metabolically labeling nascent RNA in rare cell populations in situ for purification and sequencing. Flura-seq revealed hundreds of unique, dynamic organ-specific gene signatures depending on the microenvironment in mouse xenograft breast cancer micrometastases. Specifically, the mitochondrial electron transport Complex I, oxidative stress and counteracting antioxidant programs were induced in pulmonary micrometastases, compared to mammary tumors or brain micrometastases. We confirmed lung metastasis-specific increase in oxidative stress and upregulation of antioxidants in clinical samples, thus validating Flura-seq’s utility in identifying clinically actionable microenvironmental adaptations in early metastasis. The sensitivity, robustness and economy of Flura-seq are broadly applicable beyond cancer research.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43627.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer cells may not limit themselves to the tissue or organ where they first formed. In some cases, the cells can spread to form tumors in new parts of the body. This process is known as metastasis, and because it is difficult to treat it causes the majority of cancer deaths. To develop new treatments, researchers are trying to learn more about the different steps involved in metastasis.</p><p>As cancer cells travel through the body they must adapt to the changing environments they encounter, and avoid detection and destruction by the immune system. To do so, they turn different genes on or off. When the cells reach their final destination tissue, they divide to form microscopic clusters, or ‘micrometastases’, that can grow into new tumors. Micrometastases can sometimes be eliminated by chemotherapy or radiation. Examining which genes are active in the micrometastases may help researchers to find other ways to kill these cancer cells before they can grow into larger tumors that are harder to treat.</p><p>Basnet et al. have developed a new tool called Flura-seq that documents which genes are active in small clusters of cells in the tissues of living animals. The tool was used to study how breast cancer cells form new tumors in the lungs and brains of mice. The results of the study reveal that lung and brain micrometastases have different patterns of gene activity. In particular, the cancer cells in the lungs turn on antioxidant genes. If they did not, they were killed by a condition known as oxidative stress. This suggests that hindering the activity of the antioxidant genes could help to stop tumors forming in the lungs.</p><p>Further studies that use the new Flura-seq technique could help researchers to learn more about the early stages of cancer and cancer metastasis. The technique could also be used to study gene activity in other small groups of cells as tissues develop and regenerate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>In situ transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>brain metastasis</kwd><kwd>lung metastasis</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01-CA094060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Massagué</surname><given-names>Joan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DR-12998</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Basnet</surname><given-names>Harihar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-12-0074</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Massagué</surname><given-names>Joan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-CA009207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ganesh</surname><given-names>Karuna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM07739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Yun-Han</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08-CA230213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ganesh</surname><given-names>Karuna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30-CA203238</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Yun-Han</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Development and application of highly sensitive <italic>in situ</italic> transcriptomics method, Flura-seq, in identifying dynamic organ-specific transcriptomes in early stage breast cancer metastasis have been described.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Metastasis is a multi-step process that begins with migration of cancer cells from the primary tumor into the circulation to reach lymph nodes and the parenchyma of distant organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Massagué and Obenauf, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lambert et al., 2017</xref>). In host organs, disseminated cancer cells interact with a tissue microenvironment that includes organ-specific resident cells, immune cells, perivascular niches, extracellular matrix, cytokines, metabolites, and an oxygen concentration range. This environment eliminates the majority of cancer cells that infiltrate the parenchyma from the circulation, and selects for cells that can adapt, survive as latent entities, and form micrometastases that may eventually grow into clinically manifest metastases. The progression from micro- to macrometastasis is thought to entail a dynamic interaction between disseminated cancer cells and the host microenvironment, which determines an organ-specific pattern of metastatic relapse characteristic of each type of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Obenauf and Massagué, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celià-Terrassa and Kang, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Overt metastasis is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and is a major clinical concern. Large metastatic lesions accumulate genetic and epigenetic alterations and stably express specific transcriptional signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Easwaran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roe et al., 2017</xref>). In recent years, analysis of these signatures in cells derived from human tumors and xenografts has uncovered numerous factors whose expression mediates organ-specific metastasis in animal models and is associated with organ-specific metastasis in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ell and Kang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Minn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boire et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tavazoie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Valiente et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shibue et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bragado et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). Some of these mediators serve as targets of therapeutic intervention against metastatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celià-Terrassa and Kang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sleeman and Steeg, 2010</xref>). By contrast, cancer cells in the early stages of metastatic colonization may dynamically alter their gene expression profiles in response to specific stresses experienced in distant organs as they adapt to the host tissue microenvironment and form long-lasting metastatic seeds. These early disseminated cells represent a crucial transition state and may be particularly vulnerable to therapy since they can sometimes be eliminated using adjuvant therapy after surgical resection of primary tumors, unlike established macrometastases. Thus, it is critical to understand the vulnerabilities, dynamic as they may be, of early micrometastases. However, insight into the dynamic early micrometastatic state has been limited by the lack of sensitive techniques for in situ transcriptomic analysis of minute numbers of disseminated cancer cells within large host organs.</p><p>Current techniques to study cell-type-specific transcriptomes have limitations that preclude their effective application in studying metastasis-initiating cancer cell populations. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), with or without an intervening fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) step, allows identification of the transcriptomes of underrepresented cell populations at a single-cell level, but it requires extensive physical and enzymatic processing of the tissue, which disrupts the effects of the host microenvironment while exerting stress on these cells, thus compromising the ability to discern the impact of the host stroma from the transcriptome of the isolated cells. Furthermore, only about 10–20% of the transcripts are captured during the library preparation in scRNA-seq which severely limits the coverage of transcriptome of cells of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hwang et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, scRNA-seq is challenging to apply in tissues and cell types that are difficult to dissociate into single cells. In situ transcriptomic profiling obviate these problems but lack the necessary sensitivity for disseminated cancer cells that represent less than 1% of the tissue cell population. For example, translating ribosome affinity purification and mRNA sequencing (TRAP-Seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heiman et al., 2008</xref>) is not suitable to analyze cells that constitute less than 1% of the total population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Obenauf et al., 2015</xref>). Direct-enzyme-based metabolic tagging of RNA with thiouracil (TU) and ethynyl cytosine (EC) in the cells of interest are limited in sensitivity and specificity due to collateral tagging and purification of tagged RNA in cells lacking the enzymes, and requires additional in vitro biotinylation steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cleary et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hida et al., 2017</xref>). TU tagging has a sensitivity limit of 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gay et al., 2013</xref>). Thiol (SH)-linked alkylation of the metabolic labeling of RNA in tissue (SLAM-ITseq) eliminates the noise associated with the purification of RNAs that are not thiol tagged in TU-tagging method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Matsushima et al., 2018</xref>), but undesired TU tagging through endogenous enzymes in cells lacking UPRT expression remains a limitation. Other methods such as laser capture microdissection/RNA-seq are useful in preserving the spatial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nichterwitz et al., 2016</xref>), however, require sophisticated tools and are challenging to use in rare cell populations that are sparsely distributed in the tissue.</p><p>Here, we describe the development of a CD-based method for in situ transcriptomic profiling of rare cell populations with high sensitivity (less than 0.01% of an organ), and the application of this method to the analysis of organ-specific micrometastatic adaptation. Using this approach, we define microenvironment-dependent transcriptional programs in micrometastatic pulmonary and brain metastases from breast cancer, identify oxidative stress as a lung-specific liability of disseminated cancer cells, and demonstrate that NRF2 activation and upregulation of distinct antioxidant genes are adaptive responses to this stress in lung micrometastases. This oxidative stress and adaptive transcriptional events are reversible upon removal of metastatic cells from the tissue microenvironment, and disappear when metastasis-derived cells are placed in culture. We validate our findings in metastatic tumors from different organ sites from patients with breast cancer. Thus, Flura-seq identifies both a dynamically induced organ-specific stress program activated by metastasis-initiating cancer cells in the pulmonary microenvironment, as well as an adaptive transcriptional program that ensures cancer cell survival, which could be targeted to therapeutic advantage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>5-FU tagging allows isolation and quantitation of variable abundance transcripts</title><p>Cytosine deaminase (CD) is a key enzyme of the pyrimidine salvage pathway in fungi and prokaryotes, but is absent in mammalian cells, which instead use cytidine deaminase for the same purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mullen et al., 1992</xref>). In addition to converting cytosine to uracil, CD can also convert 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), a non-natural pyrimidine, to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU is endogenously converted to fluorouridine triphosphate (F-UTP), which is incorporated into RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

Therefore, we determined whether 5-FU labeling of RNAs using this method would be restricted to CD-expressing cells or collaterally affect neighboring cells. We generated CD-expressing derivatives of MDA-MB-231 (MDA231) cells, a cell line derived from the pleural fluid of a patient with highly metastatic, triple hormone receptor-negative breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cailleau et al., 1974</xref>). The CD-expressing derivative cells, MDA231-CD, were co-cultured with unmodified MDA231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), incubated with 5-FC, and the 5-FU labeling of individual cells was determined based on anti-BrdU immunofluorescence. The co-cultures showed 5-FU-labeling not only in MDA231-CD cells but also in unmodified MDA231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>To limit the diffusion of 5-FU from CD-expressing cells, we implemented a dual strategy. First, we engineered MDA231 cells to co-express CD and uracil phosphoribosyl transferase (UPRT). UPRT directly converts 5-FU to 5-fluorouridine monophosphate (F-UMP), which does not diffuse across cell membranes, bypassing the generation of 5-fluorouridine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We developed a polycistronic vector that allows doxycycline (Dox)-inducible co-expression of UPRT, CD and red fluorescence protein (RFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and transduced this vector into the cells (MDA231-CD/UPRT cells). Second, since thymine can competitively inhibit cellular uptake of 5-FU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yuasa et al., 1996</xref>), we included thymine in the medium as a competitive inhibitor of 5-FU transport. This dual strategy restricted the anti-BrdU immunostaining to cells expressing CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thymine was used in all subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments.</p><p>Next, we determined whether this 5-FU-tagging method, ‘Flura-tagging’, could be used to isolate RNA specifically from cells of interest that were admixed with a large proportion of unlabeled cells. MDA231-CD/UPRT cells were co-cultured with 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells at ratios of 10<sup>−3</sup> to 10<sup>−4 </sup>(100 to 1000 MDA231-CD/UPRT cells to 10<sup>6</sup> 4T1 cells). After 12 hr of incubation with 5-FC, 5-FU-labeled mRNAs were immunoprecipitated with anti-BrdU antibody, and the proportion of human and mouse mRNA for representative housekeeping genes was determined by qRT-PCR. Notably, human mRNAs were enriched by more than 10-fold relative to mouse mRNAs, despite human cells comprising 0.01–0.1% of the total cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results demonstrated the efficacy and specificity of the technique in measuring newly synthesized RNAs from small cell populations of interest in a heterogeneous mixture of cells.</p><p>To identify potential transcriptional alterations caused by Flura-tagging, we compared the transcriptome of MDA231-CD/UPRT cells treated with two different concentrations of 5-FC (50 μM and 250 μM), with that of untreated cells that do not express CD/UPRT, using global RNA sequencing analysis (RNA-seq). Over 99% of ~20,000 analyzed genes showed statistically similar expression with 50 µM or 250 µM 5-FC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) indicating that Flura-tagging introduces minimal alteration in the basal transcriptomes of cells in our experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Flura-tagging system effectively captures signal dependent change in gene expression</title><p>To determine whether Flura-tagging could be used to analyze the transcriptional response to extrinsic regulatory signals, we examined the transcriptional response to TGF-β, a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates the expression of many genes involved in diverse cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">David and Massagué, 2018</xref>). We used the TGF-β response of MDA231 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Padua et al., 2008</xref>) as an indicator of the sensitivity and fidelity of our method. MDA231-CD/UPRT cells were treated with 5-FC and either TGF-β or the TGF-β receptor kinase inhibitor SB-505124 (SB). We subjected total RNA from MDA231 cells and immunoprecipitated 5-FU-tagged RNA from MDA231-CD/UPRT cells to RNA-seq analysis. In MDA231 cells, 176 genes showed either an increase or decrease of more than two-fold in transcript levels upon TGF-β treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). RNA-Seq analysis of Flura-tagged RNA samples (‘Flura-seq’) captured the TGF-β transcriptional response of MDA231 cells with high accuracy and fidelity, compared to the RNA-seq control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). It is also noteworthy that Flura-seq showed an enhancement in the fold change of the majority of TGF-β induced genes compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). This is possibly because Flura-seq only detects newly synthesized transcripts, whereas RNA-seq accounts for the total transcripts and thus dilutes the transcriptional response to an acute TGF-β stimulus. On the other hand, Flura-seq identified 575 genes differentially expressed upon TGF-β treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Comparison of the genes uniquely identified by Flura-seq (2.5 hr post TGF-β treatment) to the differential gene expression data sets in MDA231 cells 6 hr post TGF-β treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tufegdzic Vidakovic et al., 2015</xref>) showed that 83 of the genes identified only by Flura-seq were induced by TGF-β as detected by RNA-seq at later time points, suggesting that Flura-seq captures early signal-induced gene expression that is missed by RNA-seq due to dilution by the preexisting basal mRNA pool.

We also tested whether the organ-specific oxidative stress and antioxidant programs are specific to triple negative breast cancer by analyzing lung and brain micrometastases formed by HCC1954 cell line, a HER2<sup>+</sup> human breast cancer cell line. The higher oxidative stress and increased expression of antioxidants were also detected in lung micrometastases relative to brain micrometastases in HCC1954 xenograft model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>), indicating that higher oxidative stress and elevated antioxidant program are more general phenomena of early stage lung metastasis in breast cancer.</p><p>During oxidative stress, the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is stabilized, enabling transcription of an antioxidant transcriptional program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma, 2013</xref>).

Although these methods successfully identify heritable transcriptional alterations of clinical relevance, these approaches overlook the dynamic transcriptional states that are dependent on tissue-specific microenvironmental cues. Flura-seq now enables the highly sensitive capture of these dynamic transcriptional states, thus shedding light on crucial adaptive processes underway in micrometastases that could not previously be identified.</p><p>In this study, we applied Flura-seq to identify the in situ transcriptomic programs that are differentially active in cancer cells at early stages of metastatic colonization in the lungs and brain. We identified metabolic gene signatures that were specific to the colonized organ and lost upon removing cancer cells from the tissue microenvironment and placing them in culture. Specifically, we identified mitochondrial Complex I as the top upregulated transcriptional alteration in lung metastases that was dynamic and dependent on an intact tissue microenvironment. Elevated expression of Complex I genes correlated with increased oxidative stress and activation of counteracting antioxidant programs including the upregulation of a distinct set of NRF2-driven antioxidant genes in metastatic cells that seed the lungs. Antioxidant and NRF2 activity were also increased in association with high Complex I expression in lung metastases from breast cancer patients, suggesting a role of these pathways in mitigating the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress on lung metastatic cells. Lung tissue is exposed to higher concentration of oxygen compared to other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jagannathan et al., 2016</xref>), and high oxygen concentration can cause oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Halliwell, 2014</xref>). It is therefore possible that higher oxygen concentration in the lung micrometastases drives the observed changes. However, we cannot rule out other lung specific microenvironmental cues such as metabolites, cytokines, physical stress, or immune surveillance as sources of the observed changes.</p><p>These results demonstrate that metastatic tumor cells arising from a single source adopt unique transcriptional profiles depending on their site of colonization. Despite increasing appreciation that metastatic outgrowths frequently exhibit altered metabolic gene expression compared to their primary tumor counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LeBleu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dupuy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2007</xref>), whether these metabolic transitions result from the outgrowth of a selected subpopulation predisposed to thrive in a particular location or from the dynamic adaptation of cancer cells to a changing microenvironment remains an open question. Our results support a model wherein tumor cells dynamically adapt to local conditions and suggest that a major determinant of the metabolism of metastatic cells is the site of colonization. These metabolic rearrangements are likely an early event in the establishment of metastatic seeding and may represent a targetable bottleneck against the growth of metastatic lesions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Oxidative stress with clinical implications in metastasis</title><p>Oxidative stress has been implicated in metastasis, however, the precise role of the stress in metastasis has remained controversial. On one hand, oxidative stress has been observed in cancer cells soon after detachment from epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schafer et al., 2009</xref>), and it persists during circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LeBleu et al., 2014</xref>) and upon colonization of metastatic sites in model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Piskounova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gill et al., 2016</xref>). The lung has been proposed to have pro-oxidant environment due to high oxygen and toxins exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schild et al., 2018</xref>), and anti-oxidative mediators such as NRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DeNicola et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Menegon et al., 2016</xref>), peroxiredoxin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stresing et al., 2013</xref>) and thioredoxin-like 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Qu et al., 2011</xref>) stimulate the progression of lung cancer and lung metastasis. On the other hand, ROS has also been reported to promote metastasis, and antioxidants have been shown to inhibit metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferraro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ishikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Porporato et al., 2014</xref>). The oxidative state and the role of oxidative stress soon after the metastatic cancer cells seed the distant organs before they form macrometastases remain unknown. Our findings demonstrate high oxidative stress in the lung micrometastases of breast cancer, supporting the idea that antioxidant programs promote the progression of lung metastasis and highlighting a critical role for antioxidant mediators in the transition of micrometastases to overt metastases.</p><p>Surprisingly, however, our data suggest that elevated antioxidant defenses are not a universal hallmark of metastatic lesions. We found that breast cancer brain metastases experience a low level of oxidative stress and antioxidative response. Given that metastatic cells can exhibit reversible metabolic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Piskounova et al., 2015</xref>), these results raise the possibility that tumor cells undergo multiple metabolic transitions in order to adapt to the changing microenvironments encountered during the metastatic cascade. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that cancer cells from disparate origins may converge to adopt metabolic phenotypes in a given organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schild et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mashimo et al., 2014</xref>). Techniques such as Flura-seq that enable in situ interrogation of tumor cell phenotypes can reveal to what extent these various metabolic transitions are driven by adaptation to the specific microenvironment versus selection of cancer cells with preexisting traits. Given increasing evidence that cell lineage is a critical determinant of cancer cell metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mayers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yuneva et al., 2012</xref>) it will be interesting for future studies to determine whether lineage-specific metabolic predispositions contribute to the metastatic organ tropisms of different tumor types. More broadly, these studies will help to shed light on the precise factors in the tissue microenvironment that contribute to organ-specific metabolic profiles.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Flura-seq as an in situ transcriptomic technique with broad biological applications</title><p>Preservation of the intact tissue microenvironment is critical to accurately elucidate the transcriptional state of a cell in vivo. Flura-seq can define in situ transcriptomes from a very rare cell population representing a small fraction (&gt;0.003%) of an organ. The superior sensitivity of Flura-seq compared to related TU-tagging and EC-tagging may be due to the elimination of a biotinylation step and RNA purification system that distinguishes between cytosine derivatives and uracil derivatives. Flura-seq can be easily applied to any cell type that constitutes a rare subpopulation within the host tissue, such as stem cells and specific subtypes of immune and neuronal cells, in addition to residual cancer cells populations during early stages of metastasis or following the shrinking of a tumor with current therapies.</p><p>Another feature of Flura-seq is that it only identifies newly synthesized transcripts, which is an advantage in the study of transcriptional responses to cytokines, metabolites, pharmacologic agents, stress signals, and other factors that act by rapidly changing the transcriptomic state of target cells. Further, since Flura-seq involves covalently labeling RNA, it can complement other techniques such as scRNA-seq to combine in situ transcriptomic analysis with profiling of the dissociated cell population with single-cell resolution. Recent advances in scRNA-seq have significantly expanded the application of this technology to the analysis of underrepresented cell types in tissues; however, the method requires extensive physical and enzymatic processing that destroys the tissue microenvironment, and thus microenvironment-dependent gene expression features cannot be accurately captured by scRNA-seq. The higher coverage and applicability of Flura-seq to any tissues and cell types is the principal benefit of Flura-seq over scRNA-seq.</p><p>Flura-seq involves the expression of exogenous enzymes, CD and UPRT, and treatment of cells or mice with 5-FC. These treatments may alter the levels of certain transcripts, and is therefore important to validate findings made by Flura-seq with alternative methods such as immunostaining, as shown here. This limitation notwithstanding, Flura-seq provides a sensitive, robust and economical alternative to existing in situ transcriptomics techniques. Thus, the power of Flura-seq in studying rare cell populations can be harnessed to address challenging questions of high biological and clinical significance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

The lung lysates were either used immediately for mRNA extraction or stored at −80°C for later use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunofluorescence (IF) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC)</title><p>For IF, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.2% TritonX-100 for 10 min, blocked with 5% BSA for 1 hr at room temperature, prior to incubation with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight, and secondary antibodies incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Mouse lung and brain were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 24–48 hr at 4°C, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 μm. Paraffin-embedded sections or tissue microarrays were rehydrated using Histo-Clear (National Diagnostics) followed by 100-95–70% ethanol and water. Antigen retrieval was performed in a steamer for 30 min in citrate antigen retrieval solution. Tissue sections were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 hr, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight. Secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorophores were used for detection. IHC were performed on BOND RX (Leica Biosystems) using standard Epitope Retrieval Solution 2 (Leica Biosystems) for 30 min followed by primary antibody incubation for 30 min and BOND polymer refine detection kit-DAB. Automated image analysis was performed using the FIJI software package. Human histopathological sections were obtained under a biospecimen protocol approved by the MSK Institutional Review Board. All human pathology analyses were performed under the supervision of an experienced breast pathologist (E.B.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Flura-tagged and TU-tagged mRNA extraction</title><p>Cells or tissues were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM LiCl, 1% LiDS, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT), and mRNAs were extracted using Oligo (dT)<sub>25</sub> magnetic beads following the manufacturer’s protocol. The isolated mRNAs were immunoprecipitated using anti-BrdU antibody (1–5 μg/sample) conjugated with Protein G Dynabeads by overnight incubation at 4°C. The mRNAs were incubated with the antibody bead complex in 0.8X Binding buffer (0.5X Sodium Chloride-Sodium Phosphate-EDTA (SSPE) with 0.025% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1–2 hr in a rotator. Subsequently, beads were washed twice with Binding buffer, twice with Wash buffer B (1X SSPE with 0.05% Tween 20), once with Wash buffer C (TE with 0.05% Tween 20), and once with TE buffer. The bound mRNAs were eluted in 200 μl of 100 μg/mL BrdU for 45 min in a shaker at room temperature. The eluted RNAs were purified using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA was eluted in 100 μl RNAase free water. The Flura-tagged RNA elute were re-precipitated as described above, and eluted in 12.5 μl final volume. The RNA was either reverse-transcribed using cDNA kit-First Strand Transcriptor following the manufacturer’s protocol, or used for Flura-Seq. TU-tagged mRNAs were purified as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miller et al.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper is interesting, though both reviewers commented that the uniqueness of the technique was overstated and raised technical questions that should be addressed in a revised manuscript. I have summarized the specific points from the reviewers that should be addressed.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study presents a new technique called Flura-seq for transcriptomic analysis of rare cell populations in tissues. This approach is based on 5-FU labeling of nascent RNAs in cytosine deaminase-expressing cells. After validating the approach in cell lines it was used to characterize the transcriptome of rare metastatic cells in vivo. They describe organ specific gene expression signatures and focus on the fact that lung micrometastatic cells have higher expression levels of electron transport chain as well as antioxidant genes, and confirm these findings in human breast cancer metastases.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) With recent advances in single cell RNA sequencing, please discuss how this technique differs and, if possible, comment on how it performs in comparison to the more widely used single cell RNA sequencing approaches. A discussion of where Flura-Seq should be used instead of scRNA-seq would increase the impact of the paper.</p><p>2) Given that Flura-seq requires the overexpression of cytosine deaminase and uracil phosphoribosyl transferase, the administration of 5FU and thymine and a relatively short-term assay, these limitations should be more fully discussed. Also, the authors should not completely discount existing approaches that are relevant to these questions including laser capture microdissection/RNA-seq and SLAM-ITseq.</p><p>3) In Figure 3C, it was noted that only 53 to 74% of the aligned reads were mapped to the human genome after IP in 5-FC treated mice. Does it mean that 26 to 47% of the reads are derived from contaminating mouse reads? What does this mean for the efficacy of the staining and IP purification? Can one then trust that all the human reads correspond to stained RNA of actively transcribed genes with such a noisy technique? How good is the qPCR to assess the signal-to-noise ratio of the technique (for example Figure 3B) and why is there such a discrepancy between Figure 3B and 3C results?</p><p>4) In Figure 4D, it was claimed that lung micrometastases have the highest content of unique transcriptional activity. However, what is lacking is an objective quantification of this uniqueness. This result is the reason why the remainder of the paper focuses on the specificity of the lung versus brain metastases and electron transport chain (ETC)/antioxidant gene expression levels, so this should be more convincing.</p><p>5) Please comment on whether the main findings could be explained by the higher oxygen levels in the lung tissue compared to the brain and mammary fat pad. It is well known that high oxygen can lead to high levels of oxidative stress. This seems to be confirmed by the basal 4-HNE, GPX1 and NRF2 stainings in normal lung tissue, which are equally high as in the lung metastases and higher than in normal brain tissue (Figure 5C, E, F). Finally, in the comparison of in vitro cultures for example, the high oxygen levels could also be responsible for the loss of differences in the transcriptional profiles of ex vivo cultures from different organs (Figure 4B).</p><p>6) In co-culture experiments to assess the sensitivity of Flura-seq (Figure 1F), could the authors comment on why there isn't higher signal of human housekeeping genes in the samples when there are 10-fold more human cells?</p><p>7) Many of the RNAs downregulated in TGFb control samples are also reduced in the Flura-seq samples, which seems surprising given the short 30 minute 5-FC labeling period. Was the signal for these genes low relative to the control samples, as expected? To assess this, it would be helpful to see the normalized count values for each condition in the supplemental tables (not just fold-change). Also, are there differentially expressed transcripts identified by Flura-seq that are not found in the control samples? Are they known TGF-b targets? Potential false-positives?</p><p>8) Please clarify or reference how the 24 genes for the NRF2 signature were selected.</p><p>9) Please ensure that statistical significance of the results is addressed throughout, including in Figure 1F (where the SD is large), 2C, and 3B-C.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43627.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) With recent advances in single cell RNA sequencing, please discuss how this technique differs and, if possible, comment on how it performs in comparison to the more widely used single cell RNA sequencing approaches.

In the revised manuscript, we have added more details on the application of scRNA-seq in studying rare cells and highlighted its limitations that can be addressed by Flura-seq. Comments to this effect are included in the Introduction (third paragraph) and Discussion sections (subsection “Flura-seq as an in situ transcriptomic technique with broad biological applications”). Briefly, scRNA-seq requires disruption of tissue microenvironment to obtain single cells, and thus altering in situ transcriptiomic information. Furthermore, the low transcript coverage and the inapplicability to tissue and cell types that cannot be isolated into single cells remains a limitation of scRNA-seq.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given that Flura-seq requires the overexpression of cytosine deaminase and uracil phosphoribosyl transferase, the administration of 5FU and thymine and a relatively short-term assay, these limitations should be more fully discussed. Also, the authors should not completely discount existing approaches that are relevant to these questions including laser capture microdissection/RNA-seq and SLAM-ITseq.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Flura-seq may alter certain transcripts because of CD and UPRT expression and 5-FC treatment. Therefore, it is critical to validate the discovery made by Flura-seq by alternative methods such as immunostaining, as shown in the present work. We acknowledge this caveat in the Discussion (subsection “Flura-seq as an in situ transcriptomic technique with broad biological applications”). We have discussed the utility and limitations of laser capture microdissection/RNA-seq and SLAM-ITseq in the Introduction (third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 3C, it was noted that only 53 to 74% of the aligned reads were mapped to the human genome after IP in 5-FC treated mice. Does it mean that 26 to 47% of the reads are derived from contaminating mouse reads? What does this mean for the efficacy of the staining and IP purification? Can one then trust that all the human reads correspond to stained RNA of actively transcribed genes with such a noisy technique? How good is the qPCR to assess the signal-to-noise ratio of the technique (for example Figure 3B) and why is there such a discrepancy between Figure 3B and 3C results?</p></disp-quote><p>The remaining 26 to 47% of the reads in Figure 3C are indeed from contaminating mouse reads. The primary purpose of Flura-seq is to enrich RNAs from the cells of interest. We would like to clarify that in the experiment described in Figure 3C, the mRNAs from human cells were enriched from less than 1% in the input sample (0.003 to 0.08% of total cell numbers; Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, E) to 53 to 74%. Bioinformatic filtering based on the enrichment relative to input can remove all the reads coming from mouse sequences (Figure 3D) without significant effect on human transcript levels (Figure 3D). Such filtering is commonly used with other in situtranscriptomics methods involving immunoprecipitation or other pull down methods (Gay et al., Genes &amp; Development 2013; Doyle et al., Cell 2008).</p><p>In Figure 3B, the signal-to-noise ratio was calculated by obtaining a ratio of the enrichment of human transcript relative to mouse transcripts that is normalized to their corresponding inputs. The data in Figure 3C is not normalized to the corresponding inputs. The normalization likely increased the ratio by 1,000 to 10,000 in Figure 3B, hence there is no discrepancy between Figure 3C and 3D. To avoid confusion, we have changed “signal-to-noise ratio” to “relative fold enrichment” throughout the manuscript including in Figure 3B, and we have clearly stated the normalization to input in the figure legends where applicable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 4D, it was claimed that lung micrometastases have the highest content of unique transcriptional activity. However, what is lacking is an objective quantification of this uniqueness. This result is the reason why the remainder of the paper focuses on the specificity of the lung versus brain metastases and electron transport chain (ETC)/antioxidant gene expression levels, so this should be more convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a new panel to address this point (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). We found 1528 genes upregulated only in lung micrometastases, versus 374 genes in brain micrometastases and 834 genes were commonly upregulated in both tissues compared to mammary tumor. Likewise, 1406 genes were downregulated only in lung micrometastases, versus 275 genes in brain micrometastases and 857 genes commonly downregulated in both tissues compared to mammary tumor. We hope this more clearly presents the rationale for focusing on lung versus brain metastases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please comment on whether the main findings could be explained by the higher oxygen levels in the lung tissue compared to the brain and mammary fat pad. It is well known that high oxygen can lead to high levels of oxidative stress. This seems to be confirmed by the basal 4-HNE, GPX1 and NRF2 stainings in normal lung tissue, which are equally high as in the lung metastases and higher than in normal brain tissue (Figure 5C, E, F). Finally, in the comparison of in vitro cultures for example, the high oxygen levels could also be responsible for the loss of differences in the transcriptional profiles of ex vivo cultures from different organs (Figure 4B).</p></disp-quote><p>It is possible that the higher oxygen concentration in lung is at least partly responsible for higher oxidative stress and the counteracting antioxidative response observed in lung micrometastases. This further emphasizes the value of Flura-seq to capture a difference that is present only in an intact tissue microenvironment. However, we cannot eliminate other microenvironmental factors in the lung as possible contributors to this transcriptional feature. We have addressed this point in the Discussion (subsection “Flura-seq as an in situ transcriptomic technique with broad biological applications”, second paragraph). It is possible that loss of differences in the transcriptional profiles of ex vivo cultures from different organs are due to high oxygen concentration in the culture condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In co-culture experiments to assess the sensitivity of Flura-seq (Figure 1F), could the authors comment on why there isn't higher signal of human housekeeping genes in the samples when there are 10-fold more human cells?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1F, the signal-to-noise ratio was normalized to the corresponding inputs, hence the ratio remained constant between 0.1 and 0.01% human cells as the input increased with immunoprecipitated RNAs. To clarify this, we have plotted the inputs and IP separately in the new Figure 1F which shows the result as expected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Many of the RNAs downregulated in TGFb control samples are also reduced in the Flura-seq samples, which seems surprising given the short 30 minute 5-FC labeling period. Was the signal for these genes low relative to the control samples, as expected? To assess this, it would be helpful to see the normalized count values for each condition in the supplemental tables (not just fold-change). Also, are there differentially expressed transcripts identified by Flura-seq that are not found in the control samples? Are they known TGF-b targets? Potential false-positives?</p></disp-quote><p>A closer analysis revealed that more than 90% of the repressed genes have higher reads in the Flura-seq samples compared to the control samples whereas the fold change is slightly lower in the Flura-seq samples (Supplementary file 2).This suggests that TGF-β repressed genes are regulated at the transcriptional level. This is consistent with previous reports from our lab and others that SMADs bind to the <italic>MYC</italic> cis-regulatory elements to repress transcription (Chen et al. Cell 2002; Frederick et al. MCB 2004).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have included normalized count values for all the differentially expressed genes identified in control samples by RNA-seq or Flura-seq samples in Supplementary file 2. Indeed, 575 genes were found to be differentially expressed by more than 2-fold upon TGF-β treatment by Flura-seq compared to 176 genes by RNA-seq. A majority of the genes identified only by Flura-seq show expression in the same direction in the control samples, although less than 2-fold. We have added a new figure panel (new Figure 2C) to illustrate that Flura-seq shows higher fold-change for TGF-β-induced genes, and genes that are identified only by Flura-seq are also induced in the control samples, albeit less than two-fold.</p><p>The genes identified to be induced by TGF-β only in Flura-seq are likely bona fide TGF-β target genes. To test if some of the genes in the list score upon longer TGF-β treatment, we compared the genes identified by Flura-seq to a published data set identifying TGF-β induced genes after 6 h of TGF-β treatment in MDA231 cells (Tufegdzic Vidakovic et al., Cell Reports 2015). Indeed, we found 83 of the genes were identified to be induced 6 h after TGF-β treatment (Supplementary file 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Please clarify or reference how the 24 genes for the NRF2 signature were selected.</p></disp-quote><p>We generated a custom NRF2 signature by using NRF2 ChIP-seq data curated by Cistrome Database. We chose ChIP-seq samples of HeLa cells, which passed all the quality controls defined by the Cistrome Database (sequence quality, mapping quality, library complexity, ChIP enrichment, signal to noise ratio, regulatory regions). The 24-gene signature was obtained by overlapping the top 100 putative targets in duplicated ChIP-seq samples, which were curated by Cistrome Database. We have cited the paper that reported the ChIP-seq data and described how the target genes were selected in the title of Supplementary file 4, and added more details in the Results section (subsection “Mitochondrial Complex I expression and oxidative stress in lung micrometastatic cells”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Please ensure that statistical significance of the results is addressed throughout, including in Figure 1F (where the SD is large), 2C, and 3B-C.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the statistical significance in all the relevant figure panels.</p></body></sub-article></article>
