Besides the Chl <italic>d</italic>-containing cyanobacterium <italic>Acaryochloris marina</italic>, which was originally isolated from tropical ascidians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miyashita, 2014</xref>) but has now been found in many other habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behrendt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), the discovery of Chl <italic>f</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) and its occurrence in many different cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gan et al., 2015</xref>) has triggered a substantial amount of research on the biochemistry and molecular physiology of Chl <italic>f</italic>-containing cyanobacterial strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Airs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allakhverdiev et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nürnberg et al., 2018</xref>). In comparison, the in situ distribution and activity of Chl <italic>f</italic>-containing cyanobacteria and their role in primary productivity remain largely unexplored. Here, we used a novel combination of hyperspectral imaging, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and chemical imaging of O<sub>2</sub> for high-resolution mapping of the distribution of Chl <italic>f</italic>–containing cyanobacteria and their NIR-driven oxygenic photosynthesis in an intertidal beachrock habitat. Our study gives novel insight into the ecological niche and importance of endolithic Chl <italic>f</italic>-containing cyanobacteria, and indicates that high rates of NIR-driven oxygenic photosynthesis can contribute to primary production in natural biofilm habitats.</p><p>With an in vivo absorption range of 700–760 nm, Chl <italic>f</italic> is the most red-shifted chlorophyll, which was first found in the filamentous cyanobacterium <italic>Halomicronema hongdechloris</italic> isolated from stromatolites in Western Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2012</xref>), and in an unicellular cyanobacterium (strain KC1 related to <italic>Aphanocapsa</italic> spp.) isolated from Lake Biwa, Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akutsu et al., 2011</xref>). However, Bryant and coworkers discovered that the ability to synthesize Chl <italic>f</italic>, far-red shifted phycobiliproteins, and small amounts of Chl <italic>d</italic> can be induced in many different cyanobacteria, including representatives from all five major subdivisons, when grown under far-red light-enriched conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gan et al., 2015</xref>). Such far-red light photoacclimation (FaRLiP) involves remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus via synthesis and modification of pigments and pigment-protein complexes. This remodeling is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level via upregulation of paralogous photosynthesis-related genes in a 21-gene cluster, which seems largely conserved in cyanobacteria exhibiting FaRLiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gan and Bryant, 2015</xref>) and contains genes for a red phytochrome-triggered control cascade of FaRLiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, it was shown that FaRLiP also involves the modification and inclusion of Chl <italic>f</italic> in both PSI and PSII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Itoh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nürnberg et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Besides their strong relevance for exploring the biophysical and biochemical limits and controls of oxygenic photosynthesis, cyanobacteria with Chl <italic>d</italic> and Chl <italic>f</italic> have been employed in speculations on more efficient light harvesting of solar energy, as organisms with red-shifted photopigments can in principle exploit ~20% more photons in the solar spectrum for their photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Blankenship, 2011</xref>). However, FaRLiP involves remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus for better performance under 700–760 nm light and is apparently not induced in absence of NIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gan et al., 2014</xref>), and <italic>Acaryochloris marina</italic> has largely exchanged its Chl <italic>a</italic> with Chl <italic>d</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miyashita, 2014</xref>). Hence, the selective benefit of employing Chl <italic>d</italic>, Chl <italic>f</italic>, and red-shifted phycobiliproteins in oxygenic photosynthesis may be more related to the capability of exploring special ecological niches in the shadow of other oxygenic phototrophs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohkubo and Miyashita, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kühl et al., 2005</xref>). But we know nothing about the quantitative role of cyanobacteria with far red-shifted photopigments for primary production in natural habitats.</p><p>There is a growing database of cyanobacteria and habitats wherein Chl <italic>f</italic> has been detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, only three studies have reported on the actual distribution and niche of Chl <italic>f</italic>-containing cyanobacteria in their natural habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trampe and Kühl, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohkubo and Miyashita, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrendt et al., 2019</xref>), and hitherto NIR-driven oxygenic photosynthesis by Chl <italic>f</italic>-containing cyanobacteria has not been demonstrated in situ. This is experimentally challenging, as cyanobacteria exhibiting FaRLiP respond to the local light microenvironment and typically occur in dense proximity with other oxygenic phototrophs harboring a plethora of photopigments fueling Chl <italic>a</italic>-based oxygenic photosynthesis by visible light (400–700 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohkubo and Miyashita, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrendt et al., 2015</xref>). Consequently, photosynthetic activity of Chl <italic>f</italic>-containing cyanobacteria has only been measured on strains (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nürnberg et al., 2018</xref>) or enrichments isolated from their natural habitat (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrendt et al., 2015</xref>). Detailed microscopic investigation of pigmentation in cyanobacteria with Chl <italic>f</italic> has also largely been limited to culture material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Majumder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Beachrock is a widespread sedimentary rock formation on (sub)tropical, intertidal shorelines, where a mixture of biogeochemical processes cement carbonate sands together into a porous solid matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vousdoukas et al., 2007</xref>). The upper surface of light-exposed beachrock is colonized by dense microbial biofilms dominated by cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cribb, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Díez et al., 2007</xref>), which are embedded in a dense exopolymeric matrix covering the surface and endolithic pore space of the beachrock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Petrou et al., 2014</xref>). We previously demonstrated the presence of Chl <italic>f</italic>-containing cyanobacteria in an endolithic niche below the surface biofilm along with the ability of beachrock samples to upregulate their Chl <italic>f</italic>-content upon incubation under NIR, indicative of FaRLiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trampe and Kühl, 2016</xref>). Here, we correlate the spatial organization of Chl <italic>f</italic>-containing cyanobacteria with direct in vivo measurements of their NIR-driven O<sub>2</sub> production in a natural beachrock habitat.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Hyperspectral reflectance imaging on vertical cross-sections of beachrock submerged in seawater (23°C and salinity = 35) revealed the presence of a dense ~1 mm thick surface biofilm with high amounts of Chl <italic>a</italic>, while a more patchy zone containing Chl <italic>f</italic>, and less Chl <italic>a</italic> was found below the surface biofilm of the beachrock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), exhibiting localized hot spots of Chl <italic>f</italic> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Using similar NIR levels as used in the present study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrendt et al.

Assuming a NIR-driven oxygenic photosynthesis rate of 10 µmol O<sub>2</sub> L<sup>−1</sup> min<sup>−1</sup> (=nmol O<sub>2</sub> cm<sup>−3</sup> beachrock min<sup>−1</sup>) in a 1 mm thick layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and a conservative estimate of beachrock porosity of ~0.4 in the uppermost 1–2 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vousdoukas et al., 2007</xref>), we can estimate the areal NIR-driven gross photosynthesis rate to (10 µmol L<sup>−1</sup> min<sup>−1</sup> × 0.4×0.1 cm x 10<sup>−6</sup> x 10000 x 60 =) ~0.24 mmol O<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> beachrock h<sup>−1</sup>. Total beachrock primary productivity remains to be quantified in detail, but it is well known that beachrock habitats sustain high grazing rates of epifauna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McLean, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McLean, 2011</xref>) and herbivorous reef fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stephenson and Searles, 1960</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, beachrock primary production has only been reported by Krumbein, who studied a Red Sea beachrock habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krumbein, 1979</xref>). Based on his data on O<sub>2</sub> exchange under water covered conditions (cf. Figure 13 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krumbein, 1979</xref>), we estimated a total gross photosynthesis of ~10 mmol O<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> beachrock h<sup>−1</sup>. While based on several crude assumptions and comparing different habitats, these rough calculations indicate that NIR-driven photosynthesis could account for at least 2–3% of total areal photosynthesis in beachrock habitats. Furthermore, we note that we base this estimate on O<sub>2</sub> dynamics over minutes measured in a thin agar layer adjacent to the actual phototrophic cells, which will underestimate the true dynamics (see Materials and methods), and our measurements were conducted at low NIR levels that may not represent saturated photosynthesis rates. Obviously, the realized total daily primary productivity will also be strongly modulated by the actual biomass distribution, porosity and diel light exposure within the beachrock, as well as the pronounced diel cycles of environmental conditions on the beachrock platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Petrou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schreiber et al., 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, we argue that our experimental data point to a significant role of NIR-driven oxygenic photosynthesis in beachrock and potentially other endolithic habitats.</p><p>Based on the origin of isolates shown to employ FaRLiP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), it has been speculated that shaded soils, caves, plant canopies and thermal springs may be prime terrestrial habitats for cyanobacteria with Chl <italic>f</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Beachrock is widespread in intertidal zones on a global scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vousdoukas et al., 2007</xref>) and our study shows that these habitats may present a major ecological niche for cyanobacteria with FaRLiP and NIR-driven oxygenic photosynthesis in marine intertidal habitats. While we present the hitherto most detailed insight into the distribution and in situ activity of Chl <italic>f</italic>-containing cyanobacteria in intact samples from a natural habitat, there is now a need for more precise characterization of the microenvironment and metabolic activities of microorganisms in beachrock to assess the quantitative importance of NIR-driven oxygenic photosynthesis for system productivity.</p><p>The present study and the few other studies of natural habitats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) demonstrate that a key trait of such cyanobacteria is the formation of biofilms in strongly shaded environments below other algae, cyanobacteria or terrestrial plants, or in the twilight zone of caves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrendt et al., 2019</xref>). It remains to be explored to what extent the presence of cyanobacteria with FaRLiP-capability or constitutive high Chl <italic>d</italic> levels play a role for overall photosynthetic productivity in such habitats. That is, does the complementary photopigmentation of cyanobacteria with far-red shifted photopigments in the ‘understory’ of other oxygenic phototrophs lead to higher photosynthetic efficiency and productivity at the community/system level, for example in analogy to plant canopies? Such studies are complicated due to the compacted and often stratified structure of the natural communities, but the novel combination of structural and chemical imaging presented here seems a promising toolset for unraveling the ecological importance of FaRLiP and cyanobacteria with far red-shifted photopigments.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

The fourth derivative of the hyperspectral reflectance stacks was calculated using the Look@MOSI software, yielding the relative extent of light attenuation at wavelengths representative for Chl <italic>a</italic> (670–680 nm) and Chl <italic>f</italic> (718–722 nm) absorption. The resulting grayscale images were then used for construction of false‐color-coded images, showing the spatial coverage of the two defined spectral signatures. The extraction of spectral information from areas of interest (covering hotspots of Chl <italic>f</italic>) was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polerecky et al., 2009</xref>). The resulting images were first cropped to be of computational sizes for the Look@MOSI software, and were stitched back together in Photoshop CC 2015.1.2 (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose, CA) after computation. The relative absorbance/abundance of Chl <italic>f</italic> was quantified by scaling of the relative extent of light attenuation as calculated above for Chl <italic>f.</italic> Pixel intensity values from the earlier calculated gray scale images were assigned a scale ranging from 0 to 1, and were finally displayed using a color scaled lookup table in ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). This yielded false-color coded images with values between 0 and 1, displaying a relative measure of Chl <italic>f</italic> abundance according to the amount of light attenuation obtained from Chl <italic>f</italic> absorption.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Pigment analysis</title><p>Two vertically separated layers from the black beachrock zone were analyzed for composition of photopigments, that is in the top layer (0–2 mm) and in a more distinct green deeper layer (2–5 mm). Samples from the two layers were kept at −80°C until further analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trampe and Kühl, 2016</xref>). Homogenized beachrock samples were transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for pigment extraction. The pigments were extracted by adding 0.8 mL acetone:methanol (7:2 vol:vol) to each tube, which was brieﬂy vortexed, and then kept on ice for a 2 min extraction time in darkness. Subsequently, samples were sonicated in an ice-cooled high-power ultrasonicating bath (Misonix 4000; Qsonica LLC., Newtown, CT) in darkness for 10 s consisting of 10 pulses of 1 s ON and 1 s OFF (with an amplitude setting of 100%), and were then centrifuged at ~12,000 g for 1 min in a mini centrifuge (MiniSpin, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). The supernatant was ﬁltered through a 0.45 µm pore size syringe ﬁlter (Satorius Minisart SRP 4 ﬁlter; Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany), and 200 µL filtrate was then mixed with 15 µL ammonium acetate (1 M) in 0.3 mL HPLC vials. 100 µL of the extract was then immediately injected into the HPLC. Pigment extracts were separated and analyzed in the HPLC by a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD and Agilent 1260 Infinity; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) fitted with Ascentis C18 column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, Sigma-Aldrich cat. no. 581325 U), detecting specific absorption wavelengths of compounds. The extracts were run at a constant column temperature of 30°C for 69 min., and a flow-rate of 1.0 mL min<sup>−1</sup> in a changing gradient of solvent A (methanol:acetonitrile:water, 42:33:25, vol/vol/vol), and solvent B (methanol:acetonitrile:ethylacetate, 50:20:30, vol/vol/vol), where the mobile phase changed linearly from 30% solvent B at the time of injection to 100% at 52 min, staying at 100% for15 min before returning to 30% within 2 min. Spectral comparisons from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Blankenship (2011)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trampe and Kühl (2016)</xref> were used for identification of Chl <italic>a</italic>, Chl <italic>d</italic>, and Chl <italic>f</italic> from the HPLC chromatograms. Elution profiles from the absorbance detector signal at 430 nm were used to calculate pigment ratios from the derived integrated peak areas for each of the identified pigments of interest, using the manufacturer’s software (OpenLAB CDS ChemStation Edition; Agilent Technologies).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Amplicon sequencing</title><p>A survey of the microbial communities in the beachrock was performed based on high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA community gene pool, of which details will be published elsewhere. In brief, genomic DNA was isolated from portions (0.1–0.4 g) of freshly sampled black beachrock using the DNeasy PowerLyzer PowerSoil kit (QIAGEN, Germany). Costal seawater was sampled by filtration of 2.3 L seawater onto Supor-200 polyethersulfone membrane disc filters (47 mm diameter, 0.2 µm pore size; PALL cat. no. 63025) and genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy PowerWater kit (QIAGEN, Germany). T<underline>h</underline>is genomic DNA was used as template for PCR amplification with primers targeting the V3 and V4 regions of the bacterial/chloroplast 16S rRNA gene. The PCR products were sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq platform and the sequence data analyzed with the Qiime2 pipeline at the S<underline>e</underline>ction for Microbiology, Department of Biology, University of Copenhagen.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Experimental setup for O<sub>2</sub> imaging</title><p>The experiments were performed in a small glass aquarium (15 × 10 × 15 cm<sup>3</sup>) filled with filtered seawater (salinity 35). A lid with two inlets was placed on the aquarium. One inlet was used as a gas inlet, the second inlet was used to insert a robust fiber-optic O<sub>2</sub> sensor (OXR430 connected to FireSting GO<sub>2</sub> meter; PyroScience GmbH, Aachen, Germany) for monitoring the O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the bulk seawater. The beachrock sample was mounted with a smooth vertical cross-section parallel to the aquarium glass wall. The camera used for O<sub>2</sub> imaging and the excitation LED were placed perpendicular to the sample cross-section. Actinic NIR illumination was provided by a 740 nm LED (LZ4-40R300; LED Engin, Inc, San Jose, CA; HBW 25 nm) providing a NIR photon irradiance (integrated over 715–765 nm) of 28 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, as measured with a calibrated spectroradiometer (MSC15, GigaHertz-Optik GmbH, Germany).</p><p>A beachrock sample painted on one side with the O<sub>2</sub> sensor nanoparticle paint (see below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>) was placed into the aquarium, and the surrounding seawater was flushed with pure N<sub>2</sub> for at least 30 min to completely remove O<sub>2</sub>, as confirmed by the fiber-optic O<sub>2</sub> sensor. After anoxic conditions were reached, measurements of the change in O<sub>2</sub> concentration over the beachrock cross section in darkness and under NIR illumination were performed under stagnant anoxic conditions in the surrounding seawater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). Images were recorded at 5 min intervals relative to onset of actinic light or darkness. This enabled both recording of steady-state O<sub>2</sub> images in light and darkness (=homogeneous anoxia), as well as the dynamic change in O<sub>2</sub> distribution upon NIR irradiation. Proxies for the NIR-driven net photosynthesis, P<sub>N</sub>, and apparent dark respiration, R<sub>D</sub>, were calculated by subtracting images taken with a 5 min interval just before and after onset or eclipse of the actinic NIR light, respectively. Gross photosynthesis was estimated as P<sub>G</sub> = P<sub>N</sub>+|R<sub>D</sub>|. To avoid any interference from surrounding light reaching the sample, the entire setup was covered thoroughly with black fabric. All measurements were performed at room temperature (23 ± 1°C).</p><p>It should be noted that the O<sub>2</sub> measurements were done over minute intervals in the thin agar layer with O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nanoparticles coating the beachrock with the photosynthetic cells, where the observed O<sub>2</sub> levels are affected both by cell activity and diffusional exchange with the surroundings. This leads to some diffusive smearing, and the observed dynamics in O<sub>2</sub> and thus the derived reaction rates likely represent an underestimate of ‘true’ reaction rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Santner et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Chemical imaging of O<sub>2</sub></title><sec id="s3-6-1"><title>Imaging system and application of O<sub>2</sub> sensor nanoparticles</title><p>We used recently published protocols for imaging O<sub>2</sub> concentration over complex bioactive surfaces by coating beachrock cross-sections with O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive luminescent sensor nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koren et al., 2016</xref>) followed by ratiometric luminescence imaging of the coated surface with a DSLR camera (without NIR filter and with a 530 nm long pass filter mounted on the camera objective) during brief excitation with blue LED light (445 nm).

(2016)</xref>, but the porous structure of the beachrock prevented saturation and a homogenous coating of cross-sections. Instead, we coated beachrock cross-sections (as well as glass slides used for calibration) with a thin (&lt;1 mm thick) layer of agarose containing O<sub>2</sub> sensor nanoparticles, inspired by earlier work on seagrass rhizosphere O<sub>2</sub> imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koren et al., 2015</xref>). For this, 40 mg of UltraPure Low Melting Point Agarose (16520100; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thermofisher.com/">https://www.thermofisher.com/</ext-link>) was melted in 2 mL filtered seawater, which was then kept at ~35°C and mixed with 2 mL of a pre-warmed (~35°C) O<sub>2</sub> sensor nanoparticle solution (2.5 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>). This ‘sensor paint’ was then applied on a vertical cross-section of a beachrock sample (or a glass microscope slide) using a small paint brush. After solidification of the sensor paint, the coated beachrock was transferred into the aquarium and left there prior to experiments to allow acclimatization. Throughout sample preparation, exposure to high light levels was avoided. This procedure produced a stable homogenous coating of beachrock cross-sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>) with an O<sub>2</sub> sensing layer that could be easily peeled off, enabling the same sample to be used for subsequent CLSM or hyperspectral imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6-3"><title>Imaging and image analysis</title><p>The O<sub>2</sub>-dependend red emission, and the constant green reference emission from the sensor nanoparticles in the paint during brief excitation pulses from a blue LED (445 nm) were recorded in RGB pictures with a DSLR camera system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larsen et al., 2011</xref>) imaging coated beachrock sections or coated microscope glass slides. Mapping of NIR-driven oxygenic photosynthesis was done by O<sub>2</sub>-imaging of beachrock biofilm cross-sections immersed in anoxic (N<sub>2</sub> flushed) seawater under illumination with a NIR LED. Acquired RGB images were split into red, green, and blue channels and analyzed using the freely available software ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link>). First, the red channel images (recording the O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive emission of the sensor nanoparticles) and the green channel images (recording the constant emission of a reference dye in the nanoparticles) were divided using the ImageJ plugin Ratio Plus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/ratio-plus.html">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/ratio-plus.html</ext-link>) in order to get ratio images, R (=red channel/green channel).</p><p>Background fluorescence from Chl <italic>a</italic> (at &gt;680 nm) excited by the excitation light (445 nm) during O<sub>2</sub> imaging can potentially overlap with the red channel. Furthermore, such Chl <italic>a</italic>-based photosynthesis may also generate a small amount of O<sub>2</sub> during the brief excitation pulse. To account for such potential artefacts, and as we aimed to visualize changes in O<sub>2</sub> concentration (ΔO<sub>2</sub>) attributed to Chl <italic>f</italic>-based photosynthesis, all ratio images were subtracted from ratio images recorded after 45 min in the dark in anoxic water, R<sub>dark</sub>, (ΔR = R<sub>dark</sub> R). Further, to avoid any cross-talk of NIR into the red channel, O<sub>2</sub> images were always recorded during a brief (&lt;1 s) darkening during image acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6-4"><title>Calibration</title><p>For calibration, a glass slide was coated with a thin layer of the O<sub>2</sub> sensor nanoparticle paint. The coated slide was placed in the experimental setup with aerated seawater and imaged at identical camera settings as used for beachrock sample imaging. Subsequently, the O<sub>2</sub> content of the seawater was decreased by flushing it intermittently with N<sub>2</sub> gas under constant monitoring by a fiber-optic O<sub>2</sub> microsensor (OXR430 connected to FireSting GO<sub>2</sub> meter; PyroScience GmbH, Aachen, Germany). Calibration curves were obtained from RGB images of the calibration target recorded under a series of known seawater O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (ranging from 100% air saturation to anoxia) using a ROI covering the whole field of view. Plotting R versus O<sub>2</sub> showed an exponential decay with increasing O<sub>2</sub> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>), as commonly observed for optical O<sub>2</sub>-sensing materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koren and Kühl, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moßhammer et al., 2019</xref>). To enable calibration of background corrected experimental ratio images (see above), we generated a calibration curve by plotting ΔR (=R<sub>anoxic</sub> R) versus O<sub>2</sub> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8B</xref>), which was fitted with an exponential function in Image J. The ΔR images from the experiments were then calibrated in Image J using the exponential fit in the calibration function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Confocal laser scanning microscopy</title><p>After the O<sub>2</sub>-imaging, the nanoparticle paint was peeled off the beachrock sections, and a smaller subsection of the flat beachrock cross section (previously used for hyperspectral or chemical imaging) was imaged at 200x and 400x magnification on an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon A1R, Japan) with the beachrock cross section facing downwards in a 35 mm coverslip glass bottom petri dish (World Precision Instruments). Care was taken to keep the beachrock cross sections intact and oriented to enable identification and alignment of CLSM data to areas of interest exhibiting NIR-driven O<sub>2</sub> production.</p><p>The microscope was equipped with a motorized xyz sample holder and was able to acquire hyperspectral fluorescence image stacks over a large sample area by sequential scanning, with subsequent automatic stitching of the acquired images in the microscope software (NIS elements AR, Nikon, Japan). The sample was excited by 488 nm laser light (laser power 1.2 mW, 0.5 frames per seconds) and spectral fluorescence (500–750 nm) was acquired at 10 nm resolution by the spectral PMT-array detector on the CLSM microscope. First, the beachrock cross-section was imaged at 200x magnification obtaining hyperspectral image stacks of 5 confocal layers (step size 5 µm) for each field of view. Scanned images were stitched to make a 4 mm x 11 mm large image and were then de-convolved (numerical aperture of 0.75, pinhole size 177.52, refractive index 1 for 26 emission channels 500–750 nm) using the NIS elements AR software (Version 4.60, Nikon, Japan). Subsequently, a more detailed scan of the same cross sectional area was done at 400x magnification (laser power 1.2 mW, 0.063 frames per seconds), and spectral fluorescence (500–750 nm) was acquired at 10 nm resolution by the spectral PMT-array detector on the CLSM microscope obtaining hyperspectral fluorescence images in one z- plane.</p><p>We note that the beachrock cross-section was not perfectly smooth and single plane recording at 400x led to less signal in parts of the cross-section, where the surface was out of focus. Nevertheless, we could still identify most of the hot spots recorded at 200x magnification and resolve the shape of individual cells and cell clusters. Scanned images were stitched to make a 3.5 mm x 5.2 mm large image and were then de-convolved (numerical aperture of 1.00, pinhole size 177.52, refractive index 1.515 for 26 emission channels 500–750 nm). Regions of interest (ROI) were selected from the obtained cross-sectional scans and spectral fluorescence features were captured and false-color coded for particular regions of interest. CLSM scans were false-color coded to highlight the fluorescence of Chl <italic>a</italic> (690–700 nm), phycobiliproteins (650–660 nm), and Chl <italic>f</italic> (740–750 nm; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Majumder et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the excellent technical assistance in the field and during laboratory measurements by Sofie L Jakobsen, Veronica M Petersen, and the staff at Heron Island Research Station.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor.

This important result extends relatively recently acquired biochemical/biophysical observations into a natural context. Based on previous studies, and it is likely that these organisms are cyanobacteria. Assuming this is the case, this is an exciting finding because it expands the known cyanobacterial niche in nature, and potentially may be relevant to future bioengineering efforts to optimize solar energy conversion. The consensus of the reviewers is that the technical approaches in the paper are rigorous, but a few essential revisions are needed prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The identity of Chl <italic>f</italic> must be verified unambiguously. It appears that pigment analyses were performed on identical samples in Trampe and Kuhl, 2016. At a minimum, the authors should revise the text to clearly site this reference so readers can find this data; but the inclusion of pigment analyses from these samples, as supplemental data, would be preferred.</p><p>2) The authors assert that the Chl <italic>f</italic>-containing organisms in their samples are cyanobacteria. While this seems highly likely, based on the literature, this study would nonetheless be significantly strengthened by inclusion of supporting data linking the measurements in these samples to organismal identity. To this end, please include 16S rDNA data. If there is a compelling reason why 16S rDNA data are unnecessary to link Chl <italic>f</italic> to cyanobacteria in these natural samples, please articulate this in the text.</p><p>3) Finally, the current manuscript is less accessible to a broad biology audience than it should be. Only at the end of the Results/Discussion section, do the authors explain why a general audience should find this interesting. These points are very good, and should be made earlier. Before diving into the substantive details (which should remain), please revise so as to motivate non-experts to keep reading by explaining the significance of this work in more general terms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50871.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The identity of Chl f must be verified unambiguously.

We used HPLC-based pigment analysis (according to Trampe and Kühl, 2016) on black beachrock samples (taken from the same beachrock zone as the samples used for hyperspectral and O<sub>2</sub> imaging). Analysis of chromatograms and absorption spectra of different eluent fractions showed the presence of Chl <italic>a</italic> and <italic>f</italic>, and minor amounts of Chl <italic>d</italic> in the black beachrock (both in the upper 2 mm and in a deeper green endolithic zone 2-5 mm below the beachrock surface), while other chlorophylls like Chl <italic>b</italic> and <italic>c</italic> (indicative of microalgae) were absent in the samples. The amount of Chl <italic>f</italic> relative to Chl <italic>a</italic> in these samples ranged from 3.5% in the mixed surface layer to 6% in the deeper green layer, while Trampe and Kühl, 2016, reported Chl <italic>f</italic> amounts ranging from 0.5 to 5% of Chl <italic>a</italic> in beachrock.</p><p>Changes in the revised manuscript:</p><p>New text was added in the Results and Discussion section (paragraph one) and in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript (subsection “Pigment analysis”), and we added new supporting data (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) showing chromatograms and the absorption spectra of the Chl <italic>f</italic> fraction in the pigment extracts from the beachrock.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors assert that the Chl f-containing organisms in their samples are cyanobacteria.

We performed amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene pool in the upper 2 mm and in a deeper green endolithic zone 2-5 mm below the surface of black beachrock collected from the same beachrock zone as the samples used for hyperspectral and O<sub>2</sub> imaging and pigment analysis. These analyses showed no presence of OTUs related to microalgal chloroplasts in the black beachrock, while amplicon sequencing of the local seawater revealed a substantial fraction of OTUs that clustered with algal chloroplasts (Supplementary file 2). Hence, our NIR-driven O<sub>2</sub> production in the beachrock could be assigned to the presence of cyanobacteria. Interestingly, several of the predominant OTUs were related to cyanoabacteria capable of far-red light photoacclimation (FaRLiP) and synthesis of Chl <italic>f</italic>. However, we note that a detailed investigation of the microbial diversity in beachrock was beyond the scope of the present study and a more comprehensive study based on both metagenomics and 16S amplicon sequencing is currently underway.</p><p>Changes in the revised manuscript:</p><p>New text was added in the Results and Discussion section (paragraph two) and in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Amplicon sequencing”) of the revised manuscript, and we added new supporting data (Supplementary file 2) listing the most prominent OTUs in the beachrock and seawater samples relating to cyanobacteria and microalgal chloroplasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Finally, the current manuscript is less accessible to a broad biology audience than it should be.
