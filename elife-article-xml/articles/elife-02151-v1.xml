well-studied, but many species also contain an additional cluster of chemoreceptors in their cytoplasm. Although the cytoplasmic cluster is essential for normal chemotaxis in some organisms, its structure and function remain unknown. Here we use electron cryotomography to image the cytoplasmic chemoreceptor cluster in <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> and <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>. We show that just like transmembrane arrays, cytoplasmic clusters contain trimers-of-receptor-dimers organized in 12-nm hexagonal arrays. In contrast to transmembrane arrays, however, cytoplasmic clusters comprise two CheA/CheW baseplates sandwiching two opposed receptor arrays. We further show that cytoplasmic fragments of normally transmembrane <italic>E. coli</italic> chemoreceptors form similar sandwiched structures in the presence of molecular crowding agents. Together these results suggest that the 12-nm hexagonal architecture is fundamentally important and that sandwiching and crowding can replace the stabilizing effect of the membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02151.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02151.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02151.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many bacteria swim through water by rotating tiny hair-like structures called flagella. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, if all the flagella on the surface of a bacterium rotate in a counterclockwise fashion, then it will swim in a particular direction, but if the flagella all rotate in an clockwise fashion, then the bacterium will stop swimming and start to tumble.</p><p>Bacteria use a combination of swimming and tumbling in order to move towards or away from certain chemicals. For example, a bacterium is able to move towards a source of nutrients because it is constantly evaluating its environment and will swim forward for longer periods of time when it recognizes the concentration of the nutrient is increasing. And if it senses that the nutrient concentration is decreasing, it will tumble in an effort to move in a different direction.</p><p>Many bacteria, such as <italic>E. coli</italic>, rely on proteins in their cell membrane called chemoreceptors to sense specific chemicals and then send signals that tell the flagella how to rotate. These transmembrane receptors and their role in chemotaxis—that is, movement towards or away from specific chemicals in the environment—have been widely studied. However, other bacteria also have chemoreceptors in the cytoplasm inside the bacterial cell, and much less is known about these.</p><p>Now, Briegel et al. have examined the cytoplasmic chemoreceptors of two unrelated bacteria, <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> and <italic>V. cholera</italic>, and found that the cytoplasmic chemoreceptors arrange themselves in hexagonal arrays, similar to the way that transmembrane chemoreceptors are arranged. However, the cytoplasmic chemoreceptors arrange themselves in a two-layer sandwich-like structure, whereas the transmembrane chemoreceptors are arranged in just one layer. The next step is to understand how chemical binding causes these arrays to send their signals to the motor. A complete understanding of this signaling system may ultimately allow scientists to re-engineer it to draw bacteria to targets of medical or environmental interest, such as cancer cells or contaminated soils.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02151.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02151.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>electron cryotomography</kwd><kwd>correlative microscopy</kwd><kwd>chemotaxis</kwd><kwd><italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM101425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Briegel</surname><given-names>Ariane</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>Grant J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oikonomou</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Yi-Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>Grant J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM085288</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Lynmarie K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Christopher W</given-names></name><name><surname>Armitage</surname><given-names>Judith P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Nikon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Christopher W</given-names></name><name><surname>Armitage</surname><given-names>Judith P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bacterial cytoplasmic chemoreceptors assemble into a sandwich of two hexagonally packed arrays.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteria sense and respond to their environment through a chemotactic system that translates ligand binding (stimulus) into preferential flagellar rotation (response), leading to either running in a favorable direction or tumbling to find a more favorable direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hazelbauer et al., 2008</xref>). Briefly, ligands bind to the periplasmic domains of the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), either directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Milburn et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Englert et al., 2010</xref>) or via periplasmic binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tam and Saier, 1993</xref>). This results in conformational changes that traverse the length of the MCP, through one or more HAMP (histidine kinases, adenyl cyclases, MCPs, and some phosphatases) domains and the cytoplasmic coiled-coil signaling domain to either activate or inactivate a histidine kinase, CheA, bound at the distal tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wadhams and Armitage, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kentner and Sourjik, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hazelbauer et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The bacterial chemotactic system is best understood in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, where system components are located in a single operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Silverman and Simon, 1976</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, CheA is a 5-domain (P1-P5) protein that functions as a homodimer. When activated by the MCP in unfavorable environments, CheA undergoes autophosphorylation and then transfers the phosphoryl group to one of two response regulators. One of these, CheY, binds the flagellar motor when phosphorylated, switching the motor’s direction from clockwise to counter-clockwise and thus increasing the frequency of tumbling to find a more favorable direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turner et al., 2000</xref>). The other response regulator, CheB, is a methylesterase whose activity is stimulated by phosphorylation. Its activity is opposed by the constitutively active methyltransferase CheR and the balance of these two activities determines the methylation state of specific glutamate residues in the MCPs. These methylations confer adaptation on the system, modulating its response based on recent environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kleene et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Toews et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lupas and Stock, 1989</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>E. coli,</italic> MCPs associate into trimers of dimers that span the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Studdert and Parkinson, 2004</xref>) and complex with CheA and the coupling protein CheW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This results in hexagonally packed trimers-of-receptor-dimers surrounding a ring of alternating CheA P5 domains and CheW. Neighboring rings are linked together by CheA P3 dimerization domains to form extended hexagonal lattices – the so-called transmembrane chemoreceptor arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briegel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2012</xref>).

The best-studied case is <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic>, in which there are three operons, two of which are essential for normal chemotaxis in laboratory conditions. One of these operons, CheOp<sub>2</sub>, encodes components of the chemotaxis array associated with the transmembrane MCPs. The other, CheOp<sub>3</sub>, encodes components of a cytoplasmic chemotaxis cluster including CheB, CheR, CheY, CheW, two atypical CheA proteins (CheA<sub>3</sub> and CheA<sub>4</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Porter et al., 2008</xref>), and a soluble chemoreceptor, TlpT. Each of the CheA proteins in the cluster lacks canonical domains compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> CheA: CheA<sub>3</sub> contains only the P1 and P5 domains separated by a 794 amino acid sequence of unknown structure, whereas CheA<sub>4</sub> lacks the P1 and P2 domains. CheA<sub>4</sub> can transfer phosphoryl groups to P1 of CheA<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Porter et al., 2008</xref>). Both CheA<sub>3</sub> and CheA<sub>4</sub> are required for chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wadhams et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Porter et al., 2008</xref>). A second MCP homolog lacking any transmembrane domain, TlpC, is encoded in CheOp<sub>2</sub>. Fluorescent fusions of both TlpT and TlpC localize to a single cytoplasmic focus at mid-cell, which divides and is segregated during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wadhams et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2003</xref>). CheA<sub>3</sub> and CheA<sub>4</sub>, along with CheW<sub>4</sub> and a CheR, also localize to this cytoplasmic cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wadhams et al., 2003</xref>). CheW<sub>4</sub> and TlpT are required to form the cluster, and the positioning of the cluster depends on the ParA homolog PpfA, which is encoded next to TlpT in CheOp<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>). PpfA is a chromosome-associated ParA-like ATPase and controls the localization and segregation of the cytoplasmic cluster through an interaction with the N-terminus of TlpT, which is thought to stimulate the ATPase activity of PpfA in a ParB-like manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>). Sequence analysis of TlpT suggests that the 567 amino acid protein forms a classical MCP coiled-coil structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Zhulin, 2007</xref>). The 580 amino acid TlpC lacks significant homology to the canonical MCP structure and lacks a recognizable HAMP domain or methylation region.</p><p>Cytoplasmic chemoreceptors are not unique to <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic>. The genomes of many bacterial species encode MCP homologs lacking transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ulrich and Zhulin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wuichet and Zhulin, 2010</xref>). However, the organization and precise function of these cytoplasmic chemoreceptor clusters remain unknown. In the case of <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic>, it has been speculated that cytoplasmic MCPs modulate chemotactic response based on the current metabolic state of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armitage and Schmitt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Porter et al., 2008</xref>), while the inputs of cytoplasmic receptors in other organisms such as <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> are less clear.</p><p>In the case of <italic>E. coli</italic> transmembrane arrays, the membrane is thought to be important for proper assembly and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller and Falke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Draheim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin and Hazelbauer, 2012</xref>). We were therefore interested in how cytoplasmic receptors cluster in the absence of organizing membrane. We used tomography of freeze-substituted, plastic-embedded sections; immunoelectron microscopy; electron cryotomography (ECT) of both intact cells and cryosections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gan and Jensen, 2012</xref>); and correlated cryogenic fluorescence light microscopy and ECT (cryo-FLM/ECT) to characterize the structure of cytoplasmic chemoreceptor clusters in two bacteria: <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic>.

To gain confidence in our identification, we used a strain in which some cytoplasmic chemotaxis components are overexpressed. This strain exhibited chemotaxis in swim plate assays, indicating that the limited overexpression did not significantly impair chemotactic function. By fluorescence light microscopy (FLM), short cells contained single fluorescent foci and long cells two foci, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wadhams et al., 2002</xref>). In tomograms of cryosections of these cells, we observed similar structures to those seen in WT cells but with greater length, appearing in cross-section as a curved, double-layered sandwich approximately 27 nm wide (measured from density peak-to-peak; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02151.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Tomography of <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> cryosections reveals cytoplasmic clusters.</title><p>Tomographic slices of cryosections through <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> cells expressing TlpC-GFP at wild-type (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) or overexpressed (<bold>C</bold>–<bold>E</bold>) levels.

Since whole <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> cells are too thick and dense to image by ECT with high resolution, we flattened them by gentle lysis. However, unlike transmembrane receptors that remain well-organized following cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briegel et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2013</xref>), fluorescent foci were not observed after lysis, indicating disruption of the cytoplasmic receptor cluster. We reasoned that in the absence of membrane, the density of the cytoplasm might play an important role in stabilizing cytoplasmic clusters.

In this study, we describe the structure of cytoplasmic chemoreceptor arrays in two distantly related bacterial species, <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. Notably, cytoplasmic arrays in both species display a hexagonal arrangement of receptor-trimers-of-dimers, with 12 nm center-to-center spacing that is identical to that of transmembrane chemoreceptor arrays, suggesting a fundamental utility for this architecture. Whereas the transmembrane array is embedded in the membrane with a CheA/W baseplate at the receptors’ membrane-distal tips and ligand-binding domains in the periplasm, the cytoplasmic arrays assemble as a sandwich, with two CheA/W baseplates flanking two sheets of MCPs that interact in the middle, presumably at their ligand-binding domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). No membrane is associated with these arrays. The identity of the outer baseplates as CheA/W is supported by our observation of the same structure in in vitro preparations from <italic>E. coli</italic>, where only three proteins are present: receptor fragments, CheA, and CheW. The similarity of the array organization in membrane-bound and cytoplasmic clusters suggests a common organizational theme, in which either the membrane or the crowded environment of the cytoplasm provides necessary stability to the conserved architecture of a 12 nm hexagonal array of receptor-trimers-of-dimers.</p><p>Interestingly, while transmembrane arrays remain intact upon cell lysis, presumably due to the stabilizing effect of the membrane, cytoplasmic arrays fall apart unless molecular crowding agents are added. This suggests that cellular crowding contributes to the stability of the array and may be an important factor in assembly of these, and likely other, cellular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ellis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou, 2013</xref>). We observe the same requirement for molecular crowding (mimicking the cellular environment) in our in vitro preparation from <italic>E. coli</italic>. This supports the idea that chemoreceptor interactions can be enhanced by membrane binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shrout et al., 2003</xref>), but in the absence of a membrane, this can be achieved by molecular crowding and sandwiching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fowler et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The hexagonal order of the <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cytoplasmic arrays, with 12 nm center-to-center spacing, is identical to the arrangement of transmembrane chemoreceptor arrays in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briegel et al., 2009</xref>), as well as to arrays formed from cytoplasmic fragments of <italic>E. coli</italic> receptors. This indicates that the atypical <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> CheA homologs (CheA<sub>3</sub> and CheA<sub>4</sub>), despite their sequence anomalies, assemble in a similar fashion to canonical CheA proteins, including the three CheA homologs found in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ulrich and Zhulin, 2010</xref>)<italic>.</italic> From what is known in other organisms, <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> CheA<sub>3</sub> and CheA<sub>4</sub> likely intercalate into CheA/W rings with their P5 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briegel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Natale et al., 2013</xref>). This packing would position both atypical CheA homologs in close proximity to each other, thereby facilitating phosphotransfer from the P4 domain of CheA<sub>4</sub> to the P1 domain of CheA<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>The most striking difference between cytoplasmic chemoreceptor arrays in <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is their curvature.

This indicates that curvature may not affect performance unduly, with functioning arrays found in linear, concave, and convex conformations. However, there may be an upper limit of curvature tolerance. The discontinuities we observe in cytoplasmic arrays may result from ‘breaking’ of the CheA/W baseplate on one side under conditions of extreme curvature.</p><p>In transmembrane arrays, ligand-binding domains are located in the periplasm. In cytoplasmic arrays, we assume that these domains are located in the middle of the sandwich. This configuration is unlikely to inhibit access to signaling molecules as the receptor arrangement is much more porous than the outer membrane, which extracellular ligands need to cross in order to bind transmembrane arrays. The signaling implications of this arrangement remain unclear, but it is intriguing to think that ligand binding in the middle of the sandwich could result in CheA activation in both baseplates, facilitating amplification.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p>Strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> strains were cultured in succinate medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sistrom, 1960</xref>) supplemented with 25 µg/ml kanamycin and 30 µM IPTG (to induce expression of plasmid-borne FliA from pIND [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ind et al., 2009</xref>]) at 30°C with shaking. <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains were cultured in LB media at 37°C with shaking. <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cells were then mixed 1:1 with another bacterial species grown in Ca-HEPES buffer (25 mM HEPES, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> at pH 7.6) and grown for an additional 16 hr at 30°C with shaking.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02151.011</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Strains used in this study</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02151.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02151.011</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Strain</th><th>Relevant genotype</th><th>Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>JPA543</td><td>WS8N TlpC-GFP</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wadhams et al., 2002</xref></td></tr><tr><td>JPA543OE</td><td>TlpC-GFP pIND-FliA</td><td><italic>This study</italic></td></tr><tr><td>JPA1558OE</td><td>TlpT-YFP pIND-FliA</td><td><italic>This study</italic></td></tr><tr><td>WS8NOE</td><td>pIND-FliA</td><td><italic>This study</italic></td></tr><tr><td>JPA1330OE</td><td>ΔppfA TlpC-GFP pIND-FliA</td><td><italic>This study</italic></td></tr><tr><td>MKW1383</td><td>N16961 ΔctxAB::kan</td><td>Matthew Waldor</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Light microscopy</title><p>Cells were immobilized on agarose pads and imaged using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY) using a 100× oil immersion lens and images were recorded on a Coolsnap HQ<sup>2</sup> camera (Photometrics, Tuscon, AZ) operated using the Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, Chicago, IL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Vitreous cryosectioning</title><p>Vitreous cryosections were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ladinsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ladinsky, 2010</xref>).

The pellets were transferred to aluminum sectioning stubs and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p><p>Semi-thin (90 nm) cryosections were cut at −110°C with a FC6/UC6 cryoultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems) using a Cryo-Immuno diamond knife (Diatome-US). Cryosections were picked up in a drop of 2.3M sucrose in PBS and transferred to Formvar-coated, carbon-coated, glow-discharged 100-mesh copper-rhodium grids. Sections were incubated for 30’ with 10% calf serum in PBS to block nonspecific antibody binding sites, then labeled with a monoclonal antibody against GFP (Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc. Gilbertsville PA) diluted in 5% calf serum in PBS, followed by a colloidal gold (15 nm) conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (BBI International, Grand Forks ND). After labeling, the sections were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate and stabilized with 1% methylcellulose. Immunolabeled sections were imaged with a Tecnai T12 electron microscope at 120 keV. Tomographic tilt-series were acquired and analyzed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title><italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> cell lysis</title><p>Mid-log phase cells of strain JPA1558 were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in crowding buffer (20% sucrose, 7% PEG-8000, 4% trehalose, 25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.0) with 2 mg/ml lysozyme, then incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Following addition of 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 250 µM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mg/ml DNase I, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C, collected by centrifugation and resuspended in crowding buffer for imaging. Identical results were obtained with a different crowding agent, replacing the PEG-8000 and trehalose with 10% PVP and treating the cells as before.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Correlative cryo-FLM/ECT</title><p>Cells of strain JPA1558 were lysed as described above and plunge-frozen on copper EM finder grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools), loaded into a cryo-FLM stage (FEI company) and imaged on a Nikon 90Ti inverted microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY) using a 60x ELWD air objective lens and a Neo 5.5 sCMOS camera (Andor Technology, South Windsor, USA) using the NIS Elements software (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY). The grid was then transferred to the cryo-EM and tilt series were recorded from the same cells imaged by FLM previously. The grid was kept below −150°C at all times during the imaging process.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Purification and assembly of <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis components</title><p>Cytoplasmic fragments of the Tar receptor (CF<sub>4Q</sub>), CheW, CheA, and CheY were expressed and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fowler et al., 2010</xref>). The Tar fragments contained methylation-mimicking glutamine residues at the four major sites of receptor methylation. Protein purity was assessed with SDS-PAGE analysis, and protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). PEG 8000 (Fluka) and D-(+)-trehalose (Sigma–Aldrich) were prepared as 40% (wt/vol) stock solutions in deionized water and passed through a 0.22-μm syringe filter prior to use. A modified kinase buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.5) was used for sample preparation.</p><p>Formation and characterization of kinase-active ternary complexes followed published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fowler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mudiyanselage et al., 2013</xref>), further specified as follows. PEG-mediated CF<sub>4Q</sub> complexes were prepared by incubating 50 μM CF<sub>4Q</sub>, 20 μM CheW, and 12 μM CheA with final concentrations of 7.5% wt/vol PEG 8000 and 4% wt/vol trehalose. CF<sub>4Q</sub> was added last to minimize CF-promoted aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Montefusco et al., 2007</xref>) and samples were incubated overnight at 25°C in a circulating water bath and subjected to an enzyme-coupled assay and gel-based cosedimentation assay to check for phosphorylation activity and ternary complex formation. Kinase activity of PEG-mediated CF<sub>4Q</sub> complexes was similar to that observed for complexes assembled via binding to vesicles.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank Lee Rettberg and Audrey Huang for experimental help, and Dr Matthew Waldor for kindly providing strain MKW1383.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has summarized the critical concerns that will need to be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>The consensus is that the structural analysis of bacterial chemoreceptor arrays in the manuscript represents a significant advance in understanding bacterial chemosensing and chemotaxis mechanism. However, the main conclusions of the manuscript would be significantly strengthened by experiments directed at imaging native <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> arrays and/or confirming the identity of the cholera structures by immuno-EM. The reviewers have also requested that you revise the text of your manuscript to include previous electron cryo-tomography work on bacterial chemotaxis receptor arrays with associated citations. In addition, there are several excellent suggestions made by Reviewer 3 for organizational and text revisions that would improve the clarity of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>This is a well conceived and written study that represents a fundamental new contribution to the field of bacterial chemosensing and chemotaxis. The ECT structural characterization of cytoplasmic chemotaxis arrays is novel and highly significant. Certainly the work is worthy of publication in a top journal.</p><p>This reviewer can see only two significant issues worth considering:</p><p>1) The MS suggests that the planar organization of polar and cytoplasmic complexes is dominated by the CheA/W base plate. However, the fact that naked receptors form hexagonal arrays (zippers) suggests that the receptors have an intrinsic propensity to form hexagonal arrays, perhaps by providing hydrophobic binding sites arranged on the outside of the trimer with the proper symmetry for hexagonal assemblies. It is likely an oversimplification to say that the array organization is provided primarily by the base plate – the structure of the receptor trimer of dimers is essential too.</p><p>2) If possible, it would be nice to include images of native <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> arrays, in order to confirm the hypothesis that the observed curvature of the GFP-fusion arrays is due to the non-native GFP component. Perhaps these native arrays could be visualized by FLM/ECT in the lysed cell system using a non-hydrolyzable, fluorescent ATP derivative or an anti-Che antibody. However, this could be beyond the scope of the current MS.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>1) The authors describe the architecture of cytosolic chemoreceptors in <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic>, and also present some structural data from the cytosolic chemoreceptor of <italic>V. cholera</italic> in vivo and purified <italic>E. coli</italic> Tar chemoreceptors lacking transmembrane regions. Interestingly, the authors show that these structures, previously demonstrated to localize to discrete foci in cells, all share a common back-to-back architecture of hexagonally packed arrays. They propose that the (periplasmic, in membrane-bound arrays) ligand binding domains are thus minimally exposed to the cytosol. Through the finding that soluble domains of <italic>E. coli</italic> receptors form a similar structure, the authors argue that it may represent a default, low-energy configuration of chemoreceptor arrays rather than a specific evolutionary adaptation.

However, the main conclusions of the manuscript would be significantly strengthened by experiments directed at imaging native</italic> R. sphaeroides <italic>arrays and/or confirming the identity of the cholera structures by immuno-EM. The reviewers have also requested that you revise the text of your manuscript to include previous electron cryo-tomography work on bacterial chemotaxis receptor arrays with associated citations. In addition, there are several excellent suggestions made by reviewer 3 for organizational and text revisions that would improve the clarity of the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We wish to thank both the editors and the reviewers for excellent comments and suggestions on our manuscript.</p><p>Imaging native <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> arrays is very challenging – the structures are very rare and only part of each cell is captured in a cryosection. We did, however, share the reviewers’ concern that the fluorescent tags we used to facilitate identification by correlative cryo-FLM/ECT could introduce artifacts. Therefore, we have added tomography of <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> overexpressing native, untagged chemotaxis components (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The cytoplasmic arrays observed in this strain were indistinguishable from those imaged previously, showing that the curvature of the array is not an artifact of fluorophore-tagging.</p><p>We didn’t confirm the identity of the <italic>V. cholera</italic> structures by immuno-EM because we don’t know which of the multiple chemoreceptors lacking predicted transmembrane regions in the genome are found in the clusters, and we don’t have an appropriate antibody. However, we feel that it is unnecessary due to the striking conservation of the array architecture with trimer-of-receptor- dimers at the vertices of a 12 nm hexagonal lattice, a conformation that is universally conserved among bacterial transmembrane arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briegel et al, 2009</xref>). Also, we observe an identical arrangement of two hexagonally packed arrays sandwiched between CheA/CheW baseplates in the complexes formed by normally transmembrane <italic>E. coli</italic> receptor fragments.</p><p>We have included all relevant citations to our previous ECT work on chemoreceptor arrays. We have incorporated the text revisions suggested by Reviewer 3.</p><p>In addition, we have also added another experiment demonstrating that the ParA homolog PpfA, responsible for segregating the cytoplasmic clusters, does not induce curvature of the <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> arrays.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>This is a well conceived and written study that represents a fundamental new contribution to the field of bacterial chemosensing and chemotaxis. The ECT structural characterization of cytoplasmic chemotaxis arrays is novel and highly significant. Certainly the work is worthy of publication in a top journal</italic>.</p><p><italic>This reviewer can see only two significant issues worth considering</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The MS suggests that the planar organization of polar and cytoplasmic complexes is dominated by the CheA/W base plate. However, the fact that naked receptors form hexagonal arrays (zippers) suggests that the receptors have an intrinsic propensity to form hexagonal arrays, perhaps by providing hydrophobic binding sites arranged on the outside of the trimer with the proper symmetry for hexagonal assemblies. It is likely an oversimplification to say that the array organization is provided primarily by the base plate</italic> – <italic>the structure of the receptor trimer of dimers is essential too</italic>.</p><p>Thank you. We agree that the basic structure of trimers-of-receptor-dimers is fundamental and we have included the following sentence in the text: “The similarity of the array organization in membrane-bound and cytoplasmic clusters suggests a common organizational theme, in which either the membrane or the crowded environment of the cytoplasm provides necessary stability to the conserved architecture of a 12 nm hexagonal array of receptor-trimers-of-dimers.”</p><p><italic>2) If possible, it would be nice to include images of native</italic> R. sphaeroides <italic>arrays, in order to confirm the hypothesis that the observed curvature of the GFP-fusion arrays is due to the non-native GFP component. Perhaps these native arrays could be visualized by FLM/ECT in the lysed cell system using a non-hydrolyzable, fluorescent ATP derivative or an anti-Che antibody. However, this could be beyond the scope of the current MS</italic>.</p><p>We have included electron tomography of untagged <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> arrays, confirming that the curvature of the array is not an artifact induced by fluorophore tagging.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) The authors describe the architecture of cytosolic chemoreceptors in</italic> R. sphaeroides<italic>, and also present some structural data from the cytosolic chemoreceptor of</italic> V. cholera in vivo <italic>and purified</italic> E. coli <italic>Tar chemoreceptors lacking transmembrane regions. Interestingly, the authors show that these structures, previously demonstrated to localize to discrete foci in cells, all share a common back-to-back architecture of hexagonally packed arrays. They propose that the (periplasmic, in membrane-bound arrays) ligand binding domains are thus minimally exposed to the cytosol. Through the finding that soluble domains of</italic> E. coli <italic>receptors form a similar structure, the authors argue that it may represent a default, low-energy configuration of chemoreceptor arrays rather than a specific evolutionary adaptation. However, the biological significance of this architecture is not discussed. Moreover, the interesting finding that the</italic> R. sphaeroides <italic>structure is curved is clouded by the lack of data from wild-type cells</italic> – <italic>the authors acknowledge this curvature may be due to the fluorescent proteins fusions</italic>.</p><p>To clarify, we didn’t mean to propose that the ligand-binding domains are minimally exposed to the cytosol. Rather, we propose that this configuration is unlikely to inhibit access to signaling molecules as the receptor arrangement is much more porous than the outer membrane, which extracellular ligands need to cross in order to bind transmembrane arrays. To further clarify, we didn’t mean our text to suggest that this structure represents a default, non-evolved configuration. Rather, because we observe it both in cytoplasmic clusters and in soluble, normally transmembrane receptors from <italic>E. coli,</italic> we think this represents a fundamentally conserved architecture that has been evolved to optimize signaling properties. We have added electron tomography of untagged arrays, confirming that the curvature is not an artifact of fluorescent fusions.</p><p><italic>2) The initial description of receptor topology is somewhat confusing. Would a diagram be helpful? Some detailed information about the domains may not be necessary</italic>.</p><p>We have added a diagram of the receptor topology in both membrane-bound and soluble chemoreceptor arrays in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We have also taken out the overly detailed description of the kinase domains, as suggested.</p><p><italic>3) What new information does</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>add? It is helpful to have an orthogonal technique, but perhaps this could be combined with</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref>.</p><p>The images of the embedded samples shown in the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">figure 2</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) portray a greater percentage of the overall cell, thereby lending better spatial localization information of the cytoplasmic clusters. Since the clusters are relatively small and have low contrast, reducing these panels to fit them into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> will make them too difficult to interpret. Additionally, we have added new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), showing that the curved architecture of the Rhodobacter cytoplasmic clusters is neither an artifact of fluorophore tagging nor a result of the ParA homolog PpfA. These experiments were done using the same technique as used for the sample shown in the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and are therefore directly comparable.</p><p>For these reasons, we would like to keep the figure as a separate figure. We have added the following sentence to the text: “It was difficult to identify the location of the structure in the cryosections, so we turned to a technique that would allow us to place the structure in the context of the whole cell. [...] The positions of the structures in the cells were consistent with FLM observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>) strengthening our confidence in the identification of the cytoplasmic array.”</p><p><italic>4) The claim is made, based on</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>, that the receptors are localized to the 1/4 and 3/4 positions. This should be backed up by quantification, and the mentioned similarity to light microscopy appropriately cited</italic>.</p><p>Due to the necessarily low numbers of cells imaged, we don’t feel justified in making a quantitative claim here. Accordingly, we have scaled back our claim in the text and added references as suggested.</p><p><italic>5) One novel aspect of the</italic> R. sphaeroides <italic>chemoreceptor arrays is that they appear to be curved (though, as already mentioned, the exact nature of this curvature was not clear to me until later in the manuscript).

While large portions are devoted to structural details, the functional significance of these details is lacking</italic>.</p><p>The full biological significance of cytoplasmic arrays remains unclear. As we discuss in the text, over half of all genomes sequenced of motile bacteria have more than one putative chemosensory pathway and many of these encode putative soluble chemoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wuichet &amp; Zhulin, 2010</xref>). In the case of <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic>, in which the cytoplasmic cluster is essential for normal chemotaxis, it has been speculated that cytoplasmic MCPs modulate chemotactic response based on the current metabolic state of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armitage &amp; Schmitt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Porter et al., 2008</xref>), while the inputs of cytoplasmic receptors in other organisms such as <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> are still unclear. The results shown here and elsewhere reveal that the highly conserved 12 nm hexagonal array of receptor-trimers-of-dimers is a characteristic of both cytoplasmic and membrane-bound chemoreceptor arrays, and thus is likely key to the high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, cooperativity, and feedback control of this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duke &amp; Bray, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li &amp; Weis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gestwicki &amp; Kiessling, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sourjik &amp; Berg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sourjik &amp; Berg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li &amp; Hazelbauer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Endres &amp; Wingreen, 2006</xref>).
