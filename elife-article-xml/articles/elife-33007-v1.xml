Among the genes identified are several components of the cAMP signaling pathway, including <italic>dunce</italic> (a cAMP specific phosphdiesterase), <italic>rutabaga</italic> (a cAMP specific adenylyl cyclase)<italic>, Dc0</italic> (Protein Kinase A, PKA) and <italic>CREBB</italic> (a transcription factor) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for these and others) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McGuire et al., 2005</xref>). In adult flies, these genes act in cells of the mushroom bodies (MB), higher brain centers responsible for associating conditioned stimuli (CS) and unconditioned stimuli (US), and for storing these associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dubnau and Tully, 1998</xref>). Associations are stored by the MB Kenyon cells (KC), which are activated by CS—such as odors—via cholinergic transmission from olfactory projection neurons and US—such as electric shock—via dopamine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McGuire et al., 2005</xref>). Acetylcholine receptors permit Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into KCs, while dopamine receptors activate a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Calmodulin-responsive adenylyl cyclase (<italic>rutabaga</italic>), which acts as a coincidence detector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Busto et al., 2010</xref>). cAMP produced by Rutabaga activates PKA and triggers a downstream MAP kinase cascade, which leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor CREBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Impey et al., 1999</xref>). CREBB binds to cAMP response elements (CRE), activating the transcription of genes required for long term memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeZazzo and Tully, 1995</xref>).</p><p>CREBB is phosphorylated by several kinases, including PKA and CamKII, two kinases known to be involved in memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Horiuchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mayr and Montminy, 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Here we describe the identification of a novel gene <italic>Meng-Po</italic> (<italic>MP</italic>), that is required for memory formation but not for learning. The MP protein regulates the stability of CREBB together with PKA. In the absence of MP the protein stability of CREBB is affected, and removing a single copy of <italic>MP</italic> and <italic>PKA</italic> leads to a dramatic loss of CREBB and memory formation. In addition, overexpression of MP strongly promotes memory formation, indicating that MP is not only required but that it also plays an instructive role in memory formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genes encoding protein kinases expressed in MB in adult brain and behavioral consequences of RNA interference</title><p>To identify novel protein kinases involved in learning/memory, we developed a strategy that allows us to determine which kinases are expressed in MBs.

These MiMICs contain a swappable cassette, allowing integration of any DNA using <underline>r</underline>ecombinase-<underline>m</underline>ediated <underline>c</underline>assette <underline>e</underline>xchange (RMCE). We replaced these cassettes with a Trojan exon encoding <italic>SA-T2A-GAL4</italic> to permit the detection of cells expressing the kinase-encoding genes using <italic>UAS-mCD8::GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diao et al., 2015</xref>). Of the 27 putative protein kinase genes screened, we found 12 that are expressed in MBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To determine if these 12 kinases expressed in MB play a role in learning and memory we knocked down their expression using <italic>UAS-RNAi</italic> expressed under the control of the MB-selective <italic>OK107-GAL4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>) and tested the performance of learning and 3 hr memory in knockdown flies upon an olfactory aversive conditioning assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Pavlovian olfactory aversive learning requires coincidence detection of a conditioned stimulus (CS), an odor, and an unconditioned stimulus (US), an electric shock. Through a single training session using a T-maze assay in which flies are exposed to 12 CS-US pairings in one min, flies can associate CS with US and learn to avoid the odor paired with electric shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tully and Quinn, 1985</xref>). After training, flies can learn (tested immediately) and form an intermediate-term/3 hr memory (tested after 3 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Margulies et al., 2005</xref>). We identified two putative kinases, <italic>CG11221</italic> and <italic>wallenda</italic> (<italic>wnd)</italic>, which when knocked down, cause significant reductions in performance index for 3 hr memory, but not for learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref>).

By shifting flies between these temperatures we can reversibly eliminate the tagged protein from MB neurons. Hence, the protein is present during development and early adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,a’</xref>), avoiding developmental requirements. The temperature shift leads to a loss of MP in 5 day old flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b’</xref>).

Moreover, this enhancement is specific to 24 hr LTM, and not 24 hr ARM induced by 3-times mass training (3x MT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,d’</xref>). Thus, MP is not only necessary for LTM, but also is also promoting LTM formation.</p><p>Given that <italic>CREBB</italic> is a central player in LTM formation, we tested its activity in MB during <italic>MP</italic> overexpression using a previously described luciferase assay.

Hence, PKA and MP may work together in a coherent feedforward loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mangan et al., 2003</xref>) to upregulate CREBB activity and support LTM formation. To assess possible synergistic interactions between <italic>PKA</italic> and <italic>MP</italic>, we simultaneously reduced the protein levels of both MP and the catalytic subunit of PKA by creating <italic>MI03008,Pka+/MP+,Pka-C1<sup>B10</sup></italic> heteroallelic flies, and assessed the levels of CREBB protein by Western blot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fropf et al., 2013</xref>).

Although heavily studied in neuronal function, <italic>new</italic> &quot;upstream&quot; information that affects CREB activity is rare, and this work adds to this small fraction of the more than 12,000 PubMed citations on CREB. The authors demonstrate that MP activity is required for long-term memory (LTM) formation, but not learning or anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM). It's requirement in LTM formation is most likely because of an indirect effect on CREBB (or dCREB-2) stability or translation. Protein kinase A phosphorylates MP in vitro, and they probably work together to affect the levels of CREBB protein. The experiments are well conceived, although there is some confusion about the design of the behavioral experiments that were done. This issue is a major one <italic>if</italic> the different groups that constitute a figure were not done simultaneously. One behavioral control experiment is missing (regardless of whether the different groups were all done simultaneously or not).</p><p>The other suggested experiment would clarify that removing the MP kinase decreases the CREBB (or dCREB2) transcriptional activity, or the amount of the activator subspecies, consistent with its effect on memory formation. One version of this experiment is straightforward and requires the use of published antibodies.

(comments #1-2)</p><p>The rest of the comments just require changes to verbiage or adding some background verbiage, and some simple answers to experimental details that are missing. (comments #3-6)</p><p>1)The presentation of data is confusing. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>, it is very hard to tell if all of the different experimental groups were trained and tested together, or separately in subgroups, as implied by the spacing between the sets of histograms. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> (middle set of histograms) there are 9 different genotypes/induction regimens/treatments that are shown. Were all 9 groups done together, or have the authors grouped them to make statistical comparisons easier? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, Panel c', there are 6 different experimental groups, while in 3B, Panel d' there are 10 different groups. If they were done all at once, this should be stated, and the comparisons should be presented so that the reader can walk through the results one parameter at a time. For example, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> (middle panel), numbering the histograms 1-9 (as well as having the color code) and referencing the comparisons in the text would be helpful. The significance could then be described in the figure legend (e.g. 2 vs. 3, ** p &lt; 0.01; 3 vs. 7, 8 or 9 etc.). This would facilitate the comparison between groups if they are referenced (by number) in the text.</p><p>More traditionally, when the experiments are done with a subset of the samples (one parameter at a time), this reviewer counts 4 different experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> (middle set of histograms): a) the normal score for 3h memory when flies are maintained at 18 degrees, b) the effect of genotype on 3h memory when flies are shifted to 28 degrees, c) the effect of temperature shift on ARM/ASM, and d) the recovery when flies are shifted from 28 back down to 18 degrees. For experiment (a), a control that is missing is the demonstration that the wild-type and experimental flies have a normal distribution of ARM/ASM (+ cold shock) when they are maintained at 18 degrees. Experiment (b) would involve groups 3, 7, 8, and 9. Experiment (c) would involve groups 3, 4, 5, and 7, while experiment (d) would involve groups 2, 5 and 6. However, each separate experiment should have the appropriate controls.</p><p>Whether done simultaneously or in subgroups, the control for experiment (a) [+/- cold shock on the wild-type background and experimental flies at 18 degrees] needs to be done. This experiment would show that there is nothing in the background stock that disrupts the normal fractional distribution of ARM and ASM.</p><p>2) To complete the demonstration that mutant MP decreases CREBB (or dCREB2) activity, the authors need to either show that CRE-luciferase activity decreases in the MP mutant background, or that the amount of the dCREB2 nuclear activator decreases in the mutant background. The first can be done using a mushroom body-driven FLP transgene, combined with the reporter. This binary combination would allow the authors to test the MP mutant (or wild-type chromosome) for an effect on luciferase activity that only originates from the mushroom body.</p><p>For the second possibility, a simple western blot could suffice. Numerous molecular species are made off of the CREBB (or dCREB2) gene, and it is clear that the MP mutant decreases the immunoreactive species shown in their western blots. However, since the relative mobility of molecular weight markers is not shown on the western blots, it is hard to determine if the effects are on the more abundant (and larger) blocker isoforms, the less abundant and faster migrating activator isoforms, or both. It is most likely that the authors show decreases in the blocker (35-40 kd) species. However, in order for their behavioral results to make sense, there should be a decrease in both activator and blocker species in the MP mutant background. The authors should be able to detect a decrease in the amount of the nuclear activator species in their mutant background. This requires using antibodies reported in Fropf et al. (2013, 2014) and making and assaying crude nuclear extracts. This experiment will need considerably more starting material, but that should be easy to obtain for the wild-type and mutant backgrounds. Demonstrating that both blocker and activator decrease in the MP mutant background would complete their correlation/causation links between MP and CREBB.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33007.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) Overview of the proteins required for olfactory aversive learning/memory formation in Drosophila is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> (10xST, b’+CXM, red), MP-GFP knockdown flies performed similarly in a 24-h memory test when compared to control flies.

This indicates that the loss of memory is protein synthesis-dependent.”</p><p>To address if the memory enhancement observed when we overexpress MP is dependent on protein synthesis we performed the following experiments. We overexpressed MP in the MB neurons at 30°C for three days. We then fed these flies cycloheximide for 24 hrs prior and after training and tested LTM 24hrs later using the 3x ST paradigm and found that MP overexpression did not improve 24-h memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, d</xref>’, 3xST, b’+CXM, red). We added the following sentence: “The observed memory enhancement can be erased by feeding flies 35 mM CXM, indicating that enhanced memory is protein synthesis-dependent (3x ST+CXM;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, d</xref>’).” In the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we added: “However, memory enhancement can be erased by feeding flies with cycloheximide.” We added sentences in Materials and methods: “For cycloheximide (CXM, Σ) feeding (DeZazzo and Tully, 1995), 35 mM CXM in 5% glucose was added on Whatman 3 MM filter paper in a bottle with fly food to feed flies overnight prior to performing training sessions. After training, the flies are placed in a vial containing CXM filter paper with fly food for another 24 hrs prior testing.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript describes the identification and functional testing of a new, but conserved, protein kinase in Drosophila memory formation.

Whether done simultaneously or in subgroups.</p></disp-quote><p>At the reviewer’s suggestion, each experiment was done with the appropriate controls and the data are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. However, we would like to state that we originally performed the behavioral assay with the same flies using deGradFP to show protein knockdown and reversibility, and that should have obviated these control experiments. Given that it is the first time that we did perform the experiments with the deGradFP system we performed all the control experiments as requested by the reviewer. The results are exactly as anticipated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The control for experiment (a) [+/- cold shock on the wild-type background and experimental flies at 18 degrees] needs to be done. This experiment would show that there is nothing in the background stock that disrupts the normal fractional distribution of ARM and ASM.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed this control and it is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. We also added a learning assay at 18 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, learning, a’ condition).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To complete the demonstration that mutant MP decreases CREBB (or dCREB2) activity, the authors need to either show that CRE-luciferase activity decreases in the MP mutant background, or that the amount of the dCREB2 nuclear activator decreases in the mutant background. The first can be done using a mushroom body-driven FLP transgene, combined with the reporter. This binary combination would allow the authors to test the MP mutant (or wild-type chromosome) for an effect on luciferase activity that only originates from the mushroom body.</p><p>For the second possibility, a simple western blot could suffice. Numerous molecular species are made off of the CREBB (or dCREB2) gene, and it is clear that the MP mutant decreases the immunoreactive species shown in their western blots. However, since the relative mobility of molecular weight markers is not shown on the western blots, it is hard to determine if the effects are on the more abundant (and larger) blocker isoforms, the less abundant and faster migrating activator isoforms, or both. It is most likely that the authors show decreases in the blocker (35-40 kd) species. However, in order for their behavioral results to make sense, there should be a decrease in both activator and blocker species in the MP mutant background. The authors should be able to detect a decrease in the amount of the nuclear activator species in their mutant background. This requires using antibodies reported in Fropf et al. (2013, 2014) and making and assaying crude nuclear extracts. This experiment will need considerably more starting material, but that should be easy to obtain for the wild-type and mutant backgrounds. Demonstrating that both blocker and activator decrease in the MP mutant background would complete their correlation/causation links between MP and CREBB.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We tested the level of ATG2-CREBB in adult brains of wild type and MP mutants and also tested the levels with Pan-CREBB. We were able to detect the potential CREBB activator with the ATG2-CREBB antibody published by Fropf et al. (2013). The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>. We find that both the Pan-CREBB and ATG2-CREBB anti-bodies detect less CREBBs when MP is reduced as suggested by the reviewer and consistent with our previous data. We added: “We also tested if ATG2-CREBB is affected. […] As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>, we find that both the anti-Pan-CREBB antibody and the antibody recognizing ATG2-CREBB (Fropf et al., 2013) identify a ~30 kDa band that is reduced in <italic>MI03008</italic> mutant brains.’.</p><p>We added sentences in Materials and methods: ‘For detecting the ATG2-CREBB protein (Fropf et al., 2013), 50 adult brains were dissected and collected in 20 μL of the sample lysis buffer and placed at -80 °C for overnight. […] Primary antibodies for ATG2-CREBB (1:1,000)</p><p>(Fropf et al., 2013) was used and detected by HRP conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch).’. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>, we added: “(d) Protein levels of Pan- and ATG2-CREBBs are reduced in <italic>MP</italic> mutant flies. Pan- and ATG2-CREBB protein levels were assessed with anti-Pan- and anti-ATG2-CREBB antibodies. Actin was used as an internal control.”. As recommended by the reviewer we also attempted to detect the proteins in nuclear fractions but failed to detect CREBB with Pan-CREBB and ATG2-CREBB antibodies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
