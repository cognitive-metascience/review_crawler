This may arise from diverse functional traits among species. In fact, genetic diversity within species can have similarly large effects. However, studies of intraspecific genetic diversity have used genotypes varying in several complex traits, obscuring the specific phenotypic variation responsible for community-level effects. Using lines of the wild tobacco <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> genetically altered in specific well-characterized defense traits and planted into experimental populations in their native habitat, we investigated community-level effects of trait diversity in populations of otherwise isogenic plants. We conclude that the frequency of defense traits in a population can determine the outcomes of these traits for individuals. Furthermore, our results suggest that some ecosystem-level services afforded by genetically diverse plant populations could be recaptured in intensive monocultures engineered to be functionally diverse.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04490.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04490.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04490.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants are at the base of many food webs. This means that the different traits and characteristics of the plant species in an ecosystem can have a large impact on the animals and other organisms that live there.</p><p>Individuals within the same plant species often differ in multiple genes. This ‘genetic diversity’ can affect the populations of other organisms in their ecosystem, for example, by altering which species are present, and the number of individuals. However, previous studies that investigated plant genetic diversity in ecosystems used plants that varied in multiple, usually unknown, genetic traits, which made it difficult to identify specific genetic traits in plants that can influence the whole ecosystem.</p><p>One way that plants affect their ecosystems involves how they defend themselves against the herbivores that try to eat them. For example, plants can use sharp spines or harmful chemicals to deter herbivores, or attract predators that will attack the herbivores.</p><p>Here, Schuman et al. carried out a 2-year field study using wild tobacco plants that had been genetically altered to employ different defensive strategies. This was achieved by altering the expression of three genes in the plants in specific combinations. Two of the genes, called <italic>LOX2</italic> and <italic>LOX3</italic>, are required to make most of the chemicals that tobacco plants use to defend themselves against herbivores. The third gene, called <italic>TPS10</italic>, which comes from the crop plant maize, gives plants the ability to release a fragrance that attracts natural predators of their herbivores.</p><p>Except for these specific alterations, the plants were otherwise genetically identical. These plants were then grown either alone, or in groups of five plants, which reflects the normal size of groups of wild tobacco growing in its natural environment. The groups contained mixtures of plants with different gene alterations.</p><p>Schuman et al. found that the expression levels of these genes in individual plants could determine how well the whole group fared in several different measures of plant health and defense. For example, plants lacking <italic>LOX2</italic> and <italic>LOX3</italic> usually appeared to be less healthy and they were less likely to survive long enough to reproduce because they were less able to defend themselves against herbivores. However, if these plants were grown in a group with one plant that expressed <italic>TPS10</italic>, all of the plants in the group looked healthier and were more likely to survive long enough to reproduce.</p><p>Many crops are grown in large fields containing individual plants that are largely genetically identical, which makes them more vulnerable to disease. Schuman et al.'s findings suggest that some of the community-level protective effects provided by diversity in wild populations of plants could be introduced into crop fields by altering the expression of a few specific genes in some individuals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04490.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04490.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Manduca sexta</italic></kwd><kwd>Geocoris spp.</kwd><kwd><italic>Trichobaris mucorea</italic></kwd><kwd>direct and indirect defense</kwd><kwd>diversity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Meredith C</given-names></name><name><surname>Allmann</surname><given-names>Silke</given-names></name><name><surname>Baldwin</surname><given-names>Ian T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Grant to ITB 293926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Meredith C</given-names></name><name><surname>Baldwin</surname><given-names>Ian T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO-ALW 821.02.027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allmann</surname><given-names>Silke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-PEOPLE-2011-IEF-302388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allmann</surname><given-names>Silke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Both the frequency of sesquiterpene-emitting individuals and the defense capacity of individual plants determine the consequences of sesquiterpene volatile emission for individuals and their neighbors in populations of the wild tobacco <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In <italic>The Origin of Species</italic>, Darwin wrote that ‘varieties are species in the process of formation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Darwin, 1876</xref>). We now know that Darwin's ‘varieties’ are polymorphic characters resulting from natural genetic variation within species. The geneticist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dobzhansky (1973)</xref> echoed Darwin's view: ‘It is evident that the differences among proteins at the levels of species, genus, family, order, class, and phylum are compounded of elements that vary also among individuals within a species’. It has also long been known that intraspecific genetic variation in plants can alter ecological community structure; for example, in 1960, De Wit reported that the reproductive output in mixtures of the grass species <italic>Anthoxanthum odoratum</italic> and <italic>Phleum pratens</italic> depended on associations of particular genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Wit, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allard and Adams, 1969</xref>). However, efforts to measure the broader consequences for communities are more recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antonovics, 1992</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haloin and Strauss, 2008</xref>) and include the recently described field of community genetics.</p><p>Community genetics aims to quantify how genetic variation in specific traits affects the structure of ecological communities (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Whitham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haloin and Strauss, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Whitham et al., 2012</xref>). Genes most likely to have community effects are those with a large effect in the foundation species that structure communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Whitham et al., 2006</xref>), and plants are foundation species in almost all communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haloin and Strauss, 2008</xref>). Community genetics is a basic level of investigation—meaning it is close to the basic unit acted on by evolution, the gene—within the larger effort to meet what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haloin and Strauss (2008)</xref> refer to as ‘one of the supreme challenges of biology’: understanding how the feedback loops between community ecology and evolution shape biodiversity.</p><p>The maintenance of biodiversity and the ecosystem services it supports is a matter of increasing concern as the human population grows, and agricultural resource use increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Green et al., 2005</xref>). In a meta-analysis of 446 biodiversity measures taken between 1954 and 2004, of which 312 manipulated plant species biodiversity, species-level biodiversity was shown to positively affect several ecosystem properties including stability, regulation of biodiversity, nutrient cycling, erosion control, and productivity at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Balvanera et al., 2006</xref>). Functional differences among species are often thought to be the source of effects resulting from species-level biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ebeling et al., 2014</xref>). In fact, a growing number of studies has shown that genetic diversity within species can have large effects on ecological community composition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crutsinger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cook-Patton et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Whitham et al. (2012)</xref> refer to the genetically based tendency for particular genotypes to support different ecological communities as ‘community specificity’. Some, or even most, biodiversity effects may be explained through the community specificity of particular genetic traits.</p><p>Four postulates of community genetics provide the roadmap for understanding the community effects of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wymore et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Whitham et al., 2012</xref>): (1) the focal species must have a significant effect on its community or ecosystem, (2) the trait under investigation must be genetically based and heritable, (3) conspecifics differing genetically in this trait must have quantifiably different effects on community and ecosystem processes, and (4) a predictable effect on those community and ecosystem processes must follow when the gene of interest is manipulated. As Koch's postulates first allowed medical researchers to identify disease-causing agents, these postulates allow community geneticists to identify genes responsible for structuring specific aspects of ecological communities. So far, although postulates one through three have been satisfied in several ecological systems, postulate four—the critical step in attributing community functions to specific genes—has been tested in only a handful of systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Whitham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Whitham et al. (2012)</xref> suggest that improved genetic tools will soon permit the widespread testing of postulate four, as has been done for nicotine in the wild tobacco <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic>: an ecological model plant with a transformation system and a well-characterized ecological community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Krügel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Steppuhn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kessler et al., 2008</xref>; reviewed in; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schuman and Baldwin, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we built on deep molecular ecological knowledge of <italic>N. attenuata</italic> to demonstrate that all four postulates for genes controlling a suite of ecologically characterized defense traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kessler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schuman et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, we manipulated direct defenses: traits which directly reduce plant fitness loss to herbivores, and indirect defenses: traits which attract enemies of herbivores which remove or impair herbivores, and thereby indirectly reduce plant fitness loss to herbivores. <italic>N. attenuata</italic>'s direct and indirect defenses, their biosynthesis and ecological functions have been characterized in detail over two decades of research (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schuman and Baldwin, 2012</xref>). The direct defenses comprise a suite of chemical traits, most of which are induced by herbivory via jasmonate signaling, and genetically silencing these defenses causes significant changes in herbivore communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kessler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaquerel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kallenbach et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>N. attenuata</italic> also produces a complex blend of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) which can be parsed into terpenoids, GLVs and other fatty acid derivatives, and aromatics, and are regulated by elicitors in herbivore oral secretions (OS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gaquerel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schuman et al., 2009</xref>). Of these, the jasmonate-regulated sesquiterpene (<italic>E</italic>)-α-bergamotene (TAB) and the GLVs have been shown to reduce herbivore loads by attracting predators, which for the GLVs has also been shown to result in greater plant fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Halitschke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Halitschke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schuman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</xref>). The majority of <italic>N. attenuata</italic>'s direct and indirect chemical defenses can be abolished by silencing the expression of two biosynthetic genes: LIPOXYGENASE 2 (<italic>LOX2</italic>), which provides substrate for GLV biosynthesis; and <italic>LOX3</italic>, essential for jasmonate biosynthesis, and thus also for the expression of most direct defense traits and the emission of TAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kessler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allmann et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We specifically manipulated the expression of genes controlling direct and indirect defense traits in a factorial design by combining the silencing of <italic>LOX2</italic> and <italic>LOX3</italic> with the overexpression of <italic>Zea mays TERPENE SYNTHASE 10</italic> (<italic>TPS10</italic>), which produces TAB and (<italic>E</italic>)-β-farnesene (TBF) as its main products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Köllner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schuman et al., 2014</xref>). This allowed us to independently manipulate total direct and indirect defenses, and the specific volatiles, TAB and TBF. We grew these transgenic, otherwise isogenic genotypes during two consecutive field seasons, both in replicated populations of different compositions, and as individuals.</p><p>Studies of genetic diversity and community specificity most commonly measure the diversity and composition of invertebrate communities on plants, but also invertebrate abundance, and occasionally functional measures such as predation rates (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haloin and Strauss, 2008</xref>). We focused on correlates of plant fitness: plant size, apparent health, flowering, and mortality before reproductive maturity; and on functional measures of the effectiveness of plant defense: total canopy damage from herbivores, herbivore abundance, and predation services received by plants in populations. The functional measures were chosen to reflect our observation of plants' ecological communities in both years. Nearly, all of these measures of plant fitness and interactions with herbivores and their predators were significantly affected not only by the genotype of individual plants, but by neighboring genotypes in populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Data from the study was deposited in Dryad (10.5061/dryad.qj007, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schuman et al., 2015</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genetically engineered phenotypes are maintained in experimental populations</title><p>Transgenic lines manipulated in the emission of TAB, TBF, and GLVs, and the production of total jasmonate-mediated defenses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and associated source data files) were screened and characterized as described in Appendix 1.

LOX2 and LOX3 provide fatty acid hydroperoxides from 18:2 and 18:3 fatty acids (18:2/18:3-OOH) for the synthesis of green leaf volatiles (GLVs) or jasmonic acid (JA) and the jasmonate-derived hormones, respectively. GLVs are released in response to herbivore damage, and jasmonates regulate the production of most anti-herbivore defenses, including trypsin protease inhibitors (TPIs), and other HIPVs.

This apparent protective effect of <italic>TPS10</italic> volatiles was weaker for monocultures of <italic>lox2/3</italic>x<italic>TPS10</italic> plants.

However, the fact that <italic>TPS10</italic> volatiles benefitted only edge plants in these populations indicate that <italic>Geocoris</italic> spp. predators nevertheless distinguished between edge and center plants.</p><p>We conclude that <italic>TPS10</italic> expression had different consequences for plants' indirect defense, depending on whether one or all plants in a population expressed <italic>TPS10</italic>, and whether those plants also emitted other HIPVs.

The attraction of most, or all, predators and parasitoids to HIPVs depends on learned associations between HIPVs and prey: naïve predators are just as likely to respond as they are not to respond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allison and Hare, 2009</xref>). Because <italic>LOX2/3</italic>-deficient plants were heavily attacked by herbivores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), predators could associate <italic>TPS10</italic> volatiles emitted by <italic>lox2/3</italic>x<italic>TPS10</italic> plants with herbivore damage (though damage did not necessarily reflect abundance—see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Because <italic>lox2/3</italic> and <italic>lox2/3</italic>x<italic>TPS10</italic> plants had reduced emissions of other HIPVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and associated source data files, Appendix 2), there were few other volatiles which could provide the basis for learned associations between HIPVs and prey. On the other hand, TPS10 volatiles emitted constitutively by less heavily attacked <italic>TPS10</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) would be less often associated with feeding herbivores than the endogenous HIPVs released only when herbivores attack, and all the more so if <italic>TPS10</italic>-expressing plants supported fewer foliar herbivores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Perhaps because ‘honest’ endogenous HIPVs were also emitted by WT plants, <italic>TPS10</italic> plants had no advantage over WT in attracting predators.</p><p>The concept of honest vs deceptive, or ‘cry wolf’ HIPV emission has been investigated in the context of emission proportionate, or disproportionate to numbers of attacking herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shiojiri et al., 2010</xref>). But what happens when plants ‘cry wolf’ by constitutively emitting volatiles which, in nature, are only associated with herbivore damage? Plants engineered to constitutively emit particular HIPVs can attract more parasitoids when parasitoids are trained to associate engineered volatiles with their prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kappers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schnee et al., 2006</xref>), or when all emitting plants are also experimentally infested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rasmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Degenhardt et al., 2009</xref>). Such studies demonstrate that genetic engineering of HIPVs can enhance indirect defense, but they do not demonstrate that constitutive emission is an effective strategy in the complex environments of agriculture, or nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schuman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xiao et al., 2012</xref>). From an arthropod's perspective, constitutive HIPV emission is oxymoronic. If there is no effort to artificially associate constitutively emitted volatiles with prey, predators, and parasitoids may not learn to respond, or worse, learn to actively ignore the volatile emissions. Whether achieved via genetic methods or synthetic release stations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kaplan, 2012</xref>), constitutive emission is unlikely to enhance indirect defense if prey densities are low, or if plants emit other ‘honest’ HIPVs.</p><p>Moreover, assigning an indirect defense function to HIPVs based on their ability to attract predators or parasitoids to single plants may be misleading. In real populations, the effectiveness of HIPVs likely depends on the density of HIPV emission and the location of emitting plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xiao et al., 2012</xref>). There may be competition among plants in populations either to attract, or to arrest predators and parasitoids of herbivores. Specifically, whether plants benefit from emitting more or less than their neighbors likely depends on the basal level of HIPV emission in a population (low or high), and the location of plants in a population (edge or center). Perhaps, wild-type plants are capable of adjusting their own volatile emission in response to the emission of their neighbors in order to adapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baldwin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yan and Wang, 2006</xref>).

After trapping, charcoal filters were sealed with provided caps and stored at −20°C until transportation to the MPICE, elution, and analysis.

Airflow was started at 8:45 am. Volatiles were trapped for a total of 22 h and filters were exchanged after 12 h, resulting in two samples from each plant for the periods from 9 am to 9 pm (day) and 9 pm to 7 am (stopped before daylight shone on plants, night).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Plant defense phenotypes determine the consequences of volatile emission for individuals and neighbors” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript makes an important contribution to understanding the role of two volatiles. The reviewers identified a few issues that need improvement.</p><p>1) You report that the role of <italic>lox</italic> mediated direct defence and its associated volatiles is determining damage on the plot level, not affecting focal or neighbouring plants. Whereas the <italic>TSP10</italic> plants do affect abundance of stem borer beetles and predator presence on individual plant level. This conclusion is sound based on the data presented, but it is also biased by the experimental design. You did not explore the role of <italic>LOX</italic> derived volatiles or direct defences on the individual plant level experimentally. You should acknowledge and discuss the fact that the effect of <italic>LOX</italic> mediated effects has not been tested fully. The Discussion should include how the missing treatment might affect your conclusions or further inferences about the role of particular volatile emissions.</p><p>2) Although from the plants perspective measurement of damage is a useful predictor of the costs of herbivory, the measurement may not accurately present the actual effect on herbivore abundance. Damage is confounding: herbivore abundance, their feeding intensity (that individuals may adjust to plant quality), and predator pressure on herbivores. Actual herbivore counts such as provided for the stem borer beetles would more strongly support the conclusions on <italic>LOX</italic> and <italic>TSP</italic> mediated community processes. Please discuss this point or provide the counts if you have them.</p><p>3) You rely very heavily on pairwise comparisons between treatments, usually with non-parametric tests or G tests for differences in proportions. The results would be much clearer to the readers, and avoid many of the concerns over multiple comparisons, if the authors used generalized linear models that better reflect the experimental design (see below for specific suggestion). For instance, the strongest results for their “community genetics” argument comes from the pattern of reduced mortality of <italic>lox2/3</italic> vs. WT plants when in the presence of a <italic>TPS10</italic> plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), but you do not test this directly. This pattern should be tested as an interaction between the <italic>lox</italic> and <italic>TPS</italic> treatments. You interpret this pattern strongly, but all of the tests performed show marginal or non-significant differences (a marginal decline in mortality for <italic>lox2/3</italic> plants and a non-significant increase in mortality for WT plants due to the presence of a <italic>TPS10</italic> plant). A similar model could be used for stem borer infestation and predation rates. In addition to providing more powerful tests, it may help the reader if all of these analyses are presented in a parallel way.</p><p>Specific suggestion: your statistical analysis could be improved for the analysis of the field experiment data (mortality, prevalence of stem borers, and prevalence of predation).</p><p>All of the outcome variables are binomial (1 or 0 at the level of an individual plant). It is recommended that you model this outcome with a generalized linear mixed model, using a binomial error distribution. This could be done with the glmer function in R or the GLIMMIX procedure in SAS, among other options. The model would include two crossed factors: the <italic>LOX</italic> genotype of the individual plant (2 levels, wild type or mutant) crossed with the <italic>TPS10</italic> treatment of the population (5 levels, individual WT, individual <italic>TPS10</italic>, monoculture WT, monoculuture <italic>TPS10</italic>, mixed), and plot as a random effect to account for the non-independence of plants from the same plot. The test of whether the presence of a <italic>TPS10</italic> plant alters mortality on non-<italic>TPS10</italic> neighbors differently based on the <italic>LOX</italic> genotype of those neighbors would come from the interaction term in this model, with the <italic>TPS10</italic> producing plant individuals excluded (and thus the <italic>TPS10</italic> monoculture treatment dropped). Or alternatively, you could drop the individual plant treatments and have a three way factorial model of <italic>LOX</italic> genotype*population treatment (mono WT, mono <italic>TPS10</italic>, mixed)*position (Center vs. Edge). You could then perform an a priori contrast to compare the interaction specifically between the (WT monoculture vs. mixture)*(<italic>LOX</italic> genotype) for edge plants to test the significance of the pattern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p>4) Please consider that a streamlining of the presentation would make the manuscript easier to read and understand. A great deal of space is devoted to establishing that the gene silencing/overexpression worked and produced reliable phenotypes in controlled conditions.

The authors made some attempt to respond to this suggestion, providing revamped analyses for plant size, flower number, and herbivore damage. However, I was disappointed to see that they did not collect their data in a way that would allow this more powerful analyses of the plant mortality data (which is the clearest case of “extended phenotypes” where the genotype of the center plant affected the fitness of the edge plants), or the data on stem borer abundance and predation rates. For the mortality data especially, this is surprising to me: why would the authors not have noted the live/dead status of plants individually, rather than just taking a tally? Do they mean that within a given population of five plants, they tallied the total number dead (1-5), or do they really mean that they cannot ascribe their mortality data even to the plot level (the base unit of replication for their experiment). If it is the former, they could still use a binomial generalized linear model, as long as they kept the data from the center and edge plants separately. If it is the latter, this is concerning to me because this analysis does not reflect the psuedoreplication induced by having five plants per plot. While a G test is “unreplicated” in that you need only enter a single frequency, it still assumes that the individuals comprising those frequencies are independent observations (i.e. a comparison between 28/75 vs. 50/75 is more powerful than 6/15 vs. 10/15). And I am truly puzzled as to how the authors can have data on flower production at an individual plant scale, but not have mortality data on that scale. Surely if they know how many flowers any given plant produced, they must know if it was alive or not. Am I missing something obvious here?”</p><p>In light of these comments, please clarify how the data on plant mortality and stem borer infection was collected.

Whereas the</italic> TSP10 <italic>plants do affect abundance of stem borer beetles and predator presence on individual plant level. This conclusion is sound based on the data presented, but it is also biased by the experimental design. You did not explore the role of</italic> LOX <italic>derived volatiles or direct defences on the individual plant level experimentally. You should acknowledge and discuss the fact that the effect of</italic> LOX <italic>mediated effects has not been tested fully. The Discussion should include how the missing treatment might affect your conclusions or further inferences about the role of particular volatile emissions</italic>.</p><p>We agree that we did not always explicitly consider the limits of our experimental design when discussing the data, and to correct this, we have added the following text to the Discussion:</p><p>a) “It should be noted that our experimental design did not support the analysis of population-level effects […] in the presence, or absence, of total HIPVs and jasmonate-mediated defense.”</p><p>b) We changed the subsection title from “<italic>LOX2/3</italic> expression has large direct effects on plants, while the largest effects of <italic>TPS10</italic> expression are indirect” to “<italic>LOX2/3</italic> expression has large direct effects on plants, while <italic>TPS10</italic> expression has large indirect effects”.</p><p>c) We have also added the following sentence: “In contrast, due to the large suite of defenses regulated by <italic>LOX2</italic> and <italic>LOX3</italic> products, it would have been more difficult to determine the proximate cause of neighbor effects resulting from manipulation of <italic>LOX2</italic> and <italic>LOX3</italic> expression.”</p><p>d) We had already stated in the Discussion: “Although several components of plant HIPV blends have been shown to prime the direct and indirect defenses of neighbors in different systems (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baldwin et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arimura et al. 2010</xref>; and see Heil, Kost 2006), GLVs may often be the active cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Engelberth et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kessler et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frost et al. 2008</xref>). We did not mix GLV-deficient with GLV-emitting plants in our experimental design, but we can conclude that <italic>TPS10</italic> volatiles had no detectable direct effects on neighbor plants in our set-up.” (This was in the first submission and has not changed.)</p><p>e) “Of course it is possible that the manipulation of <italic>LOX2</italic> and <italic>LOX3</italic> expression within populations would also reveal such extortionist-like effects, for example if <italic>T. mucorea</italic> preferred to oviposit in <italic>TPS10</italic> plants over <italic>LOX2/3</italic>x<italic>TPS10</italic> plants in the same population, which would support the hypothesis that <italic>T.</italic> mucorea preference reflects the ratio between <italic>TPS10</italic> volatiles and other HIPVs.”</p><p>f) And finally, we added: “In this context, it would be interesting to know whether central <italic>LOX2/3</italic> plants surrounded by WT edge plants would experience a similar predation disadvantage as central <italic>TPS10</italic> plants surrounded by WT edge plants, and whether central WT plants surrounded by <italic>LOX2/3</italic> edge plants would have an advantage over their neighbors in attracting predators.”</p><p><italic>2) Although from the plants perspective measurement of damage is a useful predictor of the costs of herbivory, the measurement may not accurately present the actual effect on herbivore abundance. Damage is confounding: herbivore abundance, their feeding intensity (that individuals may adjust to plant quality), and predator pressure on herbivores. Actual herbivore counts such as provided for the stem borer beetles would more strongly support the conclusions on</italic> LOX <italic>and</italic> TSP <italic>mediated community processes. Please discuss this point or provide the counts if you have them</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this astute suggestion. We do indeed have one time point of herbivore count data and had previously not included it because the data are from only a subset of plants and we considered that they might not be as robust as the damage data. However, we re-visited these data and have now included them as a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (the original figures have been re-numbered accordingly). Indeed, the herbivore abundance data differs from the damage data. This must be interpreted with caution as the abundance data were recorded on June 26<sup>th</sup> while the damage data were recorded on June 9<sup>th</sup>, but we state these dates clearly in the text and note, in the Results and in the Discussion, that observation of the plants indicated that there were no changes in trends of herbivore damage between these dates (i.e., relative damage levels remained consistent throughout the end of the experiment). These data are also introduced in the Introduction, reviewed in the Results and in the Discussion, in several commented locations, and a new paragraph has been included in the Methods under the subsection headed “Herbivore and predator counts”.</p><p><italic>3) You rely very heavily on pairwise comparisons between treatments, usually with non-parametric tests or G tests for differences in proportions. The results would be much clearer to the readers, and avoid many of the concerns over multiple comparisons, if the authors used generalized linear models that better reflect the experimental design (see below for specific suggestion). For instance, the strongest results for their “community genetics” argument comes from the pattern of reduced mortality of</italic> lox2/3 <italic>vs. WT plants when in the presence of a</italic> TPS10 <italic>plant (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref><italic>), but you do not test this directly. This pattern should be tested as an interaction between the lox and</italic> TPS <italic>treatments. You interpret this pattern strongly, but all of the tests performed show marginal or non-significant differences (a marginal decline in mortality for</italic> lox2/3 <italic>plants and a non-significant increase in mortality for WT plants due to the presence of a</italic> TPS10 <italic>plant). A similar model could be used for stem borer infestation and predation rates. In addition to providing more powerful tests, it may help the reader if all of these analyses are presented in a parallel way</italic>.</p><p><italic>Specific suggestion.: your statistical analysis could be improved for the analysis of the field experiment data (mortality, prevalence of stem borers, and prevalence of predation).</italic></p><p><italic>All of the outcome variables are binomial (1 or 0 at the level of an individual plant). It is recommended that you model this outcome with a generalized linear mixed model, using a binomial error distribution. This could be done with the glmer function in R or the GLIMMIX procedure in SAS, among other options. The model would include two crossed factors: the</italic> LOX <italic>genotype of the individual plant (2 levels, wild type or mutant) crossed with the</italic> TPS10 <italic>treatment of the population (5 levels, individual WT, individual</italic> TPS10<italic>, monoculture WT, monoculuture</italic> TPS10<italic>, mixed), and plot as a random effect to account for the non-independence of plants from the same plot. The test of whether the presence of a</italic> TPS10 <italic>plant alters mortality on non-</italic>TPS10 <italic>neighbors differently based on the LOX genotype of those neighbors would come from the interaction term in this model, with the</italic> TPS10 <italic>producing plant individuals excluded (and thus the</italic> TPS10 <italic>monoculture treatment dropped). Or alternatively, you could drop the individual plant treatments and have a three way factorial model of</italic> LOX <italic>genotype*population treatment (mono WT, mono</italic> TPS10<italic>, mixed)*position (Center vs. Edge). You could then perform an a priori contrast to compare the interaction specifically between the (WT monoculture vs. mixture)*(</italic>LOX <italic>genotype) for edge plants to test the significance of the pattern in</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref>.</p><p>We have revisited these raw data and regrettably, none of these data sets were collected in a manner which we think permits application of the modeling techniques suggested. Specifically, the <italic>Trichobaris mucorea</italic> infestation data and mortality data were simply collected as tallies per individual or population type and genotype at the end of the season, i.e., not replicated. Thus an unreplicated analysis such as the G-test, according to our understanding, must be used. The predation assays were not always conducted on exactly the same group of plants, as over the course of the 5 repetitions some plants were damaged by wind or severed by cutworms and new plants had to be assigned. Thus it would be difficult to appropriately apportion error to a random or repeated-measures term in a model, and we feel it is most appropriate for these data as well to treat them as total frequencies and conduct an unreplicated statistical analysis. We have stated these limitations clearly in the Methods and Results sections describing the relevant experiments, as marked by comments in the revised text.</p><p>However, we greatly appreciate the reviewers’ points and detailed suggestions. We thus reviewed all of the data in the manuscript and determined that other data sets would be more appropriately analyzed with such an approach. We therefore used an approach similar to that suggested by the reviewers to analyze the newly included foliar herbivore abundance data, and we furthermore re-analyzed our foliar herbivore damage, plant size, and flower production data. These changed analyses are presented in the new version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (foliar herbivore damage data), the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and source data files (foliar herbivore abundance data), and a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and source data file (re-analyzed size and flower production data). The general statistical approaches are described in the revised statistical analysis section of the Materials and methods, and in addition, we have provided detailed descriptions of the analyses as part of the new Appendix 3.</p><p>In particular, the re-analysis of plant size and reproduction data allowed us to simplify the presentation of the flowering data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> to focus only on <italic>LOX2/3</italic> deficiency effects, while revealing subtler interactive effects of <italic>TPS10</italic> expression in the separate effects (new analysis presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 8–Source data 1</xref>), which fit well with the other data sets, and which were overlooked in our previous analysis.</p><p>Overall, the revised statistical analyses have revealed more population-level and interactive effects of <italic>TPS10</italic> expression which we feel facilitate our discussion of the data, strengthen our conclusions, and overall provide a more comprehensible and coherent picture for the reader.</p><p><italic>4) Please consider that a streamlining of the presentation would make the manuscript easier to read and understand. A great deal of space is devoted to establishing that the gene silencing/overexpression worked and produced reliable phenotypes in controlled conditions. These methods and results could be moved to an appendix. This would allow the authors to focus on the results from the field experiment, where the interesting finding is not just that manipulating plant defenses and volatiles affects herbivore damage and plant fitness, but that the genotype of one individual can affect the outcome on neighboring individuals</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion to streamline the text. The <italic>eLife</italic> staff suggested that we create three appendices, each with one coherent topic or set of contents. Thus, the results regarding screening of transgenic lines are now in Appendix 1, results demonstrating field-stable phenotypes are in Appendix 2, and the corresponding methods are in Appendix 3. We feel this has greatly improved the readability and organization of the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The reviewers found your manuscript to be improved.

If the mortality analysis is unreplicated as described in the cover letter, please justify why it is still appropriate to use the statistical test that you used</italic>.</p><p>This is an important concern and a considered comment, and we want to give a correspondingly careful and reasoned response, which is below. In summary, the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> is the most biologically meaningful plant mortality data, which is unfortunately from an unreplicated data set; however the analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> is appropriate for these data and our question, and does not violate the assumptions of the G-test regarding independence between the groups compared. Likewise, the assumption of independence is not violated for the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>. However the assumption of independence of the Fisher’s test was violated in one instance for the analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. We have corrected our analysis for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and associated parts of the Results text, but the corrected analysis produces exactly the same conclusions.</p><p>Question 1: Should we replace our unreplicated plant mortality data set (presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) with a replicated data set, collected concurrently with flowering data?</p><p>Of course we did note plant mortality while collecting the data on flowering. However the flowering data was collected on May 29<sup>th</sup> and June 6<sup>th</sup>, while we wished to analyze mortality by the end of the season on June 29<sup>th</sup>. All other data sets collected between June 6<sup>th</sup> and June 29<sup>th</sup> (herbivore abundance, predation rates) were collected on subsets of plants and plant mortality was not noted again until June 29<sup>th</sup>, at which point all surviving plants were tallied in categories while checking stems for infestation by <italic>Trichobaris mucorea</italic>. Thus total mortality for the season was calculated on June 29<sup>th</sup> as the number of plants originally planted minus the number surviving in each category. Because these total mortality numbers from June 29<sup>th</sup> most accurately reflect the likelihood that plants would not have survived to produce ripe seed, we feel it is most meaningful to present the June 29<sup>th</sup> data.</p><p>One could argue that, although the final mortality numbers from June 29<sup>th</sup> are principally more meaningful, nevertheless if mortality did not change much between June 6<sup>th</sup> and June 29<sup>th</sup>, it would be preferable to present a replicated rather than an unreplicated data set. However there was a 1.5-fold increase in overall mortality, from 29% to 46%, between June 6<sup>th</sup> and June 29<sup>th</sup>. Although the mortality data from June 6<sup>th</sup> show similar trends as June 29<sup>th</sup>, with <italic>LOX2/3</italic> deficiency tending to increase mortality and <italic>TPS10</italic> expression tending to lower mortality, the differences on June 6<sup>th</sup> are not significant even when analyzed using a GLM with a binomial distribution, because the total mortality is lower. Thus the June 6<sup>th</sup> dataset has lower statistical power and, more importantly, is truly less biologically meaningful.</p><p>Answer to question 1: No. It is best to present the unreplicated June 29<sup>th</sup> data.</p><p>Question 2: Is the use of G-tests to analyze the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> appropriate? What about the use of G-tests and Fisher’s tests in other data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>)?</p><p>In analyzing total mortality on June 29<sup>th</sup>, we wished to know whether mortality rate was dependent on, or independent of, population type. We thus used G-tests of independence and conducted post-hoc P-value corrections for multiple comparisons as necessary, which we understand to be the most appropriate choice of tests for our unreplicated data and our question. Although our data came from experimental populations (plots), we did not violate the assumption of independence incorporated into the G-test for the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. This is because, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, we only compare data from separate population types (separate plots), and we never compare data from plants at different positions in the same population type. If we had compared e.g. center to edge plants, there would be dependencies within the data set because some of the plants in group “edge” would have come from the same populations as plants in group “center”, and thus we would not be comparing independent observations. However by comparing different population types, we ensured that no plants in group A shared a population with any plants in group B, and therefore there are no dependencies between groups: they are independent. The same reasoning holds for the comparisons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, and for the comparisons of mortality between plants differing only in <italic>LOX2/3</italic> deficiency or from different population types made in the Results section text (in the subsection headed “<italic>LOX2/3</italic> deficiency increases plant mortality, but mortality is mitigated by single <italic>TPS10</italic>-expressing plants in <italic>LOX2/3-</italic>deficient populations”).</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, we compare both plants from separate population types and plants from the same population type. The comparison of plants from the same population type violates the independence assumption of the Fisher’s test and we thank the Reviewer for bringing this to our attention. We have removed the incorrect comparisons, changed the representation of the statistical comparisons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> accordingly, and corrected the relevant parts of the figure caption and of the manuscript (subsection headed “<italic>TPS10</italic>-expressing plants increase the infestation rates of their neighbors by the stem-boring weevil <italic>Trichobaris mucorea</italic>”). In this part of the manuscript text, we also removed the Fisher’s tests of infestation by genotype: when comparing genotypes differing only in <italic>TPS10</italic> expression overall, rather than different population types, we also violated the assumption of independence because some populations contain both <italic>TPS10</italic>-expressing and non-expressing individuals. As a result of removing some of the pairwise comparisons, our post-hoc correction factor decreased and the <italic>P</italic>-value we report for the comparison of WT plants in mixed versus monocultures decreased from 0.025 to 0.015. Because the critical comparisons in the analysis of the <italic>Trichobaris mucorea</italic> infestation data are those made between, and not within populations, the correction of our statistics does not change the conclusions we draw from these data.</p><p>Answer to Question 2: Yes, the G-tests and Fisher’s tests are appropriate and generally the requirement of independent observations is not violated. However, one comparison shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and a few comparisons in the associated results text violated the independence assumption of the Fisher’s test. We have removed these comparisons. The corrected analysis does not change our conclusions at all.</p></body></sub-article></article>
