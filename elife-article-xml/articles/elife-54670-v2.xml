conditions. Although predicted to share similar membrane topology with other large-pore forming proteins such as connexins, innexins, and LRRC8, pannexins have minimal sequence similarity to these protein families. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of a frog pannexin 1 (Panx1) channel at 3.0 Å. We find that Panx1 protomers harbor four transmembrane helices similar in arrangement to other large-pore forming proteins but assemble as a heptameric channel with a unique constriction formed by Trp74 in the first extracellular loop. Mutating Trp74 or the nearby Arg75 disrupt ion selectivity, whereas altering residues in the hydrophobic groove formed by the two extracellular loops abrogates channel inhibition by carbenoxolone. Our structural and functional study establishes the extracellular loops as important structural motifs for ion selectivity and channel inhibition in Panx1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pannexin</kwd><kwd>heptameric channel</kwd><kwd>ATP release</kwd><kwd>extracellular loop</kwd><kwd>ion selectivity</kwd><kwd>carbenoxolone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM114379</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawate</surname><given-names>Toshimitsu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS113632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furukawa</surname><given-names>Hiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM008267</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Michalski</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name><name><surname>Henze</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumpf</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013356</institution-id><institution>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Robertson funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furukawa</surname><given-names>Hiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Doug Fox Alzheimer's fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furukawa</surname><given-names>Hiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Austin's Purpose</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furukawa</surname><given-names>Hiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Heartfelt WingAlzheimer's Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furukawa</surname><given-names>Hiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001312</institution-id><institution>Charles H.

Pannexins are a family of ubiquitously expressed large-pore forming channels which regulate nucleotide release during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>), blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billaud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billaud et al., 2015</xref>), and neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weaver et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mousseau et al., 2018</xref>). While pannexins have limited sequence identity with innexins (~15% identity), they have virtually no sequence similarity to other large-pore forming channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Panchin et al., 2000</xref>). Among the pannexin family, pannexin 1 (Panx1) has garnered the most attention for its role as a large-pore forming channel responsible for ATP release from a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dahl, 2015</xref>). Different kinds of stimuli have been reported to activate Panx1 including voltage, membrane stretch, increased intracellular calcium levels, and positive membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruzzone et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Locovei et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiu et al., 2018</xref>). Panx1 is also targeted by signaling effectors, such as proteases and kinases, to permanently or temporarily stimulate channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pelegrin and Surprenant, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sandilos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billaud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lohman et al., 2015</xref>). The above evidence suggests that Panx1 has a capacity to integrate distinct stimuli into channel activation leading to ATP release. Despite playing critical roles in a variety of biological processes, a mechanistic understanding of pannexin function has been largely limited due to the lack of a high-resolution structure. Here, we show the cryo-EM structure of Panx1, which reveals the pattern of heptameric assembly, pore lining residues, important residues for ion selection, and a putative carbenoxolone binding site.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure determination and functional characterization</title><p>To identify a pannexin channel suitable for structure determination, we screened 34 pannexin orthologues using Fluorescence Size Exclusion Chromatography (FSEC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kawate and Gouaux, 2006</xref>).

Our result differs from previous studies that suggest hexameric assembly of pannexin based on single channel recordings on concatemeric channels and negative stain electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boassa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiu et al., 2017</xref>). The heptameric assembly observed in the current study is unlikely to be caused by the carboxy-terminal truncation or intracellular loop deletion because cryo-EM images of the full-length frPanx1 also display clear seven-fold symmetry in the 2D class averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Furthermore, 2D class averages of hPanx1 display a heptameric assembly, but not other oligomeric states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Thus, overall, our data suggests that the major oligomeric state of Panx1 is a heptamer. This unique heptameric assembly is established by inter-subunit interactions at three locations: 1) ECL1s and the loop between β2 and β3; 2) TM1-TM1 and TM2-TM4 interfaces; and 3) α9 helix and the surrounding α3 and α4 helices, and the N-terminal loop from the neighboring subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Notably, the majority of residues mediating these interactions are highly conserved (e.g. Phe67 and Tyr111; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The overall protomer structure of Panx1 resembles that of other large-pore forming channels including connexin, innexins, and LRRC8. Like other large-pore forming channels, each Panx1 protomer harbors four transmembrane helices (TM1-4), two extracellular loops (ECL1 and 2), two intracellular loops (ICL1 and 2), and an amino (N)-terminal loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). The transmembrane helices of Panx1 are assembled as a bundle in which the overall helix lengths, angles, and positions strongly resemble the transmembrane arrangements observed in other large-pore channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). In contrast, Panx1 has no similarity in transmembrane arrangement to another group of large-pore channels, CALHMs whose protomers also contain four transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">; Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Structural features in the Panx1 ECL1 and ECL2 domains are conserved among large-pore channels despite limited sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, the Panx1 ECL1 and ECL2 are joined together by two conserved disulfide bonds (Cys66 with Cys267, Cys84 with Cys248) in addition to several β-strands. ECL1 also contains an alpha-helix that extends towards the central pore and forms an extracellular constriction of the permeation pathway. While much of the transmembrane domains and extracellular loops show similarities to other large-pore forming channels, the Panx1 intracellular domains are structurally unique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). ICL1 and ICL2, for example, together form a bundle of helices that make contact with the N-terminus. The N-terminal loop of Panx1 forms a constriction of the permeation pathway and extends towards the intracellular region. The first ~10 amino acids of the N-terminus are disordered in our structure, but these residues might play a role in ion permeation or ion selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang and Dahl, 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Subunit architecture of frPanx1.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Structure of the frPanx1 protomer.

The narrowest constriction is surrounded by Trp74 located on ECL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Trp74 is highly conserved among species including hPanx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because Panx1 has been previously characterized as an anion selective channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Romanov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2014</xref>), we wondered if positively charged amino acids around the narrowest constriction formed by Trp74 may contribute to anion selectivity of the channel. Interestingly, Arg75 is situated nearest to the tightest constriction of the permeation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). We hypothesized that Arg75 might be a major determinant of anion selectivity of Panx1 channels in the open state. To assess whether Arg75 contributes to anion selectivity, we generated a series of point mutations at this position on hPanx1 and compared their reversal potentials (Erev) in asymmetric solutions using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We kept sodium chloride (NaCl) constant in the pipette solution while varying the extracellular solution. When treated with the large anion, gluconate (Gluc<sup>-</sup>), Erev shifted to +26 mV, suggesting the channel is more permeable to Cl<sup>-</sup> than to Gluc<sup>-</sup>. When exposed to the large cation, <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG<sup>+</sup>), Erev remained close to 0 mV, suggesting that Na<sup>+</sup> and NMDG<sup>+</sup> equally (or do not) permeate Panx1. These results are consistent with Panx1 being an anion-selective channel. The Arg75Lys mutant maintains the positive charge of this position, and displayed Erev values comparable to WT. Removing the positive charge at this position, as shown by the Arg75Ala mutant, diminished Cl<sup>-</sup> selectivity as the Erev in NaGluc remained near 0 mV. Interestingly, the Erev in NMDGCl shifted to −22 mV, suggesting the channel had lost anion selectivity and Na<sup>+</sup> became more permeable than NMDG<sup>+</sup>. A charge reversal mutant, Arg75Glu, shifted the Erev in NaGluc to −16 mV and in NMDGCl to −45 mV, indicating that Gluc<sup>-</sup> became more permeable to Cl<sup>-</sup>. Overall, these results support the idea that the positively charged Arg75 plays a role in anion selectivity of Panx1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Permeation and ion selectivity of Panx1 channels.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) HOLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smart et al., 1996</xref>) diagram demonstrating constrictions along the permeation pathway.

Interestingly, both Trp74Arg and Trp74Glu mutants become less selective to anions and more permeable to Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). These results suggest that introducing a charge at this position disrupts the natural ion selectivity of Panx1 channels but that position 74 itself does not control ion selectivity. We observed that the distance between the guanidino group of Arg75 and the benzene ring of Trp74 from an adjacent subunit is ~4 Å, suggesting that these two residues likely participate in an inter-subunit cation-π interaction key to Panx1 ion selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we generated Trp74Ala and Trp74Phe mutations and measured Erev potentials. Trp74Ala showed a marked decrease in Cl<sup>-</sup> permeability and an increase in Na<sup>+</sup> permeability, despite preservation of the positive charge at Arg75. A more conservative mutation, Trp74Phe, still disrupted ion selectivity, suggesting that proper positioning of the benzene ring at position 74 is important for anion selection. Altogether, our data suggests that anion selectivity is only achieved when Trp74 and Arg75 form a cation-π interaction. Given that our structure has disordered and truncated regions in the N-terminus, ICL1, and ICL2, it is possible that additional ion selectivity or gating regions exist in the full-length channel. For example, the N-termini of LRRC8 and connexins perform an important role in ion selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kyle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kronengold et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kefauver et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that the N-terminus of Panx1 is mobile and may further constrict the permeation pathway. Another possibility is that the electrostatic potential along the pore pathway contributes to the ion selectivity. Interestingly, both cytoplasmic and extracellular entrances of the permeation pathway are mostly basic, suggesting that non-permeant cations may be excluded from the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, the region underneath the W74 constriction is highly acidic, supporting the idea that anions may be selected around this area.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CBX action mechanism</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that CBX, a potent nonselective inhibitor of Panx1, likely acts through a mechanism involving ECL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Michalski and Kawate, 2016</xref>). In these experiments, mutations at a number of residues in ECL1 rendered Panx1 less sensitive to CBX-mediated channel inhibition. Mapping such residues in the Panx1 structure revealed that they are clustered proximal to the extracellular constriction by Trp74, in a groove formed between ECL1 and ECL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>). This supports our previous speculation that CBX is an allosteric inhibitor, not a channel blocker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Michalski and Kawate, 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>CBX action requires residues from both ECL1 and ECL2.</title><p>(<bold>a and b</bold>) Surface (<bold>a</bold>) and cartoon (<bold>b</bold>) representations of the frPanx1 ECL1 (light blue) and ECL2 (dark blue), with potential CBX-interacting residues shown in orange.

We mutated selected residues in ECL2 of hPanx1 to cysteines and measured channel activity before and after CBX application. We found that mutations at Ile247, Val258, and Phe262 (hPanx1 numbering) diminished CBX-sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). These data suggest that both ECL1 and ECL2 play important roles in inhibition of Panx1 by CBX. Although we do not have a cryo-EM structure complexed to CBX at this point, we speculate that CBX inhibits Panx channels by binding between ECL1 and ECL2 and ‘locking’ the conformation of gate forming ECL1 in favor of channel closure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The frPanx1-ΔLC structure uncovered a unique heptameric assembly of a large-pore channel that harbors an extracellular constriction formed by Trp74 and Arg75. These residues are located on ECL1 and face toward the central pore of the channel and thus, are situated to regulate channel function. Mutagenesis studies at these positions revealed that both residues play pivotal roles in ion selection. Unlike the LRRC8A anion channel, however, the positively charged Arg75 does not seem to form a canonical selectivity filter. Instead, the guanidino group of Arg75 likely mediates a cation-π interaction with Trp74 in the neighboring subunit, which seems to control ion selection. One possible ion selection mechanism is that this cation-π interaction stabilizes the inter-subunit interactions, which in turn creates an electrostatic environment that favors anion permeation. Another possibility is that tight inter-subunit interactions in the extracellular domain are necessary to form an ion selectivity filter in the missing region in our current model (e.g. N-terminus or C-terminal domain).</p><p>Which functional state does our model represent? Based on the lack of channel activity at 0 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2e and f</xref>), our current structure may represent a closed conformation. This is supported by the existence of a highly acidic region near Trp74 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), which may serve as a barrier for anions to permeate. However, given that the narrowest constriction at Trp74 is ~10 Å wide, it is possible that the structure actually represents an open conformation. Indeed, the +GS version of frPanx1-ΔLC shows larger leak currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>), suggesting that the C-terminal truncation may promote channel opening while lack of the N-terminal modification renders it closed. If the conformation of the N-terminus in frPanx1-ΔLC is somehow compromised during purification or reconstitution into nanodiscs, it is possible that our structure may actually look closer to the +GS version. While further studies are necessary to define the functional state of our current structure, the weak EM density in the N-terminal region leaves the possibility that frPanx1-ΔLC may be representing an open state.</p><p>We found that ECL1 and ECL2 interact to each other and form a potential CBX binding pocket. Both ECL1 and ECL2 may undergo movement based on conformational alterations of the TMDs and cytoplasmic domains. For example, it is conceivable that movement of the TMDs caused by membrane stretch or voltage, or changes in the cytoplasmic domain triggered by caspase cleavage may be coupled to conformational rearrangements in the extracellular domain. The major role of the extracellular domain in pannexin function is strongly supported by our experimental results demonstrating that mutating Trp74 and Arg75, as well as surrounding residues in ECL1 and ECL2, alter channel properties including ion selectivity. Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that application of CBX to mutants at Trp74 (e.g. to Ala, Ile, Lys) potentiates voltage-dependent channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Michalski and Kawate, 2016</xref>), which indicates that CBX likely acts as an allosteric inhibitor rather than a channel blocker.</p><p>In contrast to the extracellular domain, roles of the intracellular domain remain elusive. While the C-terminal domain has been demonstrated to play important roles in Panx1 channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sandilos et al., 2012</xref>), our study neither confirms or refutes this mechanism as half of this domain is missing in our current structure. Likewise, the first 10 residues in the N-terminus are disordered, making it challenging to understand how these residues tune the activity of Panx1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Michalski et al., 2018</xref>). Given their important roles in channel gating, it is possible that the unmodeled N-terminal region may interact with the deleted region of the C-terminal domain. It is also possible that these domains may form a channel gate. In contrast to these domains, the deleted residues in ICL-1 (between Gly171 and Lys194) seems to play a minimal role in channel gating. We surveyed 23 different deletion constructs (in which each variant harbored a different deletion length and position) and among these, all deletions constructs showed voltage-dependent channel activity via whole-cell patch clamp, with the exception of a construct in which the entire region between Lys155 and Lys194 was removed. We also tested these deletion constructs using FSEC and found that all functional constructs were properly assembled into heptamers. The above evidence indicates that the deleted region in ILC-1 plays an insignificant role in channel gating. The EM density in this region was weak and could not be modeled, indicating a high degree of conformational flexibility.</p><p>In conclusion, our frPanx1-ΔLC structure provides an important atomic blueprint for dissecting functional mechanisms of Panx1. While we did not observe a gate-like structure in the current cryo-EM map, the missing domains, especially the N-terminal loop and the C-terminal domain, may serve as a channel gate on the intracellular side of the channel. Further structure-based experiments such as cysteine accessibility and molecular dynamics simulations will facilitate our understanding of how this unique large-pore channel functions.</p></sec><sec

Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and lysed by nitrogen cavitation (4635 cell disruption vessel; Parr Instruments) at 600 psi in PBS containing leupeptin (0.5 μg/mL), aprotinin (2 μg/mL), pepstatin A (0.5 μg/mL), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mM). Broken cells were centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 10 min, and membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation at 185,000 x g for 40 min. Membranes were suspended and solubilized in PBS containing 1% C12E8 (Anatrace) for 40 min, followed by ultracentrifugation at 185,000 x g for 40 min. Solubilized material was incubated with StrepTactin Sepharose High-Performance resin (GE Healthcare) for 40 min in batch. Resin was collected onto a gravity column (Bio-Rad), washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM C12E8), and eluted with five column volumes of wash buffer supplemented with 2.5 mM desthiobiotin. Eluted protein was concentrated and further purified on a Superose 6 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare) with 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5 mM DDM as the running buffer. Peak fractions were collected and pooled. All steps were performed at 4°C or on ice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Reconstitution into nanodiscs</title><p>MSP2N2 apolipoprotein was expressed and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ritchie et al., 2009</xref>), and the N-terminal His tag was cleaved off using TEV protease prior to use. To incorporate frPanx1 into nanodiscs, soybean polar extract, MSP2N2 and frPanx were mixed at final concentrations of 0.75, 0.3 and 0.3 mg/ml, respectively. The mixture was incubated end-over-end for 1 hr at 4°C, followed by detergent removal by SM2 Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad). The supernatant and wash fractions were collected after an overnight incubation (~12 hr) and further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 10/300 column in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 3 mg/mL.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cryo-EM sample preparation and image collection</title><p>frPanx1 in nanodiscs or hPanx1 in n-Dodecyl-β-D-Maltopyranoside (DDM; Anatrace) were applied to glow-discharged lacey carbon-coated copper grids (Electron Microscopy Services). The grids were blotted for 4 s with blot force 7 at 85% humidity at 15°C, and plunge frozen into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher). All data were collected on a FEI Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher) operated at an acceleration voltage of 300 keV. For frPanx1-ΔLC, a total of 2034 images were collected at 130 k magnification with a pixel size of 1.07 Å in electron counting mode. Each micrograph was composed of 32 frames collected over 4 s at a dose of 1.79 e / Å<sup>2</sup>/frame and a total exposure per micrograph of 57.3 e / Å<sup>2</sup>. Data were collected using EPU software (FEI). For full-length frPanx1 in nanodiscs, a total of 574 images were collected at 130 k magnification with a pixel size of 1.06 Å in electron counting mode. Each micrograph was composed of 50 frames collected over 10 s at a dose of 1.4 e / Å<sup>2</sup>/frame. The total exposure per micrograph was 70 e / Å<sup>2</sup>. Data were collected using SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schorb et al., 2019</xref>). Data for full-length hPanx1 in DDM were collected in a similar fashion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cryo-EM image processing and single particle analysis</title><p>Warp was used for aligning movies, estimating the CTF and particle picking for frPanx1-ΔLC and full-length hPanx1. For full-length frPanx1, movie alignment and CTF estimation were performed using the program Unblur and CTFFind, respectively, within the cisTEM package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grant et al., 2018</xref>). 2D classification, ab-initio 3D map generation, 3D refinement, 3D classification, per particle CTF refinement and B-factor sharpening were performed using the program cisTEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grant et al., 2018</xref>). The single particle analysis workflow for frPanx1-ΔLC is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. De novo modeling was performed manually in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>). The final model was refined against the cryo-EM map using PHENIX real space refinement with secondary structure and Ramachandran restraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). The FSCs were calculated by phenix.mtriage. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Extended data <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>HEK293 cells were plated onto 12 mm glass coverslips (VWR) in wells of a six-well plate and transfected 24 hr later with 500–800 ng plasmid DNA using FUGENE 6 (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Recordings were performed ~16–24 hr later using borosilicate glass micropipettes (Harvard Apparatus) pulled and polished to a final resistance of 2–5 MΩ. Pipettes were backfilled with (in mM) 147 NaCl, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES pH 7.0 with NaOH. Patches were obtained in external buffer composed of (in mM) 147 NaCl, 10 HEPES pH 7.3 with NaOH, 13 glucose, 2 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>. A rapid solution exchange system (RSC-200; Bio-Logic) was used to perfuse cells with CBX or various salt solutions. Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments), filtered at 2 kHz (Frequency Devices), digitized with a Digidata 1440A (Axon Instruments) with a sampling frequency of 10 kHz, and analyzed with the pClamp 10.5 software (Axon Instruments). For voltage step recordings, Panx1-expressing cells were held at −60 mV and stepped to various voltage potentials for 1 s in 20 mV increments before returning to −60 mV. For ramp recordings, cells were held at −60 mV, and ramped between −100 mV and + 100 mV over 3 s duration.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the members of the Kawate and the Furukawa lab for discussions.

The reviewers thought this was an excellent manuscript that is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. As is spelled out in the reviews below, all three reviewers have suggestions for improving the manuscript in revision. Most of the issues they raise can be readily addressed by careful revision of the text to openly discuss unresolved questions or to tone down some conclusions (e.g. the potential CBX binding site). We ask that you prepare a revised version that addresses the issues raised to the best of your ability.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript presents for the first time the structure of a pannexin channel. This is a timely and very important finding for the field that will serve as a basis for understanding and studying pannexin-1 channel function.</p><p>I think it is important to note that in the current (and frenetic) race of structural biologists to determine channel structures, the main concern for physiologists is whether these structures really represent physiological conformations of the channel. I believe the authors prove, at least partially, that this is the case with the frog pannexin-1 channel. The structural interpretations that the extracellular loop 1, in particular, residues at positions W74 and R75 regulate ionic selectivity are nicely supported by their functional data. The functional data supporting inhibition by carbenoxolone at extracellular region are complementary, but less demonstrative.</p><p>The major concern with this work is with respect to some forced interpretations that do not properly address the limitations of the pannexin-1 structure and require proper clarification. This refers mainly to the lack of reliable structural data related for the cytosolic domains N-terminus (NT), intracellular loops (ICL) and C-terminus (CT), which have been shown to be crucial in gating and permeation of these channels. This needs to be properly acknowledged in the manuscript.</p><p>Another manuscript describing the pannexin-1 structures from frog and human was published a few days after the current manuscript in BioRxiv. They share similar structural results, and both lack structural information for the N-terminal and C-terminal domain.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As stated by the authors, the NT region has been shown to regulate gating and permeation in pannexin-1 channels. In this presented pannexin-1 structure the first 10 residues of the NT region are not resolved. The remaining residues are lining the pore as shown for other large pore channels including connexin, innexin and LRRC8 channels. Importantly, the intracellular loops in the aforementioned structures are critical for stabilizing the N-terminal region. This has been more recently demonstrated for connexin hemichannels. To solve the pannexin-1 structure, the authors had to remove 24 amino acids from the first ICL. How the deletion of this segment could alter the interactions between ICL1, ICL2, and NT, and the potential implications in channel gating or selectivity need to be discussed.</p><p>2) The structure does not contain a significant part of the C-terminal region, which has been shown to play an important role in the gating of human, rat and mouse Pannexin 1 channels. The lack of the CT in pannexin-1 leads to constitutively open channels in these species, even at negative potential. How is therefore explained that the frog pannexin-1 structure lacking the CT region corresponds to a closed channel conformation as the authors propose?</p><p>3) The authors suggest that the motif formed by the residues W74 and R75 is an extracellular gate in pannexin-1 channels. They referred to this motif in the text as a unique mechanism of gating, which gives the impression of a unique gate. If W74 is the only gate, one would predict that mutations in W74 (such as W74A) will disrupt the gate and produce a leaky channel, due to the substitution of an amino acid with a short side chain. This does not seem to be observed by the authors. If the mutations do not lead to a leak current, it is likely that there is a second gate for atomic ions.</p><p>4) Pannexin channel currents for different constructs shown in Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 2F are not normalized by channel levels. This implies that currents of frPanx1, hPanx1, and frPanx1-ΔLC are not comparable.</p><p>5) Figure 1—figure supplement 2F suggests that the channels used to determine the cryo-EM structure (i.e., those formed by frPanx1-ΔLC) are not functional. As noted, the authors needed to add a GS motif in the NT region to increase voltage-sensitivity. This reinforces the idea of a role for the NT in gating.</p><p>6) The Discussion section is incomplete. I think that many of the concerns in this review need to be addressed by the authors in this section.</p><p>7) The authors conclude that &quot;our structural and functional study establishes the extracellular loops as the unique structural determinants for channel gating and inhibition in Panx 1…&quot;. Considering the above issues this sentence is incorrect. It must be also noted that the inhibition mechanism proposed by the authors is only ascribable to CBX. I think that modeling/docking of CBX with the pannexin-1 structure will reinforce the experimental data and provide a more solid conclusion about the mechanism of blockade by CBX.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>By combining data from cryo-EM and electrophysiology, the work describes the first structure of a Pannexin channel at high resolution and it sheds light on the determinants of anion selectivity. This is an excellent manuscript that provides important insight into an important ion channel. The data appears to be of high quality and the major conclusions of the manuscript are sound. I thus think that the work is a strong candidate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The cryo-EM data is of high quality and it supports the structural claims made in the manuscript. The ring of aromatic residues at the extracellular constriction and the close-by arginine residues are particularly interesting, and the proposed cation-π electron interaction is supported by the data (considering the limited resolution of the map). Whereas the role of both residues for shaping the selectivity properties of the protein have been nicely demonstrated in patch clamp recordings, the evidence for the same region to act as gate is to some degree vague and speculative since it has not been demonstrated that the same residues would provide that largest energy-barrier that obstructs permeation in the closed conformation.</p><p>– Given the proposal that different region contribute to anion selectivity it would be interesting to know more about the electrostatics within the pore region.</p><p>– I wonder whether there is evidence that the described Arg residues contribute to the observed voltage dependence of currents. Although the authors have shown traces of recordings of the mutants to demonstrate shifts in the reversal potential, possible changes in the voltage dependence of gating could be better documented. I expect in their structure, the positively charged Arg would be located outside the electric field.</p><p>– I wonder whether the authors have additional evidence to exclude a potential role of CBX as pore blocker. Is the effect of CBX reversible?</p><p>– Are small currents after addition of CBX reflect incomplete occupancy of the blocker or residual conduction of the CBX-bound channel and are currents in mutants a consequence of decreased potency or increased conductance of the blocked channel (given the large amount of data presented in the study such experiments might be focus of a future study).</p><p>– In the electrophysiology section, it would be important to show some comparative data from mock-transfected cells.</p><p>– Was the change in the junction potential in asymmetric solutions in the selectivity experiments calculated to be significant and was it corrected?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript from the Kawate lab titled &quot;The cryo-EM structure of a pannexin 1 channel reveals an extracellular gating mechanism&quot; reports the structure of a pannexin 1 from frog at about 3.0 Å resolution and functional studies that tested structure-based hypotheses on ion selectivity and inhibitor binding site. The work is significant in that this is the first pannexin structure, and that the structure revealed a heptameric assembly different from other large-pore forming channels such as connexins, innexins and LRRC8. The initial FSEC and excellent biochemical work led to identification of a stable construct suitable for structural studies. The procedures for cryo-EM seem straightforward, and the quality of the density map seems consistent with the claimed resolution.</p><p>I feel that the experiments are all solid and interpretations are sound. I have two comments.</p><p>First, the study on CBX is a very good follow up on a previous JGP paper by the same lab, and it provides further evidence that extracellular loop 1 harbors the inhibitor. However, short of a CBX-pannexin complex, one could argue that the inhibitor may bind elsewhere and induce a propagated effect that is mediated by the extracellular loop.</p><p>Second, I see utility of using ion permeation as a read out for testing certain aspects of pannexin, but I do not quite understand the motivation of studying ion selectivity in pannexin. If the main function of a pannexin is to form a large pore to allow release of ATP, would it be more relevant to study permeation of ATP and its gating on a proteoliposome assay? Is there any indication that anion permeation is relevant in physiology?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54670.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an important manuscript describing the first near atomic resolution structure of a pannexin channel, a family of large pore channels thought to be important for the movement of ions and small molecules (e.g. ATP) across cellular membranes.

Except for the construct that lacks this entire region, all other constructs showed voltage-dependent channel activity in our whole-cell patch clamp experiments. We also investigated these deletion constructs using FSEC and found that the functional constructs were properly assembled into heptamers. Based on these results, we think the deleted region in the loop has insignificant contribution in channel gating. Indeed, the EM density in this region was weak and we could not model the residues between K155 and K194. The NT region on the other hand does seem to play a crucial role in channel gating, as we previously demonstrated (Michalski et al., 2018). It is possible that the unmodeled NT region may interact with the deleted region of the CTD. We included this information in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The structure does not contain a significant part of the C-terminal region, which has been shown to play an important role in the gating of human, rat and mouse Pannexin 1 channels. The lack of the CT in pannexin-1 leads to constitutively open channels in these species, even at negative potential. How is therefore explained that the frog pannexin-1 structure lacking the CT region corresponds to a closed channel conformation as the authors propose?</p></disp-quote><p>In our hands, CT truncated Panx1 (1-355 in human) does not open constitutively. This is independent of species or intracellular loop deletion. Because frPanx1-ΔLC is closed at 0 mV (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), we initially thought that the current structure represents a closed state. However, the +GS version of frPanx1-ΔLC shows larger leak currents (Figure 1), leaving a possibility that the CT truncation does promote channel opening but lack of the NT modification somehow renders it closed. If the conformation of the NT in frPanx1-ΔLC is compromised during purification or reconstitution into nanodiscs, it is possible that our structure may actually look closer to the +GS version, which may then represent an open state. We included this discussion in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors suggest that the motif formed by the residues W74 and R75 is an extracellular gate in pannexin-1 channels. They referred to this motif in the text as a unique mechanism of gating, which gives the impression of a unique gate.

This does not seem to be observed by the authors. If the mutations do not lead to a leak current, it is likely that there is a second gate for atomic ions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. Because we do not have sufficient data to confirm W74's role as a channel gate, we removed the phrase &quot;extracellular gate&quot; from our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Pannexin channel currents for different constructs shown in Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 2F are not normalized by channel levels. This implies that currents of frPanx1, hPanx1, and frPanx1-ΔLC are not comparable.</p></disp-quote><p>That is true. We do not intend to compare those constructs quantitatively, but aim to qualitatively demonstrate that all three constructs present voltage-dependent channel activity when the N-termini are modified with the addition of Gly-Ser.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 1—figure supplement 2F suggests that the channels used to determine the cryo-EM structure (i.e., those formed by frPanx1-ΔLC) are not functional.

This reinforces the idea of a role for the NT in gating.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the NT region plays essential roles in pannexin channel gating. Unfortunately, our current EM structure falls short of proposing a possible mechanism, as the first 10 amino acids are not modelled. As suggested by the reviewers, we expanded the Discussion section to clarify the limitation of our studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The Discussion section is incomplete.

However, we agree with the reviewer that the sentence is misleading. We therefore toned down its potential role as a gating machinery throughout the manuscript. We also agree that further studies are necessary to clarify the action mechanism of CBX.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The cryo-EM data is of high quality and it supports the structural claims made in the manuscript.

However, it is challenging to assess the contribution of the positively-charged side chain in voltage gating, as the interaction with W74 also seems to affect voltage dependence. One clear thing is that the positive charge at this position is not necessary for voltage-dependent channel activity, as R75A or even R75E give rise to voltage-dependent currents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I wonder whether the authors have additional evidence to exclude a potential role of CBX as pore blocker. Is the effect of CBX reversible?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the effect of CBX is reversible. We previously demonstrated that voltage-dependent channel activity of W74A, W74I, or W74K is potentiated by CBX (Michalski et al., 2016). In combination with our systematic mutagenesis studies, CBX is more likely to be an allosteric inhibitor than a channel blocker.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Are small currents after addition of CBX reflect incomplete occupancy of the blocker or residual conduction of the CBX-bound channel and are currents in mutants a consequence of decreased potency or increased conductance of the blocked channel (given the large amount of data presented in the study such experiments might be focus of a future study).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. Our previous single channel recordings suggest that CBX reduces the channel open probability without changing the conductance (Michalski et al., 2018). This suggests that the residual currents after CBX application reflect incomplete occupancy. But we agree that further experiments are necessary to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the electrophysiology section, it would be important to show some comparative data from mock-transfected cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have already published several responses from mock-transfected cells that confirm the channel activities in our lab indeed come from Panx1 (Michalski et al., 2016 and Michalski et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Was the change in the junction potential in asymmetric solutions in the selectivity experiments calculated to be significant and was it corrected?</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected junction potentials experimentally using an agar bridge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>I feel that the experiments are all solid and interpretations are sound. I have two comments.</p><p>First, the study on CBX is a very good follow up on a previous JGP paper by the same lab, and it provides further evidence that extracellular loop 1 harbors the inhibitor. However, short of a CBX-pannexin complex, one could argue that the inhibitor may bind elsewhere and induce a propagated effect that is mediated by the extracellular loop.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comments. We agree with the reviewer that CBX may bind outside of the tested residues. And yes, CBX-pannexin complex structure will be very helpful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, I see utility of using ion permeation as a read out for testing certain aspects of pannexin, but I do not quite understand the motivation of studying ion selectivity in pannexin. If the main function of a pannexin is to form a large pore to allow release of ATP, would it be more relevant to study permeation of ATP and its gating on a proteoliposome assay? Is there any indication that anion permeation is relevant in physiology?</p></disp-quote><p>While ATP release has been widely studied, anion permeation through pannexin channels has also been implicated in physiology (e.g. Thompson et al., 2008). The suggested in vitro ATP-release assay would be interesting.</p></body></sub-article></article>
