An ultra-high-speed optical trap enabled direct observation of the timing and amplitude of the working stroke, which can occur within &lt;200 μs of actin binding by β-cardiac myosin. The initial actomyosin state can sustain loads of at least 4.5 pN and proceeds directly to the stroke or detaches before releasing ATP hydrolysis products. The rates of these processes depend on the force. The time between binding and stroke is unaffected by 10 mM P<sub>i</sub> which, along with other findings, indicates the stroke precedes phosphate release. After P<sub>i</sub> release, P<sub>i</sub> can rebind enabling reversal of the working stroke. Detecting these rapid events under physiological loads provides definitive indication of the dynamics by which actomyosin converts biochemical energy into mechanical work.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myosin</kwd><kwd>optical trap</kwd><kwd>cardiac myosin</kwd><kwd>phosphate release</kwd><kwd>working stroke</kwd><kwd>strong binding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01-GM087253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ostap</surname><given-names>E Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldman</surname><given-names>Yale E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL133863</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winkelmann</surname><given-names>Donald</given-names></name><name><surname>Ostap</surname><given-names>E Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CMMI: 15-48571</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ostap</surname><given-names>E Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldman</surname><given-names>Yale E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF GRFP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woody</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-GM118139</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldman</surname><given-names>Yale E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>654148</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Capitanio</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003056</institution-id><institution>Ente Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Capitanio</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cardiac myosin converts energy from ATP into mechanical work by transitioning from a short-lived force-bearing state, to a post working stroke state before the release of inorganic phosphate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myosin is a cytoskeletal motor that uses metabolic energy stored in ATP to do mechanical work. This process underlies muscle contraction, cell motility, and intracellular transport. In muscle, myosin causes displacements of actin filaments connected to work against an external load. The majority of the mechanical work done by myosin is performed in the working stroke, the rotation of the myosin lever arm domain, which occurs soon after actin binding and is closely associated with the release of inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>), a product of ATP hydrolysis. Understanding the connections between the formation of a force-bearing actin-bound state, the biochemical step of P<sub>i</sub> release, and the mechanical action of the working stroke is fundamental to understanding energy transduction. Although substantial physiological and biophysical experiments have provided key details associated with these transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagshaw and Trentham, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hibberd and Trentham, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hibberd et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cooke et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dantzig et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araujo and Walker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">White et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takagi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muretta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caremani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rohde et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Llinas et al., 2015</xref>), controversy remains regarding the order of the force-generating conformational transitions and whether the free energy change from phosphate release precedes or follows the working stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Strengthening of the actomyosin bond due to conformational changes in myosin and actin, tilting of the lever arm, and P<sub>i</sub> release all occur within milliseconds of initial actin binding, making the mechanochemical steps difficult to resolve by commonly available biophysical measurements.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49266.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Myosin biochemical model and example UFFC traces.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Mechano-chemical model of acto-myosin interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goldman and Ostap, 2012</xref>). Steps are numbered to remain consistent with the myosin literature.

The myosin protein was a heavy meromyosin (HMM) construct with a Flag-tag placed at the C-terminus for purification. It was attached non-specifically to nitrocellulose coated silica beads on the coverslip surface. The beta-cardiac isoform not only has great relevance as the dominant myosin in the human ventricles, but its slower kinetic properties compared to fast skeletal myosin facilitated detection of fast rate processes. Although this is a two-headed construct, we did not observe evidence that both heads interacted simultaneously with actin in the presence of ATP (see Discussion). We employed an ultra-fast force clamp (UFFC) which can resolve the onset of actin-myosin binding events to less than 100 microseconds and filament motions at sub-nm resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capitanio et al., 2012</xref>). Unlike standard optical trapping techniques which typically have temporal resolutions &gt; 10 ms, UFFC allows observation of the initial myosin working stroke which can occur within 1 ms of actin binding. We applied this system to explore actomyosin attachment durations and displacements in the presence of 1.5–4.5 pN mechanical loads in directions along the long-axis of the actin filament that hinder or assist the stroke. The duration of the events, and the timing and size of filament displacements during interactions were examined in the presence and absence of 10 mM P<sub>i</sub> to determine the relationship between actin binding, the working stroke, and P<sub>i</sub> release.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Duration of actomyosin interactions observed under load</title><p>UFFC uses a feedback loop to maintain a constant force on an actin filament dumbbell by rapid (µs) control of the trapping laser position. The applied force (the geometric sum of the optical trap forces on each bead) causes the filament and two beads to move through the assay solution at a constant velocity set by the bead size and water viscosity and the force is alternated in direction to maintain the dumbbell within 200 nm excursion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–e</xref>). When a surface-attached myosin binds to actin and becomes loaded with the applied force, the filament motion stops within ~50 µs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–g</xref>). Displacement of the actin filament caused by the myosin working stroke is monitored during the interaction, which ends when myosin dissociates, allowing the actin filament to resume motion under the applied force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). The beginning and end of each actomyosin interaction are detected by examining the velocity of the optical traps as they respond to the feedback system, dropping to zero when myosin binds and increasing again when myosin releases the actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). When the working stroke displaces the filament toward its pointed end, the beads and the traps move a corresponding amount to maintain a constant force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>).</p><p>We first analyzed the duration of actomyosin interactions in the absence of P<sub>i</sub> under force that hinder or assist the stroke. To distinguish brief, reversible actomyosin attachments from longer attachments when myosins complete the ATPase cycle, most experiments were performed at a low (1 μM), rate-limiting MgATP concentration. Under both assisting and hindering loads, the distributions of event durations span a range from less than 1 ms to greater than 1 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–e</xref>). The actomyosin events with durations less than 10 ms, which represent up to 50% of the observed interactions, have not been observed previously with standard optical trapping techniques because their durations are below the minimum detectable length (deadtime, 10 ms for standard techniques, 0.5–2.7 ms for the current technique) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capitanio et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49266.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Kinetics of actomyosin attachment durations under mechanical load.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cumulative distributions of actomyosin attachment event durations at 1 μM ATP under assisting loads (solid lines) plotted on semi-log axes.

The working stroke appears to immediately follow this short-lived state, as the observed rate of the working stroke (<italic>k</italic><sub>stroke</sub>, diamonds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) is greater than or equal to the rate of detachment from the short-lived state (<italic>k</italic><sub>f</sub>, circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). <italic>k</italic><sub>stroke</sub>, surprisingly, shows an increased rate with larger forces in the direction that should hinder the working stroke.

This might suggest that after P<sub>i</sub> is released, the P<sub>i</sub> rebinding does not cause the actin cleft to reopen fully, even if it does allow power stroke reversal. Additional studies and modeling will be required to test this speculation, but it has been suggested previously that P<sub>i</sub> rebinding may induce transitions off of the canonical pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Debold et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> can explain all our observations. In this model, electrostatically mediated interactions between actin and myosin transition to the short-lived, stereo-specific state detected in our study.

The working stroke of myosin occurs directly from this state and the closure of the cleft is tightly coupled to the stroke. Both the stroke and cleft-closure can be reversed under zero load, with a rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>int</sub>) that increases with hindering load.

Additionally, by using both the top and bottom <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> values and the known excursion distance, the value of the EOD slope is be calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>_</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>This slope value can then be used in the FPGA to update the setpoint value as the trap positions change in order to account for the slope in the force signals.<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Examples of the drift offset and the calculated slope values over a 30 s trace are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3d</xref>.</p><p>When the data are analyzed, the recorded force signals can be transformed into the actual force signals by using a similar algorithm in the analysis software that was used in real time on the FPGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3e</xref>). When detecting and characterizing binding events, the forces and positions of the traps when the feedback was paused are ignored. This DSC system markedly improved reliability and consistency within and across experiments, reduced the width of the velocity distributions, lowered effective deadtimes, and improved data reliability at lower forces.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Event detection</title><p>Events were detected using a modified version of software written in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) used previously for UFFC experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capitanio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gardini et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, the velocity of the traps is calculated and smoothed using a 160–800 μs width Gaussian filter, and a threshold is determined for distinguishing periods when the trap motion has stopped that balances false binding and false unbinding events. The amount of smoothing is set so that the number of false events is estimated to be &lt;1% of all detected events based on statistical estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colquhoun and Sigworth, 1995</xref>). The smoothing varies with the applied force but is constant across experimental conditions. Because higher loads cause faster motion of the actin, less smoothing is required and shorter events can be detected at higher loads. Small corrections are applied to the start- and end-times of the events to account for delay based on the Gaussian filter, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capitanio et al., 2012</xref>). The estimated uncertainty of the localization of binding time (<italic>σ</italic><sub>t</sub>) can be calculated and ranged from 500 μs at 1.5 pN to &lt;60 μs at 4.5 pN applied load. From each data trace, a theoretical minimum detectable event length (deadtime) was calculated based on the velocity distributions and the threshold value as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capitanio et al., 2012</xref>). Events were designated as occurring either during hindering or assisting load based on the direction of actin motion when binding occurred and the polarity of the actin as determined by initial non-feedback experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Duration analysis</title><p>For a given force, all events which were shorter than the largest calculated deadtime for traces recorded at that force were excluded from the analysis. The deadtimes, set to be constant across different biochemical conditions, were 2.7, 1.25, 0.73, 0.65, and 0.5 ms for forces 1.5, 2.25, 3, 3.75, and 4.5 pN respectively. Events from molecules at the same magnitudes and directions of force were pooled for each given condition (e.g. forces, concentrations of MgATP and free P<sub>i</sub>). Parameters for deadtime corrected single, double, and triple exponential distributions were estimated in MEMLET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Woody et al., 2016</xref>) for each data set and the log-likelihood ratio test was used with a p-value cutoff of 0.05 to determine if the triple and/or double exponential distributions were statistically justified. Each molecule contributed equally to the fitted values as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woody et al., 2018a</xref>), although this did not lead to considerable differences compared to the fits weighted by the number of interactions. The observed amplitudes of each phase are reported as well as the deadtime corrected amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), which consider how many events are likely missed due to the experimental deadtime and assuming exponential duration components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Woody et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Ensemble averaging</title><p>Ensemble averages were carried out as have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woody et al., 2018a</xref>). The beginnings of the events were aligned based on their detected time of binding from the crossing of the smoothed velocity trace through the detection threshold as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capitanio et al., 2012</xref>). The trap position for the leading bead (the bead with the higher magnitude of force applied) was taken as the position of the actin filament, as there is less influence of non-linear end compliance on this more highly loaded bead. The extension point was taken to be the displacement at time σ<sub>t</sub> (uncertainty of binding time) before the detected end of the event, meaning this value was used in the averages for all time points longer than the actual event duration. The value of σ<sub>t</sub> depends on the smoothing of the velocity for event detection, and thus was smaller (more accurate) for larger forces. The average value of σ<sub>t</sub> varied from 0.5 ms for 1.5 pN to ~72 μs for 4.5 pN. Ensembles were weighted such that each molecule contributed equally to the final average.</p><p>Events longer than 15 ms were analyzed together for the 0 P<sub>i</sub> conditions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to isolate events which went through the entire biochemical cycle, including ATP binding to terminate the actomyosin interaction, as the total observed step did not change &gt;10% by excluding any additional events longer than 15 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). For the 10 mM P<sub>i</sub> data and for analysis of the 0 P<sub>i</sub> data which was directly compared to that with 10 mM P<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), events longer than 25 ms were included because the total working stroke size continued to increase as events between 15 ms and 25 ms were excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>), which could be due to reversals and detachments occurring later in an interaction when P<sub>i</sub> is present.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Quantifications of ensemble averages</title><p>Quantification of the ensemble average was done programmatically, using the methods and parameters reported below. The minimum position of the ensemble average within the first millisecond of detected actin binding was set to be zero displacement. The size of the initial displacement was calculated from the raw (unfiltered) ensemble averages by finding the time (<italic>t</italic><sub>init</sub>) when the ensemble average reached its maximum within the first 1.2 ms following the minimum position, with the exception of the 1.5 pN data, which were searched over the first 5 ms. The displacement from a window of 200 µs centered on <italic>t</italic><sub>init</sub> was averaged to determine the maximum initial position. The minimum and maximum positions were used to normalize the displacements to range from 0 to 1, as plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>. The normalized displacement data between the minimum position and <italic>t</italic><sub>init</sub> was used to fit a single exponential rise with an amplitude of 1 to determine the rate of the working stroke as reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>.</p><p>For quantification of the dip size and time, the initial stroke size was determined by averaging 100 μs on either side of <italic>t</italic><sub>init</sub>.

The size and timing of the dip are reported as the difference between the time and displacement of initial stroke and the minimum dip respectively. The total displacement is quantified as an average over the last 200 μs of the ensemble average.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Modeling</title><p>Simulations of individual traces were performed using a Monte-Carlo based method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gillespie, 1977</xref>) using the rates and transitions given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.

Once all states were assigned for a given simulated interaction (the last state is always a detached state), a position value was assigned to each state based on the mechanical properties of the states. The simulated position values were drawn for each interaction from a Gaussian distribution with a 0.1 nm standard deviation from their set mean value. The position trace before the initial interaction was a constant slope with a velocity similar to what is observed in the data for the simulated applied force. Upon initial binding, an exponential function was used to simulated stretching of the myosin under the applied load using a linear stiffness of 2 pN/nm. 3000 interactions were simulated, and the interactions lasting longer than a 25 ms cutoff were included for averaging with the same routine used for the data analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49266.021</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>File containing three supplementary tables which provides n-values for experiments, measured stroke rates, and ionic strength conditions.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-49266-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49266.022</object-id><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-49266-transrepform-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The primary optical trapping data files are &gt; 1TB, and are available upon request.

decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Single molecule mechanics resolves the earliest events in force generation by cardiac myosin&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Geeves (Reviewer #2); Arne Gennerich (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers and I felt that this is a significant piece of work that needs to be widely read and understood. It is a major technical achievement – to have such high time resolution optical trap data and the authors have chosen an ideal protein to use. Rather than the fast myosins used in Captianio's earlier work laser trap studies they use a β cardiac myosin which is several fold slower for some of the key molecular events. This allows fine detail of myosin attachment and the subsequent events to be mapped in great detail</p><p>Here for the first time the authors appear to be seeing myosin heads weakly attached to actin and the transition through the power stroke to a strongly attached form, significantly with phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) still present in the motor. Each of these is a significant observation and if the interpretations are correct then the results have a big impact on some of the major questions about how myosin generates force. The interpretation of the data will be argued over for some time.</p><p>Arguments have swung back and forth about the order of the power stroke and P<sub>i</sub> release steps, which comes first? The inability to measure these events directly has led to intense debate. Here they come down very firmly on power stroke followed by P<sub>i</sub> release.</p><p>Another important question is what is the nature of the weakly-attached pre power-stroke state and how much load can it bear? – Here the result is up to 5 pN but with a diminishing lifetime at higher load. Importantly the transition forward is less likely when attachment occurs at high load not because of load inhibition of the forwards step but because of acceleration of the reverse step.</p><p>Overall it was agreed that this work is important and that your conclusions are well supported by the data. In places the reviewers felt that the presentation needs to be improved by changes to the text.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors do not state clearly in the main text what the myosin construct is that they are using; human β HMM with a flag tag. The details are important and should not be left in the Materials and methods alone. It is only in the 2nd paragraph where they state that this is human β myosin but do not say this is HMM or how it is attached to the surface. The experiments would not be possible with any myosin faster than β and to my knowledge it is only the human β protein that is currently available in a form that can be expressed with tags.</p><p>In summary the reasons for using the β-cardiac myosin, rather than other isoforms, need to be explained clearly in the text.</p><p>2) The authors do provide a brief paragraph at the end of the manuscript referring to other myosins. For a general reader the possibility of isoform differences between myosins needs to be addressed in relation to the major conclusions.</p><p>3) The use of HMM rather than long S1 does raise issues of any involvement of the 2nd head in the events observed. This is not mentioned in the paper but will add a complication to interpretations of the data. The authors should address why HMM is used and how this affects their interpretation</p><p>4) Figure 2—figure supplement 2, in contrast to the data shown on a log time base in Figure 2 does show a marked asymmetry in the stiffness (or d value in their fits). This requires some comment and may be one of the very interesting features of the data that requires further explanation. In contrast Figure 2—figure supplement 2 is instead as showing symmetry, a single d value for assisting and hindering loads. There has been a lot of debate about asymmetry in the crossbridge stiffness and its consequences. This is worth commenting on.</p><p>5) Many of the issues here have been long debated and in this short report the authors cannot be expected to cover all the literature but some of the citations reflect a narrow view of the debate. For example:</p><p>a) In several places the authors state that their data is compatible with published data and then refer to the published data on pig myosin (subsection “Short lived States are Stereo-Specific, Open-cleft, Pre-stroke, Pi-bound states”, third paragraph, subsection “Duration of actomyosin interactions observed under load”, fifth paragraph). There is a substantial literature on the human protein including from some of the authors. The work on human form should surely be a better reference.</p><p>b) Similarly the references to the weakly attached sate (Bagshaw and Trentham, 1974; White, Belknap and Webb, 1997; Lymn and Taylor, 1971) seem an odd mixture. Bagshaw and Trentham, 1974, is all work in the absence of actin.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49266.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors do not state clearly in the main text what the myosin construct is that they are using; human β HMM with a flag tag.

Thus, the data are interpreted as resulting from single myosin heads.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2—figure supplement 2, in contrast to the data shown on a log time base in Figure 2 does show a marked asymmetry in the stiffness (or d value in their fits).

In contrast Figure 2—figure supplement 2 is instead as showing symmetry, a single d value for assisting and hindering loads. There has been a lot of debate about asymmetry in the crossbridge stiffness and its consequences. This is worth commenting on.</p></disp-quote><p>The distance parameters (<italic>d</italic>) values obtained from the Bell fit have been used as an estimate of the force dependence of the kinetic transitions being observed. This asymmetry in force sensitivity may be related to myosin stiffness, but it does not have to be. We interpreted the difference in the <italic>d</italic> values for <italic>k</italic><sub>f</sub> for assisting vs. resisting loads to be due to the transition of pulling myosin forward off of actin vs. backwards off of actin to be fundamentally different in terms of the molecular interactions. For <italic>k</italic><sub>int</sub>, we have interpreted the single <italic>d</italic> value for assisting and resisting loads to indicate that a single transition is affected for both directions of force which slows under assisting load. This directionality is consistent with reversals of the working stroke. These points are outlined in the subsection “The myosin working stroke is rapid and more likely for long events” and subsection “Experimental protocol”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Many of this issues here have been long debated and in this short report the authors cannot be expected to cover all the literature but some of the citations reflect a narrow view of the debate. For example:</p><p>a) In several places the authors state that their data is compatible with published data and then refer to the published data on pig myosin (subsection “Short lived States are Stereo-Specific, Open-cleft, Pre-stroke, Pi-bound states”, third paragraph, subsection “Duration of actomyosin interactions observed under load”, fifth paragraph). There is a substantial literature on the human protein including from some of the authors. The work on human form should surely be a better reference.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and have updated the references to cite the most relevant work done on the human protein, namely Deacon, et al., 2012, and Bloemink et al., 2014 in the places listed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Similarly the references to the weakly attached sate (Bagshaw and Trentham, 1974; White, Belknap and Webb, 1997; Lymn and Taylor, 1971) seem an odd mixture. Bagshaw and Trentham, 1974, is all work in the absence of actin.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and have updated the references to include Stein, Chock, and Eisenberg, 1984 and Brenner 1991.</p></body></sub-article></article>
