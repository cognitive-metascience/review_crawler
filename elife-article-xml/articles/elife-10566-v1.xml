However, the arbors of very few long-range projection neurons have been reconstructed in their entirety, as axons with diameters as small as 100 nm arborize in target regions dispersed over many millimeters of tissue. We introduce a platform for high-resolution, three-dimensional fluorescence imaging of complete tissue volumes that enables the visualization and reconstruction of long-range axonal arbors. This platform relies on a high-speed two-photon microscope integrated with a tissue vibratome and a suite of computational tools for large-scale image data. We demonstrate the power of this approach by reconstructing the axonal arbors of multiple neurons in the motor cortex across a single mouse brain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10566.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10566.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10566.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells or neurons transmit electrical impulses to each other over long distances. These signals travel through highly branching nerve fibers called axons, which are about one hundred times thinner than a human hair, and can extend across the entire brain. Tracing the axon of a neuron from start to end can help to explain how individual neurons and brain areas communicate signals over long distances.</p><p>A mouse brain contains approximately 70 million neurons, and tracing the axons of many neurons within a brain is a challenging problem. Tackling this problem requires a method for imaging entire brains in high enough detail to unambiguously resolve and follow axons from individual neurons across the brain. Economo, Clack et al. now demonstrate such a method for three-dimensional imaging of tissue samples as large as the whole mouse brain.</p><p>This system is fully automated and works by first imaging a layer of tissue near the exposed surface of a sample, and then cutting off a slice of tissue that corresponds to the volume that has been imaged. These steps then repeat until the entire sample has been imaged; this takes about a week for a whole mouse brain and produces about 30 terabytes of images.</p><p>Economo, Clack et al.’s advance can uncover how neurons communicate over long distances with an unprecedented level of precision. The method can now be used to generate a comprehensive database of neurons and their long distance connections. Such a database would aid efforts to model the roles of neural circuits in the brain, and inform the design of experiments to study brain activity during particular behaviors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10566.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10566.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Neuroanatomy</kwd><kwd>Whole-brain imaging</kwd><kwd>Axonal reconstruction</kwd><kwd>Neuroinformatics</kwd><kwd>Tissue clearing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Economo</surname><given-names>Michael N</given-names></name><name><surname>Clack</surname><given-names>Nathan G</given-names></name><name><surname>Lavis</surname><given-names>Luke D</given-names></name><name><surname>Svoboda</surname><given-names>Karel</given-names></name><name><surname>Chandrashekar</surname><given-names>Jayaram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-resolution fluorescence imaging of the complete mouse brain enables many neurons to be efficiently visualized in their entirety, revealing all targets of neurons that project widely across the brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A core goal of modern neuroscience is to map neural circuits across the entire brain, as long-range connectivity dictates how information flows between brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bohland et al., 2009</xref>). Brain-wide inter-areal connectivity has been probed using bulk injections of anterograde and retrograde tracers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerfen and Sawchenko, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luppi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Markov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Veenman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zingg et al., 2014</xref>) and functional imaging methods with millimeter-scale spatial resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol, 2010</xref>). However, intermingled neurons within a brain region have heterogeneous projection patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nassi and Callaway, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shepherd, 2013</xref>) and carry diverse messages in the behaving brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Movshon and Newsome, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sato and Svoboda, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Turner and DeLong, 2000</xref>). Projection maps based on bulk tracer injections are thus comprised of multiple functionally and structurally distinct groups of neurons. Reconstructions of single neurons therefore provide vital information about how neural signals are organized and transmitted across the brain to target regions.</p><p>Single-neuron reconstructions are also critical for defining the fundamental cell types in the brain. The nervous system has long been viewed as a collection of discrete cell types defined by their developmental origins, gene expression, morphology, and function. Axonal structure has been particularly useful in classifying projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cowan and Wilson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawaguchi et al., 1990</xref>) but this information is currently lacking for most cell types. Visualization of the brain-wide projection maps of the individual neurons comprising a projection pathway would enable the isolation of well-defined classes that target similar structures and may otherwise be impossible to distinguish.</p><p>Single-cell and sparse-labeling techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Furuta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horikawa and Armstrong, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pinault, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reiner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rotolo et al., 2008</xref>) have facilitated the reconstruction of individual axonal projections over long distances in the basal ganglia, hippocampus, neocortex, thalamus, olfactory cortex, and neuromodulatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawaguchi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kita and Kita, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuramoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oberlaender et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wittner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). However, the reliability and throughput of axonal reconstruction have remained limited by the necessity to restrict labeling to one or a few neurons in a single brain and to manually track individual segments between serial sections, which are often deformed and may be damaged by standard histological processing techniques.</p><p>Visualization of neurons in continuous whole-brain image volumes may overcome these limitations and allow reconstruction of long-range axonal projections in a reliable and efficient manner. This requires an approach capable of imaging every location in a three-dimensional space within a large tissue volume with high resolution so that fine axonal collaterals may be unambiguously tracked to their targets. Here, building on serial two-photon (STP) tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Portera-Cailliau et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ragan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>), we describe a system for fast volumetric microscopy that can be used to image the entire mouse brain at high resolution. Combining this technique with high-intensity, sparse neuronal labeling, a novel technique for clearing tissue, and an informatics pipeline for processing and visualizing large imaging datasets, we present a platform for efficient reconstruction of axonal morphology. We demonstrate the utility of this system by reconstructing the extensive, brain-wide axonal arborizations of diverse projection neurons in the motor cortex within a single mouse brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High-speed volumetric STP tomography</title><p>To image the axonal arbors of individual neurons, we constructed a platform for fast, automated, volumetric fluorescence imaging at sub-micron resolution.

This approach allowed us to image up to 16 million voxels/s (&gt;50 mm<sup>3</sup>/day) with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) sufficient for axonal reconstruction. This fast-scanning microscope represents a 16–48× increase in speed over conventional laser-scanning microscopy systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pologruto et al., 2003</xref>). The system is comprised primarily of commercially-available hardware and custom control software (freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TeravoxelTwoPhotonTomography">github.com/TeravoxelTwoPhotonTomography</ext-link>) and operates as follows: (1) the entire volume of space addressable by the stage system is partitioned into overlapping 3D tiles, each corresponding to a single image stack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>); (2) tiles intersecting the exposed surface of the sample are marked for imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>); (3) an image stack corresponding to each marked tile is acquired; (4) the integrated vibratome removes a portion of the imaged volume; (5) the precise surface plane of the remaining tissue is determined; and (6) this sequence of events is automatically repeated until the entire tissue sample has been processed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sample clearing and embedding</title><p>In the past, STP tomography has been limited to acquiring two-dimensional (2D) snapshots of tissue volumes separated by &gt;50 µm in the axial direction. Following small structures through highly scattering brain tissue in three dimensions requires a strategy for clearing fixed tissue that is compatible with long-term imaging. Specifically, we sought an approach that preserved the native fluorescence of fluorescent proteins, introduced little background autofluorescence, effectively cleared gray and white matter, was compatible with serial sectioning, and that could be used as a stable, long-term immersion medium during extended imaging sessions. We evaluated the compatibility of a number of recently described techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chung and Deisseroth, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ertürk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Renier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Susaki et al., 2014</xref>). Strategies employing organic solvents (i.e. 3Disco, iDisco) quenched fluorescent proteins produced hard, brittle tissue that could not be sectioned. Clearing agents requiring high-index saturated solutions (i.e. SeeDB, Clarity, CUBIC) were not robust to evaporation and solutes precipitated during extended imaging experiments. Sca<italic>l</italic>e expanded tissue, attenuated fluorescence, and resulted in unstable tissue geometry. Due to these incompatibilities, we sought an alternative method meeting these requirements.</p><p>We devised a clearing medium comprised of a ternary mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), <sc><sc>d</sc></sc>-sorbitol, and aqueous buffer (see Methods). DMSO was chosen due to its high refractive index (1.479) and extensive use in mounting medium formulations for fluorescence microscopy. The sugar alcohol <sc>d</sc>-sorbitol was found to be highly soluble in DMSO and, unlike <sc>d</sc>-fructose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ke et al., 2013</xref>), may be obtained at high purity without autofluorescent contaminants and does not cause non-enzymatic browning of biological tissue. Aqueous buffer was added to preserve green fluorescent protein (eGFP) fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>). The high refractive index of the resulting solution (1.468) reduced light scattering in tissue by minimizing index mismatches with lipid- and protein-rich brain structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The excellent tissue penetrance of these reagents further contributed to a high degree of clearing of white and gray matter in whole brains. We note that the use of subsaturating <sc>d</sc>-sorbitol solutions was important for preventing precipitation or gellation of the mixture following the evaporation and mechanical agitation that accompanies long (&gt;1 week) imaging sessions. Another key advantage of this medium over other clearing agents is its low viscosity; serial sections with consistent thickness were difficult to obtain in viscous media. This approach allowed small structures, including fine axons, to be imaged with minimal signal attenuation at imaging depths &gt;200 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–f</xref>). Samples could be reliably sectioned and imaged over the course of many days and stored for many months without adverse effects on fluorescent labels or gross changes in brain volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Hence, this medium met the requirements for high-resolution volumetric imaging and serial sectioning.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10566.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sample preparation and clearing. </title> <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Whole brains (<italic>left</italic>) and 1 mm-thick tissue sections (<italic>right</italic>) cleared using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and <sc>d</sc>-sorbitol.

Sparse labeling was achieved by expressing Cre recombinase with a highly diluted adeno-associated virus while simultaneously delivering a Cre-dependent high-titer reporter virus coding for a fluorescent reporter (e.g. eGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Using this labeling strategy, 10–50 motor cortical neurons could be routinely labeled with high intensity in each brain. Brightly-labeled neurons were likely infected with a single copy of the viral plasmid encoding Cre but with many copies of the reporter gene, thereby driving high expression in few cells. High-intensity labeling (e.g. with viral vectors encoding bright fluorescent proteins like eGFP or tdTomato) was necessary for high-contrast imaging of thin fibers. Using this labeling strategy, fine, long-range axonal collaterals - —such as those innervating the contralateral motor cortex - —were easily detected and resolved. These fibers were clearly discernable even in a maximum intensity projection through a large volume of tissue (2.3 × 1.3 × 1.0 mm) corresponding to &gt;200 individual 3D tiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).

Even with sparse labeling, axonal segments of similar caliber but originating from different somata cross paths with separations smaller than the diffraction limit of light, introducing uncertainty in the assignment of axonal identity following crossover points. In the past, the inability to unambiguously follow single processes has precluded extensive reconstruction of fine axonal collaterals in datasets containing multiple labeled neurons in the same brain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). Since the error rate in manual and automatic reconstruction of axonal processes from light microscopy datasets depends strongly upon the density of neurites within a local volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gala et al., 2014</xref>), we assessed the feasibility of complete axonal reconstruction in this dataset. We attempted to reconstruct the full axonal morphology of the same cohort of neurons depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The high density of processes at the site of viral injection - the region containing the highest density of labeled somata - prevented unambiguous reconstruction of many processes in this area due to axonal crossovers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). However, we found that the long-distance axonal projections of these neurons and their fine collaterals in target regions could be accurately reconstructed to a high degree of completeness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). This level of completeness was facilitated by the labeling sparsity, high resolution imaging, and lack of discontinuities in the dataset. Furthermore, 3–12 mm of axon could be reconstructed per hour, depending on local density—a substantial increase in throughput over classical serial-section reconstruction methods, even when samples contained only a single labeled neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wittner et al., 2007</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10566.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Complete reconstruction of axonal morphology.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Complete reconstruction of the same five projection neurons depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (inset).

For example, in this limited dataset, all four reconstructed IT neurons projected to the contralateral motor cortex. The contralateral cortical projections of the two layer V neurons spanned a similar distance along the anterior–posterior (A–P) axis (red: 2152 um; black: 2096 um). However, their terminal fields were offset along this axis by an amount closely mirroring the A-P offset between their corresponding somata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a,b</xref>; distance between projection centroids = 490 µm, A-P distance between somata = 513 um). This relationship suggests that these projections might target a continuum of cortical locations rather than a single discrete structure. In contrast, the contralateral cortical projection of both layer II neurons targeted a similar location along the A-P axis more posterior than both somata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c,d</xref>; distance between projection centroids = 32 µm; A-P distance between somata = 271 µm).

Selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dodt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huisken et al., 2004</xref>) requires reduced acquisition times, but lacks the necessary spatial resolution (&lt; 0.5 µm) for resolving close appositions between thin axonal collaterals within large tissue volumes. Knife-edge scanning microscopy ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mayerich et al., 2008</xref>) represents a potential alternative, but requires resin embedding of tissue samples that can quench or attenuate the fluorescence of native fluorophores and produces tears in large tissue volumes along the edges of 'ribbon' sections. While some axonal segments have been traced using this approach, it has been unable to identify the vast majority of fine axon collaterals innervating many target structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). Large-scale electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kleinfeld et al., 2011</xref>) offers the potential for dense reconstruction of neurites and synapses, but is not yet feasible for volumes larger than 1% of the mouse brain - —precluding the reconstruction of long-range axonal projections.

Ambiguity is introduced when axons originating from different somata are juxtaposed with separations less than the resolving limit of the optical system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). This challenge can be mitigated by imaging with the highest available resolution and imposing a high degree of labeling sparsity - —but cannot be eliminated entirely. In the example dataset presented here, excessive labeling density was largely limited to the site of virus injection and therefore only precluded the extensive reconstruction of local fibers. Biological questions focused on local collaterals will require alternative labeling strategies that achieve greater separation between labeled somata to mitigate this limitation. Sparse stochastic genetic methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rotolo et al., 2008</xref>) and retrograde labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mazarakis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wickersham et al., 2007</xref>) provide straightforward approaches for labeling well-separated somata.</p><p>Reconstructing multiple neurons within a single brain provides a particularly rich description of axonal organization. The spatial overlap - or, alternatively, segregation - of collaterals of different neurons within a single target region can be directly assessed at the micron scale. Comparison of projections of multiple neurons within the same population provides a means to better understand if topological organization in source areas is preserved in downstream structures. In addition, the fine-scale spatial relationships between axon collaterals from different sources may indicate how disparate streams of information remain isolated or are integrated in target structures. Such comparisons are challenging or impossible in datasets in which single neurons are reconstructed in different samples.</p><p>Currently whole brain imaging still requires significant time (8–10 days) and resources (many TB of storage space). Labeling techniques that take advantage of multiple, spectrally separable fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shaner et al., 2005</xref>) and the targeting of several populations with non-overlapping projections in a single brain should permit labeling of hundreds or even thousands of neurons in each brain while maintaining sufficient sparsity for single neuron reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gala et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the high degree of automation employed in the acquisition procedure provides the opportunity for further scalability by taking advantage of multiple imaging systems operating in parallel. Although the time required for manual tracing remains substantial, this constraint is likely to be greatly reduced as a result of recent developments in automation of neuronal reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gala et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jain et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peng et al., 2014</xref>) and the high SNR of axon imaging achieved with our approach.</p><p>Recent advances in imaging techniques, genetic targeting methods, and 'big data' tools have facilitated multiple, comprehensive large-scale efforts attempting to map neural connectivity. In model organisms, these projects have largely focused on mapping local connectivity using electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</xref>) and the bulk projections of neural populations using light microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mitra, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zingg et al., 2014</xref>). In humans, atlases of gross physical and functional connectivity have been constructed from diffusion-tensor imaging and resting-state functional MRI datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mori et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol, 2010</xref>). However, techniques for atlasing the brain-wide axonal collateralization of single mammalian neurons remain unavailable, even though single-cell reconstruction has long been the gold standard for establishing the structure of long-range projections. The approach described here for the efficient reconstruction of single-cell axon collateral maps represents a crucial step towards filling this gap in the available tools for mapping neural connectivity, and will contribute to the ongoing renaissance in large-scale neuroanatomy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Microscope design</title><p>We constructed a microscope for fast volumetric STP tomography. The mouse brain, approximately 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup> in volume, requires 5 × 10<sup>12</sup> voxels for a full representation at a voxel size of 0.1 µm<sup>3</sup>. Acquiring this volume of data with conventional galvanometric scanning at a rate of 1 megavoxel/s would require about 4 months. We have developed a custom resonant scanning system capable of sustaining 16 megavoxels/s for up to 4 channels (128 MB/s data rate) to reduce imaging time to approximately 1 week per sample.</p><p>The scan system is composed of a resonant scanning mirror (CRS-8kHz, Cambridge Technology, Bedford, MA) and a 5-mm linear scanning mirror (6215H, Cambridge Technology) conjugated with a scan telescope comprised of two custom scan objectives (Special Optics, Wharton, NJ) to ensure flat scanning across the available scan field. To avoid thermally damaging the sample at the edge of the resonant mirror scan field, an adjustable slit was placed at a conjugate image plane in the excitation path to block laser light in the appropriate area. A Pockels Cell (302RM, Conoptics, Danbury, CT) was used to modulate laser power and provide fast shuttering between frames.</p><p>In this study, all imaging was performed using a 40×/1.3 NA oil-immersion objective (Objective Plan-Apochromat 40×/1.3 DIC, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The emitted light was passed through a primary dichroic (FF735-Di01-25×36, Semrock, Rochester, NY) onto photomultiplier tubes (H7422P-40, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) using a custom detection head (part of the Janelia MIMMS microscope design) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flickinger et al., 2010</xref>). Two spectral channels were collected. eGFP emission was further filtered through a secondary dichroic (FF01-750/SP-25, Semrock) and an emission filter (FF03-525/50-30-D, Semrock). A second channel (FF02-617/73-30-D, Semrock) was collected for identification of red-labeled nuclei and/or spectral disambiguation of eGFP and broad-spectrum autofluorescence.</p><p>High-fidelity synchronization of the digitizer and scan system (Pockels cell, galvanometric scanner, and objective positioner) with the resonant mirror scan period was accomplished by reflecting a probe laser (635 nm, S1FC635PM, ThorLabs, Newton, NJ) from the resonant mirror onto a photodiode (PDA100A, Thorlabs). The photodiode was positioned 1 m away at one edge of the arc swept out by the resonant mirror. The voltage pulse generated by the incident probe laser was converted into a square wave using a custom circuit. This circuit was designed so that the rise of the square wave corresponds with the peak of the pulse observed from the photodiode, and permits adjustment of the clock phase in 5 ns increments.</p><p>Collected photons were converted to an analog photocurrent, which was then amplified and converted to an analog voltage using a custom transimpedance amplifier (impulse response FWHM=25 ns), and digitized using a 12-bit high-speed digitizer at 125 Msamples/second (ATS-9350, AlazarTech, Pointe-Claire, Canada). A voltage bias was applied at the amplifier to take advantage of the digitizer’s full range. The digitizer generated records 16k samples wide at a rate of 8 kHz (256 MB/s/channel). These lines were distorted due to the spatially non-linear motion of the resonant mirror. Because of this, they were resampled using a cosine lookup table in a manner that is photoefficient (discards no samples) and avoids aliasing. Resampling was implemented on a GPU (GTX 580, NVidia, Santa Clara, CA) in order to meet data throughput requirements.</p><p>Scanning a large volume of tissue was achieved by serially scanning a collection of smaller 3D stacks (tiles). Each of these tiles overlapped adjacent neighbors along each dimension, permitting post hoc registration. To address each tile, the sample was translated in three dimensions using a high-precision mechanical stage system (XY: M-511.DD, Z: M-501-DG, Controller: C843; Physike Instrumente, Karlsruhe, Germany). Fast scanning in the Z-direction was achieved using a piezo-electric motor to axially translate the objective (P-725K.103 and E-665.CR, Physike Instrumente). The maximum depth of each tile - typically set to 250 μm—was limited by the working distance of the objective and the range of the objective piezo.</p><p>Integrated tissue sectioning was implemented on a custom assembly built around the vibrating servo from a Leica 1200S (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Vibration was driven using an 86 Hz sine wave generated from a function generator and custom amplifier with vibration amplitude of approximately 1 mm. Tissue samples were positioned and fed across a stationary vibrating blade using the stage system at a velocity of 0.1 mm/sec. In this way, tissue sections &gt;25 µm could be reliably removed from the tissue block once they were imaged. Computer aided design drawings and bill of materials are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TeravoxelTwoPhotonTomography">github.com/TeravoxelTwoPhotonTomography</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Microscope operation</title><p>Fully automated microscope operation was controlled by custom software (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TeravoxelTwoPhotonTomography">github.com/TeravoxelTwoPhotonTomography</ext-link>). This software incorporates several features that ensure reliable operation spanning days to weeks. First, to guarantee an overlapping volume is reimaged after sectioning, the acquisition software applies a surface-finding procedure and adjusts the focal plane to ensure that tiles begin at the tissue surface. In this procedure, the surface is identified by searching for the top of the tissue by imaging autofluorescence in a subset of tiles with a coarse Z spacing around the expected surface position. Second, algorithms monitor the data quality of the incoming video stream to detect, for example, a photodetector fault. Third, to ensure that high data rates can be sustained over long acquisition times with high fidelity, data are locally cached on a solid-state hard drive (840 pro; Samsung) and asynchronously transferred to a highly-redundant network file system. Fourth, in the event of a fault, operation is safely halted and may resume from the point at which the fault occurred.</p><p>Volume imaging is completed in a fully automatic process. After the top plane of the sample is positioned under the objective, a region of interest is determined by probing tiles across a designated search area. A single autofluorescence image is acquired at the bottom of each tile and classified based on whether it intersects the sample with a preset intensity threshold. When a tile that intersects the sample is found, neighboring tiles are searched in such a way as to trace the perimeter of the tissue. Tiles inside the perimeter are marked for imaging without being explicitly probed for efficiency. Finally the region of interest is dilated by one tile to ensure that tiles only partially intersecting the tissue sample are also acquired. The search process is finished when all the tiles in the search area have been classified. The marked region of interest is then imaged by sequentially volume-scanning constituent tiles. After all the tiles within the marked region of interest are imaged, the vibratome is engaged and a programmed stage motion feeds the sample through the blade to remove the top layer of tissue. The sample is translated back under the objective such that the newly exposed tissue surface is aligned with the focal plane and the process is repeated until no further tiles are found to image.</p><p>Data was acquired in the coronal plane with tile dimensions of 386 × 422 × 250 μm (1024 × 1536 × 251 pixels) and an average dwell time of 61 ns/pixel. eGFP imaging was performed using a tunable ultrafast laser (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) at 920 nm using high excitation intensity (350–400 mW at the objective back aperture).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Image processing and registration</title><p>Image registration was implemented using custom scripts in Matlab (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). For laterally adjacent tiles, no registration was required; translating tiles using recorded stage positions was sufficient. For vertically adjacent tile pairs that spanned a sectioning plane, a set of corresponding features was determined using the descriptor-based image registration plugin in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Preibisch et al., 2009</xref>). Because of the large number of tile pairs (&gt;15,000 per brain), this procedure was distributed across a high-performance computing cluster. Compute time was approximately 1 min per tile pair (RAM 128 GB; 16 Intel E5-2680 CPUs). A set of common features, such as punctate auto-fluorescent bodies (lipofuscin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dowson and Harris, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Terman and Brunk, 2004</xref>), restricted to the putative overlap volume was successfully determined in approximately 2/3 of all tile pairs. Many of the remaining tile pairs either included little or no tissue (e.g. around the perimeter of the sample), or they were from relatively featureless areas within the tissue sample (e.g. ventricles and some white matter tracts).</p><p>Next, point correspondences were aggregated across each tissue section and translated into the coordinate space defined by the stage system. From these point correspondences, a 3D displacement field was determined by fitting a cubic surface to the point cloud using the RegularizeData3d package for Matlab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46223-regularizedata3d">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46223-regularizedata3d</ext-link>). Although only axially-adjacent tile pairs were registered, tile pairs could be displaced relative to one another in all three Cartesian coordinates, necessitating the determination of deformation in three dimensions. This 3D displacement field was parameterized laterally for each (x,y) position across the section plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). After the displacement fields between the current section and the sections above and below the current layer were determined, a 3D transform was computed to update the position of each tile within the full imaged volume. To solve for the transform, eight control points were determined for each tile at points offset slightly from the tile corners and located at the centroid of the overlap regions of neighboring tiles. Except in edge cases, there were seven overlapping tiles in the vicinity of each tile corner. These control points formed a regular grid across each section. Sampling the vector field at the centroid of these overlap regions is important for maintaining lateral continuity. We approximated the projection of these points from pixel space into the global coordinate space using a unique affine transform for each tile. Although useful for registration purposes, the presence of lipofuscin was sometimes undesirable during the tracing process even though these puncta were generally straightforward to disambiguate from labeled neurites. Due to the broad emission spectrum of these features, however, they could be computationally removed using standard linear spectral unmixing techniques. After this procedure, unmixed images - - computed from two-channel image tiles - contained only eGFP-labeled structures. Images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> were unmixed according to <italic>U</italic> = <italic>G</italic> − <italic>kR</italic>, where <italic>U</italic> is the unmixed image, <italic>G</italic> is the green channel of the original image, and <italic>R</italic> is the red channel of the original image. <italic>k</italic> is an empirically-determined scale factor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Image visualization and annotation</title><p>For the purposes of viewing and annotating datasets, all of the tiles in each dataset (input tiles) were resampled into a common coordinate space according to the individual affine transforms determined during the registration procedure. This produced a set of axis-aligned non-overlapping image stacks (output tiles) spanning the imaged volume. Resampling was achieved by back-projecting each voxel in each output tile to one or more input tiles where the nearest voxel was sampled. To avoid aliasing, input tiles were pre-filtered with a Gaussian kernel (sigma = 150 nm). In regions where two or more input tiles overlapped, the maximum intensity was used for the corresponding location in the output tile. The resampling task was implemented on a GPU, which ensured that execution time was dominated by the time required to read input data. Work was distributed output tile-wise over a GPU cluster (20 nodes with 7× GTX 580 1.5GB VRAM). Importantly, each node had parallel access to high-bandwidth network storage. Data were resampled to voxels 0.3 × 0.3 × 1 µm, and stored on disk along with hierarchically downsampled representations of the same volume for visualization at different spatial scales.</p><p>In order to smoothly navigate and annotate neuronal structures across large volumes of rendered data, we used a custom plugin for the Janelia Workstation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murphy et al., 2014</xref>) that displays and predictively pre-caches multiresolution data using a scheme similar to that employed for large imaging datasets in electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cardona et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Saalfeld et al., 2009</xref>). The neuronal structures depicted in this study were reconstructed by manually placing control points approximately every 5–10 µm and were stored using the SWC file format. Manual reconstruction of neurons required approximately 10–30 min/mm and speed depended upon labeling density, signal intensity, and annotator experience.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image compression</title><p>To archive datasets, raw data was compressed using the H.264 format (libavcodec; parameters: crf 18, preset slow, tune film).

Compressed datasets were typically ~1 TB/channel in size.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Development of clearing protocol</title><p>DMSO has a high refractive index (1.479) and is used extensively in mounting medium formulations for fluorescence microscopy. To improve the clearing properties of DMSO, we investigated solutions of DMSO containing a sugar or sugar alcohol, based on the established tissue-clearing properties of these molecules. We examined the solubility of several compounds: sucrose, <sc>d</sc>-fructose, <sc>d</sc>-mannitol, <sc>d</sc>-sorbitol, xylitol, maltitol, and <italic>meso</italic>-erythritol. We found that <sc><sc>d</sc></sc>-sorbitol was highly soluble in DMSO up to 1 g <sc>d</sc>-sorbitol per 1 ml DMSO (44% w/w). Although the saturated solution of <sc>d</sc>-sorbitol in DMSO was an effective tissue-clearing agent, this organic environment irreversibly decreased the fluorescence of eGFP in tissue slices. We therefore measured the fluorescence of purified eGFP as a function of DMSO concentrations (in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3) with or without <sc>d</sc>-sorbitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Surprisingly, eGFP fluorescence increased modestly at low concentrations of DMSO followed by a severe decrease at 70% v/v DMSO without <sc>d</sc>-sorbitol and at 80% v/v DMSO in solutions that included <sc>d</sc>-sorbitol. We then screened ternary mixtures of DMSO/H<sub>2</sub>O/<sc>d</sc>-sorbitol, to produce the clearing protocol described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, which uses increasing amounts of <sc>d</sc>-sorbitol with a final concentration of 45% w/w <sc>d</sc>-sorbitol in a solvent made up of 60% v/v DMSO in 0.01 M phosphate buffer. Increasing the concentration of <sc>d</sc>-sorbitol to its solubility limit (63% w/w; Solution #6 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>) further improved clearing, but evaporation and mechanical agitation initiated precipitation of <sc>d</sc>-sorbitol and/or gel formation during sectioning and imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Tissue processing and clearing</title><p>Mice were deeply anesthetized with an overdose of isoflurane and transcardially perfused with PBS that included 20 U/ml heparin (H3393; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.

The authors developed a high-speed two-photon microscope integrated with a tissue vibratome to obtain high-resolution images of whole mouse brains for manual tracing of sparsely labeled neurons. The fast-scanning STP system that can collect images from the entire mouse brain at 0.3 x 0.3 x 1.0 μm resolution in about 1 week of imaging time. This work is timely and potentially quite valuable.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors state: &quot;Although multiple clearing methods have been developed for brain tissue, including CUBIC, CLARITY, Sca/e […], and iDisco, none of these approaches satisfied all of these criteria.&quot; It's unclear why all these methods fail to satisfy the criteria. The authors should provide data showing that the other clearing methods are not compatible with their approach.</p><p>2) The authors claim that their approach allows for imaging up to 16 million voxels per second (&gt;50 mm<sup>3</sup> per day), a 16-48 X increase in speed over conventional laser-scanning microscopy systems. A table comparing the throughput of the presented method with those of other high-speed imaging techniques (e.g., SPIM) would be helpful.</p><p>3) The authors use their method with GFP. Is their method compatible for brain-wide imaging and tracing neurons that express other fluorescent proteins (mCherry, tdTomato, BFP, etc.)? Can multiple fluorescent proteins (e.g. GFP and mCherry) be imaged and traced within the same brain? These points have to be clarified and backed up with evidence or data.</p><p>4) It is important to include images showing lipofusin autofluorescence, perhaps in a supplemental figure.</p><p>5) The authors state in the Methods that &quot;for laterally adjacent tiles, no registration was required,&quot; but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows conflicting results.</p><p>6) What is the typical signal to noise ration of the acquired image? Dwell time is only 61 ns and this corresponds to only 5 excitation pulses per dwell time for 80MHz rep. rate. Does this mean that the system requires highly dense labeling? General limitations of the imaging system need to be discussed.</p><p>7) The authors demonstrate bright labeling of axonal termini in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, but these come from local collaterals nearby the somas. It would be more informative to show the termini of long-range projecting branches to demonstrate the point of high SNR labeling throughout the neuron morphology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10566.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors state: &quot;Although multiple clearing methods have been developed for brain tissue, including CUBIC, CLARITY, Sca/e […], and iDisco, none of these approaches satisfied all of these criteria.&quot; It's unclear why all these methods fail to satisfy the criteria. The authors should provide data showing that the other clearing methods are not compatible with their approach.</italic>The clearing methods listed were not adopted because one or more properties rendered them fundamentally incompatible with long-term sectioning and imaging. The table below summarizes the specific incompatibilities of each clearing technique with long-term fluorescence imaging integrated with serial sectioning. We have added additional text to the Results section (“Sample clearing and embedding”, first paragraph) more specifically detailing the incompatibilities of each method with our approach.</p><p>Nevertheless, these alternative clearing techniques remain useful tools for other applications and our intent is not to highlight their deficiencies. Instead, we only attempt to describe the rationale for the methodological choices made in developing our approach. For this reason, we believe that the revised discussion of alternative clearing techniques in the text is a more appropriate way to strengthen the revised manuscript than the inclusion of this table or additional data. A complete, quantitative evaluation of each clearing technique across all relevant parameters would be a considerable undertaking and it is not clear that this would strengthen the major conclusions of our study. Furthermore, many of the deficiencies that we describe have been confirmed in an additional study published while our manuscript has been under revision (Hama et al., 2015).</p><table-wrap position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td/><td><p><bold>Cubic</bold></p></td><td><p><bold>Sca<italic>l</italic>e</bold></p></td><td><p><bold>Clarity</bold></p></td><td><p><bold>SeeDB</bold></p></td><td><p><bold>3Disco</bold></p></td><td><p><bold>iDisco</bold></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Quenches fluorescent proteins</p></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td><p>x</p></td><td><p>x</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Attenuates fluorescent proteins</p></td><td><p>x</p></td><td><p>x</p></td><td><p>x</p></td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Tissue becomes hard/brittle</p></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td><p>x</p></td><td><p>x</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Immersion medium not robust to evaporation</p></td><td><p>x</p></td><td/><td><p>x</p></td><td><p>x</p></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Requires high viscosity immersion medium</p></td><td><p>x</p></td><td/><td><p>x</p></td><td><p>x</p></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Introduces high background fluorescence</p></td><td/><td/><td/><td><p>x</p></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Not robust to evaporative water loss</p></td><td><p>x</p></td><td/><td><p>x</p></td><td><p>x</p></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Causes tissue browning over time</p></td><td/><td/><td/><td><p>x</p></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Causes issue expansion</p></td><td/><td><p>x</p></td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Poor white matter clearing</p></td><td/><td><p>x</p></td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Causes unstable tissue geometry</p></td><td/><td><p>x</p></td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Tissue soft and highly deformable</p></td><td/><td/><td><p>x</p></td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Difficult to achieve reproducibility</p></td><td/><td/><td><p>x</p></td><td/><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p><italic>2) The authors claim that their approach allows for imaging up to 16 million voxels per second (&gt;50 mm<sup>3</sup> per day), a 16-48 X increase in speed over conventional laser-scanning microscopy systems. A table comparing the throughput of the presented method with those of other high-speed imaging techniques (e.g., SPIM) would be helpful.</italic></p><p>The reviewers are correct that a number of imaging techniques may be successfully applied to axonal imaging in large tissue volumes. While these were briefly described and contrasted in the original manuscript, we agree that this comparison was largely qualitative. We have now provided a more detailed, quantitative comparison and have included it as <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> in the revised manuscript to augment the treatment of this topic in the text (Discussion, paragraph three). We note that no other technique has been shown to have the required speed, reliability, resolution, and SNR necessary to extensively reconstruct axonal collaterals across the full mouse brain.</p><p><italic>3) The authors use their method with GFP. Is their method compatible for brain-wide imaging and tracing neurons that express other fluorescent proteins (mCherry, tdTomato, BFP, etc.)? Can multiple fluorescent proteins (e.g. GFP and mCherry) be imaged and traced within the same brain? These points have to be clarified and backed up with evidence or data.</italic></p><p>The reviewers are correct that data in the original manuscript was limited to samples in which eGFP was used as a fluorescent label. In the revised manuscript, we have included an example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) demonstrating high-signal-to-noise imaging of intermingled axons labeled with spectrally separable and phylogenetically distinct proteins (eGFP and tdTomato). We also include data demonstrating that tdTomato and other red-shifted DsRed-derived fluorescent proteins (mCherry and mPlum) are not attenuated by our clearing procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The ability to trace tdTomato-labeled neurons using our platform does not differ qualitatively from the examples presented with eGFP-labeled neurons. However, complete datasets including multiple spectral labels with additional reconstructions are not central to the description of our platform as a technical resource and will be presented in a subsequent study addressing specific biological hypotheses.</p><p>Comparatively dim labels (e.g. BFP) with small two photon cross sections and/or low quantum efficiencies are likely to produce images with reduced signal-to-noise and may not be suitable for imaging fine axonal processes using our platform (or, in fact, most other fluorescence imaging modalities relying on native unamplified fluorescence). Additionally, imaging multiple fluorophores with minimally-overlapping excitation spectra (e.g. BFP or mCherry in addition to eGFP) would require a second excitation source with appropriate spectral characteristics.</p><p>While our platform requires bright labels expressed at high levels, eGFP and tdTomato represent two of the most commonly used fluorescent labels and expression using AAV vectors has become a standard technique in neurobiology. We have noted the requirement for bright labeling in the revised Results (“High-resolution whole-brain imaging”, paragraph three).</p><p><italic>4) It is important to include images showing lipofusin autofluorescence, perhaps in a supplemental figure.</italic></p><p>As requested, we now include an example image in which lipofuscin has not been computationally removed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) The authors state in the Methods that &quot;for laterally adjacent tiles, no registration was required,&quot; but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows conflicting results.</italic></p><p>Features lying within the overlap region between axially-adjacent tiles may be displaced relative to their expected position in all three dimensions (X, Y, Z). This three-dimensional displacement between axially-adjacent tiles is illustrated across the two-dimensional (X, Y) exposed surface of the specimen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and is thus consistent with the text. This point is admittedly confusing and has been clarified in the Materials and methods (“Image processing and registration”, paragraph two).</p><p><italic>6) What is the typical signal to noise ration of the acquired image? Dwell time is only 61 ns and this corresponds to only 5 excitation pulses per dwell time for 80MHz rep. rate. Does this mean that the system requires highly dense labeling? General limitations of the imaging system need to be discussed.</italic></p><p>The reviewers are correct that high signal-to-noise imaging with short dwell times can be very challenging. In the updated manuscript, we have quantified the SNR across randomly selected axonal cross-sections (following Ragan et al., 2012) both before and after image compression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). Statistics describing the distribution of signal to noise values are now reported in the updated Results (“Reconstruction of long-distance axonal morphology”,paragraph one), but varied widely (peak z-score: 15.0 ± 2.9; median ± s.e.m.; 5-95% range: 7.0–70.7). This variability follows from the heterogeneity of neuronal labeling and, more importantly, the precise spatial location chosen along each axon, as axon diameters vary considerably, even along local (~10 µm) segments. The authors highlight <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> as compelling evidence that axons can be imaged with high signal-to-noise along their entire length. The demonstration that high-resolution, high-SNR two photon imaging can be performed with comparatively high speeds is an important novel aspect of our study.</p><p><italic>7) The authors demonstrate bright labeling of axonal termini in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, but these come from local collaterals nearby the somas. It would be more informative to show the termini of long-range projecting branches to demonstrate the point of high SNR labeling throughout the neuron morphology.</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> illustrates axonal segments (including branch points and termini) far removed from respective somata. The brain structure corresponding to each segment is listed below each image. These structures included the corpus callosum, contralateral motor cortex, piriform cortex, striatum, olfactory tubercle, somatosensory cortex, auditory cortex, and thalamus – all long-range targets of the labeled neurons in the motor cortex. This was not indicated clearly in the original manuscript. We have clarified the figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> to make this point more directly.</p><p>References:</p><p>Hama, H. et al. (2015).
