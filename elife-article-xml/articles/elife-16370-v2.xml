or alanine in second position. Although linked to several pathways including cell survival and metabolism, the molecular mechanisms underlying these outcomes are poorly understood. We identified a novel interaction of DPP9 with Filamin A, which recruits DPP9 to Syk, a central kinase in B-cell signalling. Syk signalling can be terminated by degradation, requiring the ubiquitin E3 ligase Cbl. We show that DPP9 cleaves Syk to produce a neo N-terminus with serine in position 1. Pulse-chases combined with mutagenesis studies reveal that Ser1 strongly influences Syk stability. Furthermore, DPP9 silencing reduces Cbl interaction with Syk, suggesting that DPP9 processing is a prerequisite for Syk ubiquitination. Consistently, DPP9 inhibition stabilizes Syk, thereby modulating Syk signalling. Taken together, we demonstrate DPP9 as a negative regulator of Syk and conclude that DPP9 is a novel integral aminopeptidase of the N-end rule pathway.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16370.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16370.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16370.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are made up of building blocks called amino acids bonded together to form chain-like molecules. Around twenty different amino acids are used to make proteins, and enzymes called proteases can recognize specific pairs of amino acids in proteins and cut the bonds between them. Dipeptidylpeptidase 9 (or DPP9 for short) is a protease that removes two amino acids from the end of a protein, just as long the second amino acid is one of two specific kinds (namely, an alanine or a proline). The DPP9 protease influences a range of processes in the cell including cell death, signaling and survival. Indeed, mice born with an inactive version of DPP9 die shortly after birth, but it is not known why this happens.</p><p>Justa-Schuch et al. investigated how the protease DPP9 controls processes inside cells and found an unexpected connection between DPP9 and another protein called Syk. The Syk protein is found in immune cells called B cells, and becomes highly activated whenever these cells are stimulated. Once activated Syk changes the activity of many proteins, affecting which genes are switched on and how the B cell moves and divides.</p><p>By using DPP9 as a kind of bait, Justa-Schuch et al. found human proteins that bind to the protease. This search identified a protein called Filamin A that interacted with DPP9, placing DPP9 close to Syk, which also binds to Filamin A. Further experiments showed that when DPP9 was located close to Syk, it cut the end of Syk. This cut left the Syk protein with a different amino acid exposed at its end, which in turn made it susceptible to being broken down inside the cell.</p><p>Justa-Schuch et al. went on to show that DPP9 preferentially cleaved the active form of Syk. Since cleaved Syk was subsequently broken down, DPP9 acts as a shut-off mechanism for Syk after the B cell has been stimulated. The findings show that DPP9 can influence how much and how long the B cell responds to stimulation. Inhibitors of DPP9 may therefore be useful for stabilizing Syk, which is known to stop specific tumors from growing. Future work will investigate the mechanisms that control how Filamin A, DPP9 and Syk interact.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16370.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16370.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Syk</kwd><kwd>DPP9</kwd><kwd>N-end rule</kwd><kwd>protein half-life</kwd><kwd>Cbl</kwd><kwd>B cell signalling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2234/1-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geiss-Friedlander</surname><given-names>Ruth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Heidenreich von Siebold-Programm, Universitaetsmedizin Goettingen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geiss-Friedlander</surname><given-names>Ruth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cleavage of Syk, a central kinase in B-cell signalling, by DPP9 leads to Syk degradation, identifying novel roles for DPP9 in Syk signaling and in the N-end rule pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteases of the DPPIV family are serine aminopeptidases that remove a dipeptide from the N-terminus of substrates having a Pro or an Ala residue in the second position (NH<sub>2</sub>-X<sub>aa</sub>Pro or NH<sub>2</sub>-X<sub>aa</sub>Ala) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Waumans et al., 2015</xref>). DPP8 and DPP9 are the only known intracellular members of this family, sharing 60% homology with a higher conservation (&gt;90% identity) in their active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Not surprisingly, DPP8 and DPP9 are similar in their biochemical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geiss-Friedlander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connolly et al., 2008</xref>).

Knock-in mice expressing an inactive variant of DPP9 die 8–24 hr after birth, demonstrating its importance for neonatal survival which is not compensated by DPP8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gall et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>DPP9 shows a broad tissue distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ajami et al., 2004</xref>), localizes to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ajami et al., 2004</xref>), nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Justa-Schuch et al., 2014</xref>), and to the leading edge of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). DPP9 is linked to several pathways including Akt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pilla et al., 2013</xref>), activation of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matheeussen et al., 2013</xref>), cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) and apoptosis of specific cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matheeussen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spagnuolo et al., 2013</xref>). The molecular mechanisms leading to these different outcomes are poorly understood.</p><p>For a profounder understanding of its molecular functions, we screened for interacting partners of DPP9, reasoning that these will include substrates and regulators of this peptidase. Previously, we identified SUMO1 as a novel DPP9 associating protein, and demonstrated that SUMO1 acts as an allosteric activator of DPP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pilla et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2012</xref>). Now we report filamin A (FLNA) as a novel interacting partner of DPP9, which we identified in a yeast two-hybrid assay.</p><p>FLNA is an actin binding protein that cross-links actin filaments into orthogonal networks, and is important for cell stiffening, cell adhesion and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakamura et al., 2011</xref>). An actin-binding domain is located at the amino terminus of FLNA, followed by 24 Ig-like repeats. Repeat 24 is involved in FLNA dimerization, whereas the other repeats are important for the rod-like structure of FLNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakamura et al., 2007</xref>), and participate in numerous interactions with membrane, cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, FLNA influences several cellular signalling events. Most proteins identified so far bind preferentially to FLNA repeats 16–24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yue et al., 2013</xref>). Surprisingly, we mapped the interaction between DPP9 and FLNA to repeats 5–7. Apart from DPP9, so far only the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Syk is known to bind to FLNA repeat 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Falet et al., 2010</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16370.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Filamin A (FLNA) is a novel DPP9 interacting protein.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of FLNA structure including numbering of the Ig-like domain repeats, and labelling of the actin-binding domain (ABD).

Syk is activated upon BCR engagement, and consequently initiates a cascade of events by phosphorylating its downstream effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mócsai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geahlen, 2009</xref>). The interaction between FLNA and Syk was identified in platelets, where loss of FLNA resulted in reduced signalling and mislocalization of Syk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Falet et al., 2010</xref>). Here we show that DPP9 forms a complex with FLNA and Syk. In this complex FLNA acts as a recruiting factor linking DPP9 to Syk, resulting in cleavage of the Syk N-terminus by DPP9, thus affecting Syk stability and Syk dependent signal transduction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Filamin A – a novel DPP9 interacting protein</title><p>To identify novel proteins that interact with DPP9, a human placenta library was screened in a yeast two-hybrid assay with full-length DPP9 as bait.

We verified direct interaction between FLNA and DPP9 by performing pull-down assays with the recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Only background binding of DPP9 was observed in the absence of FLNA. In line with the yeast two-hybrid assay showing the importance of repeats 5–7, DPP9 bound to an FLNA deletion construct lacking repeats 4, 9, 12, 17, 19, 21, 23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> ‘FLNA variant’), which were previously mapped for several other FLNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakamura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yue et al., 2013</xref>).

Next, in situ proximity ligation assays (PLA) were performed to visualize the association of endogenous DPP9 and FLNA in cells.

Therefore, we tested whether DPP9 interacts with the amino terminus of Syk by conducting Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) assays. Recombinant DPP9 was immobilized on a chip and probed for interaction with a synthetic Syk (1–31) peptide covering the first 31 amino acids of full-length Syk (MA↓SSGMADSANHLPFFFGNITREEAEDYLVQ). Based on published solved structures, the amino terminus of Syk includes an unstructured region followed by an α-helix (residues 22–31) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grädler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fütterer et al., 1998</xref>). Of note, amino acids 1–7 are not resolved in any determined structure of Syk, suggesting that this region is flexible and thus accessible for interactions. We observed direct binding of DPP9 to the Syk (1–31) peptide with a K<sub>D</sub> of 52 ± 4 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>), suggesting a dynamic and transient interaction. Furthermore, an inactive DPP9 variant in which the serine in the active site was mutated to a glycine residue (DPP9 S730G) showed more than a five-fold reduction in its affinity to the Syk (1–31) peptide (K<sub>D</sub> of 284 ± 27 µM) compared to the wild type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>). A lower affinity (K<sub>D</sub> of 156 ± 60 µM) was also observed between wild type DPP9 and a Syk△MA (3–31) peptide, which lacks the first two amino acids Met-Ala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). In summary, these results show a direct interaction between DPP9 and Syk N-terminus, which involves the active site of DPP9, suggesting that Syk is a DPP9 substrate.</p><p>Next in vitro cleavage assays were performed to test for processing of the Syk N-terminus peptide (1–31) by recombinant DPP9.

Processing was strongly reduced to only 6.2% in control samples treated with the allosteric DPP8/9 peptide inhibitor SLRFLYEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pilla et al., 2013</xref>).

Previously we demonstrated that this inhibitor can be delivered into cells if it is pre-incubated with cell penetrating peptides (Pep1) to form a non-covalent Pep-1-SLRFLYEG complex. Once in cells this complex dissociates leading to inhibition of DPP9 by SLRFLYEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pilla et al., 2013</xref>). Consistently, exposure of cells to SLRFLYEG resulted in a significant reduction in PLA signals corresponding to DPP9-Syk interaction events, compared to the control cells treated with the carrier peptide only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Likewise, treatment of cells with the competitive DPP9 inhibitor 1G244 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2009</xref>) also led to a clear decrease in the number of Syk-DPP9 PLA signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of note 1G244 and all other available DPP9 inhibitors also target DPP8 due to the high conservation in the active site of both enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Van Goethem et al., 2011</xref>). For control, we measured the association of DPP9 with FLNA, which was not significantly altered by the 1G244 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). These results demonstrate that Syk, but not FLNA, requires access to the active site of DPP9 for interaction. Taken together, we conclude that Syk is a novel DPP9 substrate.</p><p>What is the role of FLNA for the DPP9-Syk interaction? Strikingly, immunofluorescence microscopy images show a drastic change in the cellular localization of DPP9 in FLNA silenced cells compared to control cells treated with non-targeting siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). In particular, upon FLNA silencing, DPP9 was no longer observed at the plasma membrane and was detected less in the cytosol, showing elevated levels in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). These results demonstrate that FLNA has a strong impact on the cellular localization of DPP9. We further tested the importance of FLNA for the DPP9-Syk interaction by performing PLAs of DPP9-Syk in FLNA silenced cells, and compared to cells treated with non-targeting siRNA. We detected a significant reduction in the number of DPP9-Syk interaction events in the FLNA silenced cells as indicated by a lower number of PLA dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that the presence of FLNA is important for the ability of DPP9 and Syk to interact in cells, which eventually leads to Syk processing.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16370.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>FLNA - a scaffold linking DPP9 to Syk.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence images of HeLa cells showing that the cellular localization of DPP9 is altered in FLNA silenced cells.

This cell line shows a 40% reduction in its capacity to cleave the artificial substrate Gly-Pro-AMC (GP-AMC), which can be cleaved by DPP8, DPP9 and DPPIV. Additionally, we detected at least a 50% reduction in DPP9 protein levels in these cells compared to the control parental cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Surprisingly, although we transfected wild type and DPP9-kd cells with equal amounts of plasmid DNA encoding C-terminal FLAG tagged Syk (Syk-FLAG), higher Syk protein levels were observed in the DPP9-kd cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These unequal protein levels of the transiently transfected Syk constructs suggested that Syk may be more stable in the DPP9-kd cell line than in the wild type parental cell line. To test this hypothesis, we performed cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiments of DPP9-kd and the parental cells transfected with the Syk-FLAG construct. Cells were treated with CHX to inhibit protein synthesis (‘pulse’, time 0), and samples were taken at different time points for the chase. We found that Syk-FLAG is degraded in HeLa cells with a half-life of 6 hr. Remarkably, Syk-FLAG was more stable in the DPP9-kd cells compared to the control parental HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C and D</xref>). These results suggest that processing of Syk by DPP9 and exposure of a neo Syk N-terminus with serine in position 1 (MA↓S) leads to Syk degradation, possibly by the N-end rule pathway.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16370.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>DPP9 determines Syk stability by exposing an N-terminal serine.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reduced DPP activity in cytosolic extracts of HeLa cells with a stable silencing of DPP9 (DPP9-kd).

To test whether the serine that is exposed upon DPP9 cleavage indeed determines Syk stability, we mutated this residue to a glycine (SykS3G) or a valine (SykS3V). Following processing by DPP9 these Syk constructs would differ only in the first amino acid in their N–terminus, which would be either Ser in wild type Syk, Gly or Val in the variant proteins. We chose these residues since substrates with Ser, Gly or Val in the P1’ position (after the cleavage site) are processed by DPP9 with a similar efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geiss-Friedlander et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, we mutated the alanine in position 2 to an aspartic acid (SykA2D). This mutation destroys the DPP9 cleavage site, and thus should prevent Syk processing by DPP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connolly et al., 2008</xref>). The different Syk constructs were transfected into HeLa cells and their stability was compared by CHX chase experiments. Strikingly, the single mutation of Ser 3 to a Gly or a Val clearly increased the half-life of the SykS3G and SykS3V variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>), compared to the wild-type protein. Furthermore, an increased half-life of Syk was also measured for the SykA2D variant, which cannot be processed by DPP9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). These results highlight the importance of Syk cleavage by DPP9 and the destabilizing effect of the serine that is exposed in the N-terminus of Syk upon cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DPP9 leads to Syk degradation in B cells upon BCR-engagement</title><p>In B cells Syk signalling is initiated by the binding of an antigen to the BCR.

BCR signalling was elicited by treating cells with anti-BCR F(ab)<sub>2</sub> when adding the CHX. DPP9 and Tubulin remained unaltered over the respective chase period and were assessed as a loading control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Whereas Syk was stable in unstimulated B cells over a time period of 6 hr, upon stimulation of the BCR, Syk was degraded with a half-life of 2 hr (+ stimulation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Syk half-life in stimulated DG-75 cells is shorter than the previously published half-life of Syk in stimulated natural killer cells where it is estimated to be 8 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paolini et al., 2001</xref>). As expected, a clear stabilization of Syk was observed in stimulated DG-75 cells which were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>). Notably, consistent with our findings showing stabilization of Syk in DPP9-kd HeLa cells, treatment of stimulated DG-75 cells with the DPP8/9 inhibitor 1G244 resulted in a clear stabilization of Syk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>).</p><p>Next, we applied specific antibodies recognizing Syk phosphorylated on Y323, which was previously shown to be important for binding to Cbl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yankee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lupher et al., 1998</xref>). CHX chase experiments on BCR stimulated cells show clear signals corresponding to the phosphorylation of Syk on Y323 upon stimulation of DG-75 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H and I</xref>), which clearly dropped in intensity over time. Notably, the intensities of signals corresponding to Syk pY323 did not drop as rapidly in 1G244 treated cells. Instead, we observed an increase in signal intensity up to 20 min post BCR stimulation, suggesting that during this time more Syk is phosphorylated on Y323, but degradation is prevented due to inhibition of DPP9. Taken together, these results show a central role for DPP9 in determining the stability of Syk after BCR-engagement, and suggest that DPP9 functions upstream of Cbl.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>DPP9 is a negative regulator of Syk signalling in B cells</title><p>In addition to Y323, engagement of the BCR initiates the phosphorylation of Syk on multiple sites within a short time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furlong et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bohnenberger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Satpathy et al., 2015</xref>).

Remarkably, application of 1G244 to DG-75 cells triggered a rapid increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes, which occurred before the stimulation of the BCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> reached a plateau within less than 3 min after application of 1G244, in DG-75 cells, and were less elevated upon BCR engagement compared to control cells. Similar results were also observed in Ramos cells, a second Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>The rapid increase in calcium fluxes in response to DPP9 inhibition independently of BCR stimulation was surprising, since Syk appears to be stable in unstimulated B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Furthermore, in the absence of BCR stimulation, the steady state levels of Syk were comparable in cells treated with 1G244 and in mock treated cells (no 1G244) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Similar results were observed for PLCγ2. However, as we tested for the levels of active syk and PLCγ2, we found that the phosphorylation levels of Syk (Syk-pY352) and PLCγ2 (PLCγ2-pY753) were higher in the 1G244 treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). These observations are in line with the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). Immunoprecipitation assays of DG-75 cell lysates with antibodies against phospho-tyrosine (p-Y) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) also revealed higher levels of phosphorylated Syk and PLCγ2 upon DPP9 inhibition with 1G244 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), independently of BCR stimulation. Consistently, an increase in the steady state phosphorylation levels of PLCγ2 on pY753 was also observed in DG75 cells treated with the allosteric inhibitor of DPP9 SLRFLYEG in the absence of BCR engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>To further test the biological consequences of DPP9 activity, we analysed the effect of DPP9 inhibition on the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1/2 which is a distal downstream target of Syk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Slack et al, 2007</xref>). We therefore incubated DG-75 cells with 1G244 prior to BCR stimulation and subsequently analysed ERK1/2 phosphorylation. While BCR engagement under DPP9 inhibition revealed a more transient ERK1/2 phosphorylation profile compared to control cells, it is important to note that the levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in resting cells were slightly augmented in cells that were treated with 1G244 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7 G and H</xref>). These results are in line with the finding that DPP9 inhibition in unstimulated cells stabilizes an active phosphorylated form of Syk, resulting in ‘signal leakage’ as measured by higher levels of phosphorylated PLCγ2 forms and increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes leading to reduced sensitivity to BCR engagement. Taken together, these results suggest that DPP9 is an integral negative regulator of Syk signalling by terminating Syk activity through processing the amino terminus of the kinase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>DPP9 – a negative regulator of Syk signalling</title><p>Here, we report the identification of Syk as a novel endogenous substrate of DPP9.

Here, we present evidence for the role of DPP9 as a novel negative regulator of Syk that determines Syk stability.

Moreover, the interaction between Cbl and Syk is reduced to background level upon DPP9 silencing.

These results show that inhibition of DPP9 prior to BCR engagement leads to a ‘leakage’ in Syk signalling, and consequently reduces the response of these cells to BCR-stimulation as measured by lower levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release upon BCR-engagement probably due to the depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the resting stage. Consistently, we observed reduced BCR mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 upon DPP9 inhibition in these cells.</p><p>In addition to activated BCR signalling, which relays on the binding of antigens to the BCR, B cells also possess the so-called ‘tonic’ signalling, which maintains a constitutive baseline signal in B cells. Tonic signalling occurs in the absence of antigen binding, but nonetheless is dependent on the presence and activity of the BCR and some BCR components such as Syk, PLCγ2 and ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Monroe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wienands et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shaffer and Schlissel, 1997</xref>). The molecular details regarding this pathway are only emerging but it is clear that tonic signalling is essential for survival of B cells, including Burkitt lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corso et al., 2016</xref>). We suggest that by targeting Syk pY352 for degradation, DPP9 maintains low levels of activated Syk sufficient for tonic signalling, and thus can influence the strength of the BCR signalling in response to antigen engagement. By targeting Syk for degradation after BCR engagement, DPP9 can also influence the duration of the response to antigen BCR binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16370.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model - DPP9 is a negative regulator for Syk signalling, targeting active Syk for degradation by the N-end rule pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model: DPP9 regulates Syk signalling.

FLNA then supports the cleavage of Syk by DPP9, by increasing the local concentration of Syk and DPP9, stabilizing the interaction between Syk and DPP9, or by optimizing the orientation of DPP9 and Syk. The interaction between DPP and Syk leads to the processing of Syk N-terminus which removes the dipeptide MA, and exposes a neo Syk N-terminus with serine in position 1 is exposed.

Silencing (DPP9-kd) or inhibition of DPP9, or mutation of the DPP9 cleavage site in Syk (SykD2A) result in an increased stability of Syk. The significance of the exposed Ser for Syk stability was demonstrated by mutagenesis of this residue to a Gly or Val, resulting in a longer half-life of these variants. Therefore, we conclude that Syk is a novel substrate of the N-end rule pathway and DPP9 a novel peptidase in this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, and see more below). Of note classical primary N-degron are positively charged or bulky hydrophobic amino acids.

Knowledge regarding the participation of aminopeptidases in the N-end rule pathway is limited to methionine aminopeptidases (MetAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Varshavsky, 2011</xref>). These remove a single methionine from the amino terminus of a protein substrate leaving the protein otherwise intact. Of note, cleavage by MetAPs does not directly form an N-degron, since MetAPs remove the initiator methionine from substrates where the adjacent residue (P1’) is not destabilizing: Ser, Pro, Gly, Thr, Ala, Val or Cys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachmair and Varshavsky, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addlagatta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frottin et al., 2006</xref>).

Our data place DPP9 as a second integral aminopeptidase of the N-end rule pathway. In contrast to MetAPs, DPP9 cleavage is permissive towards more amino acids in the P1’ position (Xaa-Ala/Pro-Zaa), and is only inhibited if the residue after the cleavage site (Zaa) is Pro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geiss-Friedlander et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore DPP9 may directly produce an N-degron not requiring further modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Additionally, DPP9 can cleave substrates with any amino acid in the P2 position (Xaa) apart from Asp or Glu, greatly increasing the number of potential substrates, including proteins undergoing progressive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geiss-Friedlander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connolly et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Whereas MetAPs function largely in a co-translational manner, our data strongly suggest that DPP9 acts in a post-translational manner. Consequently, processing by DPP9 and MetAPs and funnelling of their products to the N-end rule pathway may be regulated by different signals. MetAP substrates, which were processed and acetylated at the N-terminus co-translationally, can be protected from degradation by masking of the N-degron, e.g. via protein interactions, and exposed upon changes in protein stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hwang et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shemorry et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, DPP9 substrates may be processed only upon a specific post-translational cue. For Syk, our data suggest increased cleavage by DPP9 upon BCR stimulation indicated by a shorter half-life of Syk in stimulated cells, and clear stabilization by 1G244 treatment comparable to that observed with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. This increased processing of Syk upon BCR stimulation may depend for example on Syk phosphorylation.</p><p>Additionally, we found that although DPP9 interacts directly with Syk, in cells this interaction requires FLNA, suggesting that FLNA may serve as an interaction platform linking DPP9 and Syk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Consequently, FLNA may support Syk processing e.g. by increasing the local concentration of Syk and DPP9, stabilizing the complex formation or by optimizing the orientation of DPP9 and Syk for efficient cleavage. In this sense, the function of FLNA may parallel that of F-box proteins in the ubiquitin ligase SCF complexes, which bind to substrates and thus support their ubiquitination by ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edward and Kipreos, 2000</xref>). Since FLNA interacts with multiple proteins, it is tempting to speculate that it acts as a general recruitment factor targeting DPP9 to additional potential substrates for cleavage.</p><p>In conclusion, here we identify DPP9 as a novel upstream component of the N-end rule pathway. We suggest that depending on the substrate and the exposed residue in the neo N-terminus, DPP9 may cooperate with Cbl or other E3 ligases that then ubiquitinate the substrate resulting in proteasomal degradation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, transfection and silencing</title><p>HeLa DPP9 silenced cells (DPP9-kd) were custom made for us by GenScript.

The search for functioning protease substrates – including DPP9 – is proceeding apace, but as the authors point out the identification of physiologically relevant substrates and partners is hampered by current limitations in technology. The authors have compiled several innovative strategies to explore a physiologic function for DPP9. They find that DPP9 regulates the levels on Syk in a FLNA-dependent manner, and the overall thrust of the paper supports a role for DPP9 in N-end rule degradation.</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that this paper was interesting and appropriate, in principle, for <italic>eLife</italic>, subject to addressing a few issues.</p><p>1) The link with filamin A is addressed only in the first part of the paper: is there any evidence of similar FLNA involvement in B cells?</p><p>2) The demonstration that DPP9 cleaves Syk directly is dependent on a small peptide for the Syk N-terminus.

What are the consequences on B cell fate and function of the calcium defects observed? Are other signalling pathways that involve Syk affected (e.g. Ras/MAPK or PKC/NFkB)? Does DPP9 inactivation change cell proliferation or other behaviour in B cells or Syk expressing cancer cells?</p><p>4) Much weight is put on the IG244 inhibitor in functional assays.

These assays confirm that the interactions between FLNA-DPP9 and FLNA-Syk are indeed conserved in the B cells. The new data are added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The demonstration that DPP9 cleaves Syk directly is dependent on a small peptide for the Syk N-terminus. This is central to the paper and it would be reassuring to know that full length Syk is also an efficient substrate.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the cleavage of Syk by DPP9 is a central point for this paper. As suggested we cloned Syk for expression of the full-length protein in <italic>E. coli,</italic> as well as a shorter fragment expressing the two SH2 domains in the N-terminus of Syk fused to a C-terminal GST protein. The purified proteins were incubated with DPP9, control reactions contained Syk alone, or Syk which was incubated with an inactive DPP9 variant or in the presence of an inhibitor. Mass spectrometry analysis of these reactions revealed that the amino terminus of Syk is processed in bacteria,which remove the initiator methionine (more than 90% efficiency). Consequently, the recombinant Syk which we purified from bacteria is unfit for in vitro cleavage assays.</p><p>In parallel we addressed this point, by exchanging the Ala in position 2 of Syk N-terminus to Asp (Syk A2D), thus destroying the DPP9 cleavage site in Syk. Pulse-chase analysis of this Syk variant show that abolishing the DPP9 cleavage site strongly stabilizes Syk, supporting the notion that Syk is indeed cleaved by DPP9 in the context of the full protein. These data are added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>, and are in agreement with results that we have already included in the manuscript: (1) PLA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> showing that the interactions between endogenous DPP9 and Syk are reduced in cells that were treated with a DPP9 inhibitor. In this case either a competitive inhibitor (1G244) or an allosteric inhibitor (SLRFLYEG). (2) Functional assays showing that silencing or inhibition of DPP9 clearly stabilize Syk, both in HeLa cells (transfected Syk) and in B cells (endogenous Syk).</p><p>Moreover, when examining the published solved structures of Syk, specifically at the amino terminus we observed that the best coverage of Syk N-terminus starts from residue 8, which is followed by an unstructured region. We presume that the lack of solved structures, which include residues 1-7 is due to a high flexibility of this region. The fact that the amino terminus appears to be unstructured, suggests that it is highly flexible, which would strongly support the accessibility of the N-terminus into the active site of DPP9.</p><p>To point this out we included a short sentence regarding the N terminus of Syk into the manuscript:</p><p>“Based on published structures, the amino terminus of Syk includes an unstructured region followed by an α-helix (residues 22-31) (Gradler et al., 2013; Fütterer et al., 1998). Of note, amino acids 1-7 are not resolved in any determined structure of Syk, suggesting that this region is flexible and thus accessible for interactions.”</p><p>Hence the unstructured nature of Syk N-terminus supports the conclusions from the mass spec analysis using small peptides.</p><p>Finally, as processing of the full Syk protein could not be reliably tested, we now analyzed whether DPP9 can process a longer synthetic peptide covering the N-terminal residues 1-31 of Syk. This is the peptide we used for the SPR assays. We now show that indeed DPP9 can efficiently cleave a larger Syk peptide, which most possibly mimics the N-terminal structure of the protein, with an unfolded region and an α-helix. These new data replace the previous mass spec analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, which previously analyzed the cleavage of a shorter peptide (1-15).</p><p>Taken together, the mass spec analysis with a long Syk peptide (1-31, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the SPR with longSyk peptides (1-31, 3-31), the PLA data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: endogenous proteins, use of different inhibitors), the Pulse chases in the DPP9 stably silenced cells and the different variants of Syk, functionally show that DPP9 does cleave Syk in the context of the full length protein and that this cleavage is biologically relevant.</p><p><italic>3) The link between DPP9's activity on Syk and the biological consequences is not very strong. What are the consequences on B cell fate and function of the calcium defects observed? Are other signalling pathways that involve Syk affected (e.g. Ras/MAPK or PKC/NFkB)? Does DPP9 inactivation change cell proliferation or other behaviour in B cells or Syk expressing cancer cells?</italic> </p><p>To address the question regarding the biological consequences of DPP9 activity on B cell fate, we tested the effect of DPP9 inhibition on Syk signaling.</p><p>Intriguingly we found that DPP9 appears to stabilize preferentially active, phosphorylated Syk, both in stimulated and non-stimulated cells. The calcium defects that are observed upon inhibition of DPP9 in non-stimulated cells appear to result from a mal-regulation of ‘tonic’ Syk signaling in resting cells, as seen by higher levels of phosphorylated Syk. We now complete the picture by showing that also the levels of phosphorylated PLCγ2 are higher upon DPP9 inhibition in resting cells, either with a competitive or with a non-competitive allosteric DPP9 inhibitor. The consequence is a lower sensitivity of the cells to BCR stimulation. This is evident by lower calcium release in stimulated cells (DG-75 and Ramos cells). Moreover, we analyzed more distal BCR events and show that inhibition of DPP9 leads to augmented ‘tonic’ and more transient BCR-induced ERK1/2 signaling, as measured by reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2.</p><p>These new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>) further confirm our conclusion that DPP9 is a novel negative regulator of Syk, which keeps the levels of phosphorylated Syk low in unstimulated cells, and consequently attenuates the Syk mediated signal transduction after BCR engagement.</p><p><italic>4) Much weight is put on the IG244 inhibitor in functional assays. It would be reassuring to use another inhibitor or – even better – genetic knockdown to insure against misleading off-target effects.</italic> </p><p>We addressed this question from two aspects. Since in HeLa cells we showed specificity using the DPP9 silenced cells, we now concentrated on DG-75 cells. Of note, 1G244 is considered the most specific competitive inhibitor of DPP8 and DPP9. All other available competitive inhibitors target DPPIV as well, due to the high conservation of the active site.</p><p>First, we performed PLAs in DG-75 cells and tested whether Syk interacts with 2 homologs of DPP9: DPP8 (60% homology to DPP9, localized to the cytosol and nucleus) and DPPIV (26% homology to DPP9, localized to the plasma membrane). These assays show that signals for DPP8-Syk or DPPIV-Syk are not above background levels of control PLAs, whereas the interaction between DPP9 and Syk was significantly higher than background. These data are inserted into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>Second, we performed cellular assays with the allosteric inhibitor SLRFLYEG which enters DG-75 cells, when complexed with pep-1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> shows that like 1G244 also SLRFLYEG treatment results in increased steady state levels of phosphorylated PLCγ2 in B cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
