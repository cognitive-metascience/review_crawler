area V4 whose receptive-fields lie at the attended location. It has been estimated that this reduction accounts for a substantial fraction of the attention-mediated improvement in sensory processing. These estimates depend on assumptions about how population signals are decoded and the conclusion that correlated variability impairs perception, is purely hypothetical. Here we test this proposal directly by optogenetically inducing low-frequency fluctuations, to see if this interferes with performance in an attention-demanding task. We find that low-frequency optical stimulation of neurons in V4 elevates correlations among pairs of neurons and impairs the animal’s ability to make fine sensory discriminations. Stimulation at higher frequencies does not impair performance, despite comparable modulation of neuronal responses. These results support the hypothesis that attention-dependent reductions in correlated variability contribute to improved perception of attended stimuli.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Optogenetics</kwd><kwd>visual attention</kwd><kwd>correlations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nandy</surname><given-names>Anirvan</given-names></name><name><surname>Nassi</surname><given-names>Jonathan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY021827</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reynolds</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name><name><surname>Nandy</surname><given-names>Anirvan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH T32 EY020503</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nandy</surname><given-names>Anirvan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00EY025026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jadi</surname><given-names>Monika P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000135</institution-id><institution>NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reynolds</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000324</institution-id><institution>Gatsby Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reynolds</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Low-frequency correlations among neurons in monkey visual area V4 impair the animal's ability to perform an attention-demanding task, suggesting a causal role of these fluctuations in perception.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons exhibit responses that are highly variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</xref>), with nearby neurons in the cortex exhibiting correlated variability in their spiking output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen and Kohn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Smith and Kohn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smith and Sommer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zohary et al., 1994</xref>). It has been estimated on theoretical grounds that even weak correlations substantially reduce the information coding capacity of a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zohary et al., 1994</xref>). Spatial attention can reduce correlated variability (often referred to as noise correlations) among neurons in macaque visual area V4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen and Maunsell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref>), an area that is strongly modulated by spatial attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref> found that this reduction is restricted to low frequencies below 10 Hz. These studies have estimated, on theoretical grounds, that the reduction in correlated variability accounts for a large fraction (about 80%) of the perceptual benefit due to attention. However, these estimates rely on specific assumptions about the relationship between noise and signal correlations, and thereby, on how population signals are read out in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Dayan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moreno-Bote et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Panzeri et al., 1999</xref>). Theoretical studies using heterogeneous tuning curves and optimal readout have concluded that correlated variability does not necessarily limit information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ecker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shamir and Sompolinsky, 2006</xref>). Consistent with the interpretation that attention-dependent reductions in correlated variability improve perception, a recent study of the effects of naturally occurring fluctuations in neural correlations found improved sensory discrimination when neurons in Area V4 were desynchronized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaman et al., 2017</xref>). However, other studies have posited that correlations themselves may be induced by fluctuations in attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goris et al., 2014</xref>), resulting in variation in response gain that is shared across neurons, and other experiments have shown that attention can, under some conditions, also increase correlated neural response variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ruff and Cohen, 2014</xref>). Taken together, these studies call into question the simple idea that attention reduces correlations so as to improve sensory discrimination. Importantly, all of these studies are correlative in nature. The causal role of correlated variability in perception has not been tested and thus the proposal that low-frequency correlated variability is detrimental for perception has remained purely hypothetical.</p><p>Here, we sought to directly test the effects of correlated variability on sensory discrimination by using optogenetic activation to induce correlations in Area V4 as monkeys performed an orientation discrimination task near perceptual threshold. We exploited the fact that attentional modulation of correlated variability is both spatially- and frequency selective: attention-dependent reductions in correlation are restricted to low frequencies (&lt;10 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref>)). We reasoned that the correlations that impair perception may have an inherent time scale, with low- but not high-frequency correlations impairing perception. If so, we would predict that the effects of correlations on perception should be specific to this low-frequency range.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We took advantage of a novel approach to primate optogenetics and electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nassi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ruiz et al., 2013</xref>) in which the native dura mater is replaced by a silicone based artificial dura (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>).

The monkeys were spatially cued to attend to one of two spatial locations. In the ‘attend in’ condition, the monkeys were instructed to covertly attend to a spatial location within the receptive fields of neurons at the viral injection site, while maintaining fixation at a central fixation point. In the ‘attend-away’ condition attention was directed to a location of equal eccentricity across the vertical meridian. On each trial, a sequence of oriented Gabor stimuli simultaneously flashed on and off at both spatial locations (200 ms on, variable 200–400 ms off). At an unpredictable time (minimum 1 s, maximum 5 s), one of the two stimuli (95% probability at cued location; 5% probability at uncued location, ‘foil trials’) briefly changed in orientation (200 ms) and the monkey was rewarded for making a saccade to the location of orientation change. If no change occurred within 5 s (‘catch trials’, 13% of trials), the monkey was rewarded for holding fixation.

Our goal was to induce correlations without significantly altering the mean firing rates by using low-power stimulation. Significant changes in mean firing rate could have unknown effects such as masking of the stimulus evoked response. Equating firing rates also avoids any indirect effects of mean firing rate changes on spike-count correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen and Kohn, 2011</xref>). We find that low-frequency optical stimulation modulates the timing of the neural response (Figure 4D) but does not alter the overall magnitude of the population response (Figure 4A, B, C). We replicate previous findings that attention reduces low-frequency spike-count correlations in the baseline (no optical stimulation) condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel; gray versus white bars, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.02</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>, <italic>t</italic>-test). As predicted, low-frequency optical stimulation increases low-frequency correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel; blue versus gray bar, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.045</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>, <italic>t</italic>-test). The induced correlations were at a level comparable in strength to that observed when attention was directed away from the RF location in the baseline condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel; blue versus white bar). Optogenetic activation is accompanied by a period of reduced activity following stimulation. By careful titration of laser intensity (amplitude of sinusoidal modulation) we were able to alter the timing of spiking without altering mean firing rate. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: we see a robust increase in firing rate due to attention in both the low-frequency stimulation and baseline conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>), but there is no significant rate increase due to optical stimulation either during the pre-stimulus blank period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, left panel, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.49</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>, <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, top-left panel) or during the stimulus presentation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right panel, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, bottom-left panel).

To quantify this behavioral deficit, we estimated the threshold of the monkeys’ psychometric functions and calculated the change in threshold due to optical stimulation as a modulation index (perceptual discrimination modulation index, PDMI; see Materials and methods). We find a significant increase in PDMI due to low-frequency stimulation in the attend-in condition (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.02</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>, <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating impaired detection of fine orientation changes.

In a large fraction of individual behavioral sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>), both the changes in threshold and slope were significant (20/42 sessions). 11/42 sessions had significant threshold change only, while 5/42 sessions had significant slope change only.</p><p>The impairment due to optical stimulation is location specific: there was no significant change in PDMI on trials when the monkey was cued to detect the target at the unstimulated location (attend-away condition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Importantly, the impairment is also frequency specific. When we stimulate the neurons with 20Hz sinusoidally modulated low-power laser stimulation (‘high-frequency stimulation’ condition), we observed no significant change in PDMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), despite a significant increase in high-frequency spike-count correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and phase locking comparable to the low-frequency stimulation condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). As in the low-frequency stimulation condition, we find no significant changes in mean firing rates with the high-frequency stimulation condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, right panels). The stimuli in each sequence were presented with irregular timing to ensure that any impairment did not stem from stimuli appearing at a particular phase of the laser stimulation, such as the phase at which neural sensitivity was at its nadir. To verify that such phase alignment did not nonetheless occur by chance, we measured the phase of target stimulus onset for both low- and high-frequency stimulation and found no phase preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

A second potential concern is that the laser might impair orientation discrimination by distorting or flattening orientation tuning curves. We find that orientation tuning curves were not significantly altered by the laser at either frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), at least in the range of orientations used in the experiment. A two-way ANOVA of normalized firing rates with factors 'laser-condition' (low-frequency laser, no laser) and 'orientation' revealed no significant main effect of laser condition (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf32"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>laser-condition</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.8</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.37</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>), a significant main effect of orientation and no significant interaction between the two factors.

A third potential concern is that the rhythmic laser stimulation might cause a sort of frequency-dependent adaptation that would cause neurons to be less sensitive to visual stimuli presented at a similar frequency. If so, the low-frequency (4-5Hz) laser stimulation could reduce the responses evoked by 200ms visual stimuli, impairing the monkey’s ability to discriminate the stimuli, while the high-frequency laser stimulation might not cause this effect, explaining the observed impairment. To test this, we measured the firing rates evoked by the first four non-target stimulus flashes, on no-laser, low-frequency laser and high-frequency laser trials, in the 'attend in' condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Though the first stimulus in the sequence evoked a stronger response than the subsequent stimuli (reflecting a form of visual stimulus-driven adaptation), we find no evidence that the addition of the laser at either frequency caused a change in mean firing rate. A two-way ANOVA of normalized firing rate with factors 'flash-position' (1,2,3 or 4) and 'laser condition' (low-frequency laser, high-frequency laser, no laser) revealed a significant main effect of flash position (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf34"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>flash-position</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>3.33</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.02</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>), no significant main effect of laser condition (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>laser-condition</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.65</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.52</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>) and no significant interaction between the two factors.

This was true for false alarms made during catch trials as well as on non-catch trials. Thus, we find no evidence that laser stimulation caused our subjects to mis-perceive a non-target as a target.</p><p>V4 has patchy organization for orientation tuning, so simultaneously recorded neurons tended to prefer similar orientations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Under these conditions, where signal correlations are positive, positive noise correlations should reduce discriminability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>) by increasing the overlap between neural responses evoked by discriminanda. In the present experiment, where the task was to discriminate target from non-target, this would predict that in sessions where we observed laser-induced perceptual impairment, we should observe laser-induced decreases in discriminability at the level of pairs or populations of neurons, especially on miss trials, when the monkey was unable to discriminate target from non-target. For each recording session, we calculated a neural measure of discriminability between non-target and target stimuli across simultaneously recorded neurons (neural discriminability modulation index, NDMI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; see Materials and methods, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen and Maunsell, 2010</xref>)). We then examined whether laser-induced increases in perceptual threshold were correlated with laser-induced reductions in neural discriminability on trials in which the target appeared at the opsin location (the 'attend in' condition). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows NDMI for each experimental session (calculated from miss trials where the animal failed to detect a target) against the corresponding PDMI. We examined this in two ways: by measuring the correlation in a N-dimensional space where N is the number of neurons recorded in a given session (left panel) or by measuring the average NDMI across neural pairs (right panel). As predicted, there is a strong and significant negative correlation in both analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf40"><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.29</mml:mn> <mml:mi/><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula>, NDMI from all simultaneous neurons, left panel; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf41"><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.42</mml:mn> <mml:mi/><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.01</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula>, average NDMI across all simultaneous pairs, right panel; robust correlation). In both analyses, the sessions in which low-frequency laser-induced correlations caused the strongest perceptual suppression all showed negative NDMIs. In other words, laser-induced reductions in discriminability at the neural level corresponded to increased perceptual thresholds. There was no significant correlation between NDMI and changes in the slope of the psychometric function.

The dura mater adhered to V4 bilaterally and we were unable to perform histology. The second animal (Monkey A) is currently in use in another study. Thus, we do not have a measure of lenti/CAMKII selectivity in macaque V4. However, it is reasonable to assume that the opsin was strongly biased toward pyramidal neurons. The viral constructs and injection protocol used in the present study were identical to those used previously in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nassi et al., 2015</xref>). In that study, lenti/CAMKII expressing C1V1/EYFP led to expression that was highly selective for excitatory neurons (Figure 1B of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nassi et al., 2015</xref>): of 119 neurons imaged in five different fields of view, only 2 (1.7%) were double labeled for both EYFP and parvalbumin/calretinin/calbindin, indicating that expression was heavily biased toward excitatory neurons. CaMKII has also been used in other macaque brain areas including perirhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tamura et al., 2017</xref>), where it also led to opsin expression primarily in excitatory neurons. It is possible that lenti/CAMKII leads to less selective expression in V4 pyramidal neurons, but whatever the degree of selectivity we were able to activate neuronal responses in a phase-dependent manner with low intensity laser stimulation. as needed to test the effect of correlated variability on perceptual discrimination in the present study.</p><p>Our results establish the first causal link between correlated variability and perception. The optogenetic stimulation protocol in our study, using sinusoidal modulation of laser irradiance, induces the kind of correlations in a local population of the cortex that might not be physiologically realistic. It nevertheless establishes the causal relevance of low-frequency correlated variability in perception and supports the hypothesis that attention-dependent reductions in correlated variability enhance perception. Recently, studies have theorized that only certain correlations – those that are indistinguishable from stimulus-induced correlations – are information limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moreno-Bote et al., 2014</xref>). We speculate that the correlations induced in our study included such information-limiting correlations, resulting in the observed impairment. The timescale of these low-frequency correlations is consistent with inter-saccadic intervals (200–300 ms), which may be a relevant timeframe for gathering visual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yarbus et al., 1967</xref>). Decreases in correlated variability at this timescale could therefore be critical for perception. Our study paves the way for investigating the laminar and cell-class specific components of the cortical circuit that determine this critical component of perception.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Surgical procedures</title><p>Surgical procedures have been described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nandy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nassi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ruiz et al., 2013</xref>).

This served to stabilize the site against cardiac and respiratory pulsations. The opening was centered at the site of viral injection. A single tungsten microelectrode (FHC Inc) was mounted on an adjustable X-Y stage attached to the recording chamber and advanced into the injection site using a micromanipulator (Narishige Inc) until a spike (single neuron or multi-unit) could be reliably isolated from background voltage fluctuations. Site targeting was done under microscopic guidance (Zeiss Inc) using the microvasculature as reference. A single optical fiber (600 μm multimode fiber, 0.37NA, Thorlabs Inc) was mounted on the same X-Y stage and positioned over the injection site perpendicular to the calvarium.

A beam-splitter between the EOM and collimator directed approximately 1% of the light toward a high-speed photo-detector (Thorlabs, Inc). The EOM allowed us to control the intensity of laser light entering the fiber and was controlled using custom-written Labview software and a National Instruments digital acquisition board. Before each experiment we calibrated the output of the high-speed photodetector to the full range of intensities (irradiance units) measured at the fiber tip using an integrating sphere photodiode power sensor and a digital power meter (Thorlabs, Inc).

One of the Gabors was flashed in the center of the RFs, the other at a location of equal eccentricity across the vertical meridian. At the beginning of a block of trials, the monkey was spatially cued (‘instruction trials’) to covertly attend to one of these two spatial locations. During these instruction trials, the stimuli were only flashed at the spatially cued location. At an unpredictable time (minimum 1s, maximum 5s, mean 3s), one of the two stimuli changed in orientation. The time of orientation change was chosen by sampling from an exponential distribution (thus leading to a flat hazard function of wait times till orientation change). If the sampled change time exceeded 5s, the trial was treated as a catch trial (see below), in which the change did not actually occur during the trial and the monkey was rewarded for maintaining fixation. If the orientation change did occur, the monkey was rewarded for making a saccade to the location of orientation change. However, the monkey was rewarded for only those saccades where the saccade onset time was within a window of 100-400ms after the onset of the orientation change. The location of orientation change was chosen with 95% probability at the cued location and with 5% probability at the uncued location (‘foil trials’).

If no change occurred before 5s, the monkey was rewarded for maintaining fixation (‘catch trials’, 13% of trials).

Significant changes in threshold and slope for each individual behavioral session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>) were calculated by comparing the distributions of threshold and slope values estimated from the jackknife procedure between the optical stimulation and baseline conditions (<italic>t</italic>-test, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf64"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>, corrected for the number of jackknifes).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5-2"><title>Peri-stimulus time-histograms</title><p>For this and subsequent analyses of neuronal data, we restricted our analyses to non-target flashes from correct trials (hit trials in which the monkey correctly detected a target or correct catch trials). Neuronal responses were binned using a sliding window of width 30 ms that was shifted by 10 ms increments to obtain the time-varying firing rates, also known as the peri-stimulus time-histograms (PSTH), of the recorded units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Population PSTH plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) were obtained after normalizing the responses of each neuron to the peak across the four experimental conditions (two attention conditions [attend-in, attend-away] x two stimulation conditions [no stimulation, laser stimulation]).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5-3"><title>Spike-phase distributions</title><p>We calculated the phase of each spike with respect to the sinusoidal laser stimulation during a 200 ms blank period before a non-target stimulus flash. We only considered those inter-stimulus periods where the inter-stimulus interval was greater than 500 ms (in other words, the interval between onset of the stimulus and the offset of the previous stimulus was greater than 300 ms), so as to minimize artifacts due to stimulus offset. Polar plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> show the distributions of spiking phases. To see if these distributions were significantly different from chance, we calculated a null distribution by generating spike times from a rate-matched Poisson process (gray polar plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To obtain reliable estimates for spike-phase distributions, we restricted our analysis to units with a minimum firing rate of 5 spikes/s (n = 68; firing rate averaged over the 200 ms stimulus-evoked period between 60–260 ms after non-target onset).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5-4"><title>Spike-count correlations (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf65"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>)</title><p>We calculated the Pearson correlation of spike counts across trials for every pair of simultaneously recorded units. In order to remove the influence of confounding variables like stimulus strength, spike counts were z-scored using the mean and standard deviation for repetitions of each stimulus type. Ordered pairs of z-scored spike counts were collapsed across contrast conditions and the Pearson correlation was calculated from these ordered pairs. This was done separately for the different attention and optical stimulation conditions and also for different sized counting windows (50ms for high-frequency correlations, 200ms for low-frequency correlations) during the stimulus-evoked period between 60-260ms after non-target onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Response rates for each neuron were normalized by the maximum response across conditions after first subtracting the spike rates during a 200ms pre-stimulus period (pre-stimulus rates calculated separately for baseline and low-frequency stimulation conditions). We thus obtained two response clouds for each experimental condition: one for the non-target stimuli and the other for the target stimuli (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We calculated the neural discriminability between the two response clouds as the Mahalanobis distance (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf66"><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) between the centroid of the target responses and the non-target response cloud.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Optogenetically induced low-frequency correlations impair perception&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper examined whether optogenetically induced increases in spike count correlations in V4 neurons affect the ability of macaque monkeys to detect small orientation changes of Gabor gratings. The authors report that the optogenetic stimulation in the low but not high frequency range affected performance and this effect was limited to the attended location, concluding that the attention induced reduction of low frequency spike count correlations results in improved performance.</p><p>The reviewers commented on the ambitious nature of the work and its potential importance, but raised a number of serious reservations that must be addressed for the paper to be further considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. These are summarized below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Anatomical evidence confirming that the neurons were actually transfected should be provided. This includes the information about the affected cell type, their layer locations and variability of the expression.</p><p>2) Variable performance on the orientation change task makes it difficult to interpret the effects of optogenetic stimulation. This problem should be addressed.</p><p>3) The presence of on- and off- transients in visual stimulation occurring at a frequency of 3-5Hz creates a potential problem in the study aimed at detecting correlations occurring at similarly low frequency. It is important to rule out that optogenetic stimulation may be affecting the detection of the onsets and offsets of visual stimuli. Reviewer 1 suggests a control condition that would eliminate such transients to see whether optogenetic manipulation is still selective for low frequencies.</p><p>A related question (reviewer 2) concerns the phase of optical stimulation relative to stimulus presentation whether the presence of the behavioral deficits depended on the phase of optical stimulation. Also, provide information about the phase of optical stimulation used to compute noise correlations</p><p>4) Data presentation limited to averages and distributions does not allow the evaluation of significant effects in each experiment. The data suggest that in some cases optogenetic stimulation resulted in elevated thresholds and slopes and in some cases in opposite effects. This is a problem that needs to be addressed and discussed.</p><p>5) Please provide a direct comparison between firing rates with and without optical stimulation, showing effects on individual neurons. Rate modulation index does not allow the reader to assess such effects directly.</p><p>6) Was orientation tuning affected by optical stimulation? If they were, the disruption of orientation representation in V4 by stimulation could potentially explain the behavioral effects. This should be addressed.</p><p>7) Please explain cued and uncued locations vs. &quot;catch trials&quot; and their randomization during the experiment (reviewer 1).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The goal of this paper is to causally test the idea that low-frequency oscillations amongst cortical neurons are a major limiting factor in visual perception and are actively controlled for visual attention. The strategy is a bold one – use optogenetics to introduce low-frequency correlations into the activity of cortical neurons in extrastriate area V4 and document the effects on both visual perception and neuronal activity. If the idea is correct, then the introduction of low-frequency correlations should impair performance. But there are many reasons that performance might be impaired when you alter visual cortical activity. So it is also necessary to show that visual activity has not simply been disrupted by the optogenetic manipulation, and that it is specifically the temporal restructuring of the activity that is crucial. To this end, the paper shows that overall firing rates are not changed, and that the effects are found only with low-frequency and not high-frequency stimulation, among other controls.</p><p>This is an ambitious set of experiments to attempt to pack into a short paper, especially given all of the potential pitfalls and controls that need to be considered. In the end, I was not fully convinced that the results as presented support the conclusions. There are several basic issues that need to be addressed to make the case more convincing. I also think that a more detailed unpacking of the data is need in order to understand the results.</p><p>The most obvious missing piece is histology. Figure 1C shows a surface view of the cortex illustrating the expression of EYFP. This is not sufficient to answer the questions relevant for interpreting the behavioral and neuronal data. Can you confirm that neurons were transfected? Which types of neurons, and in which layers? How variable was the expression across layers? Can you rule out retrograde transfection from axon terminals? Without histology to verify what was stimulated, I find it difficult to interpret the results.</p><p>Performance in the orientation change task seems extremely variable, to the point that it raises concerns about how to interpret changes in task performance. In some cases, the thresholds for detecting orientation changes seem to be in the expected range (a few degrees) – for example, Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 2A. But in other cases, the thresholds are unusually high, 10 degrees or more (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C). There are also unexpected elevations in% correct for signal values that should be below threshold – for example, 40% correct for the lowest orientation change value in Figure 2—figure supplement 2B. How could the monkey get 40% correct for an undetectable signal? In order to interpret the optogenetic manipulation, I would need to be reassured about the reliability of task performance in the absence of optogenetic manipulation.</p><p>There is a very basic aspect of the experimental design that seems like a problem, but perhaps the authors have a very well-reasoned explanation for this approach. The hypothesis is that low-frequency (4-5 Hz) correlations play a central role in cortical processing, and this guides the choice of sinusoidal optogenetic stimulation. But the stimulus itself is flashed on for 200 ms and then left off for 200-400 ms, which means that there were visual transients (on or off) also occurring at a frequency of 3-5 Hz. If the goal is to test the importance of intrinsic low-frequency correlations, why use a stimulus that includes transients in this same frequency range? It seems that an alternative explanation for the perturbations in performance might be that the optogenetic stimulation masks the ability to detect the onsets and offsets of the visual stimulus. Can this be ruled out? If the stimulus were simply left on for an extended period of time (seconds), and then changed orientation, would the optogenetic manipulation still be effective and still selective for low frequencies?</p><p>The data were compressed for presentation in ways that made it difficult to understand what additional significant effects might be present in each experiment. Figure 2C is a good example of this. The histogram illustrates that, overall, both the threshold and slope increased in trials with low-frequency optical stimulation, by showing that the population-level ratio of stimulation relative to baseline is significantly greater than 1. First, please clarify the stats (here and elsewhere). This is reported as a t-test in the fourth paragraph of the Results and Discussion. Which type – paired sample? Is the distribution normal, or should a non-parametric test be used? Second, please report the data in a way that allows us to appreciate what happened on individual experiments. Given the scale on the x-axis, it looks like optical stimulation may have caused significant increases in threshold or slope in some experiments and significant decreases in others. If so, it would be misleading to base the conclusion on the average effect. This point is especially relevant for the attend away condition (Figure 2D), in which the average threshold is not different, but the spread in the histogram suggests that many individual experiments were significant but roughly equally split between increases and decreases.</p><p>I had similar concerns about the neuronal data in Figure 4. In addition to plotting the rate modulation index, please directly compare the firing rates with and without optical stimulation. Was the firing rate significantly changed for individual neurons? The effects of attend-in and attend-away should be similarly documented across the population of neurons. Did optical stimulation significantly change this modulation for individual neurons? The concern here is that there may be no difference on average, but a more or less balanced combination of significant increases and significant decreases.</p><p>Beyond changes in firing rate, it is also possible that the optical stimulation disrupted the tuning properties of the neurons. Do you have data to confirm that the orientation tuning and receptive field properties of the neurons was not changed during optical stimulation?

The find that this is indeed the case, but only if the optogenetic stimulation is in the low frequency range (4-5Hz, sinusoidal modulation), not when it occurs at higher frequencies (tested were 20 Hz). This only occurred when the neurons stimulated represented the attended (instructed) location, not when the represented the non-instructed location. The authors conclude that the attention induced reduction of low frequency spike count correlations indeed convey behavioural benefits.</p><p>This is an interesting study, but I have a few questions:</p><p>I was unable to determine whether the phase of stimulation was fixed relative to stimulus presentation. Probably not as stimulus presentation varied within a trial. This means that orientation changes would occur at variable phases of optogenetic stimulation.

However, a number of issues remain and those undermine their confidence in the main conclusions of the paper. These must be addressed for the manuscript to be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The points listed below are based not only on the reviews attached below, but also on the discussion among the reviewers that followed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Lack of histology</p><p>The reviewers felt that the lack of histology seriously complicates the interpretation of the results but are willing to accept a possibility that the expression patterns of the viral vector in V4 are the same as those shown for V1 in the previous publication from the lab. However, you should add appropriate disclaimers about the assumptions about transfected neurons (based on the published V1 data), and discuss how your interpretation would be affected if these assumptions turn out to be incorrect.</p><p>2) Variability in orientation thresholds</p><p>The reviewers felt that the explanation attributing variability to the difference in thresholds for oblique and cardinal orientation, needs stronger documentation. To that end, rather than providing 8 example psychometric functions, the relationship between base orientation and performance should be documented by plotting thresholds for each of the sessions as a function of orientation.</p><p>3) Potential confound of visual and optogenetic stimulation delivered at similar low frequencies</p><p>Reviewers did not feel that the phase analysis included in the revision adequately addressed the problem. Reviewer 2 commented that while the overall effect may not be phase-specific, it may be specific &quot;to cases where the optogenetic frequency is similar to the stimulus onset/offset frequency&quot;. Please provide additional information, to address this.</p><p>Please address the absence of label for the x-axis in Figure 4—figure supplement 3B and different sign of effects on threshold and sensitivity. One of the reviewers suggests sorting the experiments into subsets based on how the psychometric curves change (for example, based on where the experiments fall in Figure 2—figure supplement 5).</p><p>4) Changes in thresholds and slopes</p><p>The summary plot (Figure 2—figure supplement 5) reveals not only increases in threshold (22/42 cases) but also decreases in threshold (~14 cases). Please address the apparently opposite effects produced by stimulation.</p><p>In addition, it appears that stimulation increased the slope more often than decrease it. Since the increase in slope is likely to be associated with an increase in sensitivity, the proposed role of decreased correlations in improving the separability of neuronal activity is puzzling. This effect appears inconsistent with the proposed interpretation of the changes in spike-count correlations with stimulation. The reviewers suggest that you link the measured changes in correlations with the observed changes in psychometric functions by using a decoding scheme similar to that used by Cohen and Maunsell, 2009. This approach would allow you to predict the changes in psychometric curves given the changes in spike-count correlations.</p><p>5) Orientation tuning</p><p>Please provide additional information concerning the Figure 4—figure supplement 4 scaling on the x-axis and pooling data across neurons.

(see comment from reviewer 1).</p><p>6) Please provide documentation of false alarm rates from catch trials with and without optogenetic stimulation (see comment from reviewer 1).</p><p>7) The phase locking of spikes to the phase of stimulation should also be shown during the stimulus, in addition in the absence of stimulation.</p><p>8) The effect of optogenetic phase on behavior should be aligned with the preferential population activity, which seems to peak/trough at 240° and 60° respectively.</p><p>9) Please clarify what statistical test was used to determine that the phase of optical stimulation did not affect behavior or orientation tuning</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In my comments below, for clarity I repeat the original comments in quotes, with my new comments inserted after each item.</p><p>Overall, the authors have made efforts to address each major comment, but have been prevented from fully settling several of the points due to technical limitations. Some of these are substantial points that affect my confidence in the main conclusions.</p><p>&quot;The most obvious missing piece is histology. Figure 1C shows a surface view of the cortex illustrating the expression of EYFP. This is not sufficient to answer the questions relevant for interpreting the behavioral and neuronal data. Can you confirm that neurons were transfected? Which types of neurons, and in which layers? How variable was the expression across layers? Can you rule out retrograde transfection from axon terminals? Without histology to verify what was stimulated, I find it difficult to interpret the results.&quot;</p><p>The authors do not have histology for the two monkeys used in the study but they show a figure from a previously published study using the same viral vector injected into cortical area V1.</p><p>Will the expression patterns be the same in V4, the area targeted in this study? I don't know, and I don't know of any published work using this vector in macaque V4. Apparently, there is tissue from one of the monkeys (that was sacrificed) from this study; even if the tissue is damaged due to penetrations it should be possible to identify transfected cells, and the approximate size and layer distribution. It is not clear what steps were taken along these lines, or if that tissue was unfortunately discarded.</p><p>&quot;Performance in the orientation change task seems extremely variable, to the point that it raises concerns about how to interpret changes in task performance. In some cases, the thresholds for detecting orientation changes seem to be in the expected range (a few degrees) – for example, Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 2A. But in other cases, the thresholds are unusually high, 10 degrees or more (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C). There are also unexpected elevations in% correct for signal values that should be below threshold – for example, 40% correct for the lowest orientation change value in Figure 2—figure supplement 2B. How could the monkey get 40% correct for an undetectable signal? In order to interpret the optogenetic manipulation, I would need to be reassured about the reliability of task performance in the absence of optogenetic manipulation.&quot;</p><p>The authors explain that this is probably due to differences in detection performance – in particular, thresholds were lower for baseline orientations near the cardinal (i.e., horizontal and vertical) orientations. They show 8 sample psychometric curves that are consistent with this explanation.</p><p>This seems plausible, but the author should show it holds true for the other 34 sessions as well. If you simply plot threshold for each session as a function of the baseline orientation, this would show whether the variance was indeed systematically related to the baseline orientation.</p><p>&quot;There is a very basic aspect of the experimental design that seems like a problem, but perhaps the authors have a very well-reasoned explanation for this approach. The hypothesis is that low-frequency (4-5 Hz) correlations play a central role in cortical processing, and this guides the choice of sinusoidal optogenetic stimulation. But the stimulus itself is flashed on for 200 ms and then left off for 200-400 ms, which means that there were visual transients (on or off) also occurring at a frequency of 3-5 Hz. If the goal is to test the importance of intrinsic low-frequency correlations, why use a stimulus that includes transients in this same frequency range? It seems that an alternative explanation for the perturbations in performance might be that the optogenetic stimulation masks the ability to detect the onsets and offsets of the visual stimulus. Can this be ruled out? If the stimulus were simply left on for an extended period of time (seconds), and then changed orientation, would the optogenetic manipulation still be effective and still selective for low frequencies?&quot;</p><p>The authors agree these are important potential confounds but for technical reasons, they are not able to do the control experiment in which the stimulus is simply left on, to test whether the optogenetic stimulus might be masking the visual onset and offsets that occur in the same frequency range.</p><p>The phase analysis is interesting, but does not address the same point exactly. I wouldn't necessarily expect the effect to be phase-specific, but I do suspect it might be specific to cases where the opto frequency is similar to the stimulus onset/offset frequency. This question remains open.</p><p>Some comments about Figure 4—figure supplement 3B: What is the x-axis and why is it unlabeled? There seem to be some interesting possible mixed effects at low delta orientations. If you pool across all sessions (with different sign of effects on threshold and sensitivity) perhaps some effects are getting averaged out. Have you tried sorting the experiments into subsets based on how the psychometric curves change (for example, based on where the experiments fall in Figure 2—figure supplement 5)?</p><p>&quot;The data were compressed for presentation in ways that made it difficult to understand what additional significant effects might be present in each experiment. Figure 2C is a good example of this. The histogram illustrates that, overall, both the threshold and slope increased in trials with low-frequency optical stimulation, by showing that the population-level ratio of stimulation relative to baseline is significantly greater than 1. First, please clarify the stats (here and elsewhere). This is reported as a t-test in the fourth paragraph of the Results and Discussion. Which type – paired sample? Is the distribution normal, or should a non-parametric test be used? Second, please report the data in a way that allows us to appreciate what happened on individual experiments.

If so, it would be misleading to base the conclusion on the average effect. This point is especially relevant for the attend away condition (Figure 2D), in which the average threshold is not different, but the spread in the histogram suggests that many individual experiments were significant but roughly equally split between increases and decreases.&quot;</p><p>The authors now provide a summary plot (Figure 2—figure supplement 5) that summarizes the changes in threshold and slope. This is helpful. It shows that in addition to the main effect reported in the paper – the increase in threshold seen in 22/42 cases – there is also sometimes a significant decrease in threshold (~14 cases). Any ideas about why the effect flips sign in these cases?</p><p>More curiously, and harder to understand, the stimulation also tends to increase the slopes more often than it significantly decreases the slopes. An increase in slope would imply that the sensitivity of the monkey during the stimulation had increased. Given the proposed role of decreased correlations in improving the separability of neuronal activity, shouldn't the main effect have been a decrease in slope?</p><p>&quot;I had similar concerns about the neuronal data in Figure 4. In addition to plotting the rate modulation index, please directly compare the firing rates with and without optical stimulation. Was the firing rate significantly changed for individual neurons? The effects of attend-in and attend-away should be similarly documented across the population of neurons. Did optical stimulation significantly change this modulation for individual neurons? The concern here is that there may be no difference on average, but a more or less balanced combination of significant increases and significant decreases.&quot;</p><p>The authors have added a Figure 4—figure supplement 1 that compares the spike rates for all neurons with and without optogenetic stimulation, and report no significant change in firing rate due to stimulation. I find this set of figures very convincing.</p><p>&quot;Beyond changes in firing rate, it is also possible that the optical stimulation disrupted the tuning properties of the neurons. Do you have data to confirm that the orientation tuning and receptive field properties of the neurons was not changed during optical stimulation? If the claim is specifically about the role of low-frequency correlations, it is important to rule out the possibility that behavioral effects were due simply to disrupting the representation of orientation information in V4.&quot;</p><p>The authors respond that they did not measure tuning curves. However, they do have data from the non-target orientation and some target orientations, which they report in Figure 4—figure supplement 4. I find it difficult to evaluate this plot because I don't understand the scaling on the x-axis or how data were pooled across neurons. It is also not clear that data from all neurons should be included in this analysis, unless their activity was strongly modulated across the range of orientations used (i.e., the data indicate direction tuning over the domain tested). And then the data might be aligned on the x-axis so that 1 value corresponded to the &quot;best&quot; direction.</p><p>The issue of possible changes in neuronal tuning is critical for interpreting the results. Perhaps the authors can do more to address this.</p><p>&quot;There was some ambiguity in the description of how the orientation change in the stimulus was managed. The paper describes a 95% probability at the cued location and 5% at the uncued location. But then there were also &quot;catch trials&quot; without any change. It's not clear how these add up. Were the 95% and 5% independent? What was the probability of a catch trial? Were these truly randomized, or were they presented in as a fixed fraction of the trials?&quot;</p><p>The authors now explain their definition of 'catch' trials.</p><p>Are the FA rates on from catch trials documented somewhere in the paper? I did not see it except for Figure 2—Figure supplement 2A, which curiously appears to show a false alarm rate on catch trials of about 50% Is this correct? How can the FA rate be that high when the hit rate drops well below that for small orientation changes? I would expect the FA rate to be the floor for the curve.</p><p>Aside from trying to understand the plots, the other reason for asking about FAs is to know whether the FAs also changed with optogenetic stimulation. This would be important for assessing possible changes in response criterion, which would also be important to nail down, since changes in criterion could also shift the psychometric curves</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have addressed some of my previous points, but I have a few issues remaining:</p><p>They describe the phase locking of spikes to the phase of stimulation when no stimulus was present. However, it would be important to see this also for the stimulus period.</p><p>The authors use 4 bins to calculate the effect of optogenetic phase on behaviour, but these are not aligned with the preferential population activity alignment, which seems to peak/trough at 240° and 60° respectively. This needs to be done.</p><p>It is unclear what statistical test was used to determine whether behaviour was unaffected by the phase of optical stimulation?</p><p>The same is true for the effect on orientation tuning.</p><p>In general, statistical reporting should be checked and adequately improved.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Optogenetically induced low-frequency correlations impair perception&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

As in Nassi et al., 2015, in the present experiment we used fluorescent goggles to visualize protein expression at the injection site (See Figure 1C, main manuscript). We were able to see a bright fluorescent spot in both monkeys, throughout the experiment, indicating continued expression of GFP-tagged opsin. Additional evidence that cells were not only transfected but that they expressed opsin at a level sufficient to drive neurons is that we found modulation of firing that was tightly time locked to laser stimulation (see e.g., phase locking with laser intensity at high and low frequency: Figure 4—figure supplement 2) and firing rates that varied with levels of optogenetic stimulation (irradiance response curves, Figure 2—figure supplement 4). Taken together, all these lines of evidence give us a high level of confidence that not only were neurons transfected but also they continued to do so through the months of the study in both animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1: “Which types of neurons, and in which layers?

We would be happy to include supplemental figures from the data collected in the Nassi et al., 2015 study, showing this in the present paper if the reviewer and editors feel that this would strengthen the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Variable performance on the orientation change task makes it difficult to interpret the effects of optogenetic stimulation. This problem should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The monkeys used in our experiments were highly trained in the orientation change detection task and participated in multiple experiments. As a result, they could achieve performance levels that were very high even for the smallest orientation changes. The smallest orientation change that we tested was 1-degree orientation. This is a substantially lower threshold than has been achieved in primate studies (See e.g., Figure 1 from Cohen and Maunsell, 2009). However, we know from the psychophysical literature (Campbell and Green, 1965; Cowey and Rolls, 1974) that humans can detect orientation changes that are much lower than 1-degree, and that human observers are most sensitive to orientation changes for gratings presented near the cardinal orientations. We looked back at our data and found indeed a pattern consistent with this. For sessions in which the baseline (non-target) orientation was horizontal or vertical, monkeys consistently performed better in detecting orientation changes of 1 degree, the smallest change we tested. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>, which shows% correct in detecting the target over eight sessions, including three (red stars) in which the non-target was presented at a cardinal orientation. This was a likely source of variation in animal performance in our study. Despite this source of variability, we find that low- but not high- frequency optogenetic stimulation systematically impaired performance for fine orientation discriminations at the stimulation site.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Examples of behavioral sessions without optogenetic stimulation.</title><p>The red asterisks mark behavioral sessions where the baseline orientation (orientation of the non-target stimuli) was either horizontal or vertical.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35123-resp-fig2-v3"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The presence of on- and off- transients in visual stimulation occurring at a frequency of 3-5Hz creates a potential problem in the study aimed at detecting correlations occurring at similarly low frequency. It is important to rule out that optogenetic stimulation may be affecting the detection of the onsets and offsets of visual stimuli. Reviewer 1 suggests a control condition that would eliminate such transients to see whether optogenetic manipulation is still selective for low frequencies.</p><p>A related question (reviewer 2) concerns the phase of optical stimulation relative to stimulus presentation whether the presence of the behavioral deficits depended on the phase of optical stimulation. Also, provide information about the phase of optical stimulation used to compute noise correlations</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these are important potential confounds that need to be addressed. Though as noted above, it was, unfortunately, not possible to do the very thoughtfully considered control experiments in these animals, as reviewer 1 had suggested (one animal had to be humanely euthanized due to health concerns and the V4 chamber of the second animal has been removed and replaced with a V1 chamber). We have, however, undertaken analyses that we believe address these concerns. We reasoned that if the change in performance were due to a phase alignment between the visual stimuli and the optical stimulation, we would expect to find variation in behavioral performance that varied with laser phase (a point raised by reviewer 2). These analyses are described below, after each reviewer’s individual comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2: “it will be important to know whether behavioural deficits occurred equally across different phases, or whether they were co-modulated”</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 3) in which we first show (panel A) that stimulus onset times were not phase locked to the laser, at either frequency. The distribution of target stimulus onset times is plotted as a function of laser phase for low-frequency (left panel) and high-frequency (right panel) optical simulation. This is due to the aperiodic nature of the stimulus flashes, with variable inter-stimulus-intervals between each non-target and between the final non-target and the target. So, targets were equally likely to occur at all phases of laser stimulation and there was therefore no tendency for targets to phase lock to the laser, at either frequency.</p><p>We next examined whether discrimination performance varied as a function of laser phase and target onset. See Panel B, which shows percent correct performance as a function of the phase of the laser at the time of target stimulus onset, grouped into 4 phase bins. We find no significant difference in performance as a function of laser phase either on low-frequency trials (Panel B) or high frequency trials (data now shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2: “The histograms show and the noise correlations also seem to be calculated over different optogenetic phases […] it will be important to determine whether there were changes in either when calculated for different optogenetic phases”.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer fully appreciates, induction of correlation by optical stimulation is the method by which we introduced correlations in the experiment. However, if we are interpreting the reviewer’s concern correctly, s/he is making a more subtle point: that there might be phase-dependent variation in the degree of endogenously generated correlation. This would not be surprising, given that increases in luminance contrast have been found to reduce pairwise “noise” correlations. So, one might imagine that, as with contrast elevation, noise correlations might similarly fall off with laser intensity. We have therefore undertaken an analysis to test this directly, in which we compute pairwise correlations as a function of laser phase. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>.</p><p>In this analysis, we examined the phase dependence of spike-count correlations for both low- and high-frequency correlations (200ms and 50ms counting windows, respectively) on low- and high-frequency optical stimulation trials. That is, for each pair of neurons, we computed the spike rate for each cycle of laser stimulation, divided into four phase bins. We then computed correlations across multiple cycles of laser stimulation. The results of this analysis appear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>. Though it is not statistically significant, there does appear to be a tendency for spike count correlations to be lower, on average, at the peak of laser intensity. However, we find no evidence that perceptual performance varied with phase and so we do not believe this change in correlation, even if it were significant, influenced the monkey’s performance. Nor can it account for the observed perceptual impairment that was caused by low frequency laser stimulation, which was phase independent (Figure 4—figure supplement 3B).</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Phase dependence of spike-count correlations for both low- (left panel, 200ms counting window) and high-frequency correlations (right pane, 50ms counting window) for the low-frequency optical stimulation condition.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35123-resp-fig3-v3"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Data presentation limited to averages and distributions does not allow the evaluation of significant effects in each experiment.

To give the reviewer and reader a sense for the data, we have added a supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 5) in which we show the changes in behavioral performance for each experimental session.

There were also changes in slope, which tended to increase with laser stimulation (red and blue points above zero). In total, for a large fraction of the sessions, both the changes in threshold and slope were significant (20/42). 11/42 sessions had significant threshold change only, while 5/42 sessions had significant slope change only.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please provide a direct comparison between firing rates with and without optical stimulation, showing effects on individual neurons.

In particular, if the differences in firing rate between target and non-target orientations were reduced by low frequency optical stimulation, this could explain our findings. While we did not record tuning curves, we do have data from the non-target orientation and from multiple target orientations, so we could examine the effect of laser stimulation over the range of orientations spanned by targets and non-targets.</p><p>The results of this analysis are shown in a new supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 4), where we plot the response rates to the non-target and target orientations for the optical stimulation (for both low- and high-frequency) and unstimulated baseline conditions. To control for variation in mean firing rate across neurons, we have normalized the firing rates by the maximum rate for each neuron. We do not see any significant differences in firing rates to the different orientations due to optical stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please explain cued and uncued locations vs. &quot;catch trials&quot; and their randomization during the experiment (reviewer 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that we were not clear in our use of these terms. We have now revised the Materials and methods section to make this clear. To summarize: The time of target onset was drawn from an exponential distribution with time constant of 3 seconds, with the constraint that the target could not appear sooner than 1 sec after the start of the trial. If the target time drawn from the exponential distribution was &gt;5 seconds, the trial was deemed a ‘catch’ trial and the target never appeared (13% of trials). On these catch trials, the monkey was rewarded for holding fixation to the 5 second mark. If the time drawn from the distribution fell between 1 second and 5 seconds, the target appeared at that time and the monkey was rewarded if it detected the target (“hit”) with an eye movement. Failure to detect the target was considered a “miss” and no reward was given. Trials were blocked according to which location was cued (left or right of fixation). When the target appeared, 95% of the time it appeared at the cued location. The remaining 5% of trials were deemed ‘foil’ trials.</p><p>The decision whether or not to stimulate (50/50), and the frequency of stimulation, were completely randomized from trial to trial.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] This is an ambitious set of experiments to attempt to pack into a short paper, especially given all of the potential pitfalls and controls that need to be considered.

In some cases, the thresholds for detecting orientation changes seem to be in the expected range (a few degrees) – for example, Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 2A. But in other cases, the thresholds are unusually high, 10 degrees or more (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C). There are also unexpected elevations in% correct for signal values that should be below threshold – for example, 40% correct for the lowest orientation change value in Figure 2—figure supplement 2B.

The hypothesis is that low-frequency (4-5 Hz) correlations play a central role in cortical processing, and this guides the choice of sinusoidal optogenetic stimulation. But the stimulus itself is flashed on for 200 ms and then left off for 200-400 ms, which means that there were visual transients (on or off) also occurring at a frequency of 3-5 Hz. If the goal is to test the importance of intrinsic low-frequency correlations, why use a stimulus that includes transients in this same frequency range? It seems that an alternative explanation for the perturbations in performance might be that the optogenetic stimulation masks the ability to detect the onsets and offsets of the visual stimulus. Can this be ruled out? If the stimulus were simply left on for an extended period of time (seconds), and then changed orientation, would the optogenetic manipulation still be effective and still selective for low frequencies?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our responses to Essential revisions #3 <underline>above</underline>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data were compressed for presentation in ways that made it difficult to understand what additional significant effects might be present in each experiment. Figure 2C is a good example of this. The histogram illustrates that, overall, both the threshold and slope increased in trials with low-frequency optical stimulation, by showing that the population-level ratio of stimulation relative to baseline is significantly greater than 1. First, please clarify the stats (here and elsewhere). This is reported as a t-test in the fourth paragraph of the Results and Discussion. Which type – paired sample? Is the distribution normal, or should a non-parametric test be used? Second, please report the data in a way that allows us to appreciate what happened on individual experiments. Given the scale on the x-axis, it looks like optical stimulation may have caused significant increases in threshold or slope in some experiments and significant decreases in others. If so, it would be misleading to base the conclusion on the average effect. This point is especially relevant for the attend away condition (Figure 2D), in which the average threshold is not different, but the spread in the histogram suggests that many individual experiments were significant but roughly equally split between increases and decreases.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Essential revisions #4 <underline>above</underline>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I had similar concerns about the neuronal data in Figure 4.

Please provide additional information, to address this.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for misunderstanding the reviewer’s initial concern, which we took to be centered on phase. It does seem plausible that neural and perceptual sensitivity might vary with the depolarization state of the neurons, and might therefore vary with laser phase. From the reviewer’s comments, he or she appears to agree that we do show that the target stimuli are not locked to any particular phase of the laser (Figure 4—figure supplement 3A) and that behavioral performance does not depend on when the target stimulus appeared in the laser cycle (Figure 4—figure supplement 3B). We have carefully considered the reviewer’s suggestion that the effect of low frequency stimulation might selectively impair stimuli presented at a similar frequency. Although we are unaware of any studies that have examined this, one might imagine that presenting the laser at a particular frequency might cause a sort of frequency-dependent adaptation that would cause neurons to be less sensitive to visual stimuli presented at a similar frequency. If so, the low (4-5Hz) frequency laser could reduce the responses evoked by 200 msec stimuli, impairing the monkey’s ability to discriminate the stimuli, while the high frequency laser might not cause this effect, explaining the observed impairment. To test this, we measured the firing rates evoked by the first four non-target stimulus flashes, on no-laser, low-frequency-laser and high-frequency laser trials, all on trials when the monkeys were attending in to the stimuli appearing at the location corresponding to the opsin site. Though the first stimulus in the sequence evoked a stronger response than the subsequent stimuli (reflecting a form of visual-stimulus-driven adaptation), we find no evidence that the addition of the laser at either frequency caused a change in mean firing rate. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref> (n=38 units; mean +/- s.e.m.). We hope we have correctly understood the nature of the reviewer’s concern.

Since the increase in slope is likely to be associated with an increase in sensitivity, the proposed role of decreased correlations in improving the separability of neuronal activity is puzzling. This effect appears inconsistent with the proposed interpretation of the changes in spike-count correlations with stimulation. The reviewers suggest that you link the measured changes in correlations with the observed changes in psychometric functions by using a decoding scheme similar to that used by Cohen and Maunsell, 2009. This approach would allow you to predict the changes in psychometric curves given the changes in spike-count correlations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this excellent suggestion. We have now done this analysis and find that for recording sessions where perceptual discrimination was impaired by low frequency laser stimulation, the laser reduced discriminability of target and nontarget at the neural level, as well. In this analysis, which appears in new Figure 5, we calculated a neural measure of discriminability (neural discriminability modulation index, NDMI) that was modeled on the analysis used by Cohen and Maunsell, 2009. We computed this measure in two ways: (1) using the full N-dimensional space that was defined by the responses across the N neurons recorded on each recording session and (2) a second pairwise analysis. Each of these analyses provided a measure of the degree of overlap between the neural responses evoked by the discriminanda. We repeated this analysis for no-laser trials and laser trials, and computed an index whose value corresponded to the change in discriminability caused by the addition of the laser. For each session, we then compared the change in perceptual threshold caused by the laser (we have termed this change the perceptual discrimination modulation index, PDMI, in the revised manuscript), with these measures of laser-induced changes in neural discriminability. This analysis revealed that on sessions for which the laser impaired perceptual discrimination at the behavioral level, there was a marked reduction in discriminability at the neural level, for both neural measures. The NDMI and PDMI are also significantly negatively correlated, using either NDMI measure. In other words, laser-induced reductions in discriminability at the neural level corresponded to increased perceptual thresholds.</p><p>We also repeated the analysis for laser induced changes in slope. For the purpose of this experiment, the psychometric function threshold is the measure of interest. It is a measure of the change in orientation needed to reliably discriminate target from nontarget. Slope does not measure this, and though we do see laser dependent changes in slope, they were not correlated with the NDMI. A change in slope means that the shift from detecting to not-detecting occurs over a narrower range of orientation changes, which is not really the point of the paper. We also note that the slope is very sensitive to the form of the psychometric function that is fit to the data. Instead of fitting a logistic function to the data as we have, if we fit a Weibull function to the data, we see a</p><p>similarly significant increase in threshold, but no significant change in slope.</p><p>Thus, we have focused on the threshold change in the manuscript and report the slope change in a supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 5A).</p><p>The NDMI analysis is detailed in the sixth paragraph of the Results and Discussion and in the subsection “Neural Discrimination Modulation Index (NDMI)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Orientation tuning</p><p>Please provide additional information concerning the Figure 4—figure supplement 4 scaling on the x-axis and pooling data across neurons.

We have corrected this (see updated Figure 4—figure supplement 4). The spike rates were normalized to peak response across stimulation conditions (optical stimulation and baseline no-stimulation conditions). The population tuning curves were plotted after aligning the peak response of each neuron to zero and binning the data into orientation bins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please provide documentation of false alarm rates from catch trials with and without optogenetic stimulation (see comment from reviewer 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We now report false alarm rates for both optical stimulation conditions and compare them to the false alarm rates to the baseline condition (Figure 2—figure supplement 2E). We have added text to document this: “Nor did we find significant changes in false-alarm rates with either low- or high-frequency stimulation (𝑝 &gt; 0.1, <italic>t</italic>-test; Figure 2—figure supplement 2E). This was true for false alarms made during catch trials as well as on non-catch trials. Thus, we find no evidence that laser stimulation caused our subjects to mis-perceive a non-target as a target.”</p><p>As mentioned, false alarm rates on catch trials are similar to those on non-catch trials: ~6% of trials. The ~50% performance rate in catch trials reported in the previous version of the figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, ‘*’ symbol) arises mostly due to the monkey breaking fixation toward the end of the long catch trials. We realize that this way of reporting performance in catch trials could be a potential source of confusion.

It is also not clear that data from all neurons should be included in this analysis, unless their activity was strongly modulated across the range of orientations used (i.e., the data indicate direction tuning over the domain tested).
