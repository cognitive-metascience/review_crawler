storage and degradation of free mRNAs in cytoplasmic assemblies. In this study, we show in Drosophila S2 cells that amino-acid starvation also leads to the inhibition of another major anabolic pathway, the protein transport through the secretory pathway, and to the formation of a novel reversible non-membrane bound stress assembly, the Sec body that incorporates components of the ER exit sites. Sec body formation does not depend on membrane traffic in the early secretory pathway, yet requires both Sec23 and Sec24AB. Sec bodies have liquid droplet-like properties, and they act as a protective reservoir for ERES components to rebuild a functional secretory pathway after re-addition of amino-acids acting as a part of a survival mechanism. Taken together, we propose that the formation of these structures is a novel stress response mechanism to provide cell viability during and after nutrient stress.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04132.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04132.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04132.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are needed by living cells to perform vital tasks and are made from building blocks called amino-acids. However, if a cell is starved of amino-acids, protein assembly comes to a halt, and if cells are deprived of amino acids for a long time, the cell may die.</p><p>To survive short periods of amino-acid starvation, the cell has developed many protective mechanisms. For example, it can start to break down existing proteins, allowing the cell to scavenge and reuse the amino-acids to make other proteins that are more important for short-term survival. The cell may also temporarily halt certain processes: for example, newly constructed proteins may no longer be transported from the cell structure where they are made—called the endoplasmic reticulum—to their final destinations in the cell. However, the protein transport apparatus is also made of proteins and needs to be protected from being broken down so that once starvation ends, the cell can more quickly return to normal working order.</p><p>Zacharogianni et al. identify a strategy cells use to store and protect part of their protein transport apparatus during times of stress. Starving fruit fly cells of amino-acids causes the cells to form protective stress assemblies incorporating the proteins associated with the ‘exit sites’ that release proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum. These assemblies are called Sec bodies, and when amino-acid starvation ends, these bodies release the exit site components unharmed. This allows the cell to quickly resume protein transport and so speeds the cell's recovery. If the Sec bodies do not form, the cells are more likely to die during amino-acid starvation.</p><p>The Sec bodies are distinct from previously identified stress assemblies that form in the cell during stress, but they share features with them, such as being liquid droplets. Some of these assemblies have been linked to degenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Further research will be necessary to determine if there are any similar harmful side effects associated with the formation of Sec bodies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04132.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04132.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>protein transport through the secretory pathway</kwd><kwd>amino-acid starvation</kwd><kwd>ER exit site</kwd><kwd>COPII</kwd><kwd>liquid droplet</kwd><kwd>stress granule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>822-020-016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilera Gomez</surname><given-names>Angelica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001722</institution-id><institution>Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rabouille</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Amino-acid starvation leads to the formation of a reversible stress assembly, the Sec body, which is a pro-survival reservoir for components of the ER exit sites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell response to nutritional restriction includes stimulation of degradation pathways, such as autophagy, as well as attenuating anabolic pathways, such as protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castilho et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Another key anabolic pathway is protein transport through the secretory pathway. In mammals, one third of the proteome encounters this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stevens and Arkin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almen et al., 2009</xref>), such as the proteins delivered to the extracellular medium, the plasma membrane, or other cellular membrane compartments with the exception of mitochondria and the nucleus. After their synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum, proteins exit the ER at specialized ER exit sites (ERES) defined by a cup-shaped ER overlaying COPII-coated vesicles in which newly synthesized proteins are packaged. They then reach the Golgi apparatus where they are further modified, sorted, and dispatched to their correct final localization. The COPII coat assembly requires 6 proteins, including the transmembrane protein Sec12 that acts as a GEF for the small GTPase Sar1. GTP-bound Sar1 recruits Sec23/Sec24, the inner COPII coat that in turn recruits Sec13/31, the outer coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">d'Enfert et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oka et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rothman and Wieland, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schekman and Orci, 1996</xref>). In addition, the large hydrophilic protein Sec16 has been found to play a major role in the COPII assembly and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ivan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hughes et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Connerly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bharucha et al., 2013</xref>) and Sec16 mutation or loss of function leads to a severe impairment in trafficking through the secretory pathway.</p><p>Stress strongly affects the functional organization of the secretory pathway. For instance, energy deprivation and osmotic shock also block secretion at the level of the ER exit and the cis Golgi, a response mostly triggered by impaired dynamics of the COPI coat, which mediates retrograde transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jamieson and Palade, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cluett et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee and Linstedt, 1999</xref>). Interestingly, GBF1, the GEF of Arf, the small GTPase required for COPI assembly, is phosphorylated and consequently inactivated by AMPK under conditions of nutrient starvation and energy depletion, leading to a block in secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyamoto et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, biosynthesis of PI4P in yeast that was shown to play a key role in coordinating trafficking from the Golgi with cell growth seems to also be sensitive to nutrient conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Piao et al., 2012</xref>). Last, ER stress that elicits the so-called ‘unfolded protein response’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shamu et al., 1994</xref>) directly impedes on the functional organization of ERES in Drosophila S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kondylis et al., 2011</xref>) and reduces COPII subunits assembly in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amodio et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, we have recently reported that serum starvation of Drosophila S2 cells also results in a distinct change in the ERES organization, namely Sec16 cytoplasmic dispersion away from ERES, in a conserved ERK7-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zacharogianni et al., 2011</xref>) that leads to protein secretion inhibition.</p><p>In this study, we focus on amino-acid starvation that leads to the formation of a novel, non-membrane bound cytoplasmic stress assembly that contains ERES components and that we call ‘Sec bodies’ [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zacharogianni et al., 2011</xref>)]. Sec bodies do not represent terminal aggregates. They are reversible, act as a reservoir for ERES components to reconstruct a functional secretory pathway upon re-feeding and are critical for cell survival during stress and upon stress relief. Furthermore, they display properties similar to those of Stress Granules, which place them in the rapidly growing class of cytoplasmic mesoscale assemblies and more specifically, the category of liquid droplets.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04132.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Amino-acid starvation induces the formation of a novel stress assembly in Drosophila S2 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence (IF) visualization of Delta-myc (using an anti-Delta antibody) in S2 cells in Schneider's (normal growth conditions) or incubated with Krebs Ringer Bicarbonate buffer (KRB) for 4 hr (amino-acid starvation).

In cells grown in Schneider's, Delta reaches the plasma membrane, whereas in KRB, it is retained intracellularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Amino-acid starvation also results in the formation of novel Sec16-positive spherical structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition to Sec16, these structures also contain COPII subunits Sec23, the two Sec24 orthologs Sec24AB (CG1472, Hau) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Norum et al., 2010</xref>) and Sec24CD (CG10882, Sten) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forster et al., 2010</xref>), and Sec31, and we therefore name them ‘Sec bodies’. Conversely, Sec bodies do not contain Sar1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), COPI components and clathrin (not shown). They also do not contain dGRASP (that amino-acid starvation drives to complete dispersion in the cytoplasm), the TGN GRIP-domain protein dGCC185, and the Golgi integral membrane protein, Fringe-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), although these two latter proteins are often found in close proximity to Sec bodies. The morphology of the ER, on the other hand, does not seem affected by amino-acid starvation (not shown).</p><p>Quantitation of this starvation phenotype reveals that although Sec bodies are present in 20% of cells after 1 hr of amino-acid starvation, it takes between 4 hr and 6 hr to get 90% of the cells displaying the typical Sec body pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), that is 7 ± 3 Sec bodies/cell, including 1 to 5 with a diameter comprised between 0.6 and 0.8 μm. Interestingly, 4–6 hr corresponds to the end of the autophagy peak, a degradative pathway stimulated by starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klionsky et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A′</xref>) as assessed by the appearance of Atg5 punctae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,A′</xref>). In this regard, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy (by wortmanin or bafilomycin) results in a premature formation of Sec bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,B′</xref>), consistent with the notion that Sec bodies form in response to a reduced level of intracellular amino-acid concentration.</p><p>Given the Sec body content in COPII subunits, we used immuno-electron microscopy (IEM) to test whether they are not simply a collection of COPII vesicles. Sec bodies are electron dense structures and non-membrane bound, although small membrane profiles can occasionally be observed in their core and often ER is in close proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, arrows).

Although we do observe some degrees of remodeling of COPII components upon mammalian cell starvation, it remains unclear whether the resulting structures are Sec bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, when human Sec16A is transfected in S2 cells, it is efficiently recruited to Sec bodies along with the endogenous components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). This suggests that in mammalian cells, Sec body formation is perhaps less pronounced due to different signaling events and not to the properties of the ERES components themselves (at least Sec16).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sec bodies are a novel stress assembly</title><p>The IEM analysis shows that Sec bodies are not endosomes or lipid droplets, as their ultrastructure is very different from these organelles [see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Teixeira et al., 2003</xref>), for lipid droplet ultrastructure in Drosophila].

We therefore tested whether Sec bodies are related to these structures. We visualized Stress Granules using endogenous FMR1 (Fragile X mental retardation protein 1), an RNA binding protein, and elF4E, a translation initiation factor, and P-bodies with Tral (Trailer Hitch), a like-SM protein. In normal growth conditions, FMR1, elF4E, and Tral are largely diffuse in the cytoplasm and Tral is also found in small punctae representing steady-state P-bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eulalio et al., 2007</xref>).

Instead, miniSec16 remains associated to the cup-shaped ER of the ERES and seems to cradle the forming Sec bodies (marked by endogenous Sec16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B′</xref>). This indicates that Sec bodies form where ERES were present, in line with their observed proximity to ER membrane (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>The time-lapse also suggested that the Sec body enlargement is mediated by recruitment of ERES components that have been dispersed in the cytoplasm. To test this further, we used a Sec16 deletion mutant (ΔNC2-3) that does not localize to ERES and is mostly cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) because it lacks the region that mediates its recruitment to ERES (NC2-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ivan et al., 2008</xref>). We found that it is efficiently recruited to Sec bodies, showing that Sec16 can be recruited from the cytoplasm and contributes to Sec body enlargement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B″</xref>). Furthermore, this result indicates that the localization to ERES prior to starvation is not necessary for incorporation to Sec bodies. Importantly, the recruitment of this cytosolic mutant is not due to its interaction with endogenous Sec16 as the NC2-3 also contains the Sec16 oligomerization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ivan et al., 2008</xref>). This suggests that a distinct Sec16 domain responds to amino-acid starvation.</p><p>Taken together, these results show that Sec bodies form (at least initially) where ERES were located and increase in size by recruiting ERES components dispersed in the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Sec body assembly does not require active transport through the early secretory pathway but depends on specific ERES components</title><p>We then ask whether membrane traffic through the early secretory pathway is required for Sec body formation.

However, Sec body formation was found to be as efficient as in control (mock depleted) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Second, we pharmacologically inhibited protein trafficking with Brefeldin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and found that this treatment before and during starvation does not affect Sec body formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Depleting Sec16 did not yield satisfactory conclusions as we have shown that Sec16 is critical for the organization of ERES in Drosophila S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ivan et al., 2008</xref>) and Sec16 depletion led to the aggregation of most of the COPII components even in cells grown in full medium (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C″</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ivan et al., 2008</xref>).

However, not all ERES residing and LCS rich proteins are necessary for Sec body formation, as Sec24CD that contains the same amount of LCS, is not.</p><p>We then tested whether LCSs were necessary for protein recruitment to Sec bodies and/or sufficient for their formation. We focused on Sec24AB as the LCSs are clustered to the first 415 amino-acids at the N-terminus (Sec24AB LCS) and compared their Sec body recruitment to this of its nonLCS region (aa 416–1184) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). LCS-sfGFP is largely recruited to ERES under normal growth conditions although not as efficiently as full-length Sec24AB. Under starvation conditions, it localizes to Sec bodies as full-length Sec24AB and seems to lead to their enlargement. This demonstrates that the LCS rich region of Sec24AB is sufficient to mediate recruitment to Sec bodies. Conversely, the nonLCS region is mostly cytoplasmic and remains largely so upon starvation, although a small pool is recruited to the Sec bodies. This shows that the LCS rich N-terminus region of Sec24AB plays a key role in recruitment of Sec24 to Sec bodies.</p><p>We then tested whether the Sec24AB LCS was sufficient to drive Sec body formation. To do so, cells were depleted of endogenous Sec24AB (resulting in the formation of Sec16 positive smaller structures) followed by the expression of Sec24AB LCS. If this is sufficient, we expect that Sec bodies would form. However, although Sec24AB LCS is recruited to the smaller structures, Sec bodies did not significantly form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

When a fraction of such an assembly (GFP marked) is photobleached, the recovery is quick as the molecules within mix instantaneously. However, when entirely photobleached, the recovery is slower as the exchange with the surrounding cytoplasm is not as efficient. We used Sec16-sfGFP and GFP-Sec23 that are efficiently incorporated to Sec bodies. When Sec bodies are partially bleached, the recovery is very fast for both GFP-Sec23 and Sec16-sfGFP, and the maximum intensity is approximately 50% of the original one. After complete photobleaching, however, Sec bodies recover more slowly and only to 10% of the initial fluorescence intensity, showing an inefficient exchange with the surrounding cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,A′</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>).

This suggests that Sec bodies act as a reservoir for ERES components allowing their re-mobilization upon stress relief to rebuild a functional secretory pathway. Of note, cycloheximide addition during starvation also does not affect Sec body formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D′</xref>).</p><p>To test further whether Sec bodies act as a mechanism for ERES components during starvation preventing their degradation, we first monitored the level of ERES components during starvation. Remarkably, amino-acid starvation leads to an increased level of Sec16, Sec23, and Sec31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A′</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2). We can rule out that this is due to an increase in protein translation during starvation as it is efficiently inhibited after 20 min (not shown). It is therefore likely that Sec body formation leads to a stabilization of the ERES components and therefore protect them against degradation.</p><p>We then asked whether this protection is inhibited when Sec bodies do not form. Upon Sec16, Sec23 and Sec 24AB depletion, we observed two things: the first is that under normal growth conditions, the level of Sec31 is higher than in mock-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, compare lanes 3, 5 and 7 to lane 1). The second is that in depleted cells, this level is not maintained upon starvation. Sec31 level is decreased instead of being stabilized as in mock-depleted cells. Sec23 behaves similarly to Sec31. In Sec24AB-depleted cells, however, its level is reduced even in cells incubated in full medium, suggesting that Sec23 turnover depends on the presence of Sec24AB. Altogether, this experiment suggests that starvation leads to ERES component stabilization that is inhibited when Sec bodies do not form. This supports the notion that Sec bodies act as a reservoir for ERES components to rebuild a functional secretory pathway upon stress relief.</p><p>In this context, we investigated the relevance of Sec body formation in cell survival upon starvation and fitness upon stress relief. To do so, we exploited the fact that only one of the two Sec24 proteins is required for Sec body formation. Indeed, Sec bodies do not form in starved Sec24AB-depleted cells, whereas they do in Sec24CD-depleted cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As mentioned above, depletion of either of the Sec24 isoforms is effective but does not affect proliferation very much when cells are grown in normal medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, dashed lines and see ‘Materials and methods’). However, upon amino-acid starvation, the number of Sec24AB-depleted cells decreases twice as much as the mock- (ds GFP) and Sec24CD-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, compare solid green to light blue, violet lines). As expected, the double depleted Sec24AB and CD cells also decline more quickly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, solid orange line). When reverted to full medium, control and Sec24CD-depleted cells started to proliferate again, whereas the number of Sec24AB-depleted cells continues to diminish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).</p><p>As the absence of Sec bodies leads to a decreased stabilization of COPII components, one reason behind the cell lethality upon re-feeding could be the inefficient protein transport through the secretory pathway. To test this, we monitored the transport of Delta to the plasma membrane of starved mock-, and Sec24AB-depleted cells upon re-feeding for 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Mock-depleted cells efficiently transport Delta whether starved or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Conversely, the efficiency of transport of Sec24AB-depleted cells after starvation is largely compromised, suggesting that formation of Sec bodies is critical for proper transport resumption. However, this result could simply be due to the depleted Sec24AB whose absence compromises transport even in cells kept in Schneider’s.</p><p>Nevertheless, Delta transport in Sec24AB-depleted cells kept in Schneider's was found almost as efficient as mock-depleted cells, suggesting that Sec24CD compensates Sec24AB depletion. This indicates that the inhibition of Sec body formation, not the absence of Sec24AB, is detrimental to anterograde transport resumption.</p><p>Taken together, these results show that Sec body formation is instrumental to efficient resumption of protein transport through the secretory pathway that contributes to cell survival and growth after re-feeding.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Sec bodies: a novel stress assembly linked to secretion inhibition</title><p>Here, we describe a novel, reversible, and non-membrane bound structure, the Sec body that forms in response to nutrient stress. Sec bodies comprise proteins that in normal growth conditions function as ERES components, including subunits of the COPII coat, namely Sec23, Sec24AB, Sec24CD, and Sec31 as well as Sec16, the upstream ERES organizer. A noticeable exception is the small GTPase Sar1. One reason for this could be that Sar1 is devoid of LCS and this is currently under further investigation.</p><p>Interestingly, the components of the other coats were seemingly not incorporated into Sec bodies but also did not form other structures, suggesting that remodeling of the ERES is sufficient to ensure inhibition of protein transport through the secretory pathway. In this regard, Sec body formation constitutes also a novel mechanism for attenuation/inhibition of protein transport through the secretory pathway. Cells can disperse ERES and Golgi components into the cytoplasm, as reported during mitosis the Golgi is fragmented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lucocq and Warren, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farhan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zacharogianni et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The dramatic remodeling of the ERES that we describe here appears to be specific for amino-acid starvation, possibly underlining the acute and severe nature of this particular stress. It is also different from the response to serum starvation that requires ERK7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zacharogianni et al., 2011</xref>). ERK7 appears to be involved to a small extent in the amino-acid starvation response, possibly facilitating the initial dispersion of a fraction of the ERES into the cytoplasm, as when depleted, it prevents Sec body formation upon amino-acid starvation by about 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zacharogianni et al., 2011</xref>). However, other signaling pathways, yet unidentified, are clearly at stake.</p><p>Interestingly, one of Sec body components is Sec16, a protein with a localization that is also modulated upon serum starvation. Furthermore, Sec16 is also phosphorylated in response to EGF signaling in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farhan et al., 2010</xref>). It could therefore be emerging as one of platform integrating nutrient and growth factors availability.</p><p>Sec bodies are novel stress structures and we have shown that they are not autophagosomes (or substrates of autophagy), not lipid droplets and not CUPS as they are devoid of dGRASP that is found quantitatively re-distributed in the cytoplasm upon amino-acid starvation, suggesting a modification involving its lipid anchor or modification of its N-terminus. Sec bodies are also different from large reversible structures containing COPII components that have been described in yeast in a number of specific COPII mutants <italic>Sec12-4</italic> and <italic>Sec16-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shindiapina and Barlowe, 2010</xref>). These structures are thought to result from an imbalance between cargo incorporation in COPII-coated vesicles and the coat formation, and lowering the cargo load by inhibiting protein translation prevented their appearance. Sec body formation is, however, insensitive to translation inhibition by cycloheximide and is therefore different from these yeast structures. Last, we also show that Sec bodies are distinct from Stress Granules and P-bodies that also form upon amino-acid starvation. Therefore, Sec bodies are novel structures.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Stress induces the formation of stress assemblies</title><p>Formation of mesoscale protein assemblies like Stress Granules, P-bodies or, more recently, Sec bodies is emerging as a general response to stress and especially nutrient stress, and is gaining increasing attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hyman and Brangwynne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilson and Gitai, 2013</xref>). For instance, in yeast under nutrient limiting conditions, metabolic enzymes and stress response proteins form reversible foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</xref>), such as purinosomes containing enzymes of the purine biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Connell et al., 2012</xref>), proteasome storage granules upon glucose restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laporte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peters et al., 2013</xref>), or, as recently described, glutamine synthetase filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petrovska et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In challenging conditions, areas of localized biochemistry in the cytoplasm can be advantageous, as reagents and possibly energy can be focused to these specific areas. The reorganization of the cytoplasm through non-membrane bound protein assemblies could confer this rapid and spatio-temporally defined compartmentalization. In this regard, we have found that Sec bodies confer a fitness advantage to the cells under starvation (see below). However, some stress assemblies (especially cytoplasmic RNP granules) can form dysfunctional RNA–protein assemblies that become irreversible and toxic for the cell. For instance, Stress Granule components have a strong relationship with degenerative diseases, such as ALS and laminopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramaswami et al., 2013</xref>). Whether Sec body components could also form such deleterious aggregates remains to be established.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Some stress assemblies have liquid droplet properties</title><p>Some of these mesoscale assemblies have liquid-like properties. These so-called liquid droplets are generally spherical and dynamic and form via phase separation (liquid demixing) of their components from the cytoplasm like a drop of oil in water. Their components display different rates of diffusion within the assembly and in the surrounding cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hyman and Brangwynne, 2011</xref>). They form via transient and weak protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions mediated by low amino-acid diversity stretches (low complexity sequences, LCS), prone to engage in such interactions. Stress granules and P-bodies have been shown to be liquid droplets, and we show here that Sec bodies exhibit clear liquid droplet features as underlined by their spherical morphology, their reversibility, FRAP properties, and LCS content.</p><p>In this regard, the presence of LCSs both in Sec16 and Sec24 is intriguing considering their role in cells under normal growth conditions where they act in sequence with many others to form the COPII coat. How the LCSs are shielded to make proteins competent for their function in COPII coat formation in growing cells remains to be investigated but the interaction with both cargo and Sec23 might be instrumental to their functioning as coat subunits. We show here that the LCS rich domain of Sec24AB is sufficient and necessary for Sec body incorporation upon amino-acid starvation, but not sufficient to induce Sec body formation. This has similarity to Tia1, a key protein necessary for Stress Granule formation that has an LCS-prion like domain that is necessary to form stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilks et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>As mentioned above, the structures that fall in the liquid droplet category have been described to form through weak protein–RNA interactions. Although Sec bodies do not appear to contain RNAs, we propose that they are nonetheless liquid droplets. The absence of RNA might account for the very low and slow recovery we observed after complete photobleaching of whole Sec bodies when compared to Stress Granules that recovers to a higher degree. Shuttling of mRNA in and out of Stress Granules could drive more exchange between the structure and the surrounding cytoplasm, and this probably does not occur in Sec bodies. However, instead of protein–RNA interactions, Sec body components could establish weak protein–protein interactions helped by molecular modifications that could trigger conformational changes and perhaps exposure of their LCS.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Sec bodies and cell survival</title><p>Importantly, one of the key features of a liquid droplet is to be efficiently reversible, and we show that Sec bodies are rapidly and completely reversible upon stress relief. This shows that they act as a reservoir of the ERES components that can be quickly remobilized to re-build a functional organelle, so that protein transport through the secretory pathway can resume once stress is relieved in order to support cell proliferation. Furthermore, Sec bodies have a role in protecting ERES components from degradation during starvation. That strengthens the fact that Sec bodies are neither autophagosomes nor a substrate of autophagy, unlike Stress Granules, which are reported to be cleared by autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchan et al., 2013</xref>). Last, we show that Sec body formation is critical for the cell viability during amino-acid starvation. It suggests a pro-survival mechanism, perhaps through the recruitment and inactivation of pro-apoptotic factors. This remains to be investigated.</p><p>Taken together, amino-acid starvation inhibits both protein translation and protein transport through the secretory pathway and, similarly for both processes, results in the concomitant formation of cytoplasmic stress assemblies where key components necessary for cell survival are stored: untranslated mRNAs in Stress Granules and ERES components in Sec bodies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, amino-acid starvation, RNAi, transfection, and drug treatments</title><p>Drosophila S2 cells were cultured in Schneider's medium supplemented with 10% insect tested fetal bovine serum (referred to as Schneider's) at 26°C as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kondylis and Rabouille, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kondylis et al., 2007</xref>).

Cells were analyzed after incubation with dsRNAs for 5 days (or 4 days in the case of Sar1 depletion). Transient transfections were performed using the Effectene transfection reagent (301425; Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. When cells were transfected with pMT constructs, expression was induced 48 hr after transfection with 1 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> for 1.5 hr. The newly synthesized proteins were allowed to localize for 1 hr after CuSO<sub>4</sub> washout. When cells were transfected with the pUAS constructs, transfection was done 48 hr prior to the experiment.</p><p>Drugs were used at the following concentrations: cycloheximide (10 μM), wortmanin (1 μM), bafilomycin (100 nM), rapamycin (2 µM), and brefeldin A (50 µM). When a drug treatment was followed by starvation, the cells were pretreated for 30 min in Schneider's following starvation in the presence of the drug.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Antibodies</title><p>The following antibodies have been used in these experiments: rabbit polyclonal anti-Sec16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ivan et al., 2008</xref>), 1:800 IF, 1:2000 WB; rabbit polyclonal anti-Sec23 (Pierce PA1-069A), 1:200 IF, 1:1000 WB; rabbit polyclonal anti-Sec31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentley et al., 2010</xref>) 1:200 IF; mouse monoclonal anti-V5 (life technologies R960), 1:500 IF; mouse monoclonal anti-FMR1 (DSHB supernanant clone 5A11), 1:10 IF; rabbit polyclonal anti-Tral, 1:200 IF; rabbit anti-dGRASP, 1:500 IF (with methanol fixation); mouse monoclonal anti-α-spectrin (DSHB supernatant clone 3A9), 1:20 IF; rat polyclonal anti-eIF4E, 1:200 IF (with methanol fixation); mouse monoclonal anti-Delta, (DHSB clone C594.9B), 1:500 IF.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>DNA constructs and RNAi</title><p>The pRmeGFP-Sec23, pRmSar1-eGFP, pMTmini-Sec16 (NC2.3-CCD)-V5, pMTΔNC2.3-V5 constructs were described in the reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ivan et al.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Reviewer 1, Elizabeth Miller, has agreed to reveal her identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision. The reviewer comments have been appended below. As you will see, the reviewers felt that the discovery of a starvation induced Drosophila Sec body that sequesters core COPII components represents a significant advance that will be of interest to a broad cell biological audience. While the characterization of the Sec body is of high quality, the reviewers felt that the functional significance of this structure needs to be addressed more fully before the manuscript is suitable for publication. The reviewers have two suggestions for experiments that would address this concern. Both reviewers suggest an analysis of mutations in the Sec body component Sec24AB that selectively perturbs Sec body formation, such as in the disordered region of postulated to contribute to lipid droplet Sec body properties. Such selective mutations will test the model presented in the manuscript and could be used to more accurately assess Sec body function. In addition and/or alternatively, reviewer 2 suggests that more precise assays should be used to test your model that Sec bodies are required to re-build the secretory pathway during recovery from starvation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Rabouille and colleagues describes an exciting new point of regulation of the COPII coat, the formation of “Sec bodies” upon amino acid starvation. To my mind, this is a significant discovery that adds insight into the relatively poorly understood mechanisms of regulation of ER export. The authors thoroughly investigate which components localize to large inclusions that accrue upon prolonged nutrient stress, identifying the core COPII coat components, Sec23/Sec24, Sec31 and Sec16 as both constituents of the structures and drivers of their formation. The timing of Sec body accumulation is monitored alongside autophagy events, which highlights an interesting property: Sec bodies appear after autophagy has declined, which is significant since COPII vesicles are now known to contribute directly to autophagosome formation. Hence, the timing of stress-related events would seem to involve a cascade of trafficking redirection followed by trafficking shutdown. This appealing model is supported by bioinformatic analysis of the COPII coat that identifies disordered regions that may contribute to “liquid droplet” properties of the COPII coat proteins themselves. The one experiment that I would suggest is to directly assess how one of these disordered regions contributes to inclusion formation: since Sec24AB is required for Sec body formation, deleting the disordered N-terminus should have a similar effect. This would be an elegant experiment since yeast experiments with N-terminally truncated Sec24 do not impact secretion in general (our unpublished data), supporting a regulatory role for this domain. In other respects, the study is solid, well-controlled and an exciting new discovery.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study describes a novel stress-induced structure called the Sec body and provides an initial characterization in Drosophila S2 cells. This structure forms in response to nutrient starvation and appears to be composed primarily of COPII components involved in ER exit. The structure is reversible, and is proposed to be an important storage depot that can be used to re-build the early secretory pathway (specifically ER exit sites) during recovery from starvation. The strengths of the study are its careful characterization of this structure by high quality microscopy studies and the exclusion of a wide range of alternative possible structures. The interest in this study is heightened by the appreciation in recent years of non-membrane-bound cellular structures that may be regulated sites of specialized biochemistry or storage. Description of the Sec body should add to this growing trend, and stimulate future work on this topic. The main drawbacks of the study that lessen its overall impact are the limitation of analysis to only Drosophila S2 cells (plus a little analysis in Drosophila tissue/larvae), and the unresolved issue of functional relevance.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) As noted above, the existence of the Sec body outside of Drosophila is not established as yet, and this would seem to help broaden the impact and level of interest in this study. It is worth discussing the evolutionary conservation of this phenomenon (or if available, results from mammalian cells).</p><p>2) The importance of the Sec body is hinted at in the last experiment, but by itself, was not especially compelling. It would substantially strengthen the paper if biological relevance were established with either a more specific perturbation and/or a more specific assay for ER exit (as opposed to cell death). The concern is that the cell death outcome may not be causally related to the absence of the Sec body; rather, the Sec24AB knockdown could independently affect both Sec body formation and other cellular processes, the latter of which ultimately cause reduced viability. Below are some suggestions that might help improve this important last part of the paper. I'm not suggesting that all three are needed, but any one would strengthen the case for physiologic relevance/function of the Sec body.</p><p>a. The ideal experiment would involve a manipulation that disrupts Sec body formation without affecting other cellular processes. I'm sure the authors have considered this extensively, but is there a mutant of Sec24AB, perhaps in the LCS, that would preclude Sec body formation without affecting its function at ERES? Such a mutant that dissociates these two functions would be well investigating as it would allow Sec body function to be studied with higher precision.</p><p>b. An alternative strategy to more specifically probe Sec body function would be to use a more precise assay. If the Sec body is needed to re-establish the early secretory pathway, then secretion should be diminished upon recovery in Sec24AB knockdown cells relative to the situation before starvation, whereas secretion rates should be the same before versus after in Sec24CD knockdown cells (or control cells, where Sec body formation is normal).</p><p>c. One could see whether, in the Sec24AB knockdown cells, starvation induces degradation of other Sec body components. In other words, is one purpose of the Sec body to protect these key factors from degradation, as speculated?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04132.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>The manuscript by Rabouille and colleagues describes an exciting new point of regulation of the COPII coat, the formation of “Sec bodies” upon amino acid starvation.

In other respects, the study is solid, well-controlled and an exciting new discovery</italic>.</p><p>We first thank Dr Liz Miller for her very supportive and positive review.</p><p>To test the role for LCS, we performed an experiment along the proposed lines. We expressed Sec24AB LCS-sfGFP (aa 1-415) and Sec24AB nonLCS-sfGFP (aa 416-1184) and compared their dynamics/behavior in starved cells to this of full length Sec24AB-sfGFP.</p><p>In normal growth conditions, both FL Sec24AB and its LCS localize to ERES, although the LCS is slightly more cytoplasmic. Conversely, the nonLCS is mostly cytoplasmic with a very small pool localized to ERES.</p><p>This is not completely in line with what the reviewer has said of yeast Sec24, that is, that removing part of the N-terminal of Sec24 would not do change its properties. Our experiments would suggest that Sec24AB-LCS behaves much more like the full length than the nonLCS (that corresponds to Sec24 N-terminal truncation of 1/3 of the protein). However, we do not know how long the N-terminal truncation of yeast Sec24 was. Second, our experimental set up is different as we express these chimeric proteins on top of the endogenous Sec24AB and this might change the behavior of the LCS. Third, yeast Sec24 is more similar to Drosophila Sec24CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>) and we assess here Sec24AB. Last, the amount of structured domains in the N-ter of yeast Sec24 seems higher than the Drosophila counterparts, which might confer different properties.</p><p>When cells are starved of amino-acids, FL Sec24AB is incorporated to Sec bodies (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure1</xref>) and its LCS also, very efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Conversely, the nonLCS remains largely cytoplasmic and is not efficiently recruited to Sec bodies, although it is present in these structures. This shows that as predicted, the LCS region of Sec24AB is necessary and sufficient for its recruitment to Sec bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>We then investigated whether Sec24AB LCS is sufficient to drive Sec body formation. To this end, we depleted cells of Sec24AB, expressed Sec24AB LCS in these depleted cells and asked whether it rescues Sec body formation.</p><p>As reported, Sec24AB depletion leads to smaller structures that are not Sec bodies (see below). However, expression of Sec24AB-LCS, although it localizes to the resulting smaller structures, does not lead to the typical large Sec body formation. This suggests that Sec24AB LCS does not drive Sec body formation. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6–figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>This study describes a novel stress-induced structure called the Sec body and provides an initial characterization in Drosophila S2 cells.

It is worth discussing the evolutionary conservation of this phenomenon (or if available, results from mammalian cells)</italic>.</p><p>We have addressed this point in three ways:</p><p>First, we starved three mammalian cell lines, immortalized MEFs, COS cells and HEK cells under similar conditions as S2 cells. We definitely see a remodeling of ERES components in starved MEFs when compared to fed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref>). However, whether this corresponds to Sec bodies is too early to say. HEK cells detach upon starvation and the response of COS cells is complex (and needs to be investigated further).</p><p>Second, Sec bodies formation is a combination of (at least) two factors. One factor is that the absence of amino-acids needs to be sensed and signaled. This is perhaps not similar in mammalian and Drosophila cells. The other factor is that ERES components respond to this signaling. Drosophila proteins that are incorporated in Sec bodies might have different properties from their mammalian counterparts.</p><p>To test this, we transfected human Sec16A (the long isoform) in S2 cells. In normal growth conditions, hSec16A localizes partially to ERES and it is efficiently incorporated in Sec bodies upon starvation. This suggests that hSec16A has molecular properties compatible with Sec body recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1–figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we would like to stress that although the conservation of the response to amino-acid starvation needs to be demonstrated and is indisputably important, we feel that the results we got on Drosophila are of sufficient interest on their own to justify publication. Many phenomena are only shown in yeast, for instance the formation of filamentous structures enriched in glutamate synthase upon starvation that was recently published in <italic>Elife</italic>. Furthermore, the concept of liquid droplets has first been illustrated in model organisms (with the P granules in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) and has only be applied later to mammalian stress granules.</p><p><italic>2) The importance of the Sec body is hinted at in the last experiment, but by itself, was not especially compelling. It would substantially strengthen the paper if biological relevance were established with either a more specific perturbation and/or a more specific assay for ER exit (as opposed to cell death).

Below are some suggestions that might help improve this important last part of the paper. I'm not suggesting that all three are needed, but any one would strengthen the case for physiologic relevance/function of the Sec body</italic>.</p><p>This is a fair point. In the original manuscript, based on the fact that protein synthesis was not needed for the reversion of Sec bodies to ERES, we have proposed that Sec bodies act as a reservoir for ERES components. This would allow ERES to be re-built immediately upon stress relief and be instrumental to cell viability.</p><p>We now show that ERES are indeed re-built within 20 minutes of growth medium addition and that they efficiently sustain anterograde transport of the plasma membrane reporter Delta, as efficiently as in non-starved cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8 A-C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We have also monitored the protein level of COPII components Sec23 and Sec31, and showed that are stabilized upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). This illustrates the notion that Sec bodies act to prevent degradation that might occurs in growing conditions (of note, we do not have a mechanism behind this degradation/stabilization at this stage).</p><p>To strengthen our conclusion, we have followed two (b and c) of the reviewer’s suggestions:</p><p><italic>a. The ideal experiment would involve a manipulation that disrupts Sec body formation without affecting other cellular processes. I'm sure the authors have considered this extensively, but is there a mutant of Sec24AB, perhaps in the LCS, that would preclude Sec body formation without affecting its function at ERES? Such a mutant that dissociates these two functions would be well investigating as it would allow Sec body function to be studied with higher precision</italic>.</p><p>This is a great suggestion, but we do not have such a mutant yet.</p><p><italic>b. An alternative strategy to more specifically probe Sec body function would be to use a more precise assay. If the Sec body is needed to re-establish the early secretory pathway, then secretion should be diminished upon recovery in Sec24AB knockdown cells relative to the situation before starvation, whereas secretion rates should be the same before versus after in Sec24CD knockdown cells (or control cells, where Sec body formation is normal)</italic>.</p><p>We agree that Sec body formation could be linked to other cell processes, some of them important for cell viability. But we have monitored transport from depleted cells in which Sec bodies do not form (Sec24AB depleted) that were first starved and reversed to full medium. Upon Sec24AB depletion, transport after the regimen of starvation/growth resumes less efficiently than in mock depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Of course, it can be argued that we measure the absence of a COPII component necessary for transport.</p><p>However, Sec24AB-depleted cells kept in Schneider’s are almost as efficient in Delta anterograde transport as mock-depleted cells. This is probably because Sec24CD compensates for the loss of AB. Therefore, the transport impairment of Sec24AB depleted cells after the regimen of starvation/growth is likely to be due to the absence of Sec body formation.</p><p>Taken together, we can state that Sec body formation allows a quicker resumption of transport through the secretory pathway when compared to situations where they do not form. This is likely to be a factor important for the cell viability upon stress relief. Why and how the cell population decreases rapidly during starvation remains to be investigated.</p><p><italic>c. One could see whether, in the Sec24AB knockdown cells, starvation induces degradation of other Sec body components. In other words, is one purpose of the Sec body to protect these key factors from degradation, as speculated?</italic></p><p>We have performed this experiment and show that upon conditions where Sec bodies do not form (upon Sec23, 24AB and Sec16 depletion), Sec body components are less stable than in cells where Sec bodies do form.</p><p>As mentioned above, the stabilization of Sec31 observed in mock-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lanes 1 and 2) is not observed upon depletion of Sec16, 23 and 24AB (compare lanes 2, 4, 6 and 8). Sec23 is also not stabilized in starved cells depleted of Sec16 (compare lanes 2 and 4). Altogether, this shows that Sec bodies do act as a protective mechanism for ERES components.</p><p>Curiously, the depletion of Sec16, 23 and 24AB seems to stabilize Sec31 in normal growth conditions. Sec23 is also stabilized in fed Sec16 depleted cells (compare lane 1 and 3). It might be due to a reduction of Sec31 and Sec23 turnover in the absence of other COPII components, perhaps suggesting that Sec31 and Sec23 turnover is enhanced by COPII coat formation. Alternatively, the depletion of a specific ERES component might lead to the compensatory upregulation of others.</p></body></sub-article></article>
