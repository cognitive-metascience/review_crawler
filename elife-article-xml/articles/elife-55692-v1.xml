Although known for their microbicidal activity, antibiotics may also interfere with the host’s immune system. Here, we analyzed the effects of bedaquiline (BDQ), an inhibitor of the mycobacterial ATP synthase, on human macrophages. Genome-wide gene expression analysis revealed that BDQ reprogramed cells into potent bactericidal phagocytes. We found that 579 and 1,495 genes were respectively differentially expressed in naive- and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected macrophages incubated with the drug, with an over-representation of lysosome-associated genes. BDQ treatment triggered a variety of antimicrobial defense mechanisms, including phagosome-lysosome fusion, and autophagy. These effects were associated with activation of transcription factor EB, involved in the transcription of lysosomal genes, resulting in enhanced intracellular killing of different bacterial species that were naturally insensitive to BDQ. Thus, BDQ could be used as a host-directed therapy against a wide range of bacterial infections.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The discovery of antibiotic drugs, which treat diseases caused by bacteria, has been a hugely valuable advance in modern medicine. They work by targeting specific cellular processes in bacteria, ultimately stopping them from multiplying or killing them outright. Antibiotics sometimes also affect their human hosts and can cause side-effects, such as gut problems or skin reactions.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that antibiotics also have an impact on the human immune system. This may happen either indirectly, by affecting ‘friendly’ bacteria normally present in the body, or through direct effects on immune cells. In turn, this could change the effectiveness of drug treatments. For example, if an antibiotic weakens immune cells, the body could have difficulty fighting off the existing infection – or become more vulnerable to new ones.</p><p>However, even though new drugs are being introduced to combat the worldwide rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, their effects on immunity are still not well understood. For example, bedaquiline is an antibiotic recently developed to treat tuberculosis infections that are resistant to several drugs. Giraud-Gatineau et al. wanted to determine if bedaquiline altered the human immune response to bacterial infection independently from its direct anti-microbial effects.</p><p>Macrophages engulf foreign particles like bacteria and break them down using enzymes stored within small internal compartments, or ‘lysosomes’. Initial experiments using human macrophages, grown both with and without bedaquiline, showed that the drug did not harm the cells and that they grew normally. A combination of microscope imaging and genetic analysis revealed that exposure to bedaquiline not only increased the number of lysosomes within macrophage cells, but also the activity of genes and proteins that increase lysosomes’ ability to break down foreign particles.</p><p>These results suggested that bedaquiline treatment might make macrophages better at fighting infection, even if the drug itself had no direct effect on bacterial cells. Further studies, where macrophages were first treated with bedaquiline and then exposed to different types of bacteria known to be resistant to the drug, confirmed this hypothesis: in every case, the treated macrophages became efficient bacterial killers. In contrast, older anti-tuberculosis drugs did not have any such potentiating effect on the macrophages.</p><p>This work sheds new light on our how antibiotic drugs can interact with the cells of the human immune system, and can sometimes even boost our innate defences. Such immune-boosting effects could one day be exploited to make more effective treatments against bacterial infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>host-pathogen

used in the treatment of bacterial infections, and, in effectively combating such diseases, have substantially increased human life expectancy. As with most drugs, antibiotic treatment can also alter host metabolism, leading to adverse side-effects, including nausea, hepatotoxicity, skin reactions, and gastrointestinal and neurological disorders. Such side-effects can become critical when antibiotic treatment is long and involves several drugs, as in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), where 2–28% of patients develop mild liver injury during treatment with first-line drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agal et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Antibiotics can interfere with the immune system, indirectly through the disturbance of the body’s microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ubeda and Pamer, 2012</xref>), or directly by modulating the functions of immune cells. Such interactions may impact treatment efficacy or the susceptibility of the host to concomitant infection. For example, after treatment completion, TB patients are more vulnerable to reactivation and reinfection of the disease, suggesting therapy-related immune impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cox et al., 2008</xref>). Drug-sensitive TB can be cured by combining up to four antibiotics in a 6-month treatment; specifically, isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB) and pyrazinamide (PZA) for 2 months, and INH and RIF for additional 4 months. INH induces apoptosis of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB)-infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tousif et al., 2014</xref>) and leads to a decrease in Th1 cytokine production in household contacts with latent TB under preventive INH therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biraro et al., 2015</xref>). RIF has immunomodulatory properties and acts as a mild immunosuppressive agent in psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsankov and Grozdev, 2011</xref>). RIF reduces inflammation by inhibiting IκBα degradation, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bi et al., 2011</xref>), and Toll-like receptor 4 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). PZA treatment of MTB-infected human monocytes and mice significantly reduces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manca et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, Puyskens et al. showed that several anti-TB drugs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and may impact host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puyskens et al., 2020</xref>). It is therefore necessary to understand how antibiotic treatment modulates macrophage functions, and more generally, how it impacts the host immune response.</p><p>The worldwide rise in antibiotic resistance is a major threat to global health care. A growing number of bacterial infections, such as pneumonia, salmonellosis, and TB, are becoming harder to treat as the antibiotics used to treat them become less effective. While new antibiotics are being developed and brought to the clinic, their effects on the human immune system are not being studied in-depth. Here, we have investigated the impact of a recently approved anti-TB drug, bedaquiline (BDQ), on the transcriptional responses of human macrophages infected with MTB. Macrophages are the primary cell target of MTB, which has evolved several strategies to survive and multiply inside the macrophage phagosome, including prevention of phagosome acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sturgill-Koszycki et al., 1994</xref>), inhibition of phagolysosomal fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong and Hart, 1975</xref>) and phagosomal rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simeone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van der Wel et al., 2007</xref>). They play a central role in the host response to TB pathogenesis, by orchestrating the formation of granulomas, presenting mycobacterial antigens to T cells, and killing the bacillus upon IFN-γ activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cambier et al., 2014</xref>). BDQ is a diarylquinoline that specifically inhibits a subunit of the bacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, decreasing intracellular ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andries et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koul et al., 2007</xref>). It has 20,000 times less affinity for human ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haagsma et al., 2009</xref>). The most common side effects of BDQ are nausea, joint and chest pain, headache, and arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diacon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">TMC207-C208 Study Group et al., 2014</xref>). However, possible interactions between BDQ and the host immune response have not been studied in detail. Understanding the impact of BDQ on the host immune response may help to develop strategies aiming at improving drug efficacy and limiting side-effects, including cytotoxicity, alteration of cell metabolism, and immunomodulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BDQ modulates the response of naïve and MTB-infected macrophages</title><p>We treated human monocyte-derived macrophages from four healthy donors with BDQ at 5 µg/mL, which corresponds to the concentration detected in the plasma of TB patients treated with BDQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andries et al., 2005</xref>). This concentration did not affect cell viability over an incubation period of 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In order to exclude potential differences due to the MTB bacillary load between treated and untreated cells, we generated a virulent BDQ-resistant strain of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (BDQr-MTB). The selected clone, which carried a Ala63→Pro mutation in subunit c of the ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andries et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), had a similar generation time to wild-type bacteria when cultured in 7H9 liquid medium, although we observed a slower growth after 7 days of treatment. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We also noted no difference in virulence or in intracellular growth of both wild-type- and BDQ-resistant MTB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C-E</xref>). As expected, the MIC<sub>99</sub> (defined as the concentration required to prevent 99% growth) for susceptible MTB was 0.07 µg/mL, a value similar to previously published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andries et al., 2005</xref>), while the MIC<sub>99</sub> of the BDQr-MTB was 36 µg/mL. We infected macrophages with BDQr-MTB. After 24 hr of infection, cells were incubated for an additional 18 hr with BDQ (5 µg/mL). The bacillary load of resistant MTB inside macrophages was the same in untreated cells as in cells after 18 hr of BDQ treatment. In contrast, in the same experiment using BDQ-susceptible MTB, there was a 70% decrease in the bacillary load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Following treatment, we characterized the genome-wide gene expression profiles of MTB-infected macrophages, as described above.

More genes were thus affected by BDQ treatment in MTB-infected cells than in naive macrophages. This probably reflects the fact that MTB infection induces an extensive remodeling of the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barreiro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tailleux et al., 2008</xref>).

This probably reflects the cell adaptation to infection. Functional annotation of the gene set upregulated by BDQ also revealed that similar pathways were affected by BDQ in naive and BDQr-MTB-infected macrophages, with an enrichment for genes associated with glucose/phospholipid metabolism and lysosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source datas 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata4">4</xref>). 452 genes were differentially expressed in both naive and MTB-infected cells upon BDQ treatment with an over-representation of lysosome-associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata7">Figure 1—source data 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>BDQ affects host metabolism</title><p>As metabolic pathways were over-represented in our RNAseq analysis, we investigated if glycolysis is affected by BDQ treatment using the Seahorse Extracellular Flux analyzer.

We confirmed that the combination of PZA with BDQ was highly bactericidal on MTB, leading to a 83% decrease in colony forming units using 50 µg/mL PZA.

Here, we have analyzed the effects of the new anti-TB drug BDQ on human macrophages. We found that in addition to its antibacterial activity, BDQ induces cell reprogramming, increasing macrophage bactericidal activity. Gene expression profiling revealed that 1495 genes were differentially expressed in MTB-infected macrophages incubated with BDQ, with over-representation of genes involved in metabolism, lysosome biogenesis, and acidification. Recent work has highlighted the role of metabolic reprogramming in controlling immunological effector functions, emphasizing the close connection between cell function and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). In agreement with these results, we observed a substantial increase in both the number of acidic compartments and proteolytic activity of macrophages upon BDQ treatment.</p><p>BDQ is a cationic amphiphilic drug, consisting of a hydrophobic ring structure and a hydrophilic side chain with a charged cationic amine group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diacon et al., 2012</xref>). Cationic amphiphilic drugs can accumulate in lysosomes through ion trapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Duve et al., 1974</xref>). At neutral pH, they passively diffuse across cell and organelle membranes but when they enter the luminal space of acidic compartments such as lysosomes, the amine group ionizes and becomes membrane-impermeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MacIntyre and Cutler, 1988</xref>). Such lysosomotropic compounds usually increase the lysosomal pH and thus decrease lysosomal enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kazmi et al., 2013</xref>). However, our results reveal instead that BDQ triggers lysosomal activation, upregulating the expression of genes coding for hydrolases and for subunits of the lysosomal proton pump v-ATPase. Consistent with these observations, we observed that BDQ-treated cells significantly increase their ability to degrade DQ-BSA.</p><p>Pre-clinical studies have shown that BDQ may induce phospholipidosis, potentially explaining some of the drug’s observed toxicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diacon et al., 2012</xref>). Phospholipidosis, which is characterized by the accumulation of phospholipids in lysosomes, resulting in impaired lysosome function, is common upon treatment with cationic amphiphilic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shayman and Abe, 2013</xref>). Various phospholipid species have been described including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and lysobisphosphatidic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reasor, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamamoto et al., 1971a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamamoto et al., 1971b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yoshikawa, 1991</xref>). In BDQ-treated macrophages, we only observed an increase in the amount of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. The quantity of cardiolipin, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylglycerol remained unchanged upon treatment. These observations do not indicate lysosomal dysfunction, but rather a targeted regulation of certain phospholipids by BDQ. In accordance with this idea, 28 genes involved in phospholipid metabolism were differentially expressed in BDQ-treated macrophages. Phosphatidylinositol phosphates regulate many cellular functions, including endosomal trafficking, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export, autophagy, and phagosome-lysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Matteis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levin et al., 2017</xref>). These phospholipids may thus be involved in the increase of autophagy and mycobacterial phagosome-lysosome fusion upon BDQ treatment.</p><p>Lysosomes are both digestive organelles of the endocytic and autophagic pathways and signaling hubs involved in nutrient sensing, cell growth and differentiation, transcriptional regulation, and metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lamming and Bar-Peled, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lawrence and Zoncu, 2019</xref>). In response to nutrients and growth factors, the mechanistic target of the rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is recruited and activated at the lysosomal surface, where it promotes ribosomal biogenesis, translation, and biosynthesis of lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lamming and Bar-Peled, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lawrence and Zoncu, 2019</xref>). mTORC1 binds to and phosphorylates TFEB, resulting in its cytosolic sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roczniak-Ferguson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Settembre et al., 2012</xref>). Upon starvation or lysosomal stress, mTORC1 is released from the lysosomal membrane and becomes inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lamming and Bar-Peled, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lawrence and Zoncu, 2019</xref>). The release of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activates the phosphatase calcineurin, which de-phosphorylates TFEB and promotes its nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Medina et al., 2015</xref>). TFEB then binds to CLEAR (coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation) elements within the promoters of genes involved in autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis and activates their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lamming and Bar-Peled, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lawrence and Zoncu, 2019</xref>). We found that TFEB translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in BDQ-treated cells, with the concomitant up-regulation of 85 genes containing CLEAR elements 18 hr after incubation with the drug.</p><p>Finding the direct host-cell target of BDQ would have been a major breakthrough, but unfortunately, we were unable to identify the target. However, it is possible that BDQ could modulate the host response by interfering with ion homeostasis inside the lysosome. Greenwood et al. recently showed that BDQ accumulated primarily in host cell lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenwood et al., 2019</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that these droplets are actually lysosomes. Due to its high hydrophobicity, BDQ might accumulate in lysosomal membranes and thereby change the transmembrane ion permeability. In agreement with this hypothesis, it has been shown that BDQ can accumulate at the lipid membrane of liposomes and act as a H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ionophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hards et al., 2018</xref>). The ensuing lysosomal stress could then facilitate the dissociation of mTOR from the lysosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plescher et al., 2015</xref>) and the activation of TFEB. Interestingly, BDQ increases the expression of mucolipin 1 gene (<italic>mcoln1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), which in turn can activate TFEB. Medina et al. showed indeed that lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released through MCOLN1 and activates calcineurin, which binds and dephosphorylates TFEB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Medina et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A striking feature of BDQ-treated macrophages is their capacity to control pathogenic bacterial infection. BDQ enhances macrophage innate defense mechanisms, including induction of antimicrobial effectors such as nitric oxide, phagosome-lysosome fusion, and autophagy. Other anti-TB drugs have been described to regulate autophagy. INH and PZA promote autophagy activation and phagosomal maturation in MTB-infected murine macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). This process was dependent of bacterial factors and was suggested to be essential for antimycobacterial drug action and for dampening proinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). In our system, we did not detect increased autophagy in cells treated with INH, which may also be due to differences in the autophagy response in murine and human macrophages. Altogether, we demonstrate that BDQ is able to boost the innate defenses of human cells.</p><p>A growing number of pathogenic bacteria are becoming resistant to antibiotics, making their use less effective. In addition to the development of ‘classical’ drugs targeting key factors in bacterial physiology, host-directed therapy (HDT) has emerged as approach that could be used in adjunct with existing or future antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Machelart et al., 2017</xref>). For example, metformin, an FDA-approved drug for type II diabetes, increases the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and stimulates phagosome-lysosome fusion by activating the 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Singhal et al., 2014</xref>), and recent studies suggest that metformin provides better outcomes in TB patients, especially those with diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yew et al., 2019</xref>). Pathogens manipulate host-signaling pathways to subvert innate and adaptive immunity. It might thus be possible to reprogram the host immune system to better control or even kill bacteria. For instance, MTB has developed several strategies to counteract autophagy, including the product of the enhanced intracellular survival (Eis) gene, which limits ROS generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). Our results clearly show that BDQ can bypass these escape mechanisms and allow more effective control of bacterial infection. We also showed that BDQ potentiates the activity of other anti-TB drugs, independently of its bactericidal activity on MTB. Hence, our work opens new avenues for downstream evaluation of the potential use of BDQ as a potent drug in HDT.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Buffy coats (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">PBMC</td><td valign="top">Etablissement Français du sang (EFS)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK 293 cell line</td><td valign="top">Obtained from Dr. Craig T.

Resistance to BDQ was confirmed (i) by bacterial culture in Middlebrook 7H9 Broth (Becton Dickinson) supplemented with albumin-dextrose-catalase (ADC, Becton Dickinson) and 0.3 µg/mL BDQ, and (ii) by confirming the mutation in the ATP synthase gene. The <italic>atpE</italic> gene was PCR-amplified using primers (forward: 5-<named-content content-type="sequence">TCGTGTTCATCCTGATCTCCA</named-content>-3; reverse: 5-<named-content content-type="sequence">GACAATCGCGCTCACTTCAC</named-content>-3) and the PCR products were sent to Eurofins for sequencing. All the selected mutants carried a mutation in the <italic>atpE</italic> gene as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andries et al., 2005</xref>). Only mutant with similar growth rate (in liquid medium and in macrophages) as the wild-type strain has been used for further experiments. Before infection, bacteria were washed and resuspended in 1 mL PBS. Clumps were disassociated by 50 passages through a needle, and then allowed to sediment for 5 min. The density of bacteria in the supernatant was verified by measuring the OD600 and aliquot volumes defined to allow 0.5 bacterium-per-cell infections. After 2 hr of incubation at 37°C, infected cells were thoroughly washed in RPMI 1640 to remove extracellular bacteria and were incubated in fresh medium.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell viability assay</title><p>Cell viability was determined using the LDH Cytotoxicity Assay kit or the MTT assay kit (Abcam), according to manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Resazurin assay determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)</title><p>The microdilution test was performed in 96-well plates as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palomino et al., 2002</xref>).

The model formula used in DESeq2 (~Donor + Infection + Infection:Donor + Infection:Treatment + Donor:Treatment) contained: the main effects for Donor and Infection, interactions of Donor with Infection and Treatment to adjust for various responses to infection and treatment between donors, and a nested interaction of Infection with Treatment because we were interested in the infection-status-specific treatment effects. The latter was used to extract differentially expressed genes between treated and untreated samples under the infected and uninfected conditions. p-Values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method producing an adjusted P-value or false-discovery rate (FDR).</p><p>Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were performed using the Cytoscape app ClueGO (version 2.5.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bindea et al., 2009</xref>).

Bedaquiline is an important antibiotic for the treatment of tuberculosis, and a better understanding of its activities is important for developing next-generation therapeutics for this globally significant disease. More-broadly, understanding the host-directed effects of antibiotics is also significant for other bacterial infections for which drug resistance is increasing.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;The antibiotic bedaquiline activates host macrophage innate immune resistance to bacterial infection&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. We found that the work addresses an important topic and is interesting. However, the reviewers have raised substantial technical concerns. Therefore, the decision is to reject your manuscript without requesting a revision. Nevertheless, in addition to the individual reviews, we are providing a consolidated review (below) that captures the consensus of the three reviewers in case you feel that the concerns are easily addressable within a reasonable timeframe.</p><p>1) A major concern is that the manuscript does not cleanly demonstrate that the effects of BDQ observed on MTB growing in cells is in fact due to the effects of BDQ on the host cells vs. effects of BDQ on MTB. The use of a BDQ resistant mutant is a nice attempt to address this concern, but it is not entirely satisfactory. First, the data shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2C demonstrate that BDQ (5µg/mL) does appear to have an effect on growth of the resistant mutant. Second, even if growth of the bacteria is unimpeded in broth, the antibiotic may still have an effect on the bacteria in cells. Even a minor effect on MTB (e.g., lysis of a few bacteria) might have a large effect on the host response. Unless this central concern can be satisfactorily addressed (which we fear it may not be) then we do not feel the paper would be a strong candidate for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>2) Another major concern relates to the presentation of the RNAseq data in Figure 1A-B and Figure supplement 3A-B. Figure 1AB shows the effect of BDQ on MTB-infected macrophages, whereas Figure supplement 3A-B shows the effect of BDQ on uninfected macrophages. If BDQ acts on host cells independent of an effect on bacteria, then we would expect similar genes to be induced in both conditions. However, the data are presented only at the level of GO-term annotations. We require gene-level expression data comparing gene induction in all four conditions (+/- BDQ and +/- MTB) in a single analysis so that we can assess whether in fact the effects of BDQ are similar +/- MTB. It may well be that MTB modulates the host response to BDQ, e.g., via activation of TLRs. In such a case, it might be useful to compare the response of cells infected with live TB +/- BDQ with the response to cells treated with TLR agonists or killed bacteria +/- BDQ. If, however, the main effects of BDQ on host gene expression only appear to occur in conjunction with infection with live MTB, then we would be concerned that the effects of BDQ are via their effects on MTB and not direct host-directed effects.</p><p>3) Another major concern is that there is no direct evidence that the apparent effects of BDQ on MTB growing in cells is due to induction of TFEB. This should be shown with TFEB mutant cells. These cells could also be used to show that the induction of lysosomal-related genes and increased lysotracker staining by BDQ is due to TFEB activation.</p><p>4) As raised by reviewer 2, it is imperative to show that the synergy between BDQ and PZA on the BDQ-resistant mutant does not occur in broth.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>- A MIC for BDQ on the resistant mutant should be reported.</p><p>- Figure 1—figure supplement 2B is missing information about what concentration of BDQ was used.</p><p>- Reviewer 2 raised a number of questions about the data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2C that should be addressed.</p><p>- As raised by reviewer 3, the proposed mechanism connecting BDQ to calcium and TFEB activation is only weakly supported by data. The authors should consider toning down their conclusions related to this part of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Tuberculosis remains a major global problem and kills more people than any other single pathogen. This paper addresses the mechanism of action of one of the most important new tuberculosis drugs, bedaquiline (BDQ), and shows that in addition to its well-known direct anti-microbial effects, BDQ also has significant 'host-directed' effects that can contribute to its anti-microbial activity. In particular, BDQ is shown to enhance lysosomal activity in macrophages. This appears to be via activation of the host transcription factor, TFEB.</p><p>In general the paper is well-written, and the experiments are well-described and well-performed. There is significant current interest in the idea of host-directed therapies for TB, and the idea that a major new TB drug might act in part via its effects on host cells is interesting and potentially very important. I have only a few minor comments:</p><p>1) Transcriptional profiling is performed on both MTB-infected and in uninfected cells. It is claimed that the effects of BDQ are &quot;similar&quot; in both situations. However, the way the data are presented makes it hard to see how similar or different the effects of BDQ are +/- MTB. Could the authors present a heat-map (indicating key genes, particularly the lysosomal signature) with all four conditions (+/- MTB, +/- BDQ) in a single analysis/panel? If there are significant differences, it might be relevant to comment on these.</p><p>2) A weakness of the manuscript is that the direct host-cell target of BDQ is not identified. Thus, the mechanism leading to TFEB induction is unclear. However, I tend to feel that identification of the target of BDQ is beyond what could be reasonably asked of this study. However, perhaps the authors could at least briefly discuss what the host cell target of BDQ might be and acknowledge that they have not identified it. In addition, the evidence that the effects of BDQ require TFEB is only indirect. It would thus be desirable, if feasible, for the authors to show, e.g., with TFEB knock out cells, that the effects of BDQ on lysosome-related gene induction does require TFEB.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Giraud-Gatineau et al. concludes that the newest anti-tuberculosis antibiotic, bedaquiline (BDQ), works by not only inhibiting ATP synthase in the bacterium, but also by synergistically working directly on host macrophages to boost their antimicrobial effects during infection. There have been many reports of similar kinds of effects of different antibiotic regimens on activating immune responses the host, but nearly all suffer from the inherent difficulty in conclusively determining whether the &quot;host effects&quot; of the antibiotic are due to direct action on macrophage pathways or whether the effects on the host are secondary to the effects of the antibiotic on the physiology of the bacteria. Indeed, each of the papers cited by the authors on this subject suffer from this problem, and the field remains murky.</p><p>It would be an exciting finding that BDQ activates host macrophage pathways (perhaps by partial inhibition of the host ATP synthase?), but unfortunately my main criticism of this paper is that I find that there are multiple issues that center around the main problem of whether BDQ actually increases the antibacterial capacity of macrophages by directly activating host pathways. I certainly appreciate the difficulty of the task, and the authors consider bacterial load as one potential factor by using a BDQ-resistant mutant, but many of my concerns relate to the data itself of these key experiments, as well as the possibility of effects on bacterial physiology induced by the antibiotic. For example, even a small amount of lysis of the bacteria could influence host transcriptional responses. Likewise, it seems that comparing resistance of a bacterium in culture vs. in a cell doesn't necessarily show that the effect is on the host. It seems likely that the antibiotic is still working solely on the bug, but the host environment sensitizes the bacterium to the antibiotic.</p><p>1) It seems likely to me that the transcriptional (Figure 1) and functional effects (Figure 2) of BDQ on infected macrophages is due to indirect effects on bacterial physiology. The use of the BDQ-resistant mutant is an important experiment, but I have doubts that the concentration used for the macrophage infection studies (5µg/mL) does not have any effect on the bacteria. This concentration apparently inhibits the growth of the resistant mutant Figure 1—figure supplement 2C inside macrophages, and this could be due to either activation of antimicrobial host effects or partial inhibition of bacterial growth. It is not clear what effects this concentration has on the bacteria, the mutant was selected on 0.3 µg/mL BDQ, and I could not find an MIC stated in the manuscript. The growth curve of bacteria grown in axenic culture +/- BDQ (panel B) is missing any information about the concentration of BDQ used, and there is no direct comparison of the growth kinetics between wild-type and mutant bacteria at 5 µg/mL. Moreover, the assumption is that treatment with 5µg/mL of BDQ doesn't change the bacteria at all, and thus any differences must be due to host modulation, yet I think there are multiple reasons to doubt this.</p><p>2) There are a number of other worrisome details about the experiment displayed in Figure 1—figure supplement 2C. First, it is curious that neither the wild-type nor resistant bacteria grew very well between the 18hour and 5day time points in the absence of BDQ. It appears they double at best, but much more would be expected. Second, the BDQ-resistant mutant didn't grow at all over this 4+ day time course in the presence of 5µg/mL BDQ. It seems unlikely to me that this effects of BDQ are solely due to host activation. Third, why are the CFU levels of the mutant bacteria so much higher than the wild-type at 18 hours?</p><p>3) It seems important to demonstrate in all of their bacterial infections, including Figure 4, that the macrophage monolayers are intact and of equal density amongst all the treatments. Indeed, while the authors test the effects of BDQ on macrophage viability in the absence of bacteria, it seems important to assess its effect during the heightened inflammatory response during infection.</p><p>4) I believe that the results with the host effects of BDQ would be more conclusive if they could show that treatment with different antibiotics gives rise to different results.</p><p>5) The authors also perform treatment of macrophages with BDQ in the absence of infection, and claim that similar pathways are activated, inferring that these effects are independent of the presence of bacteria. Unfortunately, these comparisons were evaluated at the level of GO pathway annotation, and I believe strongly that if BDQ is directly activating gene expression, perhaps via PTFB, that the comparison should be performed at the gene level, i.e. as done in Figure 2A.</p><p>6) I find the conclusion drawn from the apparent synergy btw PZA and BDQ is misleading for two reasons. First of all, given the residual sensitivity of the resistant mutant to high levels of BDQ, it seems imperative that this synergy be tested in culture. Second, given the model that BDQ activates host antimicrobial activities, I expect that BDQ would also synergize with other antibiotics besides PZA.</p><p>7) Much of the lysosome results in Figure 2 is complicated by the mild sensitivity of the resistant strain to BDQ. The one experiment that is interesting is the no-infection in panel G, but there is only a correlation, there is no evidence provided that this is the host effect of BDQ.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Giraud-Gatineau et al. describe how bedaquiline (BDQ), an antibiotic in clinical use for TB, activates bactericidal functions in human primary macrophages. Transcriptional analysis of such treated macrophages leads them to examine the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, which they find is upregulated and necessary for the effect of BDQ in reducing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> load in infected macrophages in vitro. Finally, they show that transcription factor TFEB is activated by BDQ, and that the activity of BDQ in macrophages is dependent on calcium, suggesting that the MCOLN1-calcineurin-TFEB pathway described by Medina et al., (2015) is implicated.</p><p>Overall, the concept of antibiotics serving dual functions as host-directed therapies is appealing and of great interest. However, there are several major concerns that must be addressed:</p><p>1) The proposed mechanism of enhancement of bactericidal activity is through TFEB, but the only evidence presented is correlative (TFEB immunofluorescence showing TFEB in the nucleus). This must be directly tested using loss-of-function approaches.</p><p>2) Similarly, the implication from the RNAseq, LysoTracker, and TFEB IF is that TFEB upregulates the genes responsible for lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, thus increasing bacterial clearance. The inducible recruitment of TFEB to relevant promoters must be directly tested.</p><p>3) The mechanism connecting BDQ to calcium release and TFEB activation is not shown.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…]</p><p>1) A major concern is that the manuscript does not cleanly demonstrate that the effects of BDQ observed on MTB growing in cells is in fact due to the effects of BDQ on the host cells vs. effects of BDQ on MTB. The use of a BDQ resistant mutant is a nice attempt to address this concern, but it is not entirely satisfactory. First, the data shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2C demonstrate that BDQ (5µg/mL) does appear to have an effect on growth of the resistant mutant. Second, even if growth of the bacteria is unimpeded in broth, the antibiotic may still have an effect on the bacteria in cells. Even a minor effect on MTB (e.g., lysis of a few bacteria) might have a large effect on the host response. Unless this central concern can be satisfactorily addressed (which we fear it may not be) then we do not feel the paper would be a strong candidate for eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer 2 for raising this point, acknowledging that this may be due to problems in our writing. Our main goal was to show that BDQ can activate macrophages, making them resistant to any bacterial infections, and not just to infection with MTB. In the revised manuscript, we present new data, which clearly show that BDQ induces bactericidal functions by directly targeting the host.</p><p>The first question is to what extent is the MTB mutant resistant to BDQ (BDQr-MTB). The MIC<sub>99</sub> of the mutant is 36 µg/mL, which is much higher than the concentration that we used. In our paper, BDQ is used at a maximum concentration of 5 µg/mL during 48 hours and 1 µg/mL during 5 days. At these concentrations, we never observed bacterial killing nor decrease of bacterial growth in liquid medium (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). We also showed that the bacillary load of resistant MTB inside macrophages is the same in untreated cells as in cells after 18 hours of BDQ treatment (the time point chosen for the RNAseq experiment). In contrast, in the same experiment using BDQ-susceptible MTB there is a 70% decrease in the bacillary load (Figure 1—figure supplement 2C).</p><p>We agree that BDQ might kill a few intracellular bacteria (even if we did not detect any changes by CFUs), but it is very unlikely that this effect could explain the macrophage resistance to bacterial infection. First, the effect of BDQ can also be inhibited by 3-MA and BAF, whereas these two autophagy inhibitors have no effect on untreated cells (Figure 6F). These results suggest a host-targeted effect of BDQ. The regulation of the lysosomal pathway by BDQ is also observed in uninfected macrophages and in cells stimulated with heat-inactivated MTB or with TLR agonists such as LPS and Pam3CSK4 (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Such changes were not observed in cells treated with the first line anti-TB drugs ethambutol (EMB), isoniazid (INH), pyrazinamide (PZA) and rifampicin (RIF) (new transcriptome analysis presented in Figure 5A-C and Figure 5—figure supplement 2, and LysoTracker staining analyzed by flow cytometry Figure 5D).</p><p>If the lysis of a few bacteria by BDQ induced macrophage activation, then we would expect a greater response when the cells are stimulated by heat-killed bacteria or drug-susceptible MTB than with BDQr-MTB. Again, as shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2, we did not observe any differences in the intensity of LysoTracker staining. Similar results have also been obtained when comparing the expression level of lysosomal genes. Overall, our results strongly argue for a host-dependent effect of BDQ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another major concern relates to the presentation of the RNAseq data in Figure 1A-B and Figure supplement 3A-B. Figure 1AB shows the effect of BDQ on MTB-infected macrophages, whereas Figure supplement 3A-B shows the effect of BDQ on uninfected macrophages. If BDQ acts on host cells independent of an effect on bacteria, then we would expect similar genes to be induced in both conditions. However, the data are presented only at the level of GO-term annotations. We require gene-level expression data comparing gene induction in all four conditions (+/- BDQ and +/- MTB) in a single analysis so that we can assess whether in fact the effects of BDQ are similar +/- MTB. It may well be that MTB modulates the host response to BDQ, e.g., via activation of TLRs. In such a case, it might be useful to compare the response of cells infected with live TB +/- BDQ with the response to cells treated with TLR agonists or killed bacteria +/- BDQ. If, however, the main effects of BDQ on host gene expression only appear to occur in conjunction with infection with live MTB, then we would be concerned that the effects of BDQ are via their effects on MTB and not direct host-directed effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Here we present new analysis, comparing gene expression level in all four conditions (+/- BDQ and +/- MTB). Upon BDQ treatment, 127 and 1043 genes, respectively, were differentially expressed in naïve cells and in MTB-infected macrophages, and the expression of 452 genes was modulated in both conditions. It is not surprising that the expression of more genes was affected in MTB-infected cells as MTB infection induces extensive remodeling of the transcriptome (Barreiro et al., 2012; Tailleux et al., 2008). We then classified all these genes by performing gene-set enrichment analysis. We showed that the expression of 70% of the lysosomal gene differentially expressed in MTB-infected macrophages, were also up-regulated in naïve cells upon BDQ treatment. These results are now included in Figure 1D and Figure 3A. We also performed additional experiments to determine whether the effects of BDQ on host gene expression were dependent of infection with live MTB. Briefly, cells were untreated or stimulated with LPS (TLR4 agonist), Pam3CSK4 (TLR1/2 agonist), heat-killed bacteria, drug-susceptible MTB or BDQr-MTB, and treated with BDQ. After 18 hours, RNA was collected and we performed RT-qPCR on a panel of lysosomal genes. We also analyzed the intensity of the LysoTracker staining using flow cytometry (<italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 2</italic>). Our results clearly show that the main effects on lysosome biogenesis/activation occurred with BDQ treatment and were not exclusively seen after infection with live MTB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another major concern is that there is no direct evidence that the apparent effects of BDQ on MTB growing in cells is due to induction of TFEB. This should be shown with TFEB mutant cells. These cells could also be used to show that the induction of lysosomal-related genes and increased lysotracker staining by BDQ is due to TFEB activation.</p></disp-quote><p>Using siRNA-mediated gene silencing (Troegeler et al., 2014), we inactivated the expression of TFEB in macrophages and confirmed its major role in the resistance to bacterial infection upon BDQ treatment. We also present a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with anti-TFEB antibody. As suggested by reviewers 1 and 3, we showed that TFEB activation is required for (i) the increased LysoTracker staining (Figure 9G), (ii) the induction of a panel of lysosomal-related genes (Figure 9H), and (iii) a better control of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and MTB infection upon BDQ treatment (Figure 9I-J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As raised by reviewer 2, it is imperative to show that the synergy between BDQ and PZA on the BDQ-resistant mutant does not occur in broth.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the suggested experiment.

This gave the wrong impression that bacteria do not multiply within macrophages.

It is claimed that the effects of BDQ are &quot;similar&quot; in both situations. However, the way the data are presented makes it hard to see how similar or different the effects of BDQ are +/- MTB. Could the authors present a heat-map (indicating key genes, particularly the lysosomal signature) with all four conditions (+/- MTB, +/- BDQ) in a single analysis/panel? If there are significant differences, it might be relevant to comment on these.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his positive feedback and for fair suggestions. In the revised manuscript, we present a new analysis (Figure 1). MTB infection induces important transcriptome remodeling (7,093 genes were differentially expressed upon infection with BDQr-MTB) so it is not surprising that the expression of more genes were altered after BDQ treatment of MTB-infected macrophages than uninfected macrophages. In the new version, we comment on these and present functional annotation clustering of the corresponding genes (Figure 1A-B). In the former version of our manuscript, we wrote that “We observed similar results with uninfected Mφs-treated with BDQ […] indicating that the effect of BDQ is not dependent on MTB infection”. We were principally referring here to the lysosome pathway and lipid metabolism. 452 genes were differentially expressed in both uninfected- and MTB infected cells. Classification of these genes using gene-set enrichment analysis shows an enrichment for genes associated with lysosome (Figure 1C-D). The expression of 70% of the lysosomal genes found to be differentially expressed in BDQr-MTB-infected cells, were also regulated in naïve cells upon BDQ treatment (Figure 3A). As suggested, we have added a first heat-map of the genes most up- and down-regulated in naïve- and MTB-infected cells treated with BDQ (Figure 1D), and a second heat-map focusing on the expression of lysosomal genes in all four conditions +/- MTB +/- BDQ (Figure 3A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A weakness of the manuscript is that the direct host-cell target of BDQ is not identified. Thus, the mechanism leading to TFEB induction is unclear. However, I tend to feel that identification of the target of BDQ is beyond what could be reasonably asked of this study. However, perhaps the authors could at least briefly discuss what the host cell target of BDQ might be and acknowledge that they have not identified it. In addition, the evidence that the effects of BDQ require TFEB is only indirect. It would thus be desirable, if feasible, for the authors to show, e.g., with TFEB knock out cells, that the effects of BDQ on lysosome-related gene induction does require TFEB.</p></disp-quote><p>Finding the direct host-cell target of BDQ would have been a major breakthrough, but unfortunately, we were unable to identify the target. However, it is possible that BDQ could modulate the host response by interfering with ion homeostasis inside the lysosome. Greenwood et al., recently showed that BDQ accumulated primarily in host cell lipid droplets (Greenwood et al., 2019). It is tempting to speculate that these droplets are actually lysosomes. Due to its high hydrophobicity, BDQ might accumulate in lysosomal membranes and thereby change the transmembrane ion permeability. In agreement with this hypothesis, it has been shown that BDQ can accumulate at the lipid membrane of liposomes and act as a H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ionophore (Hards et al., 2018). The ensuing lysosomal stress could then facilitate the dissociation of mTOR from the lysosomal membrane (Plescher et al., 2015) and the activation of TFEB. Interestingly, BDQ increases the expression of mucolipin 1 gene (<italic>mcoln1</italic>, Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). Recently, Medina et al. showed that lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released through MCOLN1 and activates calcineurin, which binds and dephosphorylates TFEB (Medina et al., 2015) (Medina et al., 2015). These two hypotheses are now mentioned in the Discussion section of our paper.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we present additional experiments, including silencing of TFEB expression using siRNA and chromatin purification with anti-TFEB antibody. The results show that the effects of BDQ on the induction of genes linked to lysosomes indeed require TFEB (Figure 9 and Figure 9—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) It seems likely to me that the transcriptional (Figure 1) and functional effects (Figures 2- of BDQ on infected macrophages is due to indirect effects on bacterial physiology.

The CFUs and the growth curves of both WT and BDQr-MTB, with and without different concentrations of BDQ are now included in the manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B-C). Unlike drug-susceptible MTB, BDQrMTB continues to growth in the presence of 5 µg/mL BDQ, and we observed a slight decrease in growth only after 7 days of treatment. In our paper, BDQ is used at a maximum concentration of 5 µg/mL during 48 h and 1 µg/mL during 5 days.

We observed no synergy between BDQ and PZA in culture liquid medium, suggesting a hostdependent mechanism. We next tested whether BDQ would synergize with the other first-line anti-TB drugs in liquid culture or in BDQr-MTB-infected macrophages and found that BDQ did not potentiate the activity of INH, RIF and EMB in either case. While we cannot exclude the possibility that BDQ may have additive effects with other anti-TB drugs, as has been described (Ibrahim et al., 2007), we saw no evidence of synergism with any of the first-line agents (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Much of the lysosome results in Figure 2 is complicated by the mild sensitivity of the resistant strain to BDQ. The one experiment that is interesting is the no-infection in panel G, but there is only a correlation, there is no evidence provided that this is the host effect of BDQ.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, we add a new supplemental figure describing the lysosomal regulation in uninfected cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). As we mention in the text, lysosome biogenesis/activation is increased in both naïve and BDQr-MTB-infected macrophages upon BDQ treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The proposed mechanism of enhancement of bactericidal activity is through TFEB, but the only evidence presented is correlative (TFEB immunofluorescence showing TFEB in the nucleus). This must be directly tested using loss-of-function approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>To study the role of TFEB in the enhancement of bactericidal activity upon BDQ treatment in more depth, we inactivated TFEB expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages using siRNA-mediated gene silencing (Troegeler et al., 2014). After treating the cells with BDQ, we performed RTqPCR on a panel of lysosomal genes and analyzed the intensity of the LysoTracker staining using flow cytometry. In TFEB-silenced cells, BDQ does not increase LysoTracker staining (Figure 9G), nor the expression of <italic>trpm2</italic>, <italic>scarb1</italic>, <italic>atp6v0a1</italic> or <italic>mcoln1</italic> (Figure 9H). We also infected macrophages with <italic>S. aureus</italic> and MTB and showed that TFEB activation is required for better control of both pathogens upon BDQ treatment (Figure 9I-J). In addition, we present a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay using an anti-TFEB antibody (please see the comment below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly, the implication from the RNAseq, LysoTracker, and TFEB IF is that TFEB upregulates the genes responsible for lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, thus increasing bacterial clearance. The inducible recruitment of TFEB to relevant promoters must be directly tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We evaluated the recruitment of TFEB to the promoters of some lysosomal genes. Briefly, naïve- and heat-killed-stimulated cells treated with BDQ were lysed, and chromatin was harvested and fragmented using sonication. The chromatin was then subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antiTFEB antibody. The isolated DNA was then analyzed by RT-qPCR with primers specific for <italic>gla</italic> and <italic>mcoln1</italic> promoters. As expected, BDQ induces the recruitment of TFEB to these promoters (Figure 8—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The mechanism connecting BDQ to calcium release and TFEB activation is not shown. Neither is the requirement for calcineurin.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we were unable to identify the mechanism connecting BDQ to TFEB activation.</p><p>Greenwood et al., recently showed that BDQ accumulated primarily in host cell lipid droplets (Greenwood et al., 2019). It is tempting to speculate that these droplets are actually lysosomes. Due to its high hydrophobicity, BDQ might accumulate in lysosomal membranes and thereby change transmembrane ion permeability. In agreement with this hypothesis, it has been shown that BDQ can accumulate at the lipid membrane of liposomes and act as a H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ionophore (Hards et al., 2018). The ensuing lysosomal stress could then facilitate the dissociation of mTOR from the lysosomal membrane (Plescher et al., 2015) and the activation of TFEB. Interestingly, BDQ increases the expression of mucolipin 1 gene (<italic>mcoln1</italic>, Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). Recently, Medina et al. showed that lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released through MCOLN1 and activates calcineurin, which binds and dephosphorylates TFEB (Medina et al., 2015). These two hypotheses are now mentioned in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Although the synergistic effect of BDQ with PZA seems to approach 1 log (~10% survival) killing of M. tuberculosis, the effect size of BDQ alone (Figure 3F) is quite small. This raises questions of how significant these observations are to TB. This is important, since the whole setup is to find new therapeutic agents to control MDR TB.</p></disp-quote><p>In the former Figure 3F, we used a low concentration of BDQ (1 µg/mL) in order to discriminate between additive and synergic effect. At higher concentration of BDQ (5 µg/mL, the concentration detected in the plasma of TB patients treated with BDQ (Andries et al., 2005)), we observed a 50% decrease in the number viable bacteria (now in Figure 6F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors use BAPTA (extracellular) to eliminate calcium and test the effect of loss of TFEB activation on bacterial CFU. This is done with <italic>S. aureus</italic> (not TB). Also, if they really are using BAPTA, they would not be inhibiting intracellular calcium release but import from extracellular stores, changing the interpretation of the experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>The calcium chelation experiments were performed with BAPTA-AM, not BAPTA. We would like to apologize for this error and have corrected it in the revised manuscript. Unlike BAPTA, which is a membrane-impermeable calcium chelator that binds extracellular calcium ions, BAPTA-AM is a cell permeable analog of BAPTA that binds calcium only after the acetoxymethyl group is removed by cytoplasmic esterases (Tymianski et al., 1994). It is highly selective for Ca<sup>2+</sup> over Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and It is commonly used to evaluate the role of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cell signaling.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>My only query relates to new data (Figure 7) showing that human macrophages induce nitrite, which the authors claim is derived from host NO. As far as I am aware, there has been considerable difficulty demonstrating induction of NO by human macrophages in culture. In some cases, the NO2- observed has actually been produced by the bacteria themselves (see Bussel, Zhang and Nathan, 2013). The authors may want to take this into account.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her positive comments and suggestions, which have enabled us to improve our manuscript significantly. We agree the role of NO in the inhibition of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth is controversial in human. However, in Figure 7D, we quantified NO2- in uninfected cells upon BDQ treatment, which excludes nitric oxide produced by bacteria.</p></body></sub-article></article>
