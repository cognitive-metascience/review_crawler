the spectra sensitivity into the near-infrared (NIR) tissue transmissible range. Here we present an NIR-stimulable optogenetic platform (termed 'Opto-CRAC') that selectively and remotely controls Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive gene expression to regulate the function of non-excitable cells, including T lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. When coupled to upconversion nanoparticles, the optogenetic operation window is shifted from the visible range to NIR wavelengths to enable wireless photoactivation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling and optogenetic modulation of immunoinflammatory responses. In a mouse model of melanoma by using ovalbumin as surrogate tumor antigen, Opto-CRAC has been shown to act as a genetically-encoded 'photoactivatable adjuvant' to improve antigen-specific immune responses to specifically destruct tumor cells. Our study represents a solid step forward towards the goal of achieving remote and wireless control of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-modulated activities with tailored function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10024.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10024.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10024.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Optogenetics is a technique that has been used to study nerve cells for several years. It involves genetically engineering these cells to produce proteins from light-sensitive bacteria, and results in nerve cells that will either send, or stop sending, nerve impulses when they are exposed to a particular color of light. Neuroscientists have learned a lot about brain circuits using the technique, and now researchers in many other fields are giving it a try.</p><p>There are, however, several challenges to using optogenetics in other types of cells. Nerve cells create a tiny electrical impulses when they are activated, which helps them quickly transmit messages. But other types of cells use more diverse means to communicate and transmit signals. This means that optogenetics techniques must be adapted. Additionally, many cells are located deep in the body and so getting the light to them can be difficult.</p><p>He, Zhang et al. have now developed an optogenetic system (termed “Opto-CRAC”) that can control immune cells buried deep in tissue. The action of immune cells can be tuned by controlling the flow of calcium ions through gate-like proteins in their membranes. He, Zhang et al. genetically engineered immune cells so that a calcium gate-controlling protein became light sensitive. When the cells were exposed to a blue light the calcium ion gates opened. When the light was turned off, the gates closed. More intense light caused more calcium to enter into the cells. Further experiments then revealed that exposing these engineered immune cells to blue light in the laboratory could trigger an immune response.</p><p>The next obstacle was getting light to immune cells in a live animal. So, He, Zhang et al. used specific nanoparticles that have been shown to help transmit light deep within tissue. In these experiments, mice were injected with the light-sensitive immune cells and the nanoparticles. Then, a near-infrared laser beam that can transmit into the tissues was pointed at the mice. This caused calcium channels to open in the engineered cells deep in the mice. Finally, further experiments were used to show that this light-based stimulation could boost an immune response to aid the killing of cancer cells. Other scientists will likely use the technique to help them study immune, heart, and other types of cells that use calcium to communicate.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10024.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10024.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Optogenetics</kwd><kwd>Calcium signaling</kwd><kwd>Nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>Immune response</kwd><kwd>Near infrared</kwd><kwd>STIM1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM112003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Yubin</given-names> </name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH103133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Gang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI084167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hogan</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM110397</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hogan</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Cancer Prevention Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RR140053</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A near-infrared light-stimulable optogenetic platform enables remote and wireless manipulation of calcium signaling and immune responses both in vitro and in vivo to achieve tailored function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microbial opsin-based optogenetic technologies have been widely adopted to modulate neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fenno et al., 2011</xref>), but similar tools tailored for utilization in non-excitable tissues (<italic>e.g.</italic>, the immune and hematopoietic system) are still limited. The application of channelrhodopsin (ChR)-based optogenetic tools is limited by the lack of ion selectivity and the inability to extend the spectral sensitivity into the near-infrared (NIR) range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fenno et al., 2011</xref>). Here we present a tissue penetrable near infrared-stimulable optogenetic platform (termed 'Opto-CRAC') that can be used to reversibly photo-manipulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through one of the most Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective ion channels, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) channel, which is abundantly present in most non-excitable cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hogan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>). Our tool is based on the engineering of light sensitivity into the CRAC channel and its subsequent coupling to lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP), the latter of which act as nanotransducers to convert tissue penetrable NIR light into visible light emission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). We demonstrate that Opto-CRAC tools can be applied to remotely control Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and generate repetitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, photo-tune Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gene expression, and modulate a myriad of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activities in cells of the immune system, including effector T cell activation, macrophage-mediated inflammasome activation, dendritic cells (DC) maturation and antigen presentation. Our study set the stage for achieving the goal of remote optogenetic immunomodulation and spatiotemporal control over cellular immunotherapy in a wireless manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Following antigen presentation, T cell receptor (TCR) engagement triggers a cascade of signaling events in T lymphocytes that elicit the influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> through the CRAC channel, a classic example of store operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hogan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>). The molecular choreography of SOCE is mainly coordinated by two proteins that are located in distinct cellular compartments: (i) ORAI1, a four-pass transmembrane protein that constitutes the CRAC channel pore-forming subunit in the plasma membrane (PM); and (ii) the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), an ER-resident Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor protein that is responsible for sensing ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion and directly gating ORAI1 channels through its cytosolic domain (STIM1-CT). Store depletion induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through CRAC channels further activates calcineurin, a downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphatase that dephosphorylates the master transcriptional regulator NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and subsequently causes NFAT nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Müller and Rao, 2010</xref>). In the presence of the co-stimulatory pathway, which activates the activator protein 1 (AP-1), NFAT cooperates with AP-1 to turn on genes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, IL-2 and IFN-γ) that are characteristic of a productive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Müller and Rao, 2010</xref>). To enable light control over the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/NFAT pathway, we set out to install light sensitivity into STIM1 by fusing a handful of STIM1-CT fragments with the genetically-encoded photoswitch LOV2 (light, oxygen, voltage) domain (residues 404–546) of <italic>Avena sativa</italic> phototropin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Christie et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harper, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). When expressed alone, these STIM1-CT fragments are capable of eliciting varying degrees of constitutive activation of ORAI1 channels to mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry from the extracellular space to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhou et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soboloff et al., 2012</xref>).

Upon blue light illumination, photoexcitation generates a covalent adduct between LOV2 residue C450 and the cofactor FMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>), thereby promoting the undocking and unwinding of the Jα helix to expose the STIM1-CT fragments. Unleashed STIM1-CT fragments further move toward the plasma membrane to directly engage and activate ORAI1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10024.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>LOVSoc-mediated photoactivatable Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and nuclear translocation of NFAT in mammalian cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>), Schematic of light-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry though engineered Opto-CRAC channels. Fusion with the lightswitch LOV2 domain confers photosensitivity to the ORAI1-activating STIM1-CT fragments. In the dark, STIM1-CT fragments are kept inactive presumably by docking toward the LOV2 domain. Upon blue light illumination, the undocking and unfolding of the LOV2 C-terminal Jα helix lead to the exposure of the STIM1-CT fragments, enabling their interaction with ORAI1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx across the plasma membrane.

Residues KL or KLAAA was added between LOV2 and STIM1-CT fragments as linker. Five mutations were individually introduced into LOV2 domain. The chimera LOV2<sub>404-546</sub>-KL-STIM1<sub>336-486</sub> (designated as LOVSoc) exhibited the highest dynamic range without showing significant dark activity (judging from constitutive NFAT translocation in the dark). C450A traps the LOV2 domain in the dark state to acts as a negative control whilst I539E is known to keep LOV2 in its lit state (10). G528A, I532E and N538E have been reported to increase the dynamic range of LOV2 domain (58). However, those mutations did not seem to improve the overall performance of Opto-CRAC constructs in our hands. The previously reported LOVS1K (LOV2-STIM1<sub>233-450</sub>) (47), which is approximately 8 kDa larger than LOVSoc in size because of the inclusion of CC1 region, had a much narrower dynamic range with noticeable dark activity. The dark activity is gauged by the percentage of nuclear/total GFP-NFAT in the dark and defined as follows: “−”, no discernible activation; “+”, less than 10% activation; “++”, ≥ 10%. The dynamic range, reported by the averaged fluorescence changes (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor GCaMP6s, is categorized as: “−”, &lt;0.2; “+”, 0.2–1.0; “++”, 1.0–2.5; “+++”, &gt;2.5. The domain architecture of STIM1 was shown on the top: SP, signal peptide; EF-SAM, EF-hand motif and sterile-alpha motif; TM, transmembrane domain; CC1, predicted coiled-coil region 1; SOAR/CAD, the minimal ORAI-activating region in STIM1 or the CRAC activating domain; PS, proline/serine-rich region; K, poly-basic C-tail.

After an initial screen of approximately 100 constructs using NFAT nuclear translocation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx as readouts, we decided to use the LOV2-STIM1<sub>336-486</sub> chimera (designated as 'LOVSoc') in our following experiments because it showed no discernible dark activity and exhibited the highest dynamic range in terms of evoking light-inducible Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). When expressed as an mCherry-tagged fusion protein in HEK293-ORAI1 stable cells, LOVSoc underwent rapid translocation between the cytosol and the PM in response to blue light illumination (t<sub>1/2,on</sub> = 6.8 ± 2.3 s; t<sub>1/2,off</sub> = 28.7 ± 6.5 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). This process could be readily reversed by switching the light off, and could be repeated multiple times without significant loss in the magnitude of response. The light-dependent association between LOVSoc and ORAI1 or ORAI1 C-terminus (ORAI1-CT) was further confirmed by a pulldown assay using purified recombinant proteins and by coimmunoprecipitation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In mammalian cells expressing LOVSoc, the degree of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx could be tuned by varying the light power densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>). After photostimulation for 1 min with a power density of 40 μW/mm<sup>2</sup> at 470 nm, LOVSoc triggered significant yet varied elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations to approximately 500–800 nM in a dozen of mammalian cell types derived from various non-excitable tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>), likely owing to the varied endogenous levels of ORAI proteins among the tested cells. A Light-triggered global Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and oscillations in HeLa or HEK293T cells expressing mCherry-LOVSoc could be monitored in real-time by either Fura-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3c</xref>) or genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs), including GCaMP6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Videos 2,3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), R-CaMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3d</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Inoue et al., 2015</xref>), and R-GECO1.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3e</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, localized light stimulation can be applied to achieve local activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at a defined spatial resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>), thereby providing a new approach to dissect the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains in various biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parekh, 2008</xref>). Depending on the kinetic properties of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators used, the half-life time of the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise in response to light stimulation ranged from 23 s to 36 s. After switching off the light, the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal decayed with a half-life time of approximately 25–35 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3f</xref>). These values are largely in agreement with the time scale of SOCE under physiological stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hogan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soboloff et al., 2012</xref>). We further measured the photo-activated currents by whole-cell recording in HEK293 cells stably expressing ORAI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).

Substitution of the most abundant extracellular cation Na<sup>+</sup> by a non-permeant ion NMDG<sup>+</sup> did not alter the amplitude or overall shape of the CRAC current, implying that Na<sup>+</sup> has negligible contribution to LOVSoc- mediated photoactivatable Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective CRAC currents.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-10024-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10024.010</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Light-triggered reversible cytosol-to-PM translocation of mCh-LOVSoc.</title><p>Three dark-light cycles were applied to HEK293-ORAI1 stable cells transfected with the Opto-CRAC construct mCh-LOVSoc.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10024.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10024.010</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-10024-media2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10024.011</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Time-lapse imaging of light-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx reported by cytosolic (left) or PM-tethered GCaMP6s.</title><p>HeLa cells expressing mCh-LOVSoc was exposed to a 488-nm confocal laser.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10024.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10024.011</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-10024-media3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10024.012</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Light-inducible Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx monitored with TIRF microscopy in HeLa cells coexpressing GCaMP6s-CAAX and mCh-LOVSoc.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10024.012">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10024.012</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-10024-media4.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10024.013</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Sequential and localized activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx with defined spatial resolution.</title><p>Imaging was performed on HeLa cells cotranfected with mCh-LOVSoc and GCaMP6s-CAAX.

We used either an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-based bicistronic vector or a self-cleaving 2A peptide strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Felipe et al., 2006</xref>) to enable the coexpression of ORAI1 and LOVSoc in the same cell with a single vector. Compared to LOVSoc alone, both co-expression systems resulted in ~1.4-fold increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5a</xref>). Tethering LOVSoc to the plasma membrane (PM) with an N-terminal PM-targeting sequence derived from the Src kinase Lyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>) (Lyn11-LOVSoc) expedited the photoactivation process by 3.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5b</xref>), presumably owing to its increased local concentration and much closer proximity to the ORAI1 channels. By contrast, a concatemeric form of LOVSoc with two copies covalently connected in a single polypeptide or its fusion to ORAI1 substantially slowed down photoactivatable Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5c</xref>). Collectively, we have created a set of Opto-CRAC constructs that meet the varying needs on sensitivity and photoactivation kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5d,e</xref>).</p><p>We next asked if we could manipulate the light pulse to generate diverse temporal patterns of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to tune the degree of NFAT activation, which would be reflected in the efficiency of NFAT nuclear translocation and NFAT-dependent luciferase expression. We applied a fixed light pulse of 30 s while varying the interpulse intervals from 0.5 to 4 min to generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation patterns with defined temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>) and compared the levels of NFAT activation in HeLa cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref> prolonged interpulse interval was largely accompanied by a decrease in the nuclear accumulation of NFAT. This observation agrees well with previous reports showing that higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation frequencies, or faster repetitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulses, tend to increase the ability to activate NFAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lewis et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, we have demonstrated that the engineered Opto-CRAC tools are able to achieve remote and photo-tunable activation of NFAT in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). We further confirmed the NFAT-dependent gene expression in HeLa cells transfected with an NFAT-driven luciferase (NFAT-Luc) reporter construct. In the presence of the co-stimulatory pathway (mimicked by the addition of the pleiotropic PKC activator PMA), light illumination led to a robust increase in luciferase gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). A decrease in the light pulse frequency also caused a reduction in the efficiency of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/NFAT-driven luciferase expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).

In HeLa cells expressing mCh-ORAI1-StrepTag, we detected remarkable local accumulation of UCNPs-Stv on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), confirming the cell-specific targeting of functionalized nanoparticles. To examine whether UCNPs-transduced blue light is sufficient to trigger the opening of Opto-CRAC channels, we monitored cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes using GCaMP6s in HeLa cells co-expressing LOVSoc, mCh-ORAI1-StrepTag and GCaMP6s following NIR light stimulation (980 nm). Within 20 s, transfected HeLa cells exhibited a significant increase in GCaMP6s fluorescence, indicating a rapid rise in the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that was evoked by NIR light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). This was further confirmed by using a red-emitting Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator R-GECO1.2, which enabled recording of reversible Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuation cycles and circumvented the complications associated with potential direct activation of LOVSoc by the green light source used to excite GCaMP6 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). This increase was found to be caused by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through NIR-to-blue activated Opto-CRAC channels because cells incubated with the control NIR-to-green UCNPs (β-NaYF<sub>4</sub>: Yb, 2% Er @ β-NaYF<sub>4</sub>; emission maxima at 510 nm) did not show discernible changes in the GCaMP6s signal upon stimulation with the same NIR light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then employed NIR light to remotely activate the downstream effector NFAT at the cellular level, and observed NFAT nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), as well as NFAT-dependent IFN-γ production in CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Next, we sought to demonstrate the potential application of NIR-triggered activation of the Opto-CRAC system in vivo. We performed a proof-of-principle experiment by implanting NFAT-Luc/LOVSoc expressing HeLa cells pre-incubated with UCNPs-Stv subcutaneously in the flanks of mice. The implanted site was irradiated by a 980-nm CW laser outside the body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>) without noticeable heat production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a,b</xref>) or severe damage to local tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3c</xref>). Luciferase-catalyzed bioluminescence was readily detected after NIR irradiation, whereas no discernible background activation was observed in the negative controls where LOVSoc expression and/or NIR light were absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>).</p><p>To explore the application of the NIR Opto-CRAC system in a more disease-relevant context, we set out to combine the use of our optogenetic system with DC-mediated immunotherapy in the B16-OVA mouse model of melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Briles and Kornfeld, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fidler, 1975</xref>), in which ovalbumin (OVA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Falo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mayordomo et al., 1995</xref>) is used as a surrogate tumor antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Dendritic cells, which provide the essential link between the innate and adaptive immune responses, are adept at capturing tumor antigens and cross-presenting these antigens to T cells in tumor draining lymph nodes (dLNs), thereby sensitizing and generating tumor-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) to cause tumor regression or rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palucka and Banchereau, 2012</xref>). One of the major challenges of DC vaccination-based immunotherapy is how to efficiently maintain the maturational status of DCs. Pharmacological agents (<italic>e.g</italic>., ionomycin) or signaling pathways controlling intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization have been reported to facilitate immature dendritic cell maturation through up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 or CD86, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II, as well as the chemokine receptor CCR7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Félix et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matzner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hsu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czerniecki, 1997</xref>). We hypothesize that photoactivatable Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in DCs will lead to similar phenotypic changes to expedite and sustain DC maturation and promote antigen presentation, thereby maximally sensitizing T lymphocytes toward tumor antigens to boost anti-tumor immune response. To quickly test this in vitro, we transduced bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) with retroviruses encoding both LOVSoc and ORAI1<sup>StrepTag</sup> (termed 'Opto-CRAC DCs'), pulsed cells with a mixture of OVAp (<sub>257</sub>SIINFEKL<sub>264</sub>) and UCNPs-Stv nanoparticles. NIR light stimulation resulted in approximately 2–8 fold increase in the surface expression of MHC-I/II, CD86, and CCR7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), which are characteristic of matured DCs that are capable of homing to dLNs to interact with T cells to modulate adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palucka and Banchereau, 2012</xref>).

We next adoptively transferred CFSE-abled, OVA-specific OT-I CD8 T cells into the B16-OVA mice and examined their in vivo activation and phenotypic profiles following photoactivatable DC maturation. Compared to the control group shielded from NIR, the proliferation of CD8 T cells was substantially up-regulated after light stimulation, by judging from decreased CFSE staining due to proliferative dilution and increased population of OT-1 CD8T cells in tumor draining LNs and spleens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). To assess the functional consequence of immunosensitization of tumor cells toward Opto-CRAC DC-activated immune response, we monitored the tumor growth in mouse melanoma models generated by either subcutaneous or <italic>i.v.</italic> injection of B16-OVA melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). NIR light stimulation significantly suppressed the tumor growth with diminished tumor volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>) or reduced numbers of tumor foci in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Both our ex vivo and in vivo data converge to support the conclusion that NIR-stimulable Opto-CRAC DC can robustly enhance tumor cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated killing, thereby improving antigen-specific immune responses to selectively destruct tumor cells. By acting as a genetically-encoded 'photoactivatable adjuvant', the Opto-CRAC system may hold high potential for its future use in cancer immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we described an NIR-stimulable optogenetic platform based on engineered CRAC channels and lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles. Depending on the pulse and intensity of light input, the photosensitive module, LOVSoc, can reversibly generate both sustained and oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. The magnitude and kinetics of photo-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx largely mimic the physiological responses following engagement of immunoreceptors or ligand binding to its cognate membrane receptors that leads to store depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>). Ectopic expression of a single component of LOVSoc at endogenous levels of ORAI is sufficient to elicit strong intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in a dozen of cell types derived from a wide range of human or rodent tissues. Most critically, light-generated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals can further lead to hallmark physiological responses in cells of the immune system. The sensitivity and photoactivation kinetics of this system can be further tuned by tethering LOVSoc to PM or through co-expression and fusion with ORAI1. When paired with deep tissue-penetrant and NIR-stimulable UCNPs, we have successfully demonstrated the potential application of our Opto-CRAC system to drive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gene expression and to photo-modulate immune response both in vivo and ex vivo. Compared to other existing optical tools, our Opto-CRAC system that has several distinctive features: First, complementary to the existing ChR-based tools that exhibit less stringent ion selectivity and tend to perturb intracellular pH due to high proton permeability, our Opto-CRAC system is engineered from a bona fide Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel that is regarded as one of the most Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective ion channels. Although the unitary conductance of CRAC channel is estimated to be low (&lt;10 fS in 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in T cells; compared to 4–10 pS for voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zweifach and Lewis, 1993</xref>), sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (up to minutes) through native ORAI1 channels is sufficient to activate downstream effectors. The high Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity (P<sub>Ca</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub>: &gt;1000) and its small unitary conductance is speculated to reduce the energy requirement of pumping out Na<sup>+</sup> during sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, thereby enhancing the specificity of downstream effector function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>). Second, the Opto-CRAC tool has a relatively small size (&lt;900 bp, compared to &gt;2.2 kb of ChR) and is thus compatible with almost all existing viral vectors used for in vivo gene delivery. Indeed, we have successfully used retroviral and lentiviral expression systems to deliver Opto-CRAC into primary T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Its potential delivery into excitable tissues (<italic>e.g.</italic>, muscle, heart and brain) using adeno-associated viruses remains to be tested in follow-on studies. Third, the tunable and relatively slow kinetics make it most suitable for interrogating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-modulated functions in non-excitable cell types, such as cells in the endocrine, immune and hematopoietic system. We find that our system may find broad use in adoptive cell transfer experiments or adoptive immunotherapies, which are widely used in both basic research and the clinic settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palucka and Banchereau, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Restifo et al., 2012</xref>). Fourth, in conjunction with upconversion nano-transducers, the light harvesting window can be shifted to the NIR region where deep tissue penetration and remote stimulation are feasible. Results from our in vivo studies clearly indicate that the Opto-CRAC channel and its downstream effectors can be remotely activated using NIR light, thereby paving the way for its future applications in more (patho)physiologically-relevant mouse models, or ultimately, in cancer immunotherapies with improved spatiotemporal control over engineered therapeutic T cells or DCs to reduce off-tumor cross-reaction and mitigate toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>). Given the spatial and temporal accuracy of NIR light, it is also possible to use guided NIR light to confine localized blue light generation, thus avoiding the photoactivation of off-target regions. Lastly, but critically, the lanthanide-doped UCNPs can be applied to activate other optogenetic tools that are dependent on blue light-absorbing cofactors (<italic>e.g.</italic>, ChR2 and CRY2). We anticipate that the flexible adaptability of our novel approach will lead to new opportunities to fine-tune Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent immune responses and interrogate other light-controllable cellular processes while minimally interfering with the host’s physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals and antibodies</title><p>Fura-2 AM calcium indicator was purchased form Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA).

All the cells were grown at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Cultured cells were seeded on 35-mm glass bottom dishes and an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti-E microscope customized with Nikon A1R+ confocal laser sources (405/488/561/640 nm) was used for confocal imaging. The same microscope body connected to a Ti-TIRF E motorized illuminator unit (488 nm/20 mW and 561 nm/20 mW lasers) with a 60×, NA 1.49 oil-immersion TIRF objective was used for TIRF imaging. 100-nm fluorescent beads (TetraSpeck microspheres, Life Technologies) were deposited onto a coverslip and imaged as markers for later alignment.</p><p>To monitor mCh-LOVSoc translocation from the cytosol to PM, 50–100 ng pTriEx-mCherry-LOVSoc was transfected to HEK293-ORAI1 stable cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies).

Light power density was measured by using an optical power meter from ThorLabs.

Twenty-four hours after transfection, a 488-nm laser was used to excite GFP, and a 561-nm laser to excite mCherry at intervals of 1–5 s. The mCherry-positive cells were selected for statistical analysis. Since the excitation wavelength used to acquire the GCaMP6s signals (488 nm) partially overlaps with the photo-activating wavelength of LOVSoc, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was elicited when the 488-nm laser source was turned on, and thus GCaMP6s could only be used to monitor the ON phase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. For localized photostimulation, we took advantage of the NIKON component designed for fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to stimulate selected areas (designated as pre-activated areas as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>) but only used 1–5% input of the 488-nm laser for 5–10 s.

The 561-nm laser source as used to excite red emission with blue light stimulation imposed as described above.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Near-infrared photoactivatable control of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Richard Aldrich, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another is Murali Prakriya.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>He et al. integrated several techniques to a create photoactivatable system called &quot;Opto-CRAC&quot; that controls Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into cells through CRAC channels. The high Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity of CRAC channels is a clear advantage over the current non-selective channelrodopsin-based optogenetic systems and the authors use this as a central justification for developing methods that would directly elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx instead of relying on membrane depolarization (in the channelrodopsin-based optogenetic systems) to activate endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The study develops a protein construct with LOV2 (a photoswitch that responds to blue-light) fused to a STIM1 C-terminal fragment. Using a HEK293 cell line that stably expresses Orai1 transfected with their chimeric construct, they demonstrate tight control of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx using blue light. They also showed that NFAT-translocation, which is a downstream effect of CRAC channel activation, correlates with the frequency of the blue light-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulses. In addition, the study pairs the opto construct with lanthanide-doped up conversion nanoparticles (UCNP) that absorb in the near-infrared wavelengths and emit blue light. This allowed control Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and NFAT-translocation in cells using near-infrared light, which is necessary in developing a system that can penetrate tissues in an in vivo system. Finally, as a proof-of-concept experiment, HeLa cells expressing the Opto-CRAC system are grafted subcutaneously into the flanks of mice and the manuscript demonstrates changes in NFAT-luciferase expression using near-infrared light in these cells under the skin. A light activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel could be tremendously useful for applications ranging from studies of basic biology of CRAC channels, local activation of CRAC channels in microdomains within cells, and in vivo interrogation of immune and other cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While there is considerable enthusiasm for the successful development of Opto-CRAC as a tool, particularly for use in non-excitable cells, the reviewers feel that there remains much to be done to eliminate current problems that make it unfeasible. While we recognize that this is essentially a proof of concept paper for a new technique, we feel that the following issues must be adequately addressed if the paper is to be accepted for publication.</p><p>1) In the current form, the system's limitations are substantial, even at this proof-of-concept stage. Optogenetic stimulation offers two key advantages: the requirement for a single protein and rapid kinetics. On the other hand, channelrhodopsin use is somewhat constrained by the need for blue light, which necessitates optical fiber implantation and hinders concurrent functional imaging, by its rapid inactivation, and by its limited single channel conductance. While Opto-CRAC offers significant advantages in being more calcium selective than channelrhodopsin based methods, It functions on the order of seconds to minutes, far slower than channelrhodopsin, limiting its usefulness to slower signaling processes, like many of those occurring in non-excitable cells. Although only a single protein is required for visible light stimulation, the resulting conductances are low, as judged by dynamic ranges of the employed genetically-encoded calcium indicators. In fact, it seems that the conductances are smaller than those produced by channelrhodopsin despite much longer stimulus duration. This may be due to the reliance on native ORAI channels – unlike many existing stimulation methods, where the heterologous activator is in excess, endogenous channels limit maximal conductance and make that conductance highly cell type-dependent. Moreover, induction of gene expression is predicated on concurrent treatment of cells with phorbol ester, a potent carcinogen. For these reasons, Opto-CRAC is far from being useful in animal studies.</p><p>2) However, the authors promote Opto-CRAC as a non-invasive NIR deep tissue cellular stimulator of non-excitable cells. Their assertion that no tools exist for this purpose is inaccurate, since multiple visible light-independent methods, including DREADDs, have proven quite effective outside the brain. For NIR use in culture, the authors assemble a far more elaborate system than described for visible light, consisting of engineered STIM and ORAI proteins, streptavidin-coated UCNP beads and PMA (for gene induction). For in vivo use, they implant cells expressing the encoded components that have been pre-treated with beads subcutaneously, hardly a non-invasive procedure.</p><p>3) Critically, the properties of this four-part (and not genetic) NIR system are inadequately described: NIR-dependent calcium entry is shown (as a function of GCaMP fluorescence), but not measured; NFAT translocation to the nucleus is demonstrated, but no gene expression data is provided.</p><p>4) How does one reconcile the complexity and limited sensitivity of Opto-CRAC, including the requirement for UNCP beads, with its intended application to modulate calcium in cells of the immune and hematopoietic systems? Are stem cells propagated and pre-treated ex vivo to be injected into the bone marrow or thymus? Will NIR, which elevated reporter expression in subcutaneous cells, have any impact on those tissues? No feasibility testing is described.</p><p>5) The one area where UNCPs might have a real impact as NIR light transducers is for activating channelrhodopsin (in fact, the inability of ChR to be gated by long-wave light is given as an explicit motivation for UNCP development). Injected locally and recruited to genetically targeted cells that express channelrhodopsin, UNCP could enable NIR ChR gating. Surprisingly, this potentially exciting application is not explored.</p><p>6) Is the relatively slow time scale due to properties of ORAI channels, rather than a limitation of the light induction by STIM1-LOV? If so, the comparison to channelrhodopsin should probably be tempered. At least some discussion, and perhaps some experiments should be included as to which protein is limiting (both in terms of maximal conductance and kinetics).</p><p>7) STIM1 has other targets besides Orai1 channels including other Orai isoforms, voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (which it inhibits), and even TRP channels. How the optically responsive STIM1 (LOVSoc) fits into this larger framework of potential targets is unclear. Since other channels may be engaged by STIMs, the authors should examine calcium selectivity by testing for other ions in cells that have additional endogenous channels, as opposed to using fibroblasts stably expressing ORAIs.</p><p>8) The vector size appears small enough for viral gene delivery, but it is unclear how UCNPs can be delivered. In addition, if the UCNPs binds to off-targets, that could wreak havoc with the high-energy blue light in the body.</p><p>9) Regarding the UNCPs: the conversion here is from low energy to high, which could be highly inefficient. Energies of excitation and emission at different wavelengths should be included.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10024.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>While there is considerable enthusiasm for the successful development of Opto-CRAC as a tool, particularly for use in non-excitable cells, the reviewers feel that there remains much to be done to eliminate current problems that make it unfeasible.

Nonetheless, we would like to stress that while ChR2 is most useful in neuroscience with respect to the control of neuronal excitability, our study aims to expand the repertoire of optogenetic tools, with the goal of photo-manipulating cellular events that occur at a relatively slower time scale (seconds to minutes). Here we primarily focus on cells of the immune system to present and advocate the concept of optogenetic immunomodulation. We have demonstrated the significance and wide adaptivity of our tool for different cellular systems. In a dozen of non-excitable cell types that we have tested thus far, the expression of LOVSoc alone was clearly sufficient to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at endogenous levels of ORAI1 and caused cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation of up to 500-800 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The magnitude and relatively slow kinetics of photoactivated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx largely mimic the physiological events upon engagement of immunoreceptors (as reviewed Prakriya and Lewis, 2015). Although the unitary conductance of CRAC channel is known to be extremely low (~9 fS in 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> or 24 fS in isotonic Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution in T cells; compared to 4-10 pS for voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels; Prakriya and Lewis 2015), the sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (up to minutes) through native ORAI1 channels is sufficient to trigger downstream effectors. The small unitary conductance of the CRAC channel, coupled with its high Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity (with a Ca<sup>2+</sup>: Na<sup>+</sup> permeation ratio of over 1000; among the most selective Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels known), is speculated to limit membrane depolarization, thereby reducing the energy requirement to pump out Na<sup>+</sup> during sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and enhancing the specificity of downstream effector function (Prakriya and Lewis 2015). The physiological hallmarks of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/NFAT pathway can be fully recapitulated by our Opto-CRAC system.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have demonstrated the application of Opto-CRAC to i) photo-induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gene expression, including luciferase and insulin production driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent transcriptional factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>); ii) photo-trigger T cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); iii) photo-amplify inflammasome response mediated by macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>); and iv)photo-stimulate antigen presentation by dendritic cells to boost cytotoxic T cell activities both ex vivo and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>We respectfully disagree with the comment that the system is far from being useful in animal studies. For in vivo application, we find that our system is most compatible with adoptive cell transfer experiments or therapies, which are widely used during immunotherapies in both basic research and the clinic settings. As exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, by boosting DC-mediated antigen presentation and subsequent activation of cytotoxic T cells, we have successfully used our NIR Opto-CRAC system to photo-tune anti-tumor response in a mouse model of melanoma to suppress tumor growth.</p><p><italic>Moreover, induction of gene expression is predicated on concurrent treatment of cells with phorbol ester, a potent carcinogen. For these reasons, Opto-CRAC is far from being useful in animal studies.</italic> </p><p>T cell activation requires the CD28 co-stimulatory receptor to activate AP-1 in order to cooperate with NFAT and drive a productive immune response. Please note that we only used phorbol ester to mimic the co-stimulation pathway, in vitro, for the purpose of a simpler and convenient experimental setup, but it is not a must. For example, phorbol ester can be readily replaced by anti-CD28 antibody to trigger co-stimulatory signals. In addition, to drive light-inducible Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gene expression, we can circumvent the use of phorbol ester by fusing target genes (e.g., insulin) downstream of multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup>-response elements (Stanley et al., 2012), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Moreover, in the revised manuscript, rather than repeating similar experiments in T cells, we focused on other types of immune cells that obviate the need for co-stimulatory pathways. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>, light-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in macrophages and dendritic cells, without the use of phorbol ester, is sufficient to induce the downstream events to amplify inflammatory response or to promote DC antigen presentation.</p><p><italic>2) However, the authors promote Opto-CRAC as a non-invasive NIR deep tissue cellular stimulator of non-excitable cells. Their assertion that no tools exist for this purpose is inaccurate, since multiple visible light-independent methods, including DREADDs, have proven quite effective outside the brain.</italic> </p><p>After further studies about this point, we have followed the reviewers’ suggestion and toned down our claim about the non-existence of such tools.</p><p><italic>For NIR use in culture, the authors assemble a far more elaborate system than described for visible light, consisting of engineered STIM and ORAI proteins, streptavidin-coated UCNP beads and PMA (for gene induction). For in vivo use, they implant cells expressing the encoded components that have been pre-treated with beads subcutaneously, hardly a non-invasive procedure.</italic> </p><p>The complexity of the NIR system has been substantially reduced by adopting the following strategies in the revised manuscript:i) a bicistronic IRES (internal ribosomal entry site) vector co-expressing engineered ORAI1 and LOVSoc, which is routinely used in the transduction of cells of the immune system and in adoptive immunotherapies; or ii) the protein co-expression system based on a self-cleaved 2A peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, the system now requires only a single plasmid construct, in addition to functionalized UCNPs.</p><p>For in vivo application, we find that our system is most compatible with adoptive cell transfer experiments or adoptive immunotherapies, which are widely used in both basic research and the clinic settings. We acknowledge that, like any adoptive cell therapy, our system also requires ex vivo expansion of engineered immune cells, preincubation with UCNPs, as well as re-injection into the bodies (as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In order to mitigate the reviewers’ concern, we have removed the word “non-invasive” throughout the text.</p><p><italic>3) Critically, the properties of this four-part (and not genetic) NIR system are inadequately described: NIR-dependent calcium entry is shown (as a function of GCaMP fluorescence), but not measured; NFAT translocation to the nucleus is demonstrated, but no gene expression data is provided.</italic> </p><p>The NIR-dependent calcium response curve was not shown in the original paper for GCaMP6 due to the spectroscopic conflicts between NIR-excited emission (centered around 470 nm) and GFP excitation laser source (488 nm), the latter of which is required to record GCaMP6 signals. We have to use very low light input (&lt;1 μW/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2</xref></sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>) to avoid direct activation of LOVSoc by the GFP-channel laser, so that we can ascribe the contribution solely to NIR-to-blue light stimulation. In the revised manuscript, we presented the NIR-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response curve by using R-GECO1.2 as readout to circumvent this complication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In addition, as suggested by the reviewers, we have included NIR-inducible gene expression data by using IFN-γ production in sorted primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as a physiologically-relevant example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) How does one reconcile the complexity and limited sensitivity of Opto-CRAC, including the requirement for UNCP beads, with its intended application to modulate calcium in cells of the immune and hematopoietic systems? Are stem cells propagated and pre-treated ex vivo to be injected into the bone marrow or thymus? Will NIR, which elevated reporter expression in subcutaneous cells, have any impact on those tissues? No feasibility testing is described.</italic> </p><p>Please refer to our response to Comments 1 and 2 with regard to our efforts to reduce this complexity. As pointed out in our response to Comment 2, the images presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>(original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) have a relatively low resolution/intensity because they have to be acquired under quite low laser input (&lt; 1 μW/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2</xref></sup>) in order to avoid direct activation of LOVSoc by GFP excitation (~488 nm), the latter of which is required to record signals from GCaMP6 or GFP-NFAT. We now use the red-emitting R-GECO1.2 fluorescence as readout so as to avoid such complication. The consequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals generated by our blue and NIR light are at comparable levels (Figure 3Evs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Please note that the Y-axis of GCaMP6 or R-GECO1.2 response has been shown as the ratio (not percentage) of ΔF over F<sub>0</sub> (the value of 1 means 100% change in the GCaMP6s signals; or the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal change was doubled).</p><p>Most importantly, we have demonstrated NIR-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent physiological responses both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), which clearly attests to the high feasibility and compatibility of our system with animal studies. We have carried out two proof-of-concept experiments to demonstrate the in vivo application of our system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). The elevated expression of the reporter gene luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) in subcutaneous cells did not induce tissue damages (as indicated by histological sections of the positions after 14 days of ectopic injection in mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>), nor did NIR light generate a significant local heating effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>As pointed out by the reviewers, our system is most compatible with adoptive cell therapies (such as adoptive T cell or DC vaccine-based immunotherapy), which have been gaining wide popularity in the treatment of cancer. Although the proposed experiment (bone marrow transplant) by the reviewers is quite attractive, it would take at least 4-6 months to establish the system and get the related animal protocols approved by IACUC committees. Given the limited 2-month window for revision, we performed a similar proof-of-concept experiment using engineered dendritic cells to boost CTL-mediated anti-tumor response in mouse melanoma models (via subcutaneous implantation or <italic>i.v.</italic> injection), which can be conveniently generated within 2-3 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Results from our in vivo studies clearly indicate that the Opto-CRAC channel and its downstream effectors can be remotely activated using NIR light, thereby paving the way for its future applications in more (patho) physiologically-relevant mouse models, or ultimately, in cancer immunotherapies with improved spatiotemporal control over engineered therapeutic T cells or DCs to reduce the likelihood of off-tumor cross-reaction and to mitigate toxicity as well.</p><p><italic>5) The one area where UNCPs might have a real impact as NIR light transducers is for activating channelrhodopsin (in fact, the inability of ChR to be gated by long-wave light is given as an explicit motivation for UNCP development). Injected locally and recruited to genetically targeted cells that express channelrhodopsin, UNCP could enable NIR ChR gating. Surprisingly, this potentially exciting application is not explored.</italic> </p><p>Because the main focus of this manuscript is on the Opto-CRAC system and its use in optogenetic immunomodulation, we hope that the editors and reviewers will agree with us that the use of UCNPs paired with ChR is beyond the scope of the current study. Nevertheless, we will extend a similar strategy to revamp ChR-based optogenetic tools in our near future work.</p><p><italic>6) Is the relatively slow time scale due to properties of ORAI channels, rather than a limitation of the light induction by STIM1-LOV? If so, the comparison to channelrhodopsin should probably be tempered. At least some discussion, and perhaps some experiments should be included as to which protein is limiting (both in terms of maximal conductance and kinetics).</italic> </p><p>The relatively slow time scale is due to properties inherent to the ORAI1 channels (Hogan, Lewis and Rao, 2010; Prakriya and Lewis, 2015). Hence, as per the reviewers’ suggestion, we have tempered the comparison to channelrhodopsin in our revised manuscript. Still, we would emphasize that our system is a new and complementary addition to the existing optogenetic toolkits.</p><p><italic>7) STIM1 has other targets besides Orai1 channels including other Orai isoforms, voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (which it inhibits), and even TRP channels. How the optically responsive STIM1 (LOVSoc) fits into this larger framework of potential targets is unclear. Since other channels may be engaged by STIMs, the authors should examine calcium selectivity by testing for other ions in cells that have additional endogenous channels, as opposed to using fibroblasts stably expressing ORAIs.</italic> </p><p>We measured the light-induced current by whole-cell recording in HEK293-ORAI1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The I-V curve of LOVSoc-expressing cells exhibited a typical inward rectifying current (distinct from the large outward cationic currents of TRP channels), which is characteristic of the CRAC channel. In addition, replacing the most abundant extracellular ion, Na<sup>+</sup>, with a non-permeant ion NMDG<sup>+</sup> did not significantly alter the amplitude and overall shape of the CRAC current, implying that Na<sup>+</sup> has negligible contribution to LOVSoc-mediated photo-inducible CRAC current in our system. Voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are not a concern in our system, as they are barely expressed in cells of the immune system or most of other non-excitable tissues, and we did not detect any voltage activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents during our whole-cell recording.</p><p><italic>8) The vector size appears small enough for viral gene delivery, but it is unclear how UCNPs can be delivered. In addition, if the UCNPs binds to off-targets, that could wreak havoc with the high-energy blue light in the body.</italic> </p><p>The current application is, but not restricted to, ex vivo treatment and adoptive cell transfer back to the body for therapeutic or interventional purposes. The UCNPs loaded cells are consequently introduced by i.v. or subcutaneous injection. In the long term, the targeted delivery of UCNPs can be achieved by elegant nanoparticle surface modification with targeting moieties (Anal. Chem. 2009, 81, 8687; ACS Nano 2011, 5, 3744; or Chem. Commun. 2006, 28, 2557). Furthermore, owing to the spatial and temporal accuracy of NIR light activation, one can always use guided NIR light to confine localized blue light generation. In this way, the photoactivation of off-target regions can be minimized. Moreover, compared to channelrhodopsin, which routinely requires a power intensity of &gt;0.5-1 mW/mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2</xref></sup> in order to obtain a steady-state response, our Opto-CRAC system only requires 0.04 mW/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2</xref></sup> blue light to elicit calcium influx and downstream effects. Thus, the potential toxicity caused by blue light is minimized.</p><p><italic>9) Regarding the UNCPs: the conversion here is from low energy to high, which could be highly inefficient. Energies of excitation and emission at different wavelengths should be included.</italic> </p><p>In accordance with the reviewers’ suggestion, we have quantified the upconversion quantum efficiency by following our previous method (ACS Nano 2014, 10621-10630). The upconversion quantum efficiency (QE) can be utilized to precisely measure the upconversion ability of the characterized materials. This is defined as a fraction of the absorbed photons that successfully employed to generate upconversion emission. A detailed description of QE calculation using our previous protocol was added to the Methods section. The upconversion QE of UCNPs used in the current study within the blue region was determined to be 2.7%.</p></body></sub-article></article>
