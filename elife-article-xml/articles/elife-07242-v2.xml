This hyperactivity is caused, at least in part, by decreased Kv7.2/3 (KCNQ2/3) potassium currents. However, the biophysical mechanisms underlying resilience to tinnitus, which is observed in noise-exposed mice that do not develop tinnitus (non-tinnitus mice), remain unknown. Our results show that noise exposure induces, on average, a reduction in KCNQ2/3 channel activity in fusiform cells in noise-exposed mice by 4 days after exposure. Tinnitus is developed in mice that do not compensate for this reduction within the next 3 days. Resilience to tinnitus is developed in mice that show a re-emergence of KCNQ2/3 channel activity and a reduction in HCN channel activity. Our results highlight KCNQ2/3 and HCN channels as potential targets for designing novel therapeutics that may promote resilience to tinnitus.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07242.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07242.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07242.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tinnitus is often described as ‘ringing in the ears’. Though the phantom sounds, which are heard in the absence of any genuine external noise, can take a variety of forms including buzzing, whistling, or humming. While training the brain to pay less attention to these internally generated sounds can sometimes reduce the impact of tinnitus, many people find that the disorder reduces their quality of life significantly.</p><p>One of the main causes of tinnitus is prolonged or repeated exposure to excessive noise. However, not everyone with such exposure develops tinnitus. Certain individuals appear to show a natural resilience. Identifying the basis of this resilience could make it possible to develop drugs that enhance these mechanisms, and thereby extend this protection to those who would otherwise be at risk of tinnitus.</p><p>Li et al. have brought this a step closer by studying tinnitus resilience mechanisms in mice. Previous work by the same group revealed that in mice with tinnitus a group of neurons in the brainstem called ‘fusiform cells’ are overly active. These cells receive direct input from the ear, and their hyperactivity is largely due to ion channels called KCNQ2/3 channels being less active. These channels allow for potassium ions to flow across the membrane and thereby control the activity of fusiform cells.</p><p>Li et al. now show that exposure to excessive noise causes a reduction in KCNQ2/3 activity in the exposed mice. However, in animals that successfully avoid developing tinnitus, KCNQ2/3 activity spontaneously recovers over the course of a few days. This recovery triggers a reduction in the activity of another type of ion channel, known as the HCN channel. The combined flexibility of KCNQ and HCN channels prevents tinnitus-associated hyperactivity in the fusiform cells.</p><p>Drugs that increase activity of KCNQ2/3 channels, and/or reduce activity of HCN channels, could thus boost resilience to tinnitus. In the future, targeting both channel types at the same time could provide an effective treatment with minimal side effects.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07242.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07242.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>potassium channel</kwd><kwd>HCN channels</kwd><kwd>tinnitus</kwd><kwd>homeostatic plasticity</kwd><kwd>hyperexcitability-related disorders</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PR093405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tzounopoulos</surname><given-names>Thanos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-14-1-0117</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tzounopoulos</surname><given-names>Thanos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC–DC007905</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tzounopoulos</surname><given-names>Thanos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mice that successfully avoid developing tinnitus despite exposure to excessive noise show spontaneous recovery of KCNQ2/3 potassium channel activity associated with a reduction in HCN channel activity in auditory brainstem neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of acoustic stimulus, is frequently caused by exposure to loud sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shargorodsky et al., 2010</xref>) and can be detrimental to the quality of life for millions of tinnitus sufferers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shargorodsky et al., 2010</xref>). Although the development of tinnitus is strongly correlated with acoustic trauma and noise-induced hearing loss, the absence of tinnitus after exposure to loud sounds—resilience to tinnitus—has been observed in a significant percentage of the population both in humans and in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yankaskas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Many studies have investigated the plasticity mechanisms underlying susceptibility to tinnitus; however, much less is known about the resilience mechanisms. Elucidating the resilience mechanisms could be vital for both developing pharmacological interventions to prevent and treat tinnitus, and understanding the mechanisms that differentiate pathogenic plasticity that leads to tinnitus from homeostatic plasticity that prevents the induction of tinnitus.</p><p>Here, we studied the resilience mechanisms in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), an auditory brainstem nucleus. Ablation of the DCN 3–5 months after the acoustic trauma did not affect the psychophysical evidence of tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brozoski and Bauer, 2005</xref>). However, when bilateral DCN lesion occurred prior to noise exposure, it prevented the induction of tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brozoski et al., 2012</xref>). These results suggest that although DCN is not essential for the maintenance of tinnitus, it is indispensable for the induction of tinnitus.</p><p>One of the major neural correlates for tinnitus induction is increased spontaneous firing rates in DCN fusiform cell, termed hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang and Kaltenbach, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brozoski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Whereas a persistent change in neuronal firing properties in other auditory centers such as the ventral cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus, auditory thalamus or auditory cortex may be important for tinnitus maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eggermont and Roberts, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vogler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalappa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ropp et al., 2014</xref>), transient increases in DCN neuronal spontaneous firing rates appear crucial for tinnitus induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ropp et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>After exposure to tinnitus-inducing sounds, key physiological properties of DCN fusiform cells are different between noise-exposed animals that develop tinnitus (tinnitus animals) and animals that do not develop tinnitus (non-tinnitus animals). Namely, although all noise-exposed animals show similar shifts in their hearing thresholds, only a portion of them display DCN hyperactivity and develop tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Longenecker and Galazyuk, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koehler and Shore, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Longenecker et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, fusiform cell hyperactivity in tinnitus mice is associated with reduced KCNQ2/3 currents at hyperpolarized membrane potentials, due to a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of KCNQ2/3 channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). This reduction, along with decreased synaptic inhibition and increased synaptic excitation, leads to DCN hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Middleton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pilati et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, non-tinnitus mice do not show fusiform cell hyperactivity after sound exposure and express normal levels of KCNQ2/3 currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, knowledge of the biophysical mechanisms associated with resilience to tinnitus is still in its infancy.</p><p>Because in vitro studies have shown that the intrinsic properties of fusiform cells generate spontaneous firing in these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leao et al., 2012</xref>), we blocked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission to investigate the intrinsic mechanisms underlying resilience to tinnitus in a mouse model of noise-induced tinnitus. We evaluated fusiform cell intrinsic excitability in control, tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice. We then extended this analysis by pharmacologically and biophysically isolating the ion channels whose noise-induced plasticity was associated with fusiform cell spontaneous firing rates and tinnitus or non-tinnitus behavior. Finally, we manipulated channel activity in vivo and tested the effects of these manipulations on the induction of tinnitus. Our results highlight the importance of KCNQ2/3 and HCN channels in the resilience to tinnitus and illuminate therapeutic paths that may enhance resilience for tinnitus prevention.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mouse model of tinnitus allows for behavioral separation of noise-exposed mice with either vulnerability or resilience to tinnitus</title><p>To study the neural mechanisms underlying resilience to noise-induced tinnitus, we employed an animal model of tinnitus that permits behavioral separation of tinnitus from non-tinnitus mice. According to this model, behavioral evidence of tinnitus is evaluated based on the inability of tinnitus mice to detect a silent sound gap in a continuous background sound, because their tinnitus ‘fills in the gap’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Turner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Longenecker and Galazyuk, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hickox and Liberman, 2014</xref> and ‘Discussion’). When a silent gap is introduced in a constant background sound before a startle stimulus (gap trial), normal mice show reduced startle amplitude compared to their response to a startle stimulus preceded by the same background sound but without any gap (no-gap trial; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> top left, diagram showing gap and no-gap trials; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> top middle, gray and black, representative startle responses from a sham-exposed, control mouse). Noise-exposed mice that do not detect the silent gap show similar startle amplitudes in gap and no-gap trials and are considered tinnitus mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> top middle, gray and green, representative startle responses from a tinnitus mouse). Noise-exposed mice that detect the silent gap show reduced startle amplitudes in gap trials and are considered non-tinnitus mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> top right, gray and blue, representative startle responses from a non-tinnitus mouse). To quantify the gap detection ability of control and noise-exposed mice, we calculated the gap startle ratio before and after exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Gap startle ratio is the maximum startle amplitude in gap trials divided by the maximum startle amplitude in no-gap trials. Moreover, to investigate the frequency specificity of noise-induced tinnitus, we quantified the gap startle ratio for background sounds with different frequencies (‘Materials and methods’). Our results showed that 7 days after noise exposure, 52.4% (11/21) of the noise-exposed mice exhibited a significant gap detection deficit at high-frequency (20–32 kHz) but not at low-frequency (10–16 kHz) background sounds. This deficit is indicated by an increase in gap startle ratios and is consistent with behavioral evidence of high-frequency tinnitus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> middle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>Increases in gap startle ratios in tinnitus mice are not consistent with noise-induced impairments in temporal processing or noise-induced inability to hear the background sound, because prepulse inhibition, PPI, was similar among control, tinnitus, and non-tinnitus mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> bottom left, diagram showing startle-only and prepulse trials; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> bottom middle and right, representative startle responses from control, tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, summary graphs of PPI ratio; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’). PPI ratio reflects the inhibition of startle response by a preceding non-startling sound of similar intensity as the background sound used in gap detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice displayed similar hearing thresholds before and after noise-exposure, as evidenced by their similar auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’). In response to acoustic stimuli, ABRs reflect the synchronous activity of auditory brainstem nuclei arising from the auditory nerve (wave I) to the inferior colliculus, IC (wave V, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Similar ABR thresholds may be accompanied with hidden differences in suprathreshold amplitudes of wave I. Because these differences could reflect differential degeneration of the auditory nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Furman et al., 2013</xref>), we compared the wave I amplitude of ABRs in response to suprathreshold sounds between tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice, before and after noise exposure. Whereas wave I amplitudes were reduced after noise-exposure for all noise-exposed mice, tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice showed no differences in wave I amplitude, suggesting no difference in the damage of afferent nerve terminals between these two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that neither differential noise-induced hearing threshold shifts nor differential auditory nerve damage can explain the behavioral differences between tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07242.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mouse model of tinnitus allows for behavioral separation of noise-exposed mice with either vulnerability or resilience to tinnitus.</title><p><bold>A</bold>.

Tinnitus mice present reduced KCNQ2/3 channel activity and increased spontaneous firing rates in DCN fusiform cells 7 days after noise exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, non-tinnitus mice are associated with normal KCNQ2/3 channel activity and normal spontaneous firing rates of fusiform cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). These findings suggest that in resilient, non-tinnitus mice either there is no transient reduction in KCNQ2/3 channel activity post noise exposure or that KCNQ2/3 channel activity is transiently reduced but recovers by 7 days post noise exposure. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we measured KCNQ2/3 current amplitudes in fusiform cells from noise-exposed mice 4 days post noise exposure. Because fusiform cells from DCN regions that represent high, but not low, frequency sounds are involved in tinnitus-related biophysical changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>), all in vitro electrophysiological recordings were conducted on fusiform cells from high-frequency DCN regions (≥20 kHz, dorsal part). To quantify KCNQ2/3 currents, we held fusiform cells at −30 mV for 5 s and then stepped the voltage to −50 mV for 1 s to unmask the slow deactivation of KCNQ2/3 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Consistent with previous measurements of KCNQ2/3 currents in fusiform cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>), this protocol revealed a slowly deactivating current, which was significantly reduced by XE991 application (10 μM, a specific KCNQ channel blocker; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Because KCNQ2/3 heteromeric channels mediate the KCNQ currents in fusiform cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>), the XE991-sensitive component of these recordings represents the KCNQ2/3 current amplitude. 4 days noise-exposed mice showed a significant reduction in KCNQ2/3 current amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’). A Boltzmann fit of the KCNQ2/3 conductance–voltage (G–V) function showed that the G<sub>max</sub> of KCNQ2/3 currents was not different between 4 days sham- and 4 days noise-exposed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,E</xref>), but the V<sub>1/2</sub> was shifted to more depolarized potentials in the 4 days noise-exposed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’). These results suggest that the reduction of KCNQ2/3 currents in 4 days noise-exposed mice is due, at least in part, to a depolarizing shift in the V<sub>1/2</sub> of KCNQ2/3 channels, which is mechanistically similar to the reduction of KCNQ2/3 currents in tinnitus mice when assessed 7 days after noise exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07242.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Noise-exposed mice show reduced KCNQ2/3 channel activity 4 days after noise exposure; this reduction is due to a depolarizing shift of V<sub>1/2</sub>.</title><p><bold>A</bold>.

Moreover, previous findings showed that in vivo pharmacological activation of KCNQ currents with either KCNQ2-5 or KCNQ2/3 channel activators, retigabine or SF0034, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tatulian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalappa et al., 2015</xref>), prevented the development of tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalappa et al., 2015</xref>). The ability of KCNQ channel activators to prevent the development of tinnitus is probably occurring through the reversal of the pathogenic reduction of KCNQ2/3 channel activity and the promotion of the natural resilience to tinnitus. However, in those experiments KCNQ channel activators were administered 30 min after noise exposure and then twice a day for an additional 5 days. Here, we tested whether retigabine application initiated at day 4, instead of 30 min after noise exposure, is sufficient to reduce the incidence of tinnitus at day 7. Application of retigabine at day 4 significantly reduced the percentage of mice that developed tinnitus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’), suggesting that the recovery of KCNQ2/3 currents between day 4 and 7 is crucial for tinnitus resilience. Taken together, our results suggest that experience-dependent bidirectional plasticity of KCNQ2/3 channel activity is associated with the vulnerability and resilience to noise-induced tinnitus: experience-dependent depression in KCNQ2/3 channel activity is important for vulnerability, while experience-dependent recovery in KCNQ2/3 channel activity is important for resilience to tinnitus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Reduced HCN channel activity in fusiform cells from non-tinnitus mice underlies biophysical differences between control and non-tinnitus mice</title><p>Our results highlight that pathogenic (reduction) and homeostatic plasticity (recovery) in KCNQ2/3 channel activity are associated with tinnitus and non-tinnitus behavior, respectively. However, it is not known whether fusiform cells from non-tinnitus mice are biophysically similar to the fusiform cells from control mice, or they have undergone homeostatic plasticity in other channels, which could further contribute to tinnitus resilience. To answer this question, we compared the biophysical properties between fusiform cells from control and non-tinnitus mice 7 days after sham or noise exposure. We found that although control mice and non-tinnitus mice show similar non-tinnitus behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), similar fusiform cell spontaneous firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>), similar levels of KCNQ2/3 channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>), and similar spike parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’), non-tinnitus mice are biophysically distinct from control mice. When we blocked fusiform cell spontaneous firing activity with tetrodotoxin (0.5 μM, a specific sodium channel blocker), we found that fusiform cells from non-tinnitus mice showed more hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (RMP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Because fusiform cell RMP is similar between control and tinnitus mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>), this finding suggests specific changes in subthreshold ionic conductance(s) occurring only in non-tinnitus mice. Moreover, when we used small current steps to evaluate the onset and steady state input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’), we found that onset R<sub>in</sub> was not different among control, tinnitus, and non-tinnitus mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, non-tinnitus mice displayed a significantly increased steady-state R<sub>in</sub>, which was revealed later in the voltage response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’). Together, our results revealed that fusiform cells from non-tinnitus mice exhibit a decrease in a slowly activating and deactivating depolarizing conductance that is open at subthreshold potentials. These results indicate that although control and non-tinnitus mice show similar non-tinnitus behavior, non-tinnitus mice are biophysically distinct from control mice. Importantly, these results highlight the involvement of homeostatic plasticity of additional, non-KCNQ, ionic conductances in underlying resilience to tinnitus.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07242.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Non-tinnitus mice are biophysically distinct from control mice.</title><p><bold>A</bold>.

We therefore hypothesized that a decrease in HCN channel activity mediates the hyperpolarized RMP and the increased steady-state R<sub>in</sub> in non-tinnitus mice. To test this hypothesis, we injected hyperpolarizing current to activate HCN channels. HCN channel activation led to a characteristic rebound in the membrane voltage (voltage sag) that was sensitive to the specific HCN channel blocker ZD7288 (10 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, red: before ZD7288; black: after ZD7288). We quantified HCN channel activity by measuring the ZD7288-sensitive sag ratio, which is the difference between the peak voltage response (V<sub>peak</sub>) and steady-state voltage response (V<sub>ss</sub>), normalized to the V<sub>peak</sub> (Sag ratio = (V<sub>peak</sub>−V<sub>ss</sub>)/V<sub>peak</sub>*100%).

To test this hypothesis, we measured the effect of retigabine on HCN current amplitude (intraperitoneal [IP] injections, 10 mg/kg 30 min post exposure then twice daily for 5 days; ‘Materials and methods’).

These results are consistent with recent studies showing that application of retigabine does not have any effect on hearing thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sheppard et al., 2015</xref>). However, application of retigabine reduced hearing loss in an animal model of sodium salicylate-induced sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sheppard et al., 2015</xref>). This is probably due to the fact that different mechanisms mediate sodium salicylate- and noise-induced hearing loss.

Research based on this behavioral assay has revealed important findings for the mechanisms underlying tinnitus, including neuronal hyperactivity, increased neuronal bursting activity, increased neuronal synchrony, degradation of frequency tonotopy, reduced GABAergic/glycinergic inhibition, enhanced GABAergic tonic inhibition, enhanced glutamatergic excitation, and changes in the biophysical properties of KCNQ channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engineer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Middleton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalappa et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sametsky et al., 2015</xref>). In several cases, these findings have led to ongoing clinical trials. For example, a recent study on the role of vagus nerve stimulation paired with tones for treating tinnitus was based on the gap detection paradigm in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engineer et al., 2011</xref>) and is currently under clinical trial. Our studies, which also utilized the gap detection paradigm, revealed a novel KCNQ2/3 channel activator as a clinical candidate for preventing tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalappa et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Because the gap detection paradigm is based on a reflex, unlike other animal models of tinnitus requiring extensive behavioral training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bauer and Brozoski, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lobarinas et al., 2004</xref>), it allows for faster tinnitus screening of a larger number of animals and permits the separation of tinnitus from non-tinnitus animals. However, the interpretation that tinnitus ‘fills in’ the gap in the background sound that precedes the startle stimulus is not compatible with a recent study, which showed that gap detection deficits in noise-exposed mice were evident only when the gap was placed immediately, but not 80 ms, before the startle stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hickox and Liberman, 2014</xref>). If tinnitus just ‘fills in’ the gap, then gap detection deficits in tinnitus animals are expected to be independent of where the silent gap is placed. Moreover, although human studies revealed gap detection deficits in tinnitus sufferers, which are consistent with the use of the gap detection in animal studies, the frequency of the tinnitus percept did not fully match the frequency of the background sound where gap detection deficits were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fournier and Hebert, 2013</xref>). This lack of correspondence in frequency is also inconsistent with the ‘fill in’ theory. Other human studies, which used higher-level cognitive tasks but not the acoustic reflex for assessing gap detection, did not reveal gap detection deficits in tinnitus sufferers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campolo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyen et al., 2015</xref>).

Because in vitro studies have shown that KCNQ2/3 channel activity is plastic and can be enhanced in response to increased neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Randall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Misonou, 2010</xref>), it is possible that endogenous, non-pharmacologically driven recovery in KCNQ2/3 channel activity may provide resilience to KCNQ2/3-related pathology. However, such KCNQ2/3-mediated resilience mechanisms have not been observed in hyperexcitability-related disorders. Here, we report that natural, non-pharmacologically driven recovery in KCNQ2/3 channel activity is linked with the resilience to noise-induced tinnitus. This novel finding suggests a temporal window during which endogenous, intrinsic mechanisms can restore KCNQ2/3 channel activity and lead to tinnitus resilience. Elucidation of these mechanisms will unmask previously unknown plasticity mechanisms of KCNQ2/3 channel activity, and lead to new targets for drug development towards enhancing resilience to noise-induced tinnitus in humans.</p><p>KCNQ2/3 channels mediate the native neuronal M-type current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 1998</xref>), a slowly activating voltage-gated potassium current blocked by muscarinic acetylcholine (M) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Adams, 1980</xref>).

We suggest that reduced HCN channel activity in non-tinnitus mice prevents fusiform cell hyperactivity and contributes to tinnitus resilience by hyperpolarizing the RMP of fusiform cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref>). Moreover, decreased HCN channel activity increased the steady-state R<sub>in</sub> of fusiform cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4C and 5D</xref>), which is expected to enhance responsiveness of fusiform cells to synaptic inputs. Therefore, reduction of HCN channel activity in fusiform cells may contribute to enhanced evoked activity and potentially to noise-induced hyperacusis—the perception of moderate-level sounds as intolerably loud.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that large increases in postsynaptic calcium lead to enhancement in HCN current amplitude via NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation, CaMKII activation and increased HCN channel expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2005</xref>), while smaller increases in calcium through L-type calcium channels and/or activation of mGluRs and PKC activation lead to activity-dependent decreases in HCN expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brager and Johnston, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2011</xref>). Pharmacological enhancement of KCNQ channels with retigabine reduces spontaneous firing rate in fusiform cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>) and promotes a decrease in HCN current amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Therefore, we propose that decreases in spontaneous firing that may be caused by the enhancement in KCNQ2/3 channel activity lead to changes in intracellular calcium, which, in turn, may trigger a homeostatic mechanism that decreases HCN currents in an effort to normalize spontaneous spike rates. Immunohistochemical studies have shown that the HCN2 subunit is expressed in fusiform cells that lack HCN1 subunit expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koch et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that HCN2 isoforms may mediate the noise-induced plasticity in fusiform cells. Therefore, we propose that manipulations that reduce HCN2 channel activity may serve as potential therapeutic path for preventing the development of tinnitus.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Contribution of other conductances to vulnerability and resilience to tinnitus</title><p>Reduction of KCNQ2/3 currents is associated with increased spontaneous firing rate and tinnitus behavior 7 days after noise exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). However, at 4 days after noise exposure, fusiform cells show reduced KCNQ2/3 currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) but without hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This lack of association between reduced KCNQ2/3 channel activity and neuronal hyperactivity can be explained by the hyperpolarized RMP of fusiform cells 4 days after noise exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Because various levels of inwardly rectifying potassium channels (K<sub>ir</sub>) set the diverse RMP of fusiform cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leao et al., 2012</xref>), we suggest that noise-induced increases in K<sub>ir</sub>s may mediate this hyperpolarization of RMP and hence resilience to tinnitus. We conclude that reduction in KCNQ2/3 channel activity is a robust mechanism for triggering tinnitus, but its pathogenic effect is gated by the RMP of fusiform cells. Therefore, besides targeting KCNQ2/3 channel activators for preventing tinnitus, manipulations that hyperpolarize the fusiform cell RMP may also provide additional therapeutic approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Homeostatic plasticity and tinnitus</title><p>Fusiform cells from control, 4 days noise-exposed and 7 days non-tinnitus mice show similar spontaneous firing rates but with different combinations of ionic conductances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig5 fig8">Figures 3, 5 and 8</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>)). These findings complement and extend previous experimental and theoretical work showing that similar neuronal output can result from multiple combinations of intrinsic and synaptic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edelman and Gally, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prinz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goaillard and Dufour, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ratte et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In accordance with this view, activity-dependent changes in conductances that affect neuronal excitability frequently trigger homeostatic, compensatory changes in different conductances, which result in constant neuronal output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">LeMasson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">O'Leary et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O'Leary et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O'Leary et al., 2014</xref>). Our results are consistent with such homeostatic mechanisms and highlight that recovery of KCNQ channel activity is associated with a reduction in HCN channel activity and the maintenance of normal spontaneous firing rates in non-tinnitus mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig5">Figures 3, 5</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Because homeostatic and coordinated regulation of potassium and HCN currents occurs in different species and neuronal circuits, such as dopaminergic neurons in rat susbstantia nigra pars compact, neurons of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion and octopus and MSO auditory brainstem neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacLean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oertel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khurana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amendola et al., 2012</xref>), we propose that coordinated plasticity of potassium and HCN channels may represent a general biophysical strategy for achieving neuronal homeostasis.</p><p>The fact that multiple molecular pathologies underlie hyperexcitability-related disorders, such as neuropathic pain and epilepsy, has led to the suggestion that drugs that simultaneously target more than one type of ion channels could treat these disorders more effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goaillard and Dufour, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klassen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ratte et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, because plasticity of multiple conductances is involved in tinnitus, we propose that a combination of drugs that enhance KCNQ2/3 and reduce HCN channel activity represents a potent therapeutic approach that will enhance resilience and reduce vulnerability to tinnitus. Moreover, simultaneous pharmacological enhancement of KCNQ2/3 and reduction of HCN channel activity is expected to act synergistically in stabilizing spontaneous firing rates in fusiform cells. This synergistic effect may in turn reduce the required concentration for each individual drug to exert its effect and therefore may lead to increased potency and reduced toxicity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse model of tinnitus</title><p>Animals were handled and sacrificed according to methods approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pittsburgh. ICR (CD-1) male and female mice were noise exposed at postnatal day P17–P20. After anesthetizing the mouse with 1–1.5% isoflurane, a pipette tip that was connected with the speaker was inserted into left ear canal of the mouse (unilateral noise exposure). Narrow bandpass noise with a 1 kHz bandwidth centered at 16 kHz was presented at 116 dB SPL (dB) for 45 min. For sham-exposed (control) mice, the procedures were identical with the noise-exposed mice but without noise presentation. For 4 days sham- and noise-exposure experiments, P20—P23 (instead of P17—P20) mice were used for sham or noise exposure, so that electrophysiological recordings and behavioral assessments 4 days after noise exposure were performed on mice that had similar age with the mice that were used for experiments 7 days after sham or noise exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Gap detection</title><p>The gap detection paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Turner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>) was used for assessing behavioral evidence of tinnitus. Gap detection of sham- or noise-exposed mice was assessed before exposure, 4 days or 1 week (6–7 days) after sham or noise exposure. Detailed testing has been described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al. (2013)</xref>. Briefly, the gap detection testing consists of two types of trials, gap trials and no-gap trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> top left). In gap trials, a sound gap was embedded in a narrow bandpass background sound (1 kHz bandwidth centered at 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 kHz presented at 70 dB), which was followed by the startle stimulus (20 ms white noise burst at 104 dB); a 50-ms sound gap was introduced 130 ms before the startle stimulus. No-gap trials were the same as gap trials, but that no gap was introduced in the background sound. Gap trials and no-gap trials were presented as paired stimuli for the same background sound frequency, and were delivered in an alternating manner. The startle response represents the waveform of the downward pressing force that the mouse applies onto the platform in response to the startle stimulus. The ability of a mouse to detect sound gap was quantified by the gap startle ratio, which is the ratio of the peak-to-peak value of the startle waveform (amplitude in Arbitrary Unit, AU) in gap trials over the peak-to-peak value of the startle waveform of the paired no-gap trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Prepulse inhibition</title><p>Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is the inverse of gap detection and was tested together with gap detection before, 4 days, or 1 week after sham or noise exposure. PPI testing consists of prepulse trials and startle-only trials, which were delivered in an alternating manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom left). In prepulse trials, a brief non-startling sound (prepulse) of similar intensity as the background sound used in the gap detection test (50 ms, 70 dB bandpass sound with 1 kHz bandwidth centered at 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 kHz). The prepulse was presented 130 ms before the startle stimulus. Startle-only trials were similar to the prepulse trials, but no prepulse was delivered. PPI was quantified by the PPI ratio, which is the ratio of the peak-to-peak value of the startle waveform in prepulse trials over the peak-to-peak value of the startle waveform in startle-only trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Gap detection and PPI analysis</title><p>For each sham- or noise-exposed mouse, gap detection and PPI ratios were averaged from three rounds of testing before and after sham or noise exposure. Each round of testing included 72 pairs of gap and no-gap trials for gap detection (6 background sound frequencies, 12 pairs for each frequency) and 30 pairs of prepulse and startle-only trials for PPI (6 prepulse sound frequencies, 5 pairs for each frequency). Gap startle and PPI ratios were analyzed separately. Maximum absolute amplitude of the startle response and root mean square of baseline movement preceding the startle response (RMS baseline) were measured with a Labview-based recording system. Mean and standard deviation of RMS baseline of gap, no-gap, prepulse, and startle-only trials were measured to assess the variability of baseline movement. Trials with RMS baseline amplitude above or below the mean ± 2.5 standard deviations were eliminated. When a trial was eliminated, its paired trial was also eliminated. For gap detection trials of the same background frequency, gap startle ratios were sorted in an ascending manner. To control for variability of gap startle ratios tested with the same frequency, ratios that showed an increase of more than 0.5 from the preceding value were excluded; the following values were also excluded. If more than 5 ratios were excluded within a frequency, the gap startle ratio for this frequency was not used. For background and prepulse sound of the same testing frequency, individual gap startle and PPI ratios were averaged and generated the average ratio for each round of testing. Average gap startle and PPI ratios of each frequency were then averaged across the three rounds of pre-exposure and post-exposure testing to generate the final ratio value. According to previous established criteria, gap startle ratios that were bigger than 0.9 before sham or noise exposure, or bigger than 1.1 after exposure were excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, PPI ratios that were bigger than 1 before or after exposure were excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Changes in gap startle ratio before and after exposure (Δ gap startle ratio) were calculated by subtracting the post-exposure ratio from the pre-exposure ratio for each testing frequency. The probability distribution of Δ gap startle ratios from all testing frequencies of sham-exposed mice was fitted with a Gaussian distribution, which permitted the calculation of the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (δ) of the probability distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). For evaluating the behavioral evidence of tinnitus, we calculated the point that is 2 standard deviations above the mean and used this value as the threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Mice that presented Δ gap startle ratio higher than threshold value in at least one tested frequency were considered tinnitus mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). To determine whether Δ gap startle ratios from 4 days noise-exposed mice were different from Δ gap startle ratios from 4 days sham-exposed mice, we calculated the fraction of Δ gap startle ratios that are above thresholds in 4 days sham- and noise-exposed mice, with thresholds ranging from 1 to −1 with 0.02 increments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Auditory brainstem responses</title><p>Auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds were measured before, 4 days and 7 days after noise exposure following gap detection and PPI test.

Mice were anesthetized initially with 3% isoflurane in oxygen, and then maintained with 1–1.5%. To present the sound stimuli, a pipette tip was fixed to the end of a plastic tube (2.5 cm in length), which was attached to the speaker (CF-1; Tucker Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL, United States) and was inserted into the left ear canal. ABR thresholds were obtained for 1-ms clicks and 3-ms tone bursts of 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 kHz presented at a rate of 18.56/s in response to stimuli with different intensities (80 dB–15 dB, −5 dB step). Stimuli were produced using the System 3 software package from Tucker Davis Technologies. Evoked potentials were averaged 1024 times and filtered using a 300- to 3000-Hz bandpass filter. Wave I amplitude of each ABR response was measured as the peak-to-peak amplitude of the first wave that could be identified by eye from the baseline variation. Wave I amplitude for different stimulation intensities at 20 kHz, 24 kHz, and 32 kHz were averaged as response to high-frequency sounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vivo administration of KCNQ channel activators</title><p>For these experiments, ICR (CD-1) mice (P17—P20), both male and female mice were used. For experiments where administration of vehicle and KCNQ activators start 30 min after noise exposure, 20 noise-exposed mice were injected with KCNQ channel activators: 10 mice with retigabine as its dihydrochloride salt and 10 mice with flupirtine, another KCNQ channel activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mackie and Byron, 2008</xref>). 18 noise-exposed mice were treated with vehicle: 11 mice with 0.9% saline paired with the retigabine group and 7 mice with 30% propylene glycol, 5% Tween 80, 65% D5W paired with the flupirtine group. Prior to noise exposure, all mice were assessed for gap detection and PPI. For the KCNQ channel activator group, retigabine or flupirtine were administered 30 min after noise exposure via IP injection at a dose of 10 mg/kg. In the vehicle group, the same volume of vehicle solution was administered 30 min after noise exposure via IP injection. All mice were further administered with KCNQ channel activator or vehicle twice a day every 12 hr for 5 days. Gap detection and PPI were retested 24 hr after the final injection. Only mice from the retigabine and saline vehicle group were used for electrophysiological recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). For experiments where injection of retigabine or saline started at the end of day 3 after noise exposure, injections continued 3 times a day every 8 hr for 3 days at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Gap detection and PPI were tested before noise exposure and 24 hr after the final injection. Retigabine dihydrochloride was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (LKT Laboratories, St. Paul, MN, United States) and Alomone (Jerusalem, Israel). Flupirtine maleate was obtained from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, United States).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Coronal slices of the left DCN (210 μm) were prepared from control and noise-exposed mice (P24—P27). Immediately, after brain slices were prepared, they were incubated in normal artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF) at 36°C for 1 hr and then at room temperature. Fusiform cells were visualized using an Olympus upright microscope under oblique illumination condenser equipped with a XC-ST30 CCD camera and analog monitor. Cells were identified based on their morphological and electrophysiological characteristics. The preparation of slices and the identification for fusiform cells have been described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tzounopoulos et al., 2004</xref>). The incubation as well as external recording solution contained (in mM): 130 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.2 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 20 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 3 NaHEPES, and 10 D-glucose, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. DNQX (20 μM, AMPA and Kainate receptor antagonist, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, United States), strychnine (0.5 μM, glycine receptor antagonist, Sigma–Aldrich), SR95531 (20 μM, GABAa receptor antagonist, Abcam) were used to block glutamatergic, glycinergic as well as GABAergic synaptic transmission, respectively. XE991 (10 μM, KCNQ channel blocker, Abcam) was applied for blocking KCNQ currents. Tetrodotoxin (TTX, selective inhibitor for sodium channel, 0.5 μM, Abcam) was used to block spiking activity. ZD7288 (10 μM, blocker for HCN channel, Abcam) was used to block HCN channel activity. Recordings were performed at 34–37°C using an inline heating system (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, United States) with perfusion speed maintained (4–6 ml min<sup>−1</sup>).</p><p>For whole-cell voltage and current clamp experiments, pipettes (3–5 ΜΩ) were filled with a K<sup>+</sup>-based internal solution containing (in mM): 113 K-gluconate, 4.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.6 H<sub>2</sub>0, 14 Tris-phosphocreatine, 9 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.3 Tris-GTP, 10 Sucrose, pH 7.3, and 300 mOsmol. Liquid junction potential of −11 mV was corrected. Access resistance was monitored throughout the experiment from the size and shape of the capacitive transient in response to a 5-mV depolarization step. Recordings with access resistance larger than 15 MΩ were eliminated. Recordings were performed with Clampex 10.2 and Multiclamp 700B amplifier interfaced with Digidata 1440A data acquisition system (Axon Instruments). For whole-cell voltage clamp experiments, fast, slow capacitive currents as well as series resistance (Rs) were compensated (70%, bandwidth 15 kHz). In voltage clamp ramp experiments, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> was removed from ACSF. External CsCl<sub>2</sub> (1 mM) and CdCl<sub>2</sub> (200 μM) were used to block hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN, Ih channel) and calcium channels, respectively. All recording protocols, except for the gap-free recording in current clamp, were applied below 0.1 Hz to eliminate potential short-term plasticity effects. Spike parameters were analyzed from spontaneous spikes in whole-cell, voltage-follower mode recordings (current clamp, at I = 0; synaptic transmission was pharmacologically blocked). To assess spike properties, 20 consecutive spontaneous spikes were aligned at the negative peak and averaged. Spike threshold is the membrane potential at which the depolarization slope exceeds 10 V/s. Spike amplitude is the voltage difference between the spike threshold and the peak voltage of the spike. Depolarization and hyperpolarization slope indicate the maximum positive slope during the depolarization and minimum negative slope during hyperpolarization phase of the spike. Half height width is the width of the spike when voltage equals to (spike threshold + half of spike amplitude). Fast afterhyperpolarization (fAHP) is the voltage difference between spike threshold and negative peak of the spike. Resting membrane potential (RMP) was measured with whole-cell, voltage-follower mode recordings (current clamp, at I = 0) 5 min after TTX (0.5 μM) application. ZD7288 was applied after TTX for evaluating its effect on RMP. Input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>) was measured in current clamp mode through current injection (−60 pA–60 pA, 20 pA step size, 2 s). Onset R<sub>in</sub> is the slope of the current–voltage (I–V) relationship of the average membrane voltage response of the initial 100 ms starting from the peak of the voltage response. Steady-state R<sub>in</sub> was calculated similarly to the onset R<sub>in</sub>, but the last 250 ms of the voltage response were used. To quantify KCNQ2/3 currents, we measured the XE991-sensitive tail current amplitude in response to a voltage step to −50 mV from a holding potential of −30 mV, described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). To measure HCN channel activity, we injected bias current to maintain the membrane potential at −75 mV. A hyperpolarizing current step (−550 pA, 2 s) was then used to activate HCN channels. The biggest membrane potential change from −75 mV (V<sub>peak</sub>), and the membrane potential change at the end of hyperpolarizing current (V<sub>ss</sub>) was used to calculate the sag ratio: Sag ratio = (V<sub>peak</sub>−V<sub>ss</sub>)/V<sub>peak</sub> × 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Sag ratio before and after ZD7288 (15 min application) was subtracted and generated the ZD7288-sensitive sag ratio. In voltage-clamp ramp experiments, XE991-sensitive KCNQ currents elicited by slow voltage ramp (10 mV/s) were converted to conductance (G, nS) according to Ohm's law: G = I/(V−V<sub>r</sub>). I (pA) is the current amplitude at the membrane potential V (mV), and V<sub>r</sub> is the reversal potential of potassium [−85.5 mV; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leao et al., 2012</xref>)]. Conductance–voltage curves were then fitted with Boltzmann function to describe the voltage dependence of KCNQ activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D,E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>For data that were normally distributed (based on Liliefors test), we conducted Student's t-test or One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).

Your article has been evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor), Gary Westbrook (Reviewing Editor), and two reviewers. The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before they reached a decision.</p><p>Although this study is generally well-executed and provides results relevant to a major public health issue, the reviewers felt that significant additional information is needed to support the main conclusions. Thus per <italic>eLife</italic> policy not to require substantial additional experiments, we cannot consider the manuscript further at this time.</p><p>This study addresses the question of why intense noise exposure leads to tinnitus in some mice but not others. The basis of this work is that all noise-exposed animals show shifts in hearing threshold, but only a proportion of them show increased spontaneous firing rates in fusiform cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Previously, Li, Choi, and Tzounopoulos (PNAS, 2013) showed that KCNQ2/3 (M) currents are reduced in DCN fusiform cells of mice exhibiting signs of tinnitus seven days after intense noise exposure but not in noise-exposed asymptomatic mice. A clever behavioral task is used to separate whether mice can detect a silent gap in background noise preceding a startle stimulus. “Tinnitus” mice are defined as those that cannot detect a silent gap without apparent differences in noise-induced hearing loss as measured by a prepulse inhibition (PPI) protocol.</p><p>The authors report that KCNQ2/3 currents are reduced in the fusiform cells of all noise-exposed mice four days after noise exposure, even though statistically nearly half of these mice would not have gone on to develop tinnitus. This suggests that KCNQ2/3 currents return to pre-noise exposure levels in tinnitus-resistant mice between four and seven days after noise exposure, providing a possible molecular explanation for why some noise-exposed mice develop tinnitus while others do not. In addition, the authors also report that HCN currents and resting membrane potentials are reduced in tinnitus-resistant mice seven days after noise exposure, but not in tinnitus mice.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) The extent of damage from the noise exposure is not clear in the study. It seems important to know if the differences between “tinnitus” and “non-tinnitus” mice results from differences in the extent of noise damage to hair cells, or differences in the response of the DCN to comparable damage, i.e. do responses to noise-exposure reflect different plastic responses of the DCN to the same injury, or differences in the extent of the upstream injury. For example, could the protective effect of KCNQ activation result from protection of the cochlea and the plasticity differences observed reflect a uniform response to different extents of damage? At present, this distinction seems to depend solely on the PPI measurement. The selectivity of deficits in Gap startle ratio vs. paired pulse inhibition are helpful and important, but the conclusions in the subsection “Mouse model of tinnitus allows for behavioral separation of noise-exposed mice with either vulnerability or resilience to tinnitus” seem too strong. The authors claim their results rule out impairments in temporal processing or ability to hear background noise. Selective deficits in temporal processing of e.g. offset responses could explain the results, and not relate to tinnitus. Caveats of the model should be made clear. One possible resolution would be to perform DPOAEs or ABRs in a group of animals in which they also assess “tinnitus” versus “non-tinnitus” DCN phenotype, following e.g.: Kujawa, S. G., &amp; Liberman, M. C. (2009), Adding insult to injury: cochlear nerve degeneration after “temporary” noise-induced hearing loss, The Journal of Neuroscience, 29(45), 14077-14085.</p><p>2) What is the evidence that that a selective effect of noise exposure on Gap detection is a reliable indication that an animal has tinnitus? Because tinnitus is a percept, and its physiological manifestations have been elusive, it is not at all clear at the outset how one knows if an animal is experiencing tinnitus.</p><p>3) The sole metric used for assessing KCNQ2/3 currents is the amplitude of the tail currents resulting from a voltage step from -30 mV to -50 mV (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). A more informative measure would be to generate voltage activation curves as the authors did in their 2013 paper (PNAS <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G-I</xref>).

It seems important to know if the differences between “tinnitus” and “non-tinnitus” mice results from differences in the extent of noise damage to hair cells, or differences in the response of the DCN to comparable damage, i.e. do responses to noise-exposure reflect different plastic responses of the DCN to the same injury, or differences in the extent of the upstream injury. For example, could the protective effect of KCNQ activation result from protection of the cochlea and the plasticity differences observed reflect a uniform response to different extents of damage? At present, this distinction seems to depend solely on the PPI measurement. The selectivity of deficits in Gap startle ratio vs. paired pulse inhibition are helpful and important, but the conclusions in the subsection “Mouse model of tinnitus allows for behavioral separation of noise-exposed mice with either vulnerability or resilience to tinnitus” seem too strong. The authors claim their results rule out impairments in temporal processing or ability to hear background noise. Selective deficits in temporal processing of e.g. offset responses could explain the results, and not relate to tinnitus. Caveats of the model should be made clear. One possible resolution would be to perform DPOAEs or ABRs in a group of animals in which they also assess “tinnitus” versus “non-tinnitus” DCN phenotype, following e.g.: Kujawa, S. G., &amp; Liberman, M. C. (2009), Adding insult to injury: cochlear nerve degeneration after “temporary” noise-induced hearing loss, The Journal of Neuroscience, 29(45), 14077-14085</italic>.</p><p>We agree that prepulse inhibition (PPI) measurements are not sufficient to address the issues raised by the reviewer regarding the potential role of differential injury between tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice upstream to the DCN. As suggested by the reviewers, to address these issues, we performed auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements, analysis of hearing thresholds and analysis of wave I amplitude of the ABR. Please note that we had already performed these measurements in the same animals included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and therefore these results match the behavioral gap detection and PPI experiments included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Briefly, consistent with our PPI results, tinnitus and non -tinnitus mice displayed similar hearing thresholds before and after noise-exposure, as evidenced by similar ABR thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Because similar ABR thresholds may not reveal differences in suprathreshold amplitudes of wave I, which would reflect differential degeneration of the auditory nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</xref>, J. of Neurosci.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Furman et al., 2013</xref>, J. of Neurophys.), we compared the amplitude of the wave I in response to suprathreshold sounds between tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice before and after noise exposure. Whereas wave I amplitudes were reduced after noise-exposure for all noise-exposed mice, tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice showed no differences in wave I amplitude, suggesting an indistinguishable damage of afferent nerve terminals between these two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that neither differential noise- induced hearing threshold shifts nor differential auditory nerve damage can explain the behavioral differences between tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice. We included these data in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and edited the text accordingly.</p><p><italic>2) What is the evidence that that a selective effect of noise exposure on Gap detection is a reliable indication that an animal has tinnitus? Because tinnitus is a percept, and its physiological manifestations have been elusive, it is not at all clear at the outset how one knows if an animal is experiencing tinnitus</italic>.</p><p>We agree that it is not clear to know with certainty whether a mouse experiences tinnitus. Given the subjective nature of tinnitus perception, there is not any objective behavioral paradigm in either mice or humans that provides objective evidence of tinnitus. Despite these inherent limitations of studying tinnitus perception, the gap detection paradigm has been used by a large number of leading tinnitus neuroscientists including Drs. Caspary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sametsky et al., 2015</xref>, J. of Neurosci.), Kilgard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engineer et al., 2011</xref>, Nature), Shore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koehler and Shore, 2013</xref>, J. of Neurosci.), to mention a few. There are several review articles discussing advantages and disadvantages in using this behavioral paradigm, which are outside the scope of this study. Importantly, this paradigm has revealed extremely important findings for the neurobiology and treatment of tinnitus. In several cases, these findings have also led to ongoing clinical trials. For example the Kilgard study on the role of vagus nerve stimulation paired with tones for treating tinnitus was based on this paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engineer et al., 2011</xref>, Nature), and is currently under clinical trial. Our studies, also based on the gap detection paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>, PNAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalappa et al., 2015</xref>, Journal of Neuroscience), have revealed novel KCNQ2/3 channel activators for the treatment of tinnitus and epilepsy and are moving toward clinical trials. We therefore believe that the gap detection paradigm is a useful behavioral assay for elucidating tinnitus mechanisms.</p><p><italic>3) The sole metric used for assessing KCNQ2/3 currents is the amplitude of the tail currents resulting from a voltage step from -30 mV to -50 mV (e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>). A more informative measure would be to generate voltage activation curves as the authors did in their 2013 paper (PNAS</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3G-I</italic></xref><italic>). This would provide more direct evidence about whether all noise-exposed mice exhibit the same mechanism for KCNQ2/3 current reduction (e.g. change in Vhalf versus Gmax) or if a subtle but meaningful dichotomy exists between tinnitus-resistant and susceptible mice at day 4</italic>.</p><p>We agree and performed additional experiments to measure the voltage dependence of KCNQ currents 4 days after noise exposure. Briefly, a Boltzmann fit of the KCNQ2/3 conductance–voltage (G–V) function showed that the G<sub>max</sub> of KCNQ2/3 currents was not different between sham- and 4 days noise-exposed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), but the V<sub>1/2</sub> was shifted to more depolarized potentials in the 4 days noise-exposed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; Methods). These results suggest that the reduction of KCNQ2/3 currents in 4 days noise-exposed mice is due to a depolarizing shift in the V <sub>1/2</sub> of KCNQ2/3 channels, which is mechanistically similar to the reduction of KCNQ2/3 currents in tinnitus mice when assessed 7 days after noise exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>, PNAS) We included these data in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and edited the text accordingly.</p><p><italic>4) Evidence that recovery of KCNQ2/3 currents 4 to 7 days after noise exposure provides resistance to the development of tinnitus is based on a correlation and does not directly demonstrate that KCNQ currents are important.

Application of retigabine at day 4 reduced significantly the percentage of mice that developed tinnitus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; Methods), suggesting that the recovery of KCNQ2/3 currents between day 4 and 7 is crucial for tinnitus resilience.

Moreover, these results reproduce our previous results published in two different manuscripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>, PNAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalappa et al., 2015</xref>, Journal of Neuroscience). The threshold used to assign mice to tinnitus group affects the outcome of the experiment, but it is established for every different behavioral experiment by using objective quantitative criteria. Particularly, changes in gap startle ratio before and after exposure (Δ gap startle ratio) were calculated by subtracting the post-exposure ratio from the pre-exposure ratio for each testing frequency. The probability distribution of Δ gap startle ratios from all testing frequencies of sham-exposed mice was fitted with a Gaussian distribution, which permitted the calculation of the mean (µ) and the standard deviation (δ) of the probability distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>, PNAS). For evaluating the behavioral evidence of tinnitus, we calculated the point that is 2 standard deviations above the mean and used this value as the threshold (Li eat al., 2013). Mice that presented Δ gap startle ratio higher than threshold value in at least one tested frequency were considered tinnitus mice (Li eat al., 2013, PNAS).</p><p><italic>6) The Discussion seems overly long and repetitive, but does not really explain the underlying signaling mechanisms involved in the “homeostatic” changes in subthreshold currents.
