Together with the small GTPase Cdc42 and other effectors, these proteins participate in the remodelling of the actin network downstream of BCR engagement. Here we show that mice lacking the adaptor protein ITSN2, a G-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42 that also interacts with WASp and WIP, exhibited increased mortality during primary infection, incomplete protection after Flu vaccination, reduced germinal centre formation and impaired antibody responses to vaccination. These defects were found, at least in part, to be intrinsic to the B cell compartment. In vivo, ITSN2 deficient B cells show a reduction in the expression of SLAM, CD84 or ICOSL that correlates with a diminished ability to form long term conjugates with T cells, to proliferate in vivo, and to differentiate into germinal centre cells. In conclusion, our study not only revealed a key role for ITSN2 as an important regulator of adaptive immune-response during vaccination and viral infection but it is also likely to contribute to a better understanding of human immune pathologies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>B cells</kwd><kwd>antibody responses</kwd><kwd>B-T interactions</kwd><kwd>SLAM family

part in humoral immunity through their ability to produce high affinity antibodies in response to infections. Naïve B cells express a unique B cell receptor (BCR) that allows them to recognise cognate antigen, usually on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as follicular dendritic cells or subcapsular sinus macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batista and Harwood, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cyster, 2010</xref>). Binding of antigen to the BCR triggers a signaling cascade, which provides the first signal for B cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurosaki et al., 2010</xref>). BCR engagement also induces rapid and radical alterations of cellular morphology, coupled to substantial remodelling of the B cell actin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fleire et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>BCR-induced reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton plays a central part in the initiation of B cell responses. Consequently, B cells lacking key cytoskeleton regulators, such as the small Rho GTPases Rac1 and Rac2, RhoA or Cdc42, show far-reaching functional impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burbage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerasimcik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saci and Carpenter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Walmsley et al., 2003</xref>). The activity of Rho GTPases is modulated by G-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that trigger their switch from a GDP-bound inactive to a GTP-bound active state. B cell-intrinsic deletion of the GEFs Vav or dedicator of cytokinesis (DOCK8) severely impairs antibody responses in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujikawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Randall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tarakhovsky et al., 1995</xref>). Accordingly, in humans, multiple immune pathologies have been linked to mutations in actin regulators. Mutations in <italic>DOCK8</italic> have been found in independent cohorts of immunodeficient patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGhee and Chatila, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), characterised by recurrent infections and abnormal lymphocyte function is commonly caused by loss-of-function mutations in WAS protein (WASp) or in its interacting protein WIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lanzi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thrasher and Burns, 2010</xref>), both of which are involved in triggering actin polymerisation downstream of Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martinez-Quiles et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moreau et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>One consequence of BCR signalling is antigen internalisation followed by its processing and presentation onto MHC class II, enabling cognate interactions between activated B cells and CD4 T lymphocytes that recognise antigenic peptide-MHC complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lanzavecchia, 1985</xref>). These interactions allow B cells to receive T cell help in a contact dependent fashion. The combination of BCR signalling and T cell help is critical for B cells to enter the germinal centre (GC) reaction, during which they undergo somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination, and from where antibody secreting cells with high affinity for the antigen emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Victora and Mesin, 2014</xref>). The establishment of prolonged contacts between B and T cells rely on interactions between various receptors, such as MHCII and TCR, or CD80/CD86 and CD28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crotty, 2015</xref>). The signalling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family of transmembrane receptors and the SLAM-associated protein (SAP) family of intracellular adaptors have crucial roles in stabilising B-T conjugates both at the B-T border and in GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwartzberg et al., 2009</xref>). In humans, mutations in <italic>SH2D1A</italic> (encoding for SAP) are causative of X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP), an immune pathology characterised by an extreme sensitivity to Epstein Barr Virus infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coffey et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sayos et al., 1998</xref>). SAP deficient T cells fail to establish long term conjugates with B cells, resulting in a dramatic block in the generation of high affinity antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crotty et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Czar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qi et al., 2008</xref>). The SLAM receptor CD84 is also required for this process, as CD84 deficient T cells are compromised in their ability to establish stable interactions with B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cannons et al., 2010</xref>). However, the molecules involved in stabilising these contacts on the B cell side have not been identified.</p><p>Intersectin (ITSN) 2 is a multimodular adaptor protein ubiquitously expressed as two distinct isoforms, ITSN2-S, and the longer isoform ITSN2-L. Both isoforms contain SH3 domains, which support direct interactions with multiple partners, including WASp and WIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gryaznova et al., 2015</xref>), but only ITSN2-L has a GEF domain consistent of a DH (Dbl homology) domain coupled to a PH (Pleckstrin homology) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pucharcos et al., 2000</xref>). Notably, the GEF activity of ITSN2-L is selective for Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Novokhatska et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, in a large-scale association study, <italic>ITSN2</italic> has been identified as a potential at-risk locus for Sjögren’s syndrome, a common autoimmune pathology characterised by keratoconjunctivitis and xerostomia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lessard et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>ITSN2</italic> locus has been found to be differentially methylated in B lymphocytes from healthy donors versus cells from Sjögren’s syndrome patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miceli-Richard et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we provide the first characterisation of the role of ITSN2 in the context of immune responses. We show that genetic ablation of ITSN2 rendered mice more sensitive to a lethal infection with Influenza virus. Furthermore, ITSN2 deficient B cells were defective in entering the GC reaction and in generating high affinity antibodies. In vivo, <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells exhibited proliferation defects upon immunisation, expressed reduced levels of various surface receptors, and were impaired in forming long-term conjugates with cognate T lymphocytes. The results presented here provide the first characterisation of the role of ITSN2 in the context of immune responses. Furthermore, they identify an essential function for this protein in the regulation of B-T cell interactions, germinal centre formation and antibody production, which is reminiscent of the phenotype associated with SAP or CD84 deficiency in T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>B and T cells develop normally in <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice</title><p>Due to the intricate relationship between BCR signalling, the actin cytoskeleton and its regulators, we sought to characterize the role of ITSN2 in mouse immune responses. To analyse the function of ITSN2 in B cells, we obtained ITSN2 deficient mice from the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) consortium.

These cells were allowed to settle onto planar lipid bilayers loaded with Alexa Fluor 633-labeled HEL, mimicking B cell interaction with APCs, and imaged by TIRF microscopy. Interestingly, as the cells spread over the bilayers and formed antigen microclusters, we observed the appearance of distinct ITSN2 foci in close proximity to antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, we did not detect a direct colocalisation between ITSN2 and antigen microclusters. These results indicate that the role exerted by ITSN2 in immunity is independent of its physical recruitment to antigen microclusters, and instead may be through its ability to signal downstream effectors.</p><p>Given the early ITSN2 recruitment, we wanted to establish whether its absence influences the re-organisation of the actin cytoskeleton after BCR activation. WT and <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells were allowed to spread on coverslips coated with immobilised antigen and stained for F-actin with phalloidin. WT B cells spread over the antigen-coated surface and exhibited a typical F-actin distribution, with a characteristic ring at the periphery of the cells, and about 14 actin foci per WT cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Although the overall spreading area was not affected in <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells, the organisation of the F-actin network was altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) as evident by a dramatic reduction in these foci with an average of 4 F-actin foci per cell. This is reminiscent of what has been previously reported for other components of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keppler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumari et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

In these cell lines, actin foci formation was restored by overexpression of ITSN2LGFP, indicating that this defect is indeed due to ITSN2 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether this defect in actin cytoskeleton might reflect impaired BCR signalling, we stimulated WT and <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells anti-IgM F(ab’)2 for 0, 2 or 5 min and measured the phosphorylation status of several canonical effectors by Western blotting. Both WT and <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells exhibited a robust phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK upon BCR engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). However, phosphorylation of Src, Akt and CD19 was reduced by at least 2-fold in <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This suggests that ITSN2 is implicated in propagating BCR-driven signals, in particular those leading to activation of the PI3K pathway. However, these early defects did not impair calcium influx, as both WT and <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells exhibited robust calcium flux upon BCR engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>We recently described that WIP-deficient B cells exhibit strong defects in activation of the PI3K pathway, in particular in CD19 phosphorylation, coupled to impaired actin foci formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keppler et al., 2015</xref>). These defects are coupled to an increase in BCR and CD19 motility at the single molecule level. Measuring the diffusion coefficients of IgM, IgD and CD19 in <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells, we observed a small increase in CD19 mobility, but much less marked than in the case of the WIP KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the consequence of impaired early BCR signalling in <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells on distal signalling events, we cultured WT and <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells in the presence of IL-4 with or without anti-IgM F(ab’)2.

This shows that indeed, ITSN2 deficiency leads to sustained signalling defects upon BCR engagement.</p><p>To gain insight into the physiological consequences of impaired signalling on B cell survival and activation, we measured the survival of cultured naïve WT and <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells after BCR cross-linking. The results of this experiment revealed that cell survival was comparable in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>, left panel). Moreover, when IL-4 and IL-5 were added to the culture medium, both WT and <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells underwent robust proliferation as highlighted by the multiple peaks of CTV dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>), indicating that in spite of their signalling impairment, <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells can be activated ex vivo. Next we compared the activation of WT and <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells in response to stimulation through TLR4, TLR9 or CD40, and found that in all tested conditions, both cell types proliferated to the same extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). To evaluate the role of ITSN2 in integrating BCR and TLR9 signals, we stimulated naïve WT and <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells with particles coated with IgM and CpG, and measured proliferation after 3 days. We observed comparable proliferation patterns for WT and <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>). These results indicate that ITSN2 deletion does not compromise B cell proliferation ex vivo in response to a range of soluble stimuli.

ITSN2 deficiency hindered early signalling downstream of BCR engagement and cytoskeleton remodelling triggered by antigen recognition, but did not compromise B cell activation ex vivo. However, ITSN2 deletion in B cells in vivo resulted in mice with severely impaired formation of GC B cells, reduced antibody responses and incomplete protection after Flu vaccination. Furthermore, in vivo, activation of <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells was impaired, and the cells expressed reduced amounts of surface receptors involved in mediating interactions between B and T cells. As a consequence, ITSN2 deficiency in B cells impaired the establishment of long term conjugates with cognate T cells.</p><p>The characterisation of the adaptive immune response during viral infection or immunisation highlighted that ITSN2 deletion causes severe defects in the differentiation of GC B cells and production of high affinity antibodies. These results are in line with the role of ITSN2-interaction partners WIP, WASp, and N-WASP in B cell function; indeed, B cells lacking WIP or both WASp and N-WASp are also impaired in entering the GC reaction and producing antibodies after vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keppler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Westerberg et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, ablation of DOCK8, another multimodular adaptor with GEF activity, in the B cell compartment causes defects in the generation of long term antibody responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Randall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruusala and Aspenström, 2004</xref>). Notably, mutations in <italic>WAS</italic>, WIPF1 or DOCK8 have been reported in human immunodeficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sullivan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), underscoring the importance of these cytoskeleton regulators during immune responses. Interestingly, ITSN2 has been identified as a potential candidate for primary immunodeficiency in a bioinformatics screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keerthikumar et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, ITSN2 was found to be overexpressed in B lymphocytes from patients with Sjögren’s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lessard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miceli-Richard et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The BCR engagement of membrane-tethered ligands leads to the formation of antigen microclusters and triggers a complex signalling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurosaki et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we found that ITSN2 is recruited to the plasma membrane upon BCR engagement, and although it is not directly recruited to antigen microclusters, both ITSN2 isoforms were rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after antigen binding to the BCR. In various cell lines, ITSN2 phosphorylation has been reported in response to stimulation by estrogen growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Novokhatska et al., 2013</xref>). Antigen engagement by the BCR leads to the activation of the Src family kinases and Syk, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple effectors, including Igα and Igβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurosaki et al., 2010</xref>). This promotes the recruitment of proteins containing Src homology (SH2) domains that play a central role in propagating BCR signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dal Porto et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, ITSN2 was found to interact with the SH2 domains of multiple proteins, such as Fyn, Grb2 or else PLCγ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Novokhatska et al., 2013</xref>). However, the precise functional consequences of ITSN2 phosphorylation in the context of BCR stimulation are still to be investigated in detail.</p><p><italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells were selectively impaired in forming actin foci in response to BCR signalling. Interestingly, WIP deficiency in B cells also compromises the appearance of these actin nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keppler et al., 2015</xref>). In T cells, similar actin-rich structures have been proposed to be sites of WASp-dependent actin polymerisation, to participate in PLCγ1 activation, and were missing in T cells deficient in WASp and N-WASp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumari et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the similarity of the defects in actin morphology caused by deletion of ITSN2, WIP and WASp interrogates whether these proteins participate in the same signalling axis to regulate actin remodelling after antigen engagement of the BCR. Such interconnection has been reported in the context of Vaccinia virus infection, during which ITSN1, the other member of the intersectin family, was reported to collaborate with Nck and Cdc42 to promote N-WASp dependent actin polymerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Humphries et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Antigen binding to the BCR leads to antigen internalization into endosomal compartments, trafficking of the internalized antigen to lysosomes for proteolytic cleavage, loading of peptide antigens onto MHCII molecules, and subsequent presentation to cognate T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amigorena et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lanzavecchia, 1985</xref>). We found that B cells lacking ITSN2 were as effective as WT cells in antigen internalization and presentation, indicating that ITSN2 is dispensable for these processes. In the context of T-dependent responses, antigen presentation by B cells is critical for the establishment of the Tfh population. Tfh cells are strictly required for the generation of high-affinity, class-switched antibodies and for the establishment of B cell memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vinuesa and Cyster, 2011</xref>). Tfh differentiation and function relies on multiple signals, including contact-dependent interactions between TCR and MHCII-peptide conjugates, ICOS or CD28 and their respective ligands ICOS-L and CD80/CD86, and soluble signals derived from cytokines, such as IL21 or IL6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crotty, 2015</xref>). Notably, animals deficient for ITSN2 show reduced numbers of B cells engaged in the GC reaction, but comparable or increased numbers of Tfh cells. This may be due to the fact that antigen presentation is not defective in <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells.</p><p>Interactions between GC B cells and Tfh cells occur predominantly in the GC light zone, and are key for the affinity-based selection of GC B cells. Hypermutated GC B cells with higher affinity capture more antigen from FDCs than lower affinity variants, present more MHCII-peptide conjugates, and form longer interactions with cognate Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shulman et al., 2013</xref>). As a result, they receive stronger signals and have a proliferative advantage after re-entering the dark zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gitlin et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, the GC cells were biased to the dark zone, with fewer cells exhibiting the light zone markers. This may be explained by defects <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells presented in establishing long-term interactions with cognate T cells.</p><p>ITSN2 deficiency in B cells was associated with reduced length of cognate B-T interactions. In mouse, SAP deletion dramatically impairs antibody responses, as SAP KO T cells fail to establish long term contacts with cognate B cells, and are not retained in the GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crotty et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qi et al., 2008</xref>). SAP is a small adaptor protein mediating signals downstream of receptors of the SLAM family, such as CD84, SLAM or Ly108. T cell intrinsic deficiency in CD84, but not in SLAM or Ly108, is associated to reduced GC formation and to shortened interactions between B and T cells, but without recapitulating the phenotype of SAP inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cannons et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kageyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCausland et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The deletion of ITSN2 severely impaired B cell activation in vivo and was associated to decreased expression of various surface receptors both shortly after immunisation and on GC B cells. These results intriguingly mirrors the correlation observed in SAP-deficient T cells between decreased ICOS expression, and impaired formation of B-T conjugates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cannons et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qi et al., 2008</xref>). In particular, <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B cells displayed reduced levels of SLAM and CD84, two receptors of the SLAM family, and of ICOSL. This is particularly relevant, since IL4 production by Tfh cells is SLAM dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yusuf et al., 2010</xref>), while that of IL21 is dependent on ICOS triggering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morita et al., 2011</xref>). The reduced expression of these molecules by in ITSN2 GC B cells could result in reduced cytokine secretion by Tfh cells, and hence hinder their reception of T cell help.</p><p>In contrast, expression of Ly108, another member of the SLAM family, was unaffected by ITSN2 deletion. CD84, SLAM and Ly108 are upregulated by B cells upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cannons et al., 2010</xref>). They can all signal through the intracellular adaptor SAP, and function by engaging into homotypic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Latour et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, the singularity of Ly108 function is its ability to mediate a strong inhibitory signal, as deficiency in Ly108 is sufficient to alleviate the SAP requirement for the GC reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kageyama et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> GC B cells express reduced levels of SLAM and CD84, but not of Ly108, which could alter the signalling mediated by these receptors, and hence the outcome of B-T interactions.</p><p>In summary, we have delineated a role for ITSN2, an interacting partner of Cdc42, WASp, and WIP, in generating optimal immune responses. We probed the function of this protein in the B cell compartment by studying ITSN2 deficient mice and mixed BM chimeras and using a combination of immunisation and infection experiments. Our results identify ITSN2 as a regulator of B cell activation, engagement into the GC reaction and cognate B-T interactions. They open new perspectives to understand the intricate regulatory network underlying cognate interactions between B and T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Itsn2</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>ENSMUSG00000020640; MGI:1338049</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>Itsn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic></td><td>KOMP consortium</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5631233">MGI:5631233</ext-link></td><td>Itsn2<sup>tm1.1(KOMP)Vlcg</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">µMT</td><td valign="bottom">doi:10.1038/350423a0</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_HAR:1682">IMSR_HAR:1682</ext-link></td><td>(beta)-globin (mu)MT<sup>-/-</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">MD4</td><td valign="bottom">doi:10.1038/334676a0</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5006966">MGI:5006966</ext-link></td><td>Tg(IghelMD4)4Ccg</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">OTII</td><td valign="bottom">doi:10.1046/j.1440–1711.1998.00709.x</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:004194">IMSR_JAX:004194</ext-link></td><td>B6.Cg-Tg(TcraTcrb)425Cbn/J</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>A20 cells with HEL-specific D1.3 BCR</td><td valign="bottom">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80580–4</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (plasmid)</td><td>ITSN2L GFP</td><td>Michael Way</td><td/><td>pEGFP-C1 ITSN2L</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>anti-ITSN2 antibody</td><td>Novus</td><td>NBP1-71833; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11038593">AB_11038593</ext-link></td><td>1:1000 in 5% Milk TBS-T</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>sgRNA1</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>Forward - CACCGTAGCTATAGAGAACTCTTGC; Reverse - AAACGCAAGAGTTCTCTATAGCTAC</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>sgRNA 2</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>Forward - CACCGGGGGTTGTTTCATGATAGGA; Reverse - AAACTCCTATCATGAAACAACCCCC</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Eα peptide</td><td>The Francis Crick Institute peptide chemistry unit; doi:10.1038/353660a0</td><td/><td>Sequence: Biotin-GSGFAKFASFEAQGALANIAVDKA-COOH</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal breeding and generation</title><p>ITSN2<sup>tm1.1Komp(Vlcg)</sup> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5631233">MGI:5631233</ext-link>) animals, where ITSN2 expression is disrupted by the insertion of a LacZ cassette were obtained from the KOMP consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skarnes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Valenzuela et al., 2003</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom, Michael L Dustin is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Michel Nussenzweig as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Burbage and colleagues explore the role of ITSN2, an SH3- containing adaptor protein and a Cdc42 GEF that is associated with Sjogren's syndrome, in B cell activation, germinal center development, and antibody responses against model antigen and viral infection. The study is quite comprehensive and touches on multiple potentially interesting and important topics of the field (e.g. a new player mediating specialized signals downstream of BCR for activation and/or antigen uptake; potential involvement of B-cell cytoskeleton dynamics in regulation of antigen-specific T:B interactions). However, despite a multitude of phenotypes observed in association with the ITSN2 deficiency, mechanistic analyses remain superficial and fragmented. In fact, different parts of the study are not so well connected to one another, and as a whole the study cannot yet reach a firm conclusion on the role of ITSN2 at the cellular, tissue, or the organismal level.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although ITSN2 KO mice show an increased susceptibility to PR8 infection within the first 3-6 days, it is too acute to be explained by potentially abnormal B-cell activation or defective germinal center development (observed on day 7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The readers are left wondering exactly how this phenotype is connected to later parts of the paper, particularly those mechanistic studies. The reviewers could envision two ways to address this gap. (1) its known that natural antibodies and complement play a role in protection of naive mice against flu infection (see Jayasekera, Moseman and Carroll, 2007). The authors surprisingly don't report on basal serum antibodies and ability of these to neutralize the PR8 virus in vitro. If this information is provided and accounts for the early defect then this could be reported as an additional defect that would connect the resistance to flu to a B cell defect and would be sufficient to go forward with studies of vaccination responses. (2) Since most of the study focuses on germinal center and recall responses, could the flu infection be done in the context of vaccination looking for lack of or partly defective protection to re-infection? This could also address the gap, although perhaps the data could be presented after the analysis of GC reactions.</p><p>2) These authors suspected antigen uptake/processing might be impaired in the absence of ITSN2, and three assays in vitro, namely, BCR internalization, direct detection of surface pMHC complexes, and T cell-driven B cell proliferation in culture to test if ITSN2 is required for efficient BCR-mediated antigen uptake and presentation (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). These are important and appropriate assays, especially given the subsequent observation of defective T:B interactions in vivo (Figure 8). However, it is VERY difficult for these in vitro assays to mimic the level of antigen availability and the stringent requirement for cognate T cells that antigen-specific B cells may experience in vivo. The fact that an effect of ITSN2 was not apparent in those in vitro assays may still reflect a sensitivity issue. They should try to test BCR internalization and pMHC levels on WT and ITSN2 KO B cells activated in vivo as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. Also, they should include a group without T cell co-transfer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> to ensure the difference in proliferation seen is T cell-dependent. It is really hard to conceptualize that differences in CD84, SLAM, and ICOSL as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> can explain the defect in proliferation. It remains the more likely scenario that the ITSN2 deficiency impairs BCR signaling and antigen uptake, leading to defects in antigen-specific T:B interactions. The observation that WT and KO B cells respond to NP-LPS differently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) also supports the possibility that defects in BCR and/or TLR signaling is a primary defect. The authors should look harder.</p><p>3) Analysis of the ITSN2 impact on BCR signaling is somewhat superficial, and the authors did not offer an explanation for the difference between reduced CD19/PI3K activities and enhanced ERK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). What about calcium flux after anti-IgM stimulation? Are any of these pathways more or less important for BCR-mediated antigen uptake and CD84/SLAM/ICOSL expression?</p><p>4) The LN explant imaging data in Figure 8 look solid, although it is important to conduct color-switched experiments to ensure the difference seen is not due to different toxicity profiles of the organic fluorescence dyes?</p><p>5) It is probably important to conduct rescue experiments with ITSN2 overexpression in some of the relevant assays. This is to ensure the effect seen with the ITSN2 deficiency is indeed due to ITSN2 but not LacZ, given how the KOMP knockout was made.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26556.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although ITSN2 KO mice show an increased susceptibility to PR8 infection within the first 3-6 days, it is too acute to be explained by potentially abnormal B-cell activation or defective germinal center development (observed on day 7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

We have now measured basal serum antibody titres, and found no notable differences between WT and ITSN2 KO animals. This is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>.</p><p>Our revised version of the manuscript also describes flu infection in the context of vaccination. To address this, we applied a strategy described by Zheng et al., (2016), wherein animals are vaccinated by intravenous injection of hemagglutinin trimer together with Sigma Adjuvant. After 1 month, animals are injected with a lethal dose (1.5x10<sup>5)</sup>of PR8 virus. In response to such challenge, both WT and ITSN2 KO mice exhibited severe weight loss. As expected from this experiment, WT animals started to regain weight at d9 post infection; however, this was not the case for the ITSN2 KO animals, whose weight continued to remain low for the entire duration of the experiment. These results further support the notion that ITSN2 is required for establishing protective responses upon viral infection. They are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. We believe that these results strengthen our study, and thank the reviewers for highlighting this important point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) These authors suspected antigen uptake/processing might be impaired in the absence of ITSN2, and three assays in vitro, namely, BCR internalization, direct detection of surface pMHC complexes, and T cell-driven B cell proliferation in culture to test if ITSN2 is required for efficient BCR-mediated antigen uptake and presentation (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).

To test whether this association could be observed in ITSN2 KO cells, we compared the diffusion coefficient of IgM, IgD and CD19 on WT and ITSN2 KO B cells. We detected a mild increase in CD19 diffusion coefficient in ITSN2 KO B cells, concordant with the model we proposed wherein WIP regulated CD19 phosphorylation by modulating actin dynamics and BCR motility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are any of these pathways more or less important for BCR-mediated antigen uptake and CD84/SLAM/ICOSL expression?</p></disp-quote><p>Expression of CD84, SLAM and ICOSL is increased in B cells upon activation.

Upon reception of the ITSN2 KO strain, we performed experiments (development and immunization) comparing WT, Heterozygous and ITSN2 KO animals.
