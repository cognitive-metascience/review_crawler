These may restrict <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) growth, or progress to central necrosis and cavitation, facilitating pathogen growth. To determine factors leading to Mtb proliferation and host cell death, we used live cell imaging to track Mtb infection outcomes in individual primary human macrophages. Internalization of Mtb aggregates caused macrophage death, and phagocytosis of large aggregates was more cytotoxic than multiple small aggregates containing similar numbers of bacilli. Macrophage death did not result in clearance of Mtb. Rather, it led to accelerated intracellular Mtb growth regardless of prior activation or macrophage type. In contrast, bacillary replication was controlled in live phagocytes. Mtb grew as a clump in dead cells, and macrophages which internalized dead infected cells were very likely to die themselves, leading to a cell death cascade. This demonstrates how pathogen virulence can be achieved through numbers and aggregation states.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22028.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22028.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22028.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every year, around two million people worldwide die from tuberculosis, a disease caused by the bacterium <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb).

However, if a large number of macrophages in a granuloma die, the granuloma’s core liquefies and the structure is coughed up into the airways, from where <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacteria are transmitted to other people. But how do the bacteria manage to cause the extensive death of the cells that are supposed to control the infection?</p><p>By imaging <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in human macrophages using time-lapse microscopy, Mahamed et al. reveal that the bacteria break down macrophage control by serially killing macrophages. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> cells first clump together and ‘gang up’ on a macrophage, which engulfs the clump and dies because the bacteria overwhelm it. This does not kill the bacteria, and they rapidly grow inside the dead macrophage. The dead cell is then cleaned up by another macrophage.

Granulomas, which have a defined anatomical structure as well as segregated expression of immune system related proteins within the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marakalala et al., 2016</xref>), differentiate and mature independent of each other in infected tissues, most often the lung. The process of pulmonary granuloma formation is driven by macrophage phagocytosis of inhaled, viable Mtb, followed by extravasation of monocytes and T cells from the circulation and their accumulation at the site of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramakrishnan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Russell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Russell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barry et al., 2009</xref>). However, granulomas do not always succeed in containing Mtb infection, and different granulomas in the same lung can control the infection or support the growth of the bacilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lenaerts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaplan et al., 2003</xref>). In the latter case, central necrosis within the granuloma, cavity formation, and breach into the airways, results in release of Mtb into the environment and transmission of the infection to another human host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramakrishnan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Russell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Russell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barry et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, while Mtb is considered an intracellular pathogen infecting live cells, its proliferation during active pulmonary tuberculosis occurs in an environment containing many dead cells and cell remnants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaplan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hunter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hunter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Welsh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Irwin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Part of the host response to Mtb infection is the death of the infected phagocyte. Mtb-induced macrophage death has been observed to occur by apoptotic and non-apoptotic mechanisms. Apoptosis was reported to be protective against Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fratazzi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keane et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Molloy et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oddo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behar et al., 2010</xref>). Evidence from mouse macrophages shows that protection is mediated through efferocytosis, the internalization of apoptotic cell fragments by macrophages, leading to the elimination of the Mtb inside the cellular fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2012</xref>). Mtb was also observed to induce non-apoptotic cell death, differentiated from apoptosis by the lack of caspase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2006</xref>), lack of DNA fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keane et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 2006</xref>), and loss of membrane integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dobos et al., 2000</xref>). Mtb was not killed when necrotic cell death was induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Molloy et al., 1994</xref>). Mtb is reported to initiate non-apoptotic cell death by the breakdown of mitochondrial membrane integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duan et al., 2002</xref>), interference with host plasma membrane repair through inhibition of prostaglandin E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Divangahi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Divangahi et al., 2010</xref>), and secretion of a necrosis inducing toxin which kills macrophages by hydrolyzing NAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). The inflammatory effect of non-apoptotic cell death resulting from the immediate loss of membrane integrity upon death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fink and Cookson, 2005</xref>) may allow for the recruitment of additional host phagocytes to the site of infection which may lead to infection spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clay et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, control of Mtb through apoptosis and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gutierrez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Watson et al., 2012</xref>) may dampen the inflammatory response.</p><p>Mtb infection is known to be controlled by the adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooper and Flynn, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flynn et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">1992</xref>) which becomes effective several weeks after exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wolf et al., 2008</xref>), though a study using intravital imaging observed limited T cell effector function in Mtb granulomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egen et al., 2011</xref>). The adaptive immune response controls Mtb by activating macrophages with factors such as interferon gamma (IFNγ) to kill or control the growth of the bacilli, and by targeting infected macrophages with cytotoxic lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooper and Flynn, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flynn et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">1992</xref>). However, given that different infection outcomes can coexist in the same lung, the source for variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Russell et al., 2009</xref>) in infection outcomes at different foci is not well understood. Substantial variability in other biological systems results from positive feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaern et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sigal et al., 2006</xref>). Positive feedback involves a cascade of events such that once an event occurs, the probability that it will occur again is increased. To understand how an environment conducive to bacterial growth and host cell death is sustained, we investigated virulent Mtb infection dynamics in primary human macrophages in vitro using time-lapse microscopy over approximately 80 hr at 10 min resolution.</p><p>We observed that macrophage internalization of Mtb aggregates led to the killing of the host cell, with the frequency of host cell death increasing with aggregate size. Uptake of single large aggregates showed a higher frequency of cell death relative to the uptake of a similar number of bacteria as multiple small aggregates, and the time to death was inversely correlated to aggregate size. Once the host cell was killed, Mtb was able to rapidly grow inside the dead infected macrophage regardless of whether the cells were monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) or alveolar macrophages, or whether the cells were exposed to IFNγ prior to infection. Growth inside dead cells was significantly faster than in the extracellular environment. Once host cell death occurred, other macrophages internalized the dead infected cells, and this rapidly led to their own death, forming a cell death cascade. These observations of a cycle of host cell death followed by bacterial replication could drive Mtb infection dynamics of necrosis and bacterial proliferation in lung granulomas of patients with active tuberculosis disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The number and aggregation state of Mtb internalized by individual cells determines macrophage fate</title><p>We infected human MDM with the virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv strain labelled with red fluorescent protein (RFP) or mCherry expressed under the control of a constitutively active promoter (groEL and smyc’ respectively). We used live cell imaging in Biosafety Level 3 containment over a period of approximately 80 hr to follow the outcome of infection in individual macrophages. MDM cell borders were determined by custom written image analysis software (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>, Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Source code 1</xref>). Time of cell death was determined to be the time point at which movement of internal cellular structures ceased or the cell detached (Materials and methods). This method of death determination was validated in macrophages with the DNA intercalating dye DRAQ7, which only enters the cell when membrane integrity has been compromised due to cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To examine whether Mtb fluorescence is a valid measure of Mtb number, we tracked the increase in Mtb by fluorescence versus colony forming units (CFU) over 3 days of growth. We found a tight correspondence between the two measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), with an incremental increase in fluorescence translating to an incremental increase in the number of bacilli as measured by CFU. Hence, fluorescence measurements reflect Mtb numbers and an increase in Mtb fluorescence reflects Mtb growth.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-22028-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22028.003</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Macrophage internalization of Mtb aggregates.</title><p>Mtb infections of human macrophages were imaged by time-lapse microscopy at a resolution of 10 min between image acquisitions.

The aggregation state of Mtb has been hypothesized to impact host-pathogen interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orme, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sani et al., 2010</xref>). Mtb naturally aggregate, unless cultured with a nonionic detergent such as Tween 80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubos and Middlebrook, 1948</xref>). To minimize modification of the outer surface of Mtb and its aggregation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sani et al., 2010</xref>), we grew Mtb without detergent for several replication cycles and gently broke up aggregates resulting from such growth into a heterogeneous population of bacterial aggregation states. Hence, MDM in a single experiment were infected by individual bacteria or multibacterial clumps of various sizes (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). This enabled us to compare the consequences of MDM phagocytosis of different Mtb numbers and aggregation states in the same experiment. We converted Mtb fluorescent signal inside MDM to bacterial numbers by dividing the signal by the mean fluorescence of a single bacterium, with single Mtb obtained by filtering. We then ranked MDM from lowest to highest by the sum of Mtb internalized. This ranking gave the best separation in the frequency of cell death between the top 50% and bottom 50% of ranks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The raw data describing the outcome of the macrophage-Mtb interactions is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>. The full dataset contains the dynamics of macrophage Mtb internalization and fate of 759 MDM, with 720 infected cells and 39 uninfected bystander cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). To compare the death frequencies between cells internalizing different numbers of Mtb over the course of the imaging, we divided the dataset into ten groups of infected cells, where cells internalizing a similar number of Mtb were grouped together and where each group constituted 10% of the total number of infected cells. We also compared death frequency to a group of bystander cells which did not phagocytose any Mtb. We then determined the frequency of cell death in each group, and as well as the mean number of Mtb in the group. Macrophage fate was found to depend on the number of Mtb internalized. As the number of bacteria internalized increased, there was more cell death and it occurred sooner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Phagocytosis of small numbers of Mtb, less than approximately 10 bacilli, did not induce significantly more macrophage death than observed in uninfected bystander cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Above 10 Mtb internalized but below approximately 30, there was a trend toward increased macrophage death relative to bystander cells, but the differences in frequencies were not significant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref> for p-values and significance thresholds). The probability of death increased significantly relative to bystanders and cells with less than 10 Mtb when more than 30 Mtb were internalized per cell over the course of the movie, and a threshold for Mtb to induce death was clearly visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> at about 50 Mtb internalized, with differences relative to bystander and lightly infected cells becoming highly significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22028.004</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Number of Mtb internalized determines probability of macrophage death.</title><p>The death frequency for 720 infected MDM was graphed over time as a function of the sum of Mtb internalized (raw data provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

In order to control for bacterial number, we limited the comparison to cells which internalized an average of approximately 50 Mtb (49.6 ± 18.9 Mtb for macrophages which phagocytosed multiple smaller aggregates, versus 49.4 ± 14.3 for macrophages which phagocytosed one large aggregate), an infection level where approximately one half of infected cells died by the end of our imaging period of 83 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). This infection level was chosen so as to increase sensitivity by excluding very highly infected cells, which died with a high frequency, as well as lightly infected cells, which did not die at an appreciably higher frequency relative to bystanders. We obtained a lower frequency of cell death when infection occurred by multiple smaller pickups compared to single large pickups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). While 47% of the cells died when they accumulated Mtb in three or more internalizations, 71% of the cells died when they internalized a similar mean number of Mtb as one pickup. The difference was significant (p=5×10<sup>−4</sup> by bootstrap). In addition to the summary of the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we also represent the individual cell histories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> for multiple pickups and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> for single pickups).

We represent each cell as a line, with pickup events (denoted as circles or stars, where are circles are internalizations of cell-free Mtb, and stars are internalizations of dead infected cells, both color coded according to the number of Mtb internalized) at a location on the line corresponding to the time of pickup.

Live macrophages internalized Mtb throughout the imaging period, and hence an increase in Mtb fluorescence could be the result of either new Mtb internalized, or existing Mtb growing in the live cell. Therefore, we marked the time each macrophage internalized Mtb, and used a 10 hr tracking window which could be fitted between internalization events for many of the cells. We calculated the median fold change in Mtb in this interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). For comparison, we used an interval of the same length in cells after death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In order to investigate the source of variability and the statistical significance of the data, we fitted the temporal dynamics of Mtb fluorescence of each individual infected MDM with an exponential curve. Variability in Mtb growth was evident in individual slopes in live macrophages, with Mtb growing in some cells and decreasing in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> inset). Mtb growth in dead cells was less variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> inset).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22028.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Mtb growth in macrophages before and after macrophage death.</title><p>Median (circle with dot) and interquartile range (blue rectangle) of Mtb signal in live (<bold>A</bold>) and dead cells (<bold>B</bold>).

A key macrophage activator is IFNγ, secreted by several immune cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chackerian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flesch and Kaufmann, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooper et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flynn et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fenton et al., 1997</xref>).

Infection with aggregates led to cell death which, similarly to untreated MDM, resulted in Mtb growth inside the dead infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The median growth constant in dead MDM treated before death with IFNγ was 0.027 hour<sup>−1</sup> (interquartile range 0.0076 to 0.046), corresponding to a doubling time of 25.8 hr.

We selected from our dataset all live macrophages, which internalized dead infected macrophages before 90% of the video recording elapsed, to avoid cells where we could not capture the death event because it was too close to the end of the movie. While cell-free pickups of Mtb also occurred in some of these cells, internalization of a dead infected cell was the terminal internalization event in all but two of the observed cells. Frequency of cell death was 89% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

Chains of macrophage internalizations of dead infected cells, followed by cell death of the internalizing macrophage and uptake by the next cell, were also seen (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>). We compared the frequency of death from dead cell pickups to the frequency of death in cells internalizing large cell-free aggregates (81–300 bacilli), which had a similar median number of bacteria (dead infected cells contained a median of 114 Mtb, versus 125 Mtb for cell-free aggregates). Death frequency was 81% for cells that internalized cell-free aggregates, and the difference between death frequencies was not significant (p=0.16). This indicated that the highly cytotoxic effect of dead infected cell internalization can be mostly explained by the high number of Mtb they contain.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22028.027</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Internalization of dead infected cells leads to rapid cell death.</title><p>Cells are ranked according to the time of last pickup, with cells ranked highest internalizing earliest.

To model the consequences of host cell death associated with bacterial growth, we performed numerical simulations to determine the number of dead host cells through time. Here, we do not claim to capture the exact dynamics of what occurs in vivo in the diseased lung, but rather illustrate the trend (see Materials and methods for simulation details). We compared the number of dead host cells when the Mtb doubling time in dead cells was one day, versus when it was two days (where two days is within the range of the doubling times observed for extracellular Mtb, which was 22–75 hr for the data presented in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As in the experimental results, host cell death was dependent on the bacterial number internalized, and host cells were restrictive of intracellular bacterial growth when alive and permissive when dead. A one day doubling time yielded substantially higher numbers of dead cells in many of the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, left panels). Strikingly, only the one day doubling time in dead cells resulted in high Mtb growth over the simulation period of 60 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, right panels). High Mtb growth was very sensitive to the doubling time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), and this could not be explained by the differences in doubling time if growth was cell-free (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, white lines in right panels), as both growth rates were rapid for the timescale of the simulations. Rather, this simplified simulation shows the presence of positive feedback in the host cell-Mtb interactions: faster Mtb growth in the dead cell leads to larger intracellular clumps upon phagocytosis by another cell, and hence to a higher probability of death of the phagocytosing cell, leading to Mtb growth in the new dead cell and a higher probability to kill the next phagocyte in the infection chain.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22028.030</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Positive feedback in Mtb infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the positive feedback loop.

While it can be inferred that high bacillary loads cause host cell death, this view is incomplete, as it lacks insight into the dynamic interactions between host cells and bacilli which cause the buildup of bacterial numbers and host necrosis at a particular site. Furthermore, since Mtb clumps are present in vivo, it is necessary to consider the effect of clumps on the dynamics of the host-pathogen interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orme, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sani et al., 2010</xref>). This entails using non-detergent treated Mtb capable of aggregate formation. Here we used time-lapse microscopy of detergent untreated Mtb infection of primary human macrophages to map out the interactions between Mtb and the host macrophages. We quantified host cell-Mtb dynamics over 80 hr of growth at a 10 min resolution between time-lapse frames, necessary to capture several replication cycles of this slow growing pathogen.

If breach of the phagolysosomal membrane precedes death in Mtb infection, one reason for the increased cytotoxicity of aggregates may include increased membrane breaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rodríguez-Muela et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sargeant et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boya and Kroemer, 2008</xref>). In addition, Mtb induced mitochondrial membrane breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duan et al., 2002</xref>), interference with host plasma membrane repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Divangahi et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2010</xref>), and toxin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun et al., 2015</xref>) would all be expected to scale with Mtb number per macrophage.</p><p>Host cell death did not eliminate intracellular Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), consistent with previous reports at the cell population level showing that Mtb induced necrosis does not clear the bacilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fratazzi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Molloy et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dobos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Divangahi et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tobin et al., 2012</xref>), and that upregulation of <italic>Ipr1</italic>, which switches the host response to Mtb from necrosis to apoptosis in mice, limits Mtb growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pan et al., 2005</xref>). Pre-stimulation with IFNγ or use of alveolar macrophages instead of MDM did not substantially alter the ability of Mtb to survive host cell death. These observations differ from results showing that efferocytosis leads to the elimination of Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2012</xref>). However, the protective effect of efferocytosis may occur when cells die by apoptosis and the number of bacilli inside the dead cell is small while the number of uninfected macrophages is large, enabling the surrounding macrophages to divide up the bacillary load of a single dead infected cell. This was not the case in our experiments.</p><p>The observation that Mtb growth was slowest in live cells, intermediate in the extracellular environment, and most robust in dead infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), suggest that the dead cell may provide Mtb with a favorable growth niche relative to the intact phagosome in live cells or the extracellular environment, while live cells provide a poor growth environment either because of antimicrobial effector mechanisms or reduced access to nutrients in the Mtb compartment. Our results indicating acidification of Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>) are consistent with the presence of antimicrobial effector mechanisms that reduce Mtb growth in Mtb compartmentalized to the phagosome. Mtb can inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion and complete phagosome acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vergne et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rohde et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Via et al., 1997</xref>). However, acidification may occur when macrophages are activated with cytokines such GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denis and Ghadirian, 1990</xref>), as are the MDMs used for this study. In this case, Mtb growth may be impaired or arrested in acidified vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomes et al., 1999</xref>). Acidification was lost immediately upon cell death (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>). However, loss of antimicrobial effector mechanisms may not be the only factor responsible for robust growth in dead cells, as growth is faster than in the extracellular medium, indicating that Mtb may have access to cytosolic nutrient sources, which promote growth in other intracellular pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Appelberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ray et al., 2009</xref>). If Mtb growth in the dead cells was solely dependent of leakage of nutrients from the extracellular environment, the intracellular bacilli would not be expected to replicate any faster than extracellular Mtb. This is clearly not what we observe.</p><p>In these experiments we used a pure macrophage culture to investigate the outcome of macrophage-Mtb interactions. In the granuloma, the presence of other cell types can influence outcomes. Particularly relevant are the T cell subsets of the adaptive cellular immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooper and Flynn, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flynn et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mogues et al., 2001</xref>). T cells control Mtb by activating macrophages to kill Mtb through IFNγ secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flynn et al., 1993</xref>), and CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells target intracellular bacteria by granulysin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stenger et al., 1998</xref>), which has been reported to enable granzymes to enter and kill the bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walch et al., 2014</xref>). These mechanisms would counteract the spread of Mtb, but would likely be restricted by the Mtb mediated death of the host cell before recognition and targeting by T cells, limited T cell effector function in the granuloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egen et al., 2011</xref>), lack of T cells in the inner cell layer of granulomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ulrichs et al., 2004</xref>), and impaired expression of perforin and granulysin observed in Mtb granulomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The process we observe likely reflects a positive feedback loop for Mtb replication in late stage infection, as illustrated by the outcomes of the simplified model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. At this infection stage, localized expansion of Mtb numbers may occur by the following scenario, captured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and strikingly in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>: serial killing is initiated when a human macrophage internalizes a clump of bacilli which causes its death by necrosis. Upon death, Mtb rapidly grows in the dead cell, with a doubling time faster than either in the extracellular environment or in live cells (where growth is minimal). The next macrophage to internalize the Mtb, this time encased in a dead cell, faces a larger Mtb clump and also dies. The new dead infected cell now provides fuel for the next round of bacterial growth and bait for the next macrophage. This illustrates how, once initiated, Mtb replication can be locally stabilized in the active state.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethical statement</title><p>Blood was obtained from adult healthy volunteers after written informed consent (University of KwaZulu-Natal Institutional Review Board approval BE022/13).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including David G Russell (Reviewer #3), and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper by Mahamed and colleagues is conceptually simple, that the size of bacterial aggregates internalized by host phagocytes determines the outcome of the interaction, and that if this outcome is host cell death it triggers a rapid burst of bacterial replication. This is an attractive concept that may have biological significance in late stage, localized expansion of bacterial numbers that likely drives the breakdown of bacterial containment and mobilizes the tissue damage required for transmission. It is the accelerated intracellular growth in this setting that is particularly novel. The findings are generally consistent with in vivo observations adding relevance to the study. Other strengths of the study are in the careful and sophisticated design of experiments, elegant quantitative live cell imaging and mathematical modeling of macrophage cell death and <italic>M. Tuberculosis</italic> dynamics. Having said this, the description of the potential mechanisms involved is limited and these are not explored. The authors can improve the figures a bit to help the reader. Finally, the heavy emphasis on what occurs in the granuloma is a bit of a stretch when using a pure macrophage culture since the presence of the other cell types can certainly influence the findings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Further rationale for the parameters for the Mtb dynamics simulations and some type of validation or sensitivity analysis should be done. The doubling time of 565 hours (23-24 days!) in live cells is rather remarkable.</p><p>A major drawback of the paper is the lack of mechanism. There is no mechanism for why Mtb grows better in dead macrophages, i.e. is it in the phagosome, is it metabolizing released lipids, is it the local environment providing acquisition of nutrients into a dying leaky cell, or loss of antimicrobial effector mechanisms or others? The discussion is largely a recapitulation of the data. Nor is their definition of the mechanism on how TB induces cell death based on bacilli number and/or clumps. The authors should further consider potential mechanisms for the observations.</p><p>Another major drawback is some methodology. A strain of Mtb expressing RFP is used and the amount of TB quantified by measuring the amount of protein. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, an increase in TB of 1.1 fold is seen at 3 hours, since the doubling time is about 20 hrs, is this is due to an increase in surface area preceding cell division, or the division of bacteria that were already in that process prior to infection? There is no validation with quantification of actual TB. CFUs should be done on some experiments.</p><p>The figures are very confusing. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, is this an example and what exactly does the rank mean, not what is on the right?

However, the effectiveness of these would be restricted in late stage disease (Discussion section):</p><p>“In these experiments we used a pure macrophage culture to investigate the outcome of macrophage-Mtb interactions. […] These mechanisms would counteract the spread of Mtb, but would likely be restricted by Mtb mediated death of the host cell before recognition and targeting by T cells, limited T cell effector function in the granuloma (Egen et al., 2011), lack of T cells in the inner cell layer of granulomas (Ulrichs et al., 2004), and impaired expression of perforin and granulysin observed in Mtb granulomas (Andersson et al., 2007).”</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Further rationale for the parameters for the Mtb dynamics simulations and some type of validation or sensitivity analysis should be done. The doubling time of 565 hours (23-24 days!) in live cells is rather remarkable.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers are correct that 565 hours is too exact a number given the interquartile range of the data, and the fact that at slow growth rates, small changes in slope are heavily magnified in terms of the doubling time, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>, around a slope of zero:<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22028.035</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22028.035">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22028.035</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22028-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>We therefore substitute 565 hours with a doubling time of &gt;100 hours (Results section, subsection “Mtb clumps are not eliminated by macrophage death and rapidly grow inside the dead cell”, third paragraph). This doubling time, corresponding to a slope of ~0.07 (marked by blue vertical line in the figure), is before the doubling time becomes highly sensitive to the slope.</p><p>Regarding simulation parameters, a doubling time of one day is what we observed experimentally for Mtb in dead cells. Since the comparison was to a longer doubling time, we chose for simplicity a doubling time of 2 days. This is well within the range of Mtb growth. For example, the doubling time range for extracellular Mtb is 22-75 hours for the data shown in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. This is now described in the Results section:</p><p>“We compared the number of dead host cells when the Mtb doubling time in dead cells was 1 day, versus when it was 2 days (where two days is within the range of the doubling times observed for extracellular Mtb, which was 22-75 hours for the data presented in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).”</p><p>To examine the sensitivity of Mtb growth in the system to doubling time, we repeated the stochastic simulations using doubling times ranging from 1 to 3 days, and asked in what fraction of the simulations the number of Mtb expanded by more than 3 orders of magnitude (from 1 to &gt;1000 bacilli).</p><p>The result shows that in a system where 1) Mtb growth depends on macrophage death, and 2) macrophage death depends on the clump size internalized, Mtb expansion is very sensitive to the doubling time in the dead infected cells.</p><p>These results are presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>: Sensitivity of Mtb expansion to doubling time in dead cells. They are also described in the Results section: “High Mtb growth was very sensitive to the doubling time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>)”</p><p>A description was also added to the Methods:</p><p>“To examine the sensitivity of the number of Mtb after 60 days to doubling time, we ranged t<sub>d</sub> from 1 to 3 days, and calculated the fraction of the simulations in which the number of Mtb expanded by more than 3 orders of magnitude (from 1 to &gt;1000 bacilli).”</p><p><italic>A major drawback of the paper is the lack of mechanism. There is no mechanism for why Mtb grows better in dead macrophages, i.e. is it in the phagosome, is it metabolizing released lipids, is it the local environment providing acquisition of nutrients into a dying leaky cell, or loss of antimicrobial effector mechanisms or others. The discussion is largely a recapitulation of the data.</italic> </p><p>To understand the factors allowing for robust Mtb growth in dead but not live macrophages, we performed an experiment where we labelled the Mtb with pHrodo, an Mtb binding dye that fluoresces at low pH. We observed that preceding death, Mtb show pHrodo fluorescence, indicating that in our system Mtb are in an acidified phagosome. Hence, the growth suppression we observe in live cells makes sense. Dramatically, upon cell death, the acidified compartment disappears, as now shown in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-D</xref>, where the method is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, and the result summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>.</p><p>A description is now added to the Results section:</p><p>“To understand the mechanism behind the very slow growth in live MDM versus robust growth in dead MDM, we labelled Mtb with the pH detection dye pHrodo prior to MDM infection. […] Upon cell death, this compartmentalization disappeared.”</p><p>The method is described in the Methods section:</p><p>“pHrodo labeling. Mtb was labelled with 100 µM pHrodo Green STP Ester (Thermo Fisher) in 100 mM sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5 for 30 minutes at room temperature, and then washed 3 times with phosphate buffered saline before proceeding to infection of MDMs. The DNA intercalating dye DRAQ7 was used at 3µM in the same experiments to detect cell death.”</p><p>This result implies that antimicrobial effector mechanisms were lost upon death. However, this does not fully explain the rapid Mtb growth in dead cells relative to the extracellular medium. If Mtb growth in the dead cells was solely dependent of leakage of nutrients from the extracellular environment, the intracellular bacilli would not be expected to replicate any faster than extracellular Mtb. Instead, our results are consistent with Mtb gaining access to cytosolic nutrient sources, which promote growth in other intracellular pathogens.</p><p>We have added a discussion of the mechanisms in the Discussion section:</p><p>“[…] the dead cell may provide Mtb with a favorable growth niche relative to the intact phagosome in live cells or the extracellular environment, while live cells provide a poor growth environment either because of antimicrobial effector mechanisms or reduced access to nutrients in the Mtb compartment. […] If Mtb growth in the dead cells was solely dependent of leakage of nutrients from the extracellular environment, the intracellular bacilli would not be expected to replicate any faster than extracellular Mtb. This is clearly not what we observe.”</p><p><italic>Nor is their definition of the mechanism on how TB induces cell death based on bacilli number and/or clumps. The authors should further consider potential mechanisms for the observations.</italic> </p><p>We have now added discussion about possible reasons why clumps cause cell death (Discussion section):</p><p>“If breach of the phagolysosomal membrane precedes death in Mtb infection, one reason for the increased cytotoxicity of aggregates may include increased membrane breaching (rodriquez-Muela et al., 2015; Sargeant et al., 2014; Boya and Kroemer, 2008). In addition, Mtb induced mitochondrial membrane breakdown (Duan et al., 2002), interference with host plasma membrane repair (Divangahi et al., 2009; Divangahi et al., 2010), and toxin secretion (Sun et al., 2015) would all be expected to scale with Mtb number per macrophage.”</p><p><italic>Another major drawback is some methodology. A strain of Mtb expressing RFP is used and the amount of TB quantified by measuring the amount of protein. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, an increase in TB of 1.1 fold is seen at 3 hours, since the doubling time is about 20 hrs, is this is due to an increase in surface area preceding cell division, or the division of bacteria that were already in that process prior to infection?</italic> </p><p>In an unsynchronized culture, an increase of fluorescence from 1 to 1.1 would be the result of some bacteria increasing in surface area and others dividing. We have validated that an incremental increase in fluorescence corresponds to a similar increase in CFU (see point 1 in the discussion of the validation below).</p><p><italic>There is no validation with quantification of actual TB. CFUs should be done on some experiments.</italic> </p><p>We have now validated fluorescence as a measurement of bacterial number by CFU in two experiments:</p><p>1) We have tracked the growth of our fluorescent strain both by fluorescence and CFU over 3 days. We found a tight correspondence between the two measures. The results are presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and described in the Results section:</p><p>“To examine whether Mtb fluorescence is a valid measure of Mtb number, we tracked the increase in Mtb by fluorescence versus by colony forming units (CFU) over 3 days of growth. We found a tight correspondence between the two measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), with an incremental increase in fluorescence translating to an incremental increase in the number of bacilli as measured by CFU. Hence, fluorescence measurements reflect Mtb numbers and increase in Mtb fluorescence reflects Mtb growth.”</p><p>2) We have redone the experiment comparing intracellular Mtb growth in dead cells versus Mtb extracellular growth. This was possible to do in bulk culture since we could increase the dose of Mtb until 99% of macrophages died, and compare it to the same dose of Mtb, but grown extracellularly. We observed a dramatic difference between cell-free growth and intracellular growth in dead cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), validating the conclusions from the time-lapse data.</p><p>The data are described in the Results section:</p><p>“We confirmed these results by CFU, quantifying the number of Mtb after 3 days of growth in dead MDM versus extracellular growth in MDM medium. […] We recovered approximately an order of magnitude more Mtb by CFU after growth in dead cells versus after growth in the MDM extracellular medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).”</p><p><italic>The figures are very confusing. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, is this an example and what exactly does the rank mean, not what is on the right?</italic> </p><p>We have now represented the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> as a standard heat map, with time on the x-axis and mean number of Mtb internalized on the y-axis. The method by which this was done is described in the figure legend. The previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>.The result is described in the Results section:</p><p>“To compare the death frequencies between cells internalizing different numbers of Mtb over the course of the imaging, we divided the dataset into ten groups of infected cells, where cells internalizing a similar number of Mtb were grouped together and where each group constituted 10% of the total number of infected cells. […] As the number of bacteria internalized increased, there was more cell death and it occurred sooner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).”</p><p>Unlike the previous representation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, which we agree with the referees was difficult to interpret because of the large amount of data, this simplified and smoothened representation makes it clear that there is a threshold for cell death as a function of the number of Mtb phagocytosed. This is now described in the Results section:</p><p>“[…] a threshold for Mtb to induce death was clearly visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> at about 50 Mtb internalized, with differences relative to bystander and lightly infected cells becoming highly significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>).”</p><p><italic>The stats are not clear in the text, figure or legend. I am not convinced that this represents that the aggregate size determines the probability of macrophage death.</italic> </p><p>In order to clarify the calculation of significance, we introduce <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>. In part A, we show another representation of the data – the fraction of dead cells in each group of cells over time as a curve.</p><p>In part B, the p-value for the significance of the death frequency at the end of the movie (last point on each of the curves) is determined by bootstrap and presented as a table, where the frequency of each group of cells is compared to each of the groups with a lower mean number of Mtb. Values which are tested for significance using a stringent significance threshold of 0.005, where α=0.05 for single comparisons was adjusted for n=10 comparisons by the Bonferroni method. The higher stringency resulted in some values on the borderline of significance from previous version of the paper falling below the significance threshold this time. The significant results using this threshold are in bold.</p><p>We provide the source code for the bootstrap statistical analysis as Source code 2. The bootstrap is now described in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref> legend.</p><p>We now also describe these results in the Results section:</p><p>“Phagocytosis of small numbers of Mtb, less than approximately 10 bacilli, did not induce significantly more macrophage death than observed in uninfected bystander cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). […] The probability of death increased significantly relative to bystanders and cells with less than 10 Mtb when more than 30 Mtb were internalized per cell over the course of the movie, and a threshold for Mtb to induce death was clearly visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> at about 50 Mtb internalized, with differences relative to bystander and lightly infected cells becoming highly significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>).”</p><p>We clarify the programs used to generate the statistical results in the Methods section:</p><p>“Statistical significance Where noted, bootstrap (Efron and Tibshirani, 1994) was used to determine statistical significance. […] Statistical analysis not using bootstrap was performed using Graphpad Prism 6 and identified in the figure legends.”</p><p>We now provide two references in the Methods section for the statistical technique and the correction for multiple hypotheses:</p><p>81) Efron B &amp; Tibshirani RJ (1994) An introduction to the bootstrap (CRC press).</p><p>82) Noble WS (2009) How does multiple testing correction work? Nature biotechnology 27(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">12</xref>):1135-1137.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> does not clearly demonstrate what is claimed. It should be obvious. These are two examples that permeate the figures.</italic> </p><p>We have now added summary panel A to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> that shows the data represented as survival curves.We have kept the single cell representations, but modified them to make it clearer that we are comparing multiple small Mtb pickups to one large pickup by both color and size coding the pickups.</p><p>We clarify how we chose the two comparison groups in the Results section, and describe the outcomes:</p><p>“In order to control for bacterial number, we limited the comparison to cells which internalized an average of approximately 50 Mtb (49.6 ± 18.9 Mtb for macrophages which phagocytosed multiple smaller aggregates, versus 49.4 ± 14.3 for macrophages which phagocytosed one large aggregate), an infection level where approximately one half of infected cells died by the end of our imaging period of 83 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). […] The difference was significant (p=5x10<sup>-4</sup> by bootstrap). In addition to the summary of the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we also represent the individual cell histories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> for multiple pickups and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> for single pickups).”</p><p>We have also modified the single cell graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> to increase clarity. We note that we are trying to describe a complex process: we track individual macrophages that phagocytose different numbers of Mtb in different states at different times, and may or may not die as a result. Hence, there is an inherent limit to how much the data can be simplified without losing information. We state this in the Results section, and further clarify the single cell representations:</p><p>“The data is inherently complex as it tracks individual macrophages which phagocytose different numbers of Mtb in different states at different times, and may or may not die as a result. […] If macrophage death occurs, line color changes from green to dark blue at time of death.”</p><p>We also further clarify the single cell representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> in the Results section:</p><p>“We therefore compared macrophages which internalized single clumps of Mtb during the first half of the imaging period, to increase the measurable time to death, if it occurred. […] In contrast, the time to cell death appeared to be clearly linked to the time of pickup when the number of Mtb in the clump was large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).”</p><p>Furthermore, we clarify <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> by simplifying the cell panel In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> by deleting the DRAQ7 only images and only showing the overlays.We the introduce Figure panel B to make it clear how we quantified the results, and panel C to summarize the results.</p><p><italic>Consider dropping the last sentence. The days of &quot;might provide a novel target for therapeutic intervention&quot; without any rationale or route to intervention have long since past.</italic> </p><p>We thank the referees for pointing out that the paper could be concluded better. We have now dropped the last sentence and replaced it with the essential message of the paper, paraphrasing some of the summary provided by the referees:</p><p>“The process we observe likely reflects a positive feedback loop for Mtb replication in late stage infection, as illustrated by the outcomes of the simplified model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. […] This illustrates how, once initiated, Mtb replication can be locally stabilized in the active state.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
