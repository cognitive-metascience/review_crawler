that act as bacterial virulence factors and effectors in immune defence. Upon binding to the membrane, they convert from the soluble monomeric form to oligomeric, membrane-inserted pores. Using real-time atomic force microscopy (AFM), electron microscopy (EM), and atomic structure fitting, we have mapped the structure and assembly pathways of a bacterial CDC in unprecedented detail and accuracy, focussing on suilysin from <italic>Streptococcus suis</italic>. We show that suilysin assembly is a noncooperative process that is terminated before the protein inserts into the membrane. The resulting ring-shaped pores and kinetically trapped arc-shaped assemblies are all seen to perforate the membrane, as also visible by the ejection of its lipids. Membrane insertion requires a concerted conformational change of the monomeric subunits, with a marked expansion in pore diameter due to large changes in subunit structure and packing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04247.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04247.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04247.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many disease-causing bacteria secrete toxic proteins that drill holes into our cells to kill them.

They form two branches of the largest superfamily of pore-forming proteins. Proteins of this MACPF/CDC superfamily share a common core topology of a highly bent and twisted β-sheet flanked by two α-helical regions, though lacking any detectable sequence homology between the two branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rosado et al., 2008</xref>). Crystal structures of CDCs in their soluble, monomeric form (perfringolysin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rossjohn et al., 1997</xref>; anthrolysin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bourdeau et al., 2009</xref>; suilysin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; listeriolysin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Köster et al., 2014</xref>) revealed extended, key-shaped molecules. Pore-forming domains 1 and 3 (see also below) are linked by a long thin β-sheet (domain 2) to an immunoglobulin fold domain (4) which can bind to the membrane via a tryptophan-rich loop. CDCs form heterogeneous rings and arcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tilley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sonnen et al., 2014</xref>) on cholesterol-rich liposomes and lipid monolayers (for example, the CDC perfringolysin O hardly binds to membranes with &lt;30% molar concentration of cholesterol, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>). Extensive biophysical and molecular analysis of CDCs established that, on CDC binding to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ramachandran et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hotze et al., 2012</xref>), α-helical regions in domain 3 unfurl to form transmembrane β-hairpins, denoted as TMH1 and TMH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shepard et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shatursky et al., 1999</xref>). If the TMH regions are trapped by introducing a disulphide bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hotze et al., 2001</xref>), prepore oligomers are formed on the membrane surface. Cryo-EM and single particle analysis of liposome-bound CDCs led to low-resolution 3D structures of prepore and pore forms of pneumolysin, a major virulence factor of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tilley et al., 2005</xref>). These structures, as well as an AFM study of perfringolysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</xref>), established that the 11 nm high molecule must collapse to a height of 7 nm above the membrane in order to insert the TMH regions. Simple pseudo-atomic models were obtained by fitting domains (broken at plausible hinge points) into the EM density maps. It was proposed that the long, thin β-sheet domain 2 collapses after the molecule opens up to release the TMH regions. However, because of the heterogeneity of the oligomeric assemblies and aggregation of the liposomes upon pore formation, resolution has been limited by the difficulty of obtaining sufficiently large data sets.</p><p>After comparing several CDCs (pneumolysin, suilysin, anthrolysin, and listeriolysin), we found that suilysin was less susceptible to these problems and we chose it to pursue new structural and dynamic studies. A disulphide-locked double cysteine mutant of suilysin, designed to prevent TMH1 insertion, enabled us to trap an active prepore state as well as to visualize the pore formation process by AFM in solution. Cryo-EM reconstruction and fitting revealed new details of the β-sheet unbending and changes in subunit packing upon conversion of prepores to pores. AFM images reveal that the prepore state is highly mobile. Following the addition of DTT to trigger insertion of the disulphide-locked prepore, time-lapse AFM yielded real-time movies of its conversion to ring and crescent-shaped pores. The observed distributions of rings and arcs can be explained by a theoretical model for kinetically trapped, noncooperative assembly, fully determined by the relative kinetics of monomer binding to the membrane and monomer assembly on the membrane surface. Together these studies provide substantial new understanding of the structure and dynamics of CDC pore formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conformational changes in prepore and pore states determined by cryo-EM</title><p>Negative stain EM and rotational symmetry analysis of complete rings of disulphide locked (Gly52Cys/Ser187Cys) suilysin prepores and wild-type pores formed on lipid monolayers revealed that most rings contain 37 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Unexpectedly, the diameter of the 37-fold suilysin prepore was smaller than the diameter of the 37-fold pore (see below for quantification), indicating that conformational changes during pore formation are accompanied by changes in subunit packing.</p><p>3D reconstruction of suilysin prepores and pores in liposomes was performed using a pseudo single-particle approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tilley et al., 2005</xref>), yielding a 15 Å cryo-EM map of the prepore using the disulphide-locked construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D</xref>), and a 15 Å cryo-EM map of a wild-type suilysin pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,F</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The 3D maps, both of 37-mers, confirmed a significant expansion in ring diameter upon pore formation. In order to interpret the maps, we performed flexible fitting of suilysin domains from the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; PDB:3hvn). Domain deformations and hinge movements were identified by normal mode analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lindahl et al., 2006</xref>). Additional evidence for the correctness of the fits followed from electrostatic potential maps and analysis of interacting residues at the interfaces of domain 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The results show that both models have extended regions of complementary charge on the predicted interacting surfaces. Although the extent of complementary charge is less in the pore model, in this case the oligomer is stabilized by the β-barrel of the pore. Measured from the fitted position of the base of domain 4, the prepore and pore diameters are 296 Å and 319 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), an expansion of 8%. In addition to the 4 nm reduction in height, each pore subunit approximately doubles in width.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04247.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structural transitions during pore formation.</title><p>3D cryo-EM maps of 37-mer prepore and pore forms of suilysin are shown with fitted atomic structures.

Both rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and arcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) enclosed local depressions in the membrane, the depth of which was tip-dependent, but in many cases exceeded the 2.2 nm length of an extended lipid molecule, indicating that the lipid bilayer was locally removed. These depressions were reproducible between the trace and retrace versions of the AFM line scans and were observed for various lengths and orientations of the arcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We therefore conclude that suilysin can perforate the membrane irrespective of the completion of the ring assembly, locally removing the lipids to create partial β-barrel pores with an unsealed edge of the lipid bilayer. This is in agreement with recent cryo electron tomography data on pneumolysin assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sonnen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Besides isolated rings and arcs, we observed interlocked arcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, arrows), in which one or both ends of the arc contacted another arc or ring.

The distributions show a broad peak centred between lengths of 10–30 monomers and a smaller, narrow peak corresponding to completed rings of about 37 monomers. The arc-length distributions for disulphide-locked prepores and pores after reduction by DTT are practically identical. Combined with the observation that suilysin does not oligomerize before binding to the cholesterol-containing membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), this demonstrates that assembly is completely determined and terminated in the prepore state, i.e., is not affected by the prepore-to-pore transition.

Under given conditions such as incubation temperature, lipid composition, protein sequence and concentration, these distributions are reproducible between EM and AFM experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The similarity between prepore and pore distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>) implies that oligomerization is arrested before pore insertion. Therefore, our work rigorously establishes that the whole CDC assembly takes place in the prepore state, as was previously suggested for perfringolysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hotze et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hotze and Tweten, 2012</xref>).</p><p>As can be deduced from the prevalence of larger but incomplete assemblies of the disulphide-locked suilysin, the association of such larger oligomers (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">≳</mml:mi><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> subunits) is not a determining factor in membrane pore formation by CDCs. On the contrary, the oligomerization appears to be dominated by monomer addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), although the addition of smaller oligomers (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">≲</mml:mi><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> subunits) cannot be fully excluded. As demonstrated by our oligomerization model, the measured arc-length distributions are consistent with the kinetically trapped product of a two-stage irreversible and noncooperative reaction. The outcome is largely determined by the ratio of the corresponding rate constants and the density of monomers per unit area of membrane (in addition to the effects of steric hindrance at higher surface densities). The first stage can be the binding of monomers to the membrane, as assumed here, or a rate-limiting nucleation step that triggers the oligomerization reaction, as assumed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hotze et al., 2001</xref>). The second stage of this reaction is oligomerization by addition of monomers or very small oligomers. As the rate constants can be expected to vary from one protein to another, this model implies that the various CDCs can yield differing oligomeric populations.</p><p>Suilysin prepore intermediates appear both more mobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–E</xref>) and more flexible than pore assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that the β-sandwich membrane-binding domain 4 does not significantly penetrate the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakamura et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ramachandran et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast to the earlier observations on pneumolysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tilley et al., 2005</xref>), prepore assembly in suilysin is accompanied by some opening of the central β-sheet. A possible explanation for this difference is that the wild-type pneumolysin preparation in that study formed many stable prepores, apparently in an inactive, dead-end state, whereas wild-type suilysin is extremely active and is not observed in a prepore state.</p><p>The activity of wild-type suilysin was greatly impaired, however, by incubating it in the presence of an equal concentration of disulphide-locked suilysin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) and recovered on unlocking the mutant. These results imply that wild-type and mutant co-assemble as expected, and that the prepore-to-pore transition requires a concerted conformational change of all subunits in the suilysin assemblies, suggesting a cooperative insertion of subunits into the membrane.</p><p>The mobility of prepore assemblies on the membrane surface makes it possible for the subunits to slide apart upon pore formation, as seen in the 8% diameter expansion. This size difference was seen in the earlier work, but the symmetry measurement was less clear, and it was explained by assigning a lower symmetry to the prepore (31 vs 38 for the pore) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tilley et al., 2005</xref>). In view of the present observations, it seems likely that pneumolysin rings also expand and that the previous assignment of different symmetries to pneumolysin pores and prepores was most likely incorrect.</p><p>We observed arc-shaped assemblies as small as 5 subunits, with heights corresponding to the suilysin pore state. This gives an estimate of the minimum oligomer size required for membrane insertion. The size of the AFM tip was too large to probe the membrane perforation in arc-shaped complexes smaller than about 15 monomers (see e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We have observed membrane perforation for arcs at any size between 15 and 37 monomers, which unambiguously demonstrates that a fully enclosed β-barrel is not essential for the insertion of the transmembrane β-hairpins and membrane perforation, as was previously presumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hotze and Tweten, 2012</xref>). Unsealed lipid edges and incomplete β-barrels are a surprising by-product of this membrane perforation by incomplete CDC oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>), as was recently suggested based on electron tomography of various pneumolysin assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sonnen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The size of the membrane lesions can thus vary between less than half the lumen in a completed SLY pore to the larger pores formed by interlocked arcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>), as suggested by conductance measurements on black lipid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marchioretto et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of the extent of oligomerization, both arc and ring prepores can convert directly to the pore configuration as the β-hairpins unfurl and insert into the lipid bilayer. This is followed by the ejection of lipids from the membrane as the pore is formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). The results imply that the hydrophilic inner surface of the partially or fully completed β-barrel is sufficient to destabilize the lipid membrane in the pore lumen, leading to ejection of lipid micelles from the pore.</p><p>The approach of identifying hinge regions for domain fitting to the suilysin pore map has yielded a pseudo-atomic model that goes beyond the earlier rigid body fitting to pneumolysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tilley et al., 2005</xref>). The mechanism of collapse through buckling of domain 2 involves a sideways movement around the ring, and the bending is in the opposite direction to that proposed in the earlier model. The resulting tilt of domain 1 results in the 8% radial expansion of the ring, clearly seen by the displacement of domain 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Then the models were evaluated using the DOPE statistical potential score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shen and Sali, 2006</xref>). The top models from the individual domains were connected with MODELLER into one partial model (containing domains 1, 2, and 4—but not 3), which was then C37 symmetrized in Chimera. Next, the map was segmented around three asymmetric units of the resulting pore model. Loop refinement was performed on the loops connecting domain 1 and the corresponding strands from the barrel (only on the central asymmetric unit). The resolution was insufficient to include β5 from domain 3 in the model. The refined asymmetric unit was C37 symmetrized to give the final pore model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Prepore map fitting</title><p>Only domains 1 and 4 were fitted into the prepore map. The starting structure was the crystal structure of suilysin monomer. We first rigidly fitted the whole crystal structure and then deleted domain 2 and 3, as their corresponding density was not sufficiently resolved. The fit of domain 4 was further refined to improve the CCC, taking into account the position relative to the membrane. The final fits of domain 1 and 4 were C37 symmetrized to give a final (partial) prepore model without clashes between the monomers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Mapping of electrostatic potential and interacting residues</title><p>We calculated the electrostatic potential of domain 1 in both prepore and pore models using the APBS method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2001</xref>; available in Chimera) and mapped it onto their molecular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). For the pore model, optimization of the side chain rotamers was done using SCWRL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krivov et al., 2009</xref>) prior to the calculation of the electrostatic potential. We further analysed the contacts in adjacent monomers of domain 1 in the prepore and pore fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). We considered two residues as interacting (interface residue) if their corresponding Cβ atoms are within a distance of 7 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Malhotra et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>AFM sample preparation</title><p>Small unilamellar vesicles were injected onto a freshly cleaved mica surface at a concentration between 5 and 25 nM in the presence of 60 µl of 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.8. Incubation of the vesicles on the mica for 30 min at room temperature allowed them to rupture and adsorb onto the surface, yielding an extended lipid bilayer film. Any remaining vesicles were removed by gently rinsing with 80 µl of the adsorption buffer. The rinsing process was repeated 3–7 times to ensure a clean and uniform surface conducive for AFM imaging. Wild-type and disulphide-locked suilysin were injected into a 150 µl fluid cell containing the supported lipid bilayers and allowed to equilibrate for ∼10 min prior to imaging. The concentration of suilysin in the various AFM experiments was 12–180 nM.</p><p>For the doping assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), wild-type and locked suilysin were mixed in the desired molar ratios and 60 nM of the protein mixture was incubated on the lipid bilayers for 10 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>AFM imaging and data processing</title><p>Real-time topographic images of suilysin on the supported lipid bilayers were collected on a Multimode 8 system (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) by performing rapid force-distance (PeakForce Tapping) curves. The PeakForce method continuously records force-distance curves with a user-defined force set-point (here about 50 pN) that is referenced to a continuously adjusted baseline. Typically, these force-distance curves were recorded at a frequency of 2 kHz with a maximum tip-sample separation between 5 and 20 nm. The topographic features were verified for consistency between trace and retrace images, as well as for their reproducibility in subsequent scan frames. For imaging, the vertical scan limit was reduced to ∼1.5 μm. Typically, images were recorded at 0.2–1 frames/min. Suilysin prepores and pores were also imaged at rates of up to 10 frames/min using a home-built AFM system and miniaturized cantilevers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leung et al., 2012</xref>), but this did not yield information additional to the data presented here. Suilysin prepores were only resolved at high concentration on the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), or when the temperature was lowered to 15°C (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). The real-time, low-temperature measurements were carried out on a Dimension FastScan AFM system in tapping mode with images acquired at 4 frames/min using FastScan Dx probes (Bruker).The AFM probes used for suilysin imaging had nominal spring constants ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 N/m and resonance frequencies between 10 and 130 kHz in liquid. We used silicon nitride AFM probes with batch-processed silicon tips including MSNL E and F (Bruker), ScanAsyst Fluid+ (Bruker), and cantilevers with individually grown carbon tips, for example, Biotool (Nanotools, Munich, Germany). Batches of AFM probes were screened for tip sharpness and appropriate tilt angles prior to data collection.</p><p>All AFM imaging was performed in the presence of 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.8 with either an E or a J scanner with an integrated temperature control. Images were analysed by either the Nanoscope Analysis software package (Bruker) or using the open-source SPM analysis software, Gwyddion (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sourceforge.net">www.sourceforge.net</ext-link>). The raw AFM images were plane-levelled and subsequently line-by-line flattened using the lipid membrane as reference. A Gaussian filter with a full-width-half-maximum of 2-pixels was applied to smooth out high frequency noise where necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Oligomerization model</title><p>The assembly of suilysin (SLY) in the prepore state was described by the irreversible reactions <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>SLY</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>pre</mml:mtext><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>SLY</mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>pre</mml:mtext><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>→</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>SLY</mml:mtext><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>pre</mml:mtext><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for oligomerization via monomer-association with a rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Volker Dötsch as Reviewing editor and Andreas Engel as one of the other two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Carl Leung and colleagues present a structural investigation of the pore forming protein suilysin. They used AFM and cryo-EM to investigate both, the structure and dynamics of pore formation. Interpretation of these data was done by fitting and modeling. The crystal structure of suilysin reveals key-shaped molecule in its soluble form, which undergoes a conformational change when binding to the target membrane. Cryo- and negative stain EM of cys-locked suilysin-prepores and wt-pores revealed rings of different diameters but identical number (37) of subunits, supporting the conformational change. A 3D map was reconstructed from cryo-EM projections of vitrified rings.</p><p>While these results were seen as interesting by all reviewers, some discussion about the impact of these findings arose. In particular two questions were discussed:</p><p>1) The first one focused on the observation that lipids are released upon insertion. This issue has been discussed in the field for quite a while but has not been convincingly shown. The interpretation that this release occurs is based on the observation of density in the time resolved AFM images that appear and then disappear again. Showing conclusively that this density is indeed lipids would be a significant step ahead. Is there additional experimental evidence that this interpretation is correct? Could the authors for example provide a statistical evaluation of the size of these densities and explore if this is consistent with the expected size of the released lipids?</p><p>In addition, the process of when and how lipid ejection occurs should be discussed.</p><p>2) The provided structural model is of higher resolution than all other models that have been published before. Is there experimental evidence from mutational analysis that the structural model is correct? Again any evidence that the proposed interfaces indeed play a role during this process would significantly strengthen the impact of these results.</p><p>Further issues that should be addressed are:</p><p>3) “Negative stain EM and rotational symmetry analysis of complete rings of disulphide locked (Gly52Cys/Ser187Cys) suilysin prepores and wild-type pores formed on lipid monolayers revealed that most rings contain 37 subunits.” This is not documented properly: it should be, at least in the supplemental data. Cryo-EM reaches a resolution of 15 Å where the subunits are just visible. Negative stain is not likely to produce the same resolution; usually 25 Å is good. So how sure then is the 37-fold symmetry?</p><p>4) “The pore structure is similar to that observed with pneumolysin, but with improved resolution, resolving the β-barrel and defining hinge bending and domain movements.” There is no evidence that the β-barrel and defining hinge bending are resolved in the 15 Å map. It is that a convincing model has been developed to demonstrate this. Convincing is the height change seen by AFM - the 2 observation together make this work exciting. Please reformulate.</p><p>5) In the title and in some parts of the manuscript suilysin is named as a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin. Does cholesterol play a role in the assembly and insertion process? What is the role of cholesterol?</p><p>6) The attachment to the membrane is assumed to be irreversible. What is the basis for this assumption? Is there a conformational change that occurs upon membrane binding? And a second upon oligomerization followed by the final conformational change when the pore is formed?</p><p>7) The assembly itself is assumed not to be cooperative. What about the conformational change from the pre-pore to the pore? Is this a cooperative process?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04247.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The first one focused on the observation that lipids are released upon insertion.

These observations are made within minutes after injection of DTT to trigger the prepore-to-pore transition, and just before the first detection of membrane lesions within the pores.</p><p>As additional experimental evidence, we have now included a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> that demonstrates that appearance of additional density is reproducible, after triggering the prepore-to-pore transition, in an independent time-resolved experiment carried out along the same lines as the one reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. It can thus be excluded that the additional density is artefactual. This leaves only two possible candidates to explain the additional high features appearing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-D</xref> (and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>): suilysin or lipids. While we cannot exclude the ejection of some protein, our interpretation of ejected lipids is supported (i) by the subsequent appearance of collapsed lipid vesicles on the membrane (plateaus in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and (ii) by the fact that after completion of pore formation, there are obviously lipids missing within the pore lumens (see holes in membrane, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), as described in the manuscript.</p><p>We appreciate the suggestion of a statistical size evaluation in the reviewers’ comment above, but would like to point out that for such soft and clearly mobile features in AFM images (see streaky appearance of the white features in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), reliable and accurate volume measurements are nigh impossible. For completeness, we have now also attempted confocal fluorescence and TIRF microscopy experiments with fluorescent lipids, but unfortunately with inconclusive results.</p><p>In the Discussion section, in the paragraph “Regardless of the extent of oligomerization…” we have specified that the lipid ejection occurs upon conversion of suilysin from its prepore to pore state, hence upon the unfurling of the β-hairpins into the membrane. We have now expanded the corresponding paragraph to briefly discuss how lipid ejection may occur, specifically: “The results imply that the hydrophilic inner surface of the partially or fully completed β-barrel is sufficient to destabilize the lipid membrane in the pore lumen, leading to ejection of lipid micelles from the pore.”</p><p><italic>2) The provided structural model is of higher resolution than all other models that have been published before. Is there experimental evidence from mutational analysis that the structural model is correct? Again any evidence that the proposed interfaces indeed play a role during this process would significantly strengthen the impact of these results</italic>.</p><p>In response to this question, we have analysed the electrostatic properties of the surfaces of domain 1 that form the major interfaces in the prepore and pore oligomers. The results show that both models have extended regions of complementary charge on the predicted interacting surfaces. Although the extent of complementary charge is less in the pore model, in this case the oligomer is stabilized by the beta barrel of the pore. This analysis lends support to both models, is discussed in the Results section on the Cryo-EM data, and is shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>Further issues that should be addressed are</italic>:</p><p><italic>3) “Negative stain EM and rotational symmetry analysis of complete rings of disulphide locked (Gly52Cys/Ser187Cys) suilysin prepores and wild-type pores formed on lipid monolayers revealed that most rings contain 37 subunits.” This is not documented properly: it should be, at least in the supplemental data. Cryo-EM reaches a resolution of 15 Å where the subunits are just visible. Negative stain is not likely to produce the same resolution; usually 25 Å is good. So how sure then is the 37-fold symmetry</italic>?</p><p>The subunit repeat is clearly resolved around the outer edge of the ring in negative stain end views on membrane monolayers. End view class averages and rotational correlation plots documenting the presence of 36-39-mers are presented in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) “The pore structure is similar to that observed with pneumolysin, but with improved resolution, resolving the β-barrel and defining hinge bending and domain movements.” There is no evidence that the β-barrel and defining hinge bending are resolved in the 15 Å map. It is that a convincing model has been developed to demonstrate this. Convincing is the height change seen by AFM - the 2 observation together make this work exciting. Please reformulate</italic>.</p><p>This sentence has now been reformulated to: “The pore structure is similar to that observed with pneumolysin, but with improved resolution, and showing significant differences in the hinge bending and domain movements.”</p><p><italic>5) In the title and in some parts of the manuscript suilysin is named as a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin. Does cholesterol play a role in the assembly and insertion process? What is the role of cholesterol</italic>?</p><p>We have now specified in the introduction that CDCs, exemplified by perfringolysin O, require &gt;∼30% for membrane binding (with the new reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with that observation on perfringolysin O, our experiments with suilysin on membranes with 10% and 20% cholesterol content did not show any significant sign of membrane binding and pore formation (data not shown, since this point is well established in the CDC literature). As for the dependency on cholesterol above the ∼30% threshold, we acquired data mostly at 33% and 55% cholesterol content, but did not observe large changes in oligomeric populations in this range (compare, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) The attachment to the membrane is assumed to be irreversible. What is the basis for this assumption? Is there a conformational change that occurs upon membrane binding? And a second upon oligomerization followed by the final conformational change when the pore is formed</italic>?</p><p>Firstly, the assumption of irreversible oligomerization is dictated by the presence of a broad maximum for incomplete (but oligomeric) assemblies in the prepore state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>): Because the chemical interface between all subunits is identical, this maximum cannot be explained as an equilibrium result, and must thus represent kinetically trapped assemblies, hence irreversible oligomerization.</p><p>As for monomer attachment to the membrane, it will eventually become irreversible because of the irreversibility of the subsequent oligomerization. The monomer attachment to the membrane can therefore be approximately described by an effective irreversible rate equation. The above-mentioned assumption of irreversible membrane binding was thus made because it simplifies the model (reducing the number of free parameters) while it is not critical for the modelling results.</p><p><italic>7) The assembly itself is assumed not to be cooperative. What about the conformational change from the pre-pore to the pore? Is this a cooperative process</italic>?</p><p>Our experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref> suggest that the prepore-to-pore transition is indeed a cooperative process, as we have now made more explicit in the Discussion (“The activity of wild-type suilysin was greatly impaired…”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
