neurotransmission. Endocytosed SV can travel directly into the recycling pool or recycle through endosomes but little is known about the molecular actors regulating the switch between these SV recycling routes. ADP ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) is a small GTPase known to participate in constitutive trafficking between plasma membrane and early endosomes. Here, we have morphologically and functionally investigated Arf6-silenced hippocampal synapses and found an activity dependent accumulation of synaptic endosome-like organelles and increased release-competent docked SVs. These features were phenocopied by pharmacological blockage of Arf6 activation. The data reveal an unexpected role for this small GTPase in reducing the size of the readily releasable pool of SVs and in channeling retrieved SVs toward direct recycling rather than endosomal sorting. We propose that Arf6 acts at the presynapse to define the fate of an endocytosed SV.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10116.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10116.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10116.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Communication between neurons takes place at cell-to-cell contacts called synapses.

The experiments involved rat neurons grown in the laboratory, and showed that Arf6 controls both the number of synaptic vesicles ready to be released and the trafficking of synaptic vesicles via endosomal structures in active neurons. The next step following on from these findings is to understand how Arf6 exerts its effects and how this protein is regulated in the presynaptic neuron.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10116.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10116.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Arf6</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle</kwd><kwd>endosomes</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>recycling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Jérôme Lejeune</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1155-FA2013A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fassio</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Università degli Studi di Genova</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>D34G1300017005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fassio</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The small GTPase Arf6 plays a role in setting the size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles and in the definition of the recycling route for endocytosed vesicles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are continuously recycled at the nerve terminal and this process is tightly controlled to ensure the fidelity of neurotransmission. After endocytosis, SVs are shuttled back to the recycling pool either directly or via endosome-like compartments. The existence of endosome-like compartments has been demonstrated at the synapse since the pioneering experiments on synapse ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heuser and Reese, 1973</xref>), but their functional role in SV cycling is highly debated and the molecular and signaling pathways that define the fate of an endocytosed SV are still largely unknown (see for recent reviews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morgan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kokotos and Cousin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jähne et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The ADP ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) is a small GTPase that localizes primarily to the plasma membrane/endosomal system and is best known as a regulator of endocytic trafficking and actin cytoskeleton dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Myers and Casanova, 2008</xref>). As for others small GTPases, the activity of Arf6 is tightly controlled by two families of regulatory proteins: guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that function as Arf6 activators by facilitating the conversion from GDP-bound inactive form to GTP-bound active form, and GTPase activating protein (GAPs) that function as negative regulators by enhancing GTP hydrolisis. Neurons express several GEFs and GAPs for Arf6 and Arf6 has been reported to play a role in neurite outgrowth and dendritic spine maturation although its function in mature synapses is largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaworski, 2007</xref>). At postsynaptic sites, accumulating evidence has recently shown that Arf6 plays a role in AMPA receptor trafficking and long-term synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scholz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Myers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oku and Huganir, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). At presynaptic sites, Arf6 has been predicted to play a role in the assembly of the clathrin coated complex during SV endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krauss et al., 2003</xref>). While overexpression of the Arf6 GEF msec7-1 has been reported to increase basal synaptic transmission at the <italic>Xenopus</italic> neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashery et al., 1999</xref>), the function of Arf6 at the presynaptic terminal has never been directly addressed. Interestingly, mutations in Arf6 regulatory genes have been recently associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shoubridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Falace et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rauch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fine et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigate the ultrastructural and functional effects of Arf6 silencing in hippocampal synapses and reveal an unexpected presynaptic role for this small GTPase in determining the size of the readily releasable pool of SVs and in promoting direct <italic>versus</italic> endosomal recycling of SVs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first investigated on the expression of the small GTPase Arf6 at synaptic level by biochemical experiments and revealed expression of Arf6 in isolated nerve terminal-extract; differential extraction of synaptosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Phillips et al., 2001</xref>) revealed that Arf6 is not tightly associated with presynaptic or postsynaptic membranes, as it is mainly extracted at pH6 similarly to the SV protein synaptophysin. We also evaluated Arf6 expression at synaptic level by immunocytochemistry. Endogenous Arf6 colocalyzed with both presynaptic (Synaptophysin) and postsynaptic (Homer1) markers in primary rat hippocampal neurons (17 days in vitro, DIV) and triple labelling showed expression of the small GTPase at the presynaptic and postsynaptic site of single synaptic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To directly examine how Arf6 activity impacts on synapse structure, we performed electron microscopy (EM) analysis at Arf6-knockdown (KD) synapses. Rat hippocampal neurons were transduced at 12 DIV, after the initial wave of synaptogenesis had occurred, with a lentiviral vector, driving the expression of short hairpin targeting the coding sequence of the rat Arf6 mRNA (shRNA#1) or the respective mismatch control and GFP as a reporter. The silencing efficiency was tested 5 days post transduction by western blotting (WB) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Ultrastructural analysis revealed that Arf6-KD synapses were undistinguishable from control synapses in terms of synaptic area and active zone (AZ) length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), but were characterized by a decreased total number of SVs and a significantly increased number of SVs docked at the AZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, intraterminal cisternae, resembling endosome-like structures and occasionally found in control synapses, were dramatically increased in Arf6-silenced synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The observed phenotype was completely rescued by the expression of a rat Arf6 variant resistant to shRNA#1 silencing (Arf6-res, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10116.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reduced SV density and accumulation of intraterminal cisternae at Arf6 deficient synapses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Upper panels</italic>, representative electron micrographs of synaptic terminals from cultured hippocampal neurons (17 DIV) transduced with lentiviruses expressing an Arf6 shRNA (Arf6-KD) or an inactive mismatched version (Control).

This observation rules out the possibility that the intraterminal cisternae represent membrane infoldings in continuity with the plasma membrane. To investigate on the nature of intraterminal cisternae, Arf6-silenced and control neurons were stained with the synaptic marker VAMP2 and the synaptic endosome markers Rab5 and Vti1A. At Arf6-KD VAMP2-positive synapses, a significant increase of both Rab5 and Vti1A signals was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

We first tested the efficiency of SecinH3 to impair Arf6 activation in hippocampal primary cultures (17 DIV) by pull-down experiments and revealed a significant decrease of GTP-bound Arf6 in SecinH3-treated neurons with respect to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Wild-type neurons were therefore treated with either SecinH3 or vehicle (DMSO) and analyzed for synapse morphology. SecinH3 treatment did not result in any variations in the synaptic area or AZ length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), but the complex ultrastructural modifications observed at Arf6-silenced synapses (i.e. decreased number of SVs, increased number of docked SVs and increased number of intraterminal cisternae) were completely phenocopied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The possibility that the SecinH3 treatment results in delocalization of Arf6 from synaptic sites was assessed by staining control and treated cultures with the presynaptic marker Synaptophysin and Arf6. No significant difference was observed in the intensity of the Arf6 signal at Synaptophysin-positive puncta in control and SecinH3-treated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These data demonstrate that the lack of Arf6 activation, rather than of its expression, is sufficient to cause the accumulation of both SVs at the AZ and Elos at the expense of total SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, the acute SecinH3 treatment suggests that accumulating Elos represent transient structures rather than stable organelles recruited at the synapse upon loss of Arf6 activation.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10116.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>SecinH3 treatment phenocopies Arf6 silencing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Upper panels</italic>, representative electron micrographs of synaptic terminals from cultured hippocampal neurons (17 DIV) treated with either SecinH3 (30 µM) or DMSO (Vehicle). <italic>Lower panels</italic>, morphometric analysis of the density of SVs, docked SVs and cisternae in control (black) and SecinH3 treated (red) synapses.

Experiments were performed at 17–18 DIV (3–4 days after transfection) and RFP/SypHy-positive axonal processes were selected for stimulation and analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). When the amount of surface-expressed SypHy was evaluated, we observed a significant increase of extracellularly exposed SypHy at Arf6-silenced synapses compared with control synapses, suggestive of a global impairment of SV cycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Neurons were first stimulated with 40 action potentials (APs) at 20 Hz, a protocol widely employed to measure the readily releasable pool (RRP) of SVs and, therefore, suitable to reveal if the increased docked SVs observed by EM were functional or represented mistargeted/unprimed SVs, not competent for fusion. Both the shRNA #1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>) and the shRNA #2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) significantly increased the peak fluorescence at the end of the 2 s. Stimulation without affecting the kinetics of fluorescence return to basal level at the end of the stimulation, which describe ‘post-stimulus’ endocytosis. To reveal whether the increased peak fluorescence was due to higher exocytosis or impairment of ‘during-stimulus’ endocytosis we employed the H<sup>+</sup>ATPase inhibitor Bafilomycin. This drug prevents reacidification of internalized SVs and allows monitoring net exocytosis. The peak fluorescence was equally increased when neurons were stimulated in the presence of Bafilomycin, suggesting that the observed peak fluorescence increase was indeed attributable to an increased number of exocytosed SVs. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Next, to exclude the involvement of shRNA-mediated off-target effects, we performed rescue experiments.

These data demonstrate that increased docked SVs in Arf6-depleted synapses are indeed functional releasable SVs and that Arf6 silencing causes an alteration in the process of neurotransmission in the absence of any effects on the kinetics of RRP endocytosis.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10116.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Increased readily releasable pool at Arf6-deficient synapses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images from neuronal processes cotransfected with Arf6-shRNA #1 (RFP) and SypHy.

Bafilomycin was concomitantly used to dissect out ‘during-stimulus’ recycling. At control synapses, Bafilomycin increased the response to the stimulation, indicative of the existence of an active ‘during-stimulus’ recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). At the end of the stimulation, and in the absence of Bafilomycin, fluorescence returned to the basal level due to ‘post-stimulus’ endocytosis, with an average time constant of endocytosis (τ) of 36 s. Strikingly, at Arf6-KD synapses, the peak fluorescence was not modified by Bafilomycin, suggesting a strong impairment of ‘during-stimulus’ endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To measure the net exocytosis (EXO) during stimulation, the areas below the curves in the presence of Bafilomycin were calculated and no differences were observed between control and Arf6 KD synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To quantify net ‘during-stimulus’ endocytosis (ENDO), additional curves were obtained by plotting the point-by-point differences between the curves run in the presence and absence of Bafilomycin. The time course of ‘during- stimulus’ endocytosis revealed that recycling was virtually absent in the first 12 s of stimulation, and started to take place only in the last 8 s of stimulation, resulting in a significant decrease in ENDO upon Arf6 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Moreover, Arf6 silencing slowed down also ‘post-stimulus’ endocytosis as revealed by the significantly higher τ (59 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting an involvement of the small GTPase in the endocytosis of recycling SVs, differently from what has been observed for SVs belonging to the RRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Remarkably, all the described defects on ‘during-stimulus’ and ‘post-stimulus’ recycling in Arf6-KD synapses were completely rescued by the concomitant expression of the shRNA#1-resistant Arf6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>).

To challenge these hypotheses, we visualized SVs and intraterminal cisternae formation upon AP firing by stimulating control or Arf6-KD neurons (17–18 DIV) in the presence of soluble HRP. Samples were fixed at the end of the stimulation (400APs@20Hz) and after 2 and 20 min. wash in the absence of HRP. The decreased number of SVs and the increased number of docked SVs and intraterminal cisternae were fully confirmed in Arf6 deficient synapses at all time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, when the HRP-positive (HRP<sup>+</sup>) structures at the end of the stimulus, representative of active cycling during stimulation, were analyzed, a significant decrease HRP<sup>+</sup> SVs accompanied by an increase of HRP<sup>+</sup> cisternae in Arf6-KD terminals compared to control was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This result correlates with the observed defect in ‘during-stimulus’ endocytosis revealed by the SypHy experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and suggests that Elos preferentially form when Arf6 signalling is occluded. Interestingly, after 2 min. wash in the absence of HRP, HRP<sup>+</sup> SVs remained substantially unchanged in control synapses, while they significantly increased in Arf6-depleted terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This increase demonstrates that, in Arf6-depleted terminals, SVs efficiently form from intermediate endosomal structures, since the additional HRP<sup>+</sup>SVs can only derive from intraterminal HRP<sup>+</sup>-Elos after HRP had been removed from the extracellular medium. The data suggest that Arf6 regulates the direct formation and recycling of SVs so that, in its absence, Elos form upon stimulation and SVs lately bud from the newly formed structures. Finally, after 20 min-wash in the absence of HRP, SVs and intraterminal cisternae significantly lose their HRP content in both experimental groups, suggesting that both SVs and cisternae are actively recycled, thus ruling out the possibility that SVs are stuck at Elos in Arf6-depleted synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10116.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Stimulus-induced formation of intraterminal cisternae is increased at the expense of SV formation at Arf6-silenced synapses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative EM images for Control and Arf6-KD synapses in neurons stimulated with 400APS@20hz in the presence of HRP (10 mg/ml) and then incubated for additional 2 or 20 min, in the absence of HRP.

Considering that the molecular nature, as well as the function of synaptic endosomal structures is a matter of debate, our 3D analysis coupled with staining for endosomal markers demonstrate that the structures that form upon Arf6-silencing are <italic>bona fide</italic> synaptic Elos. Moreover, these organelles unequivocally participate in SV recycling as their formation is abrogated by TTX treatment. The same phenotype is observed when blocking Arf6 activation by pharmacological treatment, demonstrating that synaptic Elos form due to the loss of Arf6 activation, that results therefore essential for the direct recycling of endocytosed SV. The increased travelling of SVs via synaptic Elos at Arf6-depleted synapses, results in recycling defects during long-lasting stimulation (20 s), when multiple rounds of exo-endocytosis are required, suggesting that direct, rather than endosomal, recycling is the favorite and most efficient recycling route during repetitive stimulation. Moreover, synaptic Elos formation is accompanied by an increased RRP demonstrating that, while defining the recycling route of endocytosed SV, Arf6 also regulates the abundance of release competent SVs at the AZ.</p><p>The function of endosomal structures at the synaptic terminal is still elusive, but a role in both regeneration of SVs and SV protein sorting and renewal has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoopmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wucherpfennig et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Uytterhoeven et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandes et al., 2014</xref>). Our data reveal that the small GTPase Arf6 is a component of the machinery that regulates the fate of an endocytosed SV at the synapse. We speculate that active Arf6 shifts SVs toward direct recycling, away from synaptic Elos, through which only a subset of SVs, either devoid of Arf6 or in which Arf6 is inactive, travel to undergo protein turnover. This scenario is reminiscent of the role of active Arf6 in endosomal recycling of transferrin receptors, where the small GTPase mediates fast recycling of the receptor, and confirms the central role of Arf6 in determining the intracellular trafficking pathway of endocytic cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Montagnac et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grant and Donaldson, 2009</xref>). Intriguingly, upstream regulators of Arf6 activity have been recently demonstrated to act in SV recycling at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction with morphological and functional phenotypes reminiscent of the Arf6-depleted hippocampal synapses described in this paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Uytterhoeven et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Podufall et al., 2014</xref>). Several downstream effectors for active GTP-bound Arf6 have been described that could play a role in SV recycling at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donaldson and Jackson, 2011</xref>), and among them the adaptor protein AP-2 is of particular relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paleotti et al., 2005</xref>). Neuron-specific deletion of AP-2 has been recently described to result in the accumulation of presynaptic endosome-like vacuoles and loss of SVs at hippocampal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kononenko et al., 2014</xref>), resembling the Arf6-KD phenotype described here. Accumulation of synaptic endosomal structures can be attributed to defective SVs reformation or to an increase in the trafficking of SVs via intermediate endosomal compartments because of a defect in the direct recycling route bypassing intermediate endosomes. For Arf6-KD neurons, we favor the second hypothesis as morpho-functional experiments revealed that Arf6-depleted synapses show deficient SV formation upon stimulation but functional SV reformation from intraterminal Elos during the post-stimulus period. Endosome-like structures seem therefore to preferentially form at the expense of SVs in the absence of Arf6, which instead does not appear to play a major role on SV reformation from Elos.</p><p>Additional Arf6 downstream targets, other than AP-2, could also be involved, such as the phosphatidylinositolphosphate-kinase type Iγ, already described as a SV cycle regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Di Paolo et al., 2004</xref>), or the scaffold protein JIP3. Interestingly, JIP3 has been identified as an Arf6 target mediating the fast component of constitutive endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Montagnac et al., 2011</xref>) and the <italic>C. elegans</italic> JIP3 homologue UNC-16 mutant shows endosomal structure accumulation and SV depletion at motor neuron synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The hypothesis that SVs preferentially travel via endosomes when Arf6 expression/activation is impaired is also in accordance with the increased RRP, which was reported to go through endosomal sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoopmann et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, RRP is increased at Arf6-depleted synapses but the kinetics of endocytosis for the SVs belonging to RRP was unaffected, supporting the idea that endosomal recycling is the retrieval mechanisms selected by SVs from the RRP. In line with these observations, clathrin depletion was recently reported to be ineffective on endocytotic decay after RRP depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kononenko et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting a clathrin/Arf6-independent SV retrieval for RRP vesicles. However, the increased RRP due to Arf6 silencing was insensitive to TTX, opening the possibility that it is a distinct activity-independent mechanism. Differently from what we observed after the short (2 s) stimulation, Arf6 depletion impacts on SV endocytosis after the longer (20 s) stimulation, suggesting that not only the frequency, but also the duration of the stimulus can challenge the membrane retrieval mechanisms.</p><p>Whereas the Rab family of small GTPases has been extensively implicated in various steps of SV cycling, ranging from the docking/priming phases during exocytosis to recycling phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Binotti et al., 2015</xref>; see for a review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pavlos and Jahn, 2011</xref>), our work reveals additional roles for the small GTPase of the Arf family, Arf6, in the SV cycling pathway and in the definition of the size of the SV pools. Interestingly, Rab proteins can act both as regulators or effectors for activated Arf6, as demonstrated in various cellular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chesneau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pelletán et al., 2015</xref>). In particular Arf6 and Rab35 have been shown to turn each other off by recruitment of reciprocal GAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chaineau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dutta and Donaldson, 2015</xref>) and active Rab35 is reported to regulate SV endosomal sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Uytterhoeven et al., 2011</xref>). Future work is needed to unravel the Arf6 interactome at the presynapse in order to define the specific GEFs and GAPs that regulate Arf6 activity in discrete subsynaptic compartments and the Arf6 effectors that mediate the described functions.</p><p>The use of pharmacological tools to mimic or revert Arf6 function at synapse opens new therapeutic approaches to correct dysregulations of the Arf6 pathway occurring in human neurological diseases associated with mutations in the Arf6 regulatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shoubridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Falace et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rauch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fine et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Sprague-Dawley rats were from Charles River.

The tissue was homogenized in 10 ml of ice-cold HB buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors, using a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The resultant homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4°C in order to remove nuclei and debris and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 18,900 × g for 10 min at 4°C to obtain the P2 fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of HB buffer and gently stratified on a discontinuous Percoll gradient (3%–10%–23%). After a 10 min centrifugation at 18,900 × g at 4°C, the synaptosomal fraction from the 10% and 23% Percoll interface was collected, washed in Krebs buffer (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.3 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 10 mM Tris/Hepes pH 7.4) to eliminate Percoll and used as the starting material for subsequent ultrafractionation. Ultrasynaptic fractionation was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Phillips et al., 2001</xref>). Briefly, synaptosomes were pelleted by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 5 min, 4°C) and resuspended in 300 µl of 0.32 M sucrose, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. An aliquot was removed and kept as total. Protease inhibitors were used in all purification steps. Synaptosomes were then diluted 1:10 in ice-cold 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and mixed with an equal volume of 2X solubilization buffer (2% Triton X-100, 40 mM Tris, pH 6, 4°C). After a 30 min incubation at 4°C, the insoluble material (synaptic junction) was pelleted by centrifugation (40,000 × g, 30 min, 4°C). The supernatant (1% TX-100 pH 6 soluble) was decanted and the proteins precipitated with 6 volumes of acetone at -20°C overnight and then centrifuged (18,000 × g, 30 min, -15°C). The synaptic junction pellet (containing the insoluble postsynaptic density and the presynaptic active zone) was resuspended in 10 volumes of 1X solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris, pH 8, 4°C), incubated for 30 min at 4°C and then centrifuged (40,000 × g, 30 min, 4°C). The proteins in the supernatant (1% TX-100 pH 8 soluble) were precipitated in 6 volumes of acetone at -20°C overnight and then centrifuged (18,000 × g, 30 min, -15°C), while the pellet was kept as postsynaptic density fraction (1% TX-100 pH 8 insoluble).

For electrical field stimulation, coverslips were mounted into the imaging chamber (~100 μl volume; Quick Exchange Platform; Warner Instruments) and APs were evoked by passing 1 msec current pulses through platinum iridium electrodes using an AM2100 stimulator (AM-Systems). After 10 s of baseline acquisition (<italic>F</italic>0), neurons were stimulated with a train of 40/400 APs at 20Hz in the presence or absence of 1 μM Bafilomycin. At the end of the stimulation protocol, cells were perfused with 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (<italic>F</italic><sub>max</sub>). Images were analyzed using the eXcellence software (Olympus).

The time constant of endocytosis (τ endo) was calculated by the fitting the post-stimulus decay with a single-exponential function. To quantify net exocytosis (EXO) ongoing during stimulation, the areas below the curves obtained in the presence of Bafilomycin were measured. To quantify the net during stimulus’ endocytosis (ENDO), additional curves were built from the differences between the curves run in the presence and those in the absence of Bafilomycin and the areas below the curves were measured.</p><p>To evaluate the SypHy surface fraction, neurons were perfused for 20 sec with Tyrode Solution (pH 7.4) to measure the basal fluorescence (F<sub>basal</sub>), then with MES buffer (pH 5.5) (F<sub>acid</sub>) to measure the fluorescence under the acidic condition, and lastly with a Tyrode solution with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (F<sub>alkalin</sub>) to evaluate the total amount of probes at the synaptic boutons. SypHy surface fraction was evaluated by subtracting the fluorescence change between basal and acidic conditions (F<sub>basal</sub>-F<sub>acid</sub>) from the fluorescence change between alkaline and acidic conditions (F<sub>alkalin</sub>-F<sub>acid</sub>) and reported as percent values, as follows: F<sub>extra</sub> =[(F<sub>basal</sub>-F<sub>acid</sub>)/ (F<sub>alkalin</sub>-F<sub>acid</sub>)]*100.</p><p>Data are expressed as means ± SEM for the number of coverslips analyzed.

This paper is significant as it provides important insights in presynaptic endosome function, an area that is so far been poorly studied due to lack of tools and low depth of analysis.</p><p>As most of the data appear solid, and the experiments are well performed, some experimental controls are needed to improve the rigidity of the conclusions drawn. Also the interpretation of the data should be carefully revisited.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Control experiments:</p><p>1) The authors need to provide better data to convince the presence of Arf6 in the pre synapse. While this is likely due to the observed phenotypes, a more direct demonstration may be helpful.</p><p>Related, while the labeling of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that disruption of Arf6 alters endosomal markers, this is mainly through modification of postsynaptic Arf6 signaling. Furthermore, the conclusion that Arf6 activity, rather than the protein, mediates the phenotype would be stronger if the authors can assess if Arf6 protein was still present at synapses with the inhibitor present. Maybe the drug leads to delocalization of Arf6.</p><p>2) Showing the ultrastructure of the Arf6 rescue would strengthen the paper.</p><p>Please also comment on and revise these points:</p><p>The authors suggest that Arf6 is a &quot;switch channeling SVs to direct rather than to endosomal recycling&quot; (highlights). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> implies that this statement is false.

As shown by the representative images and related intensity profiles (panel A of new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) Arf6 signal colocalized with both markers. Considering the resolution of conventional optical microscopy this evidence is only suggestive for expression at both pre- and post-synaptic compartments. We therefore performed immunocytochemistry with Arf6, the presynaptic marker VGlut1 and the postsynaptic marker Homer1. We used VGlut1 because an antibody raised in guinea pig anti-VGLut1 is commercially available (Synaptic Systems, #135 304, 1:200) allowing to perform triple immunolabelling. We analysed the intensity profiles of the Arf6 signal at single synaptic puncta in which pre- and post-synaptic signals were not completely overlapped. We revealed that indeed Ar6 signal is present at both pre- and post-synaptic compartments (panel B of new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This evidence is supported by biochemical fractionation of isolated nerve terminals in which Arf6 immunoreactivity is mainly associated with intra-synaptic protein, as the SV-marker Synaptophysin, and scarcely associated with both presynaptic- (active zone) and post-synaptic (postsynaptic density) membranes (panel C of new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is therefore expected that, as correctly observed in the revision, disruption of Arf6 may also alter endosomal markers at the postsynaptic level.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, the conclusion that Arf6 activity, rather than the protein, mediates the phenotype would be stronger if the authors can assess if Arf6 protein was still present at synapses with the inhibitor present. Maybe the drug leads to delocalization of Arf6.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion and performed synaptic localization experiments in control (DMSO 3hrs) and sSecinH3-treated (30μM 3 hrs) cultures and revealed no significant dispersion of the synaptic Arf6 signal upon treatment. These results have been inserted in panel B of new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Showing the ultrastructure of the Arf6 rescue would strengthen the paper.</italic> </p><p>Rescue of the ultrastructural phenotype has been added as supplementary to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The quantification of the synaptic area and AZ length of these new samples have been added to Table 1.</p><p><italic>Please also comment on and revise these points:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors suggest that Arf6 is a &quot;switch channeling SVs to direct rather than to endosomal recycling&quot; (highlights). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> implies that this statement is false. The absence of Arf6 actually implies that more vesicles can be immediately recycled upon stimulation, when the authors use a stimulation protocol that is well within the physiological range of these cultures.</italic> </p><p>As pointed out in the above comment, the stimulation protocol applied in the experiments reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (40 action potentials at 20Hz) is well within physiological range of the cultures. However, under our experimental conditions recycling is rather small (if any) during this stimulation protocol, as demonstrated by the similar peak response in the presence or absence of Bafilomycin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>). Thus, the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> imply that the availability of SV for release is increased in the absence of Arf6, in line with the ultrastructural data showing that the number of docked vesicles is also increased (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The highlight &quot;Arf6 switch channeling SVs to direct rather than to endosomal recycling&quot; was therefore not related to results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> but rather to the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, in which a different protocol of stimulation (400 action potentials at 20Hz) has been used. This protocol allows measurable recycling that was indeed significantly decreased in the absence of Arf6. For the sake of clarity we modified the statement in the highlight with: “Arf6 regulates SV recycling”.</p><p><italic>The authors suggest that Arf6 &quot;controls the availability of SVs for release&quot; (highlights). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> imply that this statement is also false. Plenty of vesicles are available for release in the absence of Arf6 – in fact, about as many as in control synapses, even with long stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</italic> </p><p>We perfectly agree with the referees in saying that plenty of SVs are available for release in the absence of Arf6 and modified the highlight into “Arf6 defines the readily releasable pool of SVs”.</p><p><italic>The authors suggest that Arf6 has an unexpected role in &quot;determining the size of the readily releasable pool of SVs&quot;. This is interpreted from observing a larger size of this pool in the absence of Arf6, which implies that Arf6 may, if anything, have a role in reducing this pool. This statement is therefore confusing.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the referees that active Arf6 reduces the readily releasable pool of SVs, as unmasked by the increased RRP in the absence of Arf6. By using “determining” we meant that Arf6 define the readily releasable pool of SVs (see novel highlight) as demonstrated by the increased size of the pool in its absence.</p><p><italic>The authors' data demonstrate that the Arf6 absence slows endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which results in the appearance of large endosome-like objects. It is evident that these objects do participate in synaptic recycling. This can be inferred from the fact that they disappear upon TTX treatment, and also from the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, which follow closely the original Heuser &amp; Reese, 1973, experiments on this subject. The simplest interpretation of the manuscript, therefore, is that Arf6 is involved in the break-up of such organelles in synaptic vesicles. In a knock-down of Arf6 the efficiency of this break-up process is far lower, and the endosome-like organelles become prominent, since their break-up is slowed down.

To validate this hypothesis we performed morpho-functional experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, in which the ultrastructural analysis was coupled with the evaluation of SV and organelle recycling upon stimulation. The data suggest that endosome-like organelles preferentially form at the expense of SVs upon Arf6 depletion. Indeed, the increased endosome-like structures upon stimulation (400 action potentials at 20Hz) at Arf6-depleted synapses is followed by formation of HRP-positive SVs, as shown in the quantification after 2 min. of washing, which most probably derive from HRP-positive endosome-like organelles. Moreover after longer washing (20 min) HRP-positive-SVs and HRP-positive endosome-like structures equally decreased in both control and Arf6-depleted synapses. These data therefore suggested a preferential accumulation rather than an increased persistence of endosomal-like organelles at Arf6 depleted synapses.</p><p><italic>In the Discussion and the title the authors talk about Arf6 acting as a chaperone. There is no evidence in the paper that Arf6 acts as a chaperone and this is better removed.</italic> </p><p>The term “chaperone” has been removed from both title and manuscript text.</p></body></sub-article> </article>
