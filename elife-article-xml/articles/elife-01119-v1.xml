In this study, we report that these kinases attenuate β-adrenergic signaling in white adipose tissue. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with specific inhibitors of these kinases restored β-adrenergic signaling and lipolysis attenuated by TNFα and Poly (I:C). Conversely, overexpression of the kinases reduced induction of <italic>Ucp1</italic>, lipolysis, cAMP levels, and phosphorylation of hormone sensitive lipase in response to isoproterenol or forskolin. Noncanonical IKKs reduce catecholamine sensitivity by phosphorylating and activating the major adipocyte phosphodiesterase PDE3B. <italic>In vivo</italic> inhibition of these kinases by treatment of obese mice with the drug amlexanox reversed obesity-induced catecholamine resistance, and restored PKA signaling in response to injection of a β-3 adrenergic agonist.

Obesity also increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and certain cancers. There is considerable evidence to suggest that adipose tissue becomes less sensitive to catecholamines such as adrenaline in states of obesity, and that this reduced sensitivity in turn reduces energy expenditure. However, the details of this process are not fully understood.</p><p>It is well established that obesity generates a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation in liver and adipose tissue, accompanied by the secretion of signaling proteins that prevent fat cells from responding to insulin, which leads to type 2 diabetes. Activation of the NFκB pathway is thought to have a central role in causing this inflammation. Now Mowers et al. have investigated whether inflammation caused by activation of the NFκB pathway also has a role in producing catecholamine resistance in fat cells.</p><p>Obesity-dependent activation of the NFκB pathway increases the levels of a pair of enzymes, IKKε and TBK1. Mowers et al. found that elevated levels of these two enzymes reduced the ability of certain receptors (called β-adrenergic receptors) in the fat cells of obese mice to respond to catecholamines. High levels of the two enzymes also resulted in lower levels of a second messenger molecule called cAMP, which increases energy expenditure by elevating fat burning. However, treating the fat cells with drugs that interfere with the two enzymes restored sensitivity to catecholamine, allowing the fat cells to burn energy.</p><p>Mowers et al. also treated obese mice with amlexanox, a drug that inhibits these enzymes, and found that this treatment made the mice sensitive to a synthetic catecholamine that triggered the release of energy from fat. Mowers et al. suggest, therefore, that IKKε and TBK1 respond to inflammation in the body by reducing catecholamine signaling, thus preventing energy expenditure. Drugs targeting these enzymes may be useful for treating conditions like obesity or type 2 diabetes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01119.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01119.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>energy expenditure</kwd><kwd>catecholamine resistance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30DK089687</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mowers</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1DK60591, R24DK090962</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saltiel</surname><given-names>Alan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reduced energy expenditure in obesity may result from reduced sensitivity to sympathetic activation due to inflammation-generated signals in adipose tissue.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity generates a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation in liver and adipose tissue accompanied by macrophage infiltration and the local secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that attenuate insulin action, resulting in insulin resistance and the subsequent development of Type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wellen and Hotamisligil, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hotamisligil, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lumeng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shoelson et al., 2007</xref>). Numerous studies indicate a strong correlation between inflammation and insulin resistance across several populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hotamisligil, 2006</xref>). Moreover, genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of inflammatory pathways can dissociate obesity from insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hotamisligil, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shoelson et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that local inflammation can be a key step in the generation of insulin resistance.</p><p>The transcription factor NFκB and its inflammatory program play an important role in the development of insulin resistance in obese liver and adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yuan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arkan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wunderlich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2009</xref>). NFκB is activated by the IκB kinase (IKK) family, which has four members: IKKα, IKKβ, IKKε, and TBK1. IKKα and IKKβ act with the scaffolding partner NEMO to activate NFκB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hacker and Karin, 2006</xref>). Although pharmacologic inhibition or genetic ablation of IKKβ defined a role for this kinase in insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yuan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arkan et al., 2005</xref>), the roles of the noncanonical kinases IKKε and TBK1 are less certain.</p><p>We recently reported that both mRNA and protein expression levels of IKKε and TBK1 are increased in adipose tissue from mice fed a high fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2009</xref>). Both of these kinases are increased as a consequence of the inflammatory program in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reilly et al., 2013</xref>), and contain NFκB regulatory sites in their promoter regions, allowing them to be induced upon NFκB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kravchenko et al., 2003</xref>). Deletion of the IKKε gene rendered mice partially resistant to some of the deleterious effects of high fat feeding, including weight gain, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2009</xref>). We report, in this study, that IKKε and TBK1 can desensitize lipolytic signaling in white adipose tissue in response to β-adrenergic agonists by phosphorylating and increasing the activity of PDE3B, in the process decreasing cAMP levels. Thus, induction of these noncanonical IκB kinases might contribute to catecholamine resistance during obesity, and blocking their activity has the potential to increase energy expenditure as an anti-obesity and anti-diabetes therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IKK<italic>ε</italic> and TBK1 overexpression decrease sensitivity to the <italic>β</italic>-adrenergic/cAMP pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes</title><p>Sympathetic activation of adipose tissue plays a key role in maintaining energy balance by stimulating lipolysis and fat oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coppack et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Langin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Festuccia et al., 2011</xref>). Activation of β-adrenergic signaling by either β-adrenergic agonists or cold exposure in white and brown adipose tissue initiates a cascade of events through cyclic AMP (cAMP), culminating in the transcriptional upregulation of Ucp1, which results in increased proton leak and energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Himms-Hagen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yehuda-Shnaidman et al., 2010</xref>). Our previous studies revealed that compared to wild-type (WT) controls, IKKε-deficient mice exhibited increased energy expenditure while on a high fat diet (HFD), accompanied by increased expression of Ucp1 in white adipose depots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, increased energy expenditure in IKKε-deficient mice was only seen in HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that upon induction of IKKε during obesity, the kinase might repress an increased adaptive thermogenic response to overnutrition. To explore this possibility, we overexpressed IKKε in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and examined <italic>Ucp1</italic> gene expression after treatment with the non-selective β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (ISO), or the β<sub>3</sub>-adrenergic agonist, CL-316,243. Fold difference in <italic>Ucp1</italic> gene expression was calculated by normalization of relative <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA levels in treated relative to control samples. Treatment of empty vector-expressing cells with ISO or CL-316,243 resulted in a 1.6-fold or twofold increase in <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA levels, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The induction of <italic>Ucp1</italic> gene expression in response to ISO or CL-316,243 was blunted when WT IKKε was overexpressed in these cells.

We thus modeled the obesity-dependent increase in the noncanonical IKKs by overexpressing IKKε in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, followed by assay of glycerol release in response to ISO or CL-316,243. Although both isoproterenol and CL-316,243 increased lipolysis in empty vector-expressing cells, overexpression of WT IKKε reduced the lipolytic effects of isoproterenol and CL-316,243 by greater than 40%, and also reduced basal glycerol release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The reduction in lipolysis by IKKε overexpression was accompanied by dramatically reduced phosphorylation of HSL and perilipin in response to ISO or CL-316,243 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Expression of the catalytically inactive kinase was less effective in blocking lipolytic signaling, although the levels of protein achieved by overexpression were lower compared to the WT kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Overexpression of TBK1 reduced phosphorylation of HSL in response to isoproterenol or the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Identical results were obtained when IKKε was overexpressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated with forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), as detected by western blotting with an anti-phospho-PKA substrate motif antibody. Overexpression of IKKε also repressed the phosphorylation of p38 (p-p38) in response to forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) or isoproterenol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), whereas overexpression of IKKε K38A was without effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While glycerol release is likely the result of changes in HSL and perilipin phosphorylation, it is important to note that we have not directly assayed whether re-esterification of glycerol intermediates are also affected. Taken together, these data suggest that similar to what is observed in obesity, overexpression of IKKε or TBK1 can repress lipolytic signaling. The partial effectiveness of the kinase-inactive mutants is puzzling, but may reflect their activation of endogenous IKKε or TBK1 kinases due to dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larabi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Since PKA signaling is responsible for Ucp1 induction in response to catecholamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2001</xref>), we explored the possibility that both IKKε and TBK1 might reduce β-adrenergic sensitivity of adipocytes by decreasing cAMP levels. IKKε overexpression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes reduced by greater than 80% the increase in cAMP levels produced by both isoproterenol and forskolin, whereas overexpression of IKKε K38A did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Previous studies have shown that decreased sensitivity to adrenergic stimuli in adipose tissue can result from reduced β-adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reynisdottir et al., 1994</xref>) or increased expression of α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stich et al., 2002</xref>). These studies represent the first demonstration that defects distal to the adrenergic receptor may also contribute to catecholamine resistance, and suggest that IKKε and TBK1 can attenuate the β-adrenergic/cAMP pathway in response to β-adrenergic stimuli in adipocytes in a cell-autonomous manner, and further that induction of these kinases during obesity may account for decreased energy expenditure by reducing sensitivity of adipocytes to β-adrenergic stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Prolonged treatment with TNFα decreases the sensitivity of adipocytes to β-adrenergic stimulation in a manner dependent on the activity of IKKε and TBK1</title><p>Obesity is accompanied by infiltration of proinflammatory macrophages into adipose tissue; these cells secrete inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, which generate insulin resistance by stimulating catabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hotamisligil, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lumeng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ye and Keller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ouchi et al., 2011</xref>). Although TNFα is known to increase lipolysis in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Souza et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Green et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Plomgaard et al., 2008</xref>), there is also evidence of a counterinflammatory response in obesity that may serve to repress energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gregor and Hotamisligil, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saltiel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calay and Hotamisligil, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reilly et al., 2013</xref>). We thus used TNFα to model the inflammatory milieu of obese adipose tissue in cell culture to determine whether the cytokine might also regulate β-adrenergic signaling in this context. While short-term treatment with TNFα augmented the increase in cAMP produced by forskolin treatment, this effect declined after 12 hr. After 24 hr of exposure, TNFα inhibited the production of the second messenger produced by forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

However, HFD-fed mice treated with amlexanox responded like normal diet mice, despite the fact that they were weight matched with control HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The fold increase in serum glycerol levels was also significantly higher in amlexanox-treated HFD mice, as compared to vehicle-treated HFD-fed mice.

Interestingly, levels of cAMP were increased after CL-316,243 IP injection in mice on HFD pretreated with amlexanox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

To examine whether inhibition of catecholamine resistance in obese adipose tissue by targeting noncanonical IKKs with amlexanox can lead to increase energy expenditure in diet-induced obese mice, we measured oxygen consumption rates of vehicle or amlexanox-treated HFD-fed mice after a single injection of CL-316,243 in metabolic cages.

Obesity is commonly associated with blunted whole-body catecholamine-induced lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horowitz and Klein, 2000</xref>). This is thought to occur through a number of mechanisms, including leptin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myers et al., 2010</xref>), as well as the reduced expression of β-adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reynisdottir et al., 1994</xref>) or increased expression of α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stich et al., 2002</xref>). White adipose tissue and cultured isolated adipocytes from obese human and mouse models exhibit decreased cAMP-stimulated lipolysis and fat oxidation, due to reduced energy expenditure from decreased mitochondrial uncoupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yehuda-Shnaidman et al., 2010</xref>). This desensitization to adrenergic activation is also a feature of childhood onset obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bougneres et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Enoksson et al., 2000</xref>), and has been observed in adipocytes from first-degree relatives of obese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hellstrom et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrate here a novel link between obesity and reduced sympathetic activity and β-adrenergic sensitivity, through the inflammation-dependent induction of the noncanonical IκB kinases IKKε and TBK1. Obesity generates a state of low-grade inflammation in both humans and rodents, which involves activation of the NFκB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wellen and Hotamisligil, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hotamisligil, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shoelson et al., 2007</xref>). Upon its prolonged activation, NFκB induces the expression of the noncanonical IκB kinases IKKε and TBK1. The induction of these kinases was blocked by administration of anti-inflammatory agents to mice without producing weight loss, suggesting that they are expressed in response to inflammation rather than obesity <italic>per se</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reilly et al., 2013</xref>). Deletion of the IKKε gene rendered mice partially resistant to weight gain, insulin resistance, steatosis and the long-term inflammation produced by high fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2009</xref>), and administration of the dual specificity IKKε/TBK1 inhibitor amlexanox to diet-induced obese or ob/ob mice produced even more profound effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reilly et al., 2013</xref>). The blockade of these kinases in obese rodents with amlexanox results in increased phosphorylation of PKA substrates in adipose tissue, along with increased expression of Ucp1, and improved rates of lipolysis and fat oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reilly et al., 2013</xref>). Amlexanox was shown to inhibit phosphodiesterase activity of rat peritoneal mast cells via an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Makino et al., 1987</xref>). Together these data indicate that IKKε and TBK1 might exert their physiological effects in part by reducing the sensitivity of adipocytes to β-adrenergic stimulation via changes in cAMP.</p><p>Data presented here suggest that the molecular target of IKKε/TBK1 is the phosphodiesterase PDE3B. Upon increased expression in the obese state, these kinases can phosphorylate PDE3B, causing an increase in the activity of the enzyme that cleaves cAMP, reducing the stimulation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of proteins in response to sympathetic activation. These proteins include HSL and perilipin, responsible for β-adrenergic-stimulated lipolysis, and other proteins such as p38 that regulate expression of Ucp1. The reduced sensitivity to β-adrenergic activation can attenuate lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, as well as adaptive thermogenesis.</p><p>Several issues deserve further attention. The first concerns the relative roles of the two noncanonical IKKs in this pathway. Both TBK1 and IKKε are induced in response to obesity-dependent inflammation, and appear to phosphorylate PDE3B on the same residues with equal efficiency. Although there are differences in expression of these kinases in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimada et al., 1999</xref>), and perhaps differences in the upstream signals that lead to their regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wunderlich et al., 2008</xref>), their relative roles in controlling this pathway remain uncertain. Additionally, the mechanism by which PDE3B is regulated remains uncertain. While phosphorylation correlates well with decreased levels of cAMP in cells, we have been unable to demonstrate increased catalytic activity of the enzyme due to phosphorylation by IKKε, TBK1 or the other kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kitamura et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Palmer et al., 2007</xref>) thought to regulate the phosphodiesterase. Perhaps the phosphorylation-dependent binding of the enzyme to 14-3-3 exerts changes in its localization and access to its substrate, thus explaining increased activity in cells.</p><p>How is it that insulin resistance produced by inflammation fails to block continued energy storage? One possible explanation may lie in the homeostatic response to inflammation itself, typified by the induction of TBK1 and IKKε. Our data confirm previous findings that TNFα and perhaps other inflammatory cytokines can promote lipolytic processes in cells after short-term treatment, but that after longer exposure elicit an inhibitory response that appears to be the result of TBK1 and IKKε induction. Thus, these kinases may be part of a ‘counter-inflammatory’ program that attenuates the extent to which inflammatory signals are effective, and also serves to conserve energy by repressing lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation through activation of PDE3B. Interestingly, PDE3B is also a target of insulin action in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Degerman et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, TBK1 and IKKε appear to co-opt insulin targets to conserve energy during obesity. These insights further suggest that the noncanonical IKKs might be interesting new therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO) unless stated otherwise.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Mowers et al. investigate mechanisms by which inflammation in response to HFD causes catecholamine resistance. These studies build on their prior work demonstrating that obesity-induced inflammation enhances the expression of non-canonical IKKε and TBK1 in adipocytes. Here, they present evidence that these kinases phosphorylate PDE3B, which subsequently leads to reduced cellular cAMP concentrations and a reduction of cAMP dependent pathways including lipolysis. The authors conclude that reduced energy expenditure in obesity may result from reduced sensitivity to sympathetic activation due to inflammation-generated signals in adipose tissue.</p><p>Both reviewers were of the opinion that the manuscript reports significant new findings. One reviewer stated, “Overall this is a timely and well-performed study that provides important new mechanistic information on the functional role of the non-canoncial IKKe and TBK1 proteins in diet induced obesity, energy balance and lipid metabolism.” The second reviewer noted, “The paper is well written and comprehensive despite a cornucopia of data.” Both reviewers also raised some substantial concerns that will need to be addressed by additional experiments. One reviewer made the general comment, “While the results on PDE3B phosphorylation are interesting and potentially important, the effects of IKKe and TBK1 on lipolysis are less impressive and require additional consolidation.” Specific comments to be addressed are as follows:</p><p>1) Lipolysis was determined as glycerol release per g of adipose tissue. This is problematic because adipose tissue mass and adipocyte size changes in response to high fat feeding. The “decrease” in lipolytic rates (Figure 1A) may result from increased TAG accumulation and adipocyte mass rather than from reduced lipase activities. Glycerol release should be displayed per cell or per DNA content and not tissue mass.</p><p>2) Also, glycerol release is a compound value of TAG hydrolysis and re-esterification of glycerol intermediates. In order to determine whether lipase activities are affected, it is necessary to measure their actual activities in in vitro assays.</p><p>3) The increase in lipolysis in response to ISO and FSK are surprisingly moderate (Figure 1A) and glycerol release data correlate relatively poorly to P-HSL levels (comparing Figure 1A with Figure 1C).</p><p>4) To strengthen the data on lipolysis the authors should analyze perilipin phosphorylation and the expression of ATGL/CGI-58. Particularly perilipin phosphorylation by PKA is a strong determinant of lipolysis.</p><p>5) Figure 2A: Why does UCP1 expression not return to the level of empty vector when IKKe is mutated (IKKe K38A)? What happens to UCP1 expression in TNFa treated 3T3-L1 cells?</p><p>6) Throughout all figures the induction of HSL phosphorylation in response to ISO and FSK is very inconsistent. Additionally, glycerol release and cellular cAMP concentrations do not correlate well with HSL phosphorylation (e.g., Figure 4B and Figure 4D) in the TNF experiments – why? What are the long-term TNF-treated phosphorylation patterns of HSL and perilipin?</p><p>7) Figure 4C lacks a true negative control of a kinase that does not phosphorylate PDE3B.</p><p>8) In several instances, the sample number is insufficient to provide statistically meaningful information. For example, the authors mentioned that in Figure 1A isoproterenol-induced glycerol release in HFD is not significant due to small sample size (n=2). The sample numbers need to be increased in order to make defined conclusions.</p><p>9) Isoproterenol induced glycerol release in ND IKKε KO is significantly enhanced compared to ND IKKε WT (Figure 1A). However there were no differences in phospho-PKA substrate phosphorylation (Figure 1B) and relative pHSL/HSL ratio (Figure 1C). In contrast isoproterenol-induced phospho-PKA substrate phosphorylation (Figure 1B) and relative pHSL/HSL ratio (Figure 1C) were significantly increased in HFD IKKε KO compared to HFD IKKε WT, although there was no difference in isoproterenol-induced glycerol release in HFD IKKε KO and HFD IKKε WT (Figure 1A). How can the authors interpret these apparent inconsistencies? Is this due to the lack of statistical significance due to the low sample size?</p><p>10) To study β-adrenergic signaling several agonist were selectively employed isoproterenol, forskolin, CL-316,243. It would have been preferable if more consistency in the agonist used were reported. For example, either isoproterenol-induced UCP1 expression or CL-316,243-induced glycerol release should be provided in either Figure 2A or Figure 2B, respectively, for completeness.</p><p>11) The data presented in Figure 3 clearly demonstrates that TNF-α induced IKKε in adipocytes suppresses cAMP and glycerol production, and that the IKKε and TBK1 inhibitors amlexanox and CAY10576 rescue the TNF-α induced defects. Since these are also pharmacological manipulations, it would be nice to have a genetic conformation, such as examining the effect of IKKε and TBK1 knockdown on TNF-α-mediated cAMP and glycerol production.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01119.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Lipolysis was determined as glycerol release per g of adipose tissue.

The “decrease” in lipolytic rates (Figure 1A) may result from increased TAG accumulation and adipocyte mass rather than from reduced lipase activities. Glycerol release should be displayed per cell or per DNA content and not tissue mass</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers bring up a good point, which reveals a fundamental problem in comparing these mouse models in which the weights are different. Although ?-adrenergic signaling and lipolysis are enhanced in white adipose tissue from IKK? knockout mice fed a high-fat diet, the body weights of IKK? knockout mice are reduced compared to WT mice. We realized that conclusions derived from these data are thus confusing and somewhat problematic. Because weight loss alone has the potential to improve catecholamine sensitivity in obese mice, it is impossible to determine from these data whether the differences were due to weight or direct IKK? effects. Furthermore, we now know that in addition to IKKε TBK1 also plays an important role in the regulation of the lipolytic pathway.</p><p>Because of these problems in interpretation of the data, we have elected to remove Figure 1 in its entirety from the revised paper. However, in order to address the issue of the direct role of IKK? and TBK1 in energy expenditure and catecholamine sensitivity in vivo, we have added another experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref> of the revised paper), demonstrating that weight-matched, amlexanox-treated mice are more sensitive to CL injection regarding energy expenditure, as measured by indirect calorimetry. We hope this is a more accurate and interpretable experiment that sheds light on this issue with in vivo data.</p><p><italic>2) Also, glycerol release is a compound value of TAG hydrolysis and re-esterification of glycerol intermediates. In order to determine whether lipase activities are affected, it is necessary to measure their actual activities in in vitro assays</italic>.</p><p>While it is relatively easy to demonstrate changes in lipolysis after treatment of adipocytes with beta-adrenergic agonists, the corresponding increase in lipase activity as measured in vitro is rarely more than 1.5 fold. Even when HSL is phosphorylated in vitro with recombinant PKA, the change in catalytic activity is relatively modest (up to about 50% increase in most studies (Krintel et al., <italic>FEBS J</italic>, 2009) and many others). The reason for this discrepancy is that in addition to its modest effect on catalytic activity, HSL (and perilipin) phosphorylation induces a translocation of the enzyme to the lipid droplet, where it can gain access to its substrate. This translocation effect relies on phosphorylation, and is probably the more important event in controlling activity in cells (Clifford et al., <italic>JBC</italic>, 2000, and many other papers). Because of this, HSL activity per se is rarely measured in vitro after cell lysis.</p><p>We appreciate that in addition to HSL phosphorylation, other events including re-esterification of glycerol intermediates may occur that contribute to changes in overall net lipolysis, and have modified the paper to include these possibilities. However, since the study is largely focused on the effects of IKK?/TBK1 on cAMP signaling, we feel that our demonstrated changes in HSL, p38 and perilipin (see below) phosphorylation are sufficient to make the point.</p><p><italic>3) The increase in lipolysis in response to ISO and FSK are surprisingly moderate (Figure 1A) and glycerol release data correlate relatively poorly to P-HSL levels (comparing Figure 1A with Figure 1C)</italic>.</p><p>Because of the reasons explained above, we have removed Figure 1.</p><p><italic>4) To strengthen the data on lipolysis the authors should analyze perilipin phosphorylation and the expression of ATGL/CGI-58. Particularly perilipin phosphorylation by PKA is a strong determinant of lipolysis</italic>.</p><p>As requested, we examined levels of phospho-perilipin using an anti-phospho-perilipin antibody that recognizes Ser522, which is a site phosphorylated by PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig5">Figure 1C, 2D, 2E, and 5C</xref>). Perilipin phosphorylation correlated well with HSL phosphorylation. We also analyzed the expression levels of ATGL and CGI-58 in response to long-term TNFα treatment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. We observed decreased levels of HSL and perilipin, which are targets of PPARγ (Deng et al., <italic>Endocrinology</italic>, 2006, Arimura et al., <italic>J Biol Chem.</italic>, 2004) because TNF? treatment resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in PPARγ expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as previously reported (Zhang et al., <italic>Mol Endocrinol.</italic>, 1996). However, expression of ATGL and CGI-58 were not changed in response to long-term TNFα treatment.</p><p><italic>5) Figure 2A: Why does UCP1 expression not return to the level of empty vector when IKKe is mutated (IKKe K38A)? What happens to UCP1 expression in TNFa treated 3T3-L1 cells</italic>?</p><p>This is an interesting question and points to the limits in interpreting experiments in which the kinase inactive mutants are overexpressed. Firstly, the levels of protein achieved by overexpression of IKK? K38A are consistently less than those seen with the WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>), probably because the kinase inactive mutant is somewhat toxic to cells. In this regard, using more IKKε K38A DNA in an attempt to reach similar levels of WT protein expression during electroporation was not successful, as the fat cells would not tolerate the transfection. We also tried to generate stable 3T3-L1 adipocytes by lentiviral transduction to resolve this problem, but achieved only 10% infection efficiency in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, again reflecting the toxicity produced by the dead kinase. Even though we were not able to achieve equal expression, we repeated our experiments to examine <italic>Ucp1</italic> gene expression in response to β-adrenergic stimuli in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing empty vector or IKKε, or IKKε K38A by electroporation. Interestingly, as shown before in numerous experiments, overexpression of IKKε K38A still produced a small reduction in the sensitivity of cells to β-adrenergic stimuli regarding <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), glycerol release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or cAMP signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) compared to when empty vector was overexpressed, despite the fact that levels of expression were lower than those seen with the WT kinase. We are not able to provide a conclusive explanation for this, but can point to one possibility. TBK1 decreases sensitivity to β-adrenergic stimuli, similar to the effect of IKKε (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B</xref>), and both endogenous TBK1 and IKKε are present in IKKε K38A expressing cells. Recent studies on crystal structure of TBK1 suggest that homo- and hetero-dimerization of both IKK? and TBK1 (Larabi et al., <italic>Cell rep.</italic>, 2013 and Tu et al., <italic>Cell rep.</italic>, 2013) could result in activation of the complex. Thus, dimerization of IKKε K38A with an endogenous active kinase may produce increased activity of the complex. We have discussed this possibility in the revised paper.</p><p>As requested, we also examined the effect of TNF? treatment on <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression in response to isoproterenol or forskolin, or CL-316,243 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1B</xref>). TNFα treatment reduced the induction of <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA levels in response to β-adrenergic stimuli in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</p><p><italic>6) Throughout all figures the induction of HSL phosphorylation in response to ISO and FSK is very inconsistent. Additionally, glycerol release and cellular cAMP concentrations do not correlate well with HSL phosphorylation (e.g., Figure 4B and Figure 4D) in the TNF experiments – why? What are the long-term TNF-treated phosphorylation patterns of HSL and perilipin</italic>?</p><p>We repeated our experiments to examine the effects of long-term TNFα treatment on phosphorylation of HSL and perilipin, and now include this new data in the paper. We observed that phosphorylation of HSL and perilipin correlated well with glycerol release and cellular cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> of the revised paper). We also observed that long-term TNFα treatments resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in HSL and perilipin phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p><italic>7) Figure 4C lacks a true negative control of a kinase that does not phosphorylate PDE3B</italic>.</p><p>As a negative control, we performed in vitro kinase assay using recombinant IKKβ with purified PDE3B as a substrate, since this IKK is most closely related to TBK1 and IKKε. PDE3B phosphorylation was barely detected with IKKβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p><italic>8) In several instances, the sample number is insufficient to provide statistically meaningful information. For example, the authors mentioned that in Figure 1A isoproterenol-induced glycerol release in HFD is not significant due to small sample size (n=2).

How can the authors interpret these apparent inconsistencies? Is this due to the lack of statistical significance due to the low sample size</italic>?</p><p>Because of the reasons explained above, we have removed the previous Figure 1.</p><p><italic>10) To study β-adrenergic signaling several agonist were selectively employed isoproterenol, forskolin, CL-316,243. It would have been preferable if more consistency in the agonist used were reported. For example, either isoproterenol-induced UCP1 expression or CL-316,243-induced glycerol release should be provided in either <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, respectively, for completeness</italic>.</p><p>We hoped to show one stimulus at the receptor level (the non-selective β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol or the β<sub>3</sub>-adrenergic agonist, CL-316,243) and one beyond the receptor (the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin) to emphasize the role of noncanonical kinases IKKε and TBK1 on catecholamine resistance beyond the receptor level. Since differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes predominantly expresses the β<sub>3</sub>-adrenergic receptor (Monjo et al., <italic>Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab.</italic>, 2005), CL-316,243 was also used in some experiments. As requested, we now show isoproterenol or CL-316,243-induced UCP1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and isoproterenol or CL-316,243-induced glycerol release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We view the discovery of post receptor involvement in adrenergic desensitization in obesity and its connection to the noncanonical IκB kinases IKKε and TBK1 as our most significant finding.</p><p><italic>11) The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> clearly demonstrates that TNF-α induced IKKε in adipocytes suppresses cAMP and glycerol production, and that the IKKε and TBK1 inhibitors amlexanox and CAY10576 rescue the TNF-α induced defects. Since these are also pharmacological manipulations, it would be nice to have a genetic conformation, such as examining the effect of IKKε and TBK1 knockdown on TNF-α-mediated cAMP and glycerol production</italic>.</p><p>This was an excellent idea and we pursued it. Unfortunately, it was not possible to achieve complete knockdown of IKKε and TBK1. Making matters more difficult, TNFα also induces both mRNA and protein levels of IKKε through NFκB activation (Reilly and Chiang et al., <italic>Nat Med.</italic>, 2013), even under knockdown conditions. The data below shows that we get ∼ 80% knockdown of TBK1 and ∼ 50% knockdown of IKKε in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by electroporation, but that 24 hours of TNFα treatment induces IKKε protein levels almost back to control levels, and also decreases PPARγ levels (Zhang et al., <italic>Mol Endocrinol.</italic>, 1996) in a dose dependent manner.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-01119-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p></body></sub-article></article>
