In contrast, the adult vestibular system can produce new hair cells in response to damage, or by reprogramming of supporting cells with the hair cell transcription factor Atoh1. We used RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to probe the transcriptional and epigenetic responses of utricle supporting cells to damage and Atoh1 transduction. We show that the regenerative response of the utricle correlates with a more accessible chromatin structure in utricle supporting cells compared to their cochlear counterparts. We also provide evidence that Atoh1 transduction of supporting cells is able to promote increased transcriptional accessibility of some hair cell genes. Our study offers a possible explanation for regenerative differences between sensory organs of the inner ear, but shows that additional factors to Atoh1 may be required for optimal reprogramming of hair cell fate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hair

mechanosensors present in the inner ear and lateral line organs of vertebrates. They are extremely vulnerable to the mechanical trauma of environmental noise exposure, and to ototoxic aminoglycoside antibiotics and platinum-containing chemotherapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Oesterle, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liberman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Francis and Cunningham, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liberman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sheth et al., 2017</xref>). Non-mammalian vertebrates are able to regenerate significant numbers of hair cells and achieve impressive functional recovery following deafening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brignull et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ryals et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Monroe et al., 2015</xref>), and naturally replenish hair cells in their vestibular and lateral line sensory organs by an ongoing process of self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corwin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corwin, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">JÃ¸rgensen and Mathiesen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roberson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kil et al., 1997</xref>). These regenerative processes involve the mobilization of neighboring supporting cells to re-enter the cell cycle and trans-differentiate into hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cotanche, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corwin and Cotanche, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ryals and Rubel, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stone and Cotanche, 2007</xref>). In contrast, the mammalian hearing organ, the organ of Corti, has an extremely limited capacity for spontaneous regeneration, and this has only been observed in immature or embryonic mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kelley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bramhall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cox et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkinson et al., 2015</xref>). This regenerative failure has prompted attempts to promote mammalian hair cell regeneration experimentally. A variety of manipulations, performed mostly in immature mice and rats, can induce neonatal supporting cells to divide and trans-differentiate into hair cell-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkinson et al., 2015</xref>). These include placing supporting cells in dissociated cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">White et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Oshima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sinkkonen et al., 2011</xref>), inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway, and activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkinson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kuo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maass et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maass et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ni et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, forced expression of the hair cell-specific transcription factor Atoh1 can cause supporting cells and non-sensory cells of the cochlea to convert to hair cell-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zheng and Gao, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kawamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Izumikawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yang et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yang et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kuo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). However, the mammalian cochlea becomes refractory to these various manipulations as the organ of Corti matures, and almost no regeneration can be induced after the onset of hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). As supporting cells are neither added nor replaced in the organ of Corti during this period, it is likely that maturation of cochlear supporting cells is responsible for their failure to divide and differentiate into hair cells. However, the mechanistic basis for this maturation remains elusive.</p><p>In contrast to the mammalian cochlea, mature mammalian vestibular organs are capable of a very limited, but significant, amount of ongoing hair cell production and regeneration following damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Forge et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rubel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kuntz and Oesterle, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ogata et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kawamoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golub et al., 2012</xref>). Small numbers of immature hair cells have been observed in the adult mammalian utricle, including in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>), and recent use of lineage tracing techniques have clearly demonstrated that small numbers of supporting cells can trans-differentiate into cells resembling type II hair cells in the adult mouse utricle, at a rate of about two hair cells added per week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bucks et al., 2017</xref>). This rate of replacement increases significantly after hair cells are experimentally killed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bucks et al., 2017</xref>). Hair cell production in the adult utricle is superficially similar to that observed during embryonic hair cell formation in mammals: it involves up-regulation of the Atoh1 transcription factor, and is regulated by the Notch signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golub et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bucks et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, overexpression of the Atoh1 transcription factor in normal or ototoxin-treated adult utricle organ cultures or immature mice leads to a robust production of hair cell-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shou et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>These results raise a number of questions regarding the capacity of mature supporting cells to contribute to hair cell regeneration and the capacity of Atoh1 to enhance this regeneration. First, what is the transcriptional response of supporting cells to hair cell loss, and are any aspects of the hair cell differentiation program activated in these cells in the absence of overt hair cell production? Second, are the hair cell-like cells produced in the utricle spontaneously after damage, or after transduction of Atoh1, <italic>bona fide</italic> hair cells, as opposed to a supporting cell-hair cell hybrid? Third, why are mature utricle supporting cells apparently more competent to trans-differentiate into hair cells than their cochlear counterparts? In the present study, we have addressed these questions using a utricle organ culture model of hair cell damage, combined with RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis of supporting cells. We find that hair cell loss alone leads to up-regulation of many characteristic hair cell genes in supporting cells, although these cells do not express typical hair cell markers such as Myosin7a. Transduction of these cultures with an Atoh1-expressing adenovirus induces significant numbers of Myosin7a-expressing hair cell-like cells and further expands the number of up-regulated hair cell genes. We show that the chromatin of hair cell gene loci in utricle supporting cells is maintained in a more accessible state than their counterparts in the mature cochlea, and that Atoh1 transduction of supporting cells can render the chromatin of some hair cell gene loci more accessible. However, Atoh1 transduction is unable to achieve complete conversion of supporting cells to hair cells, and we find that genes associated with mature hair cells are under-represented in our reprogrammed supporting cells.

GO analysis of the 346 additional hair cell genes induced in utricle supporting cells by Atoh1 revealed several significantly enriched pathways including gene sets for cilium (GO: 0005929; 12 genes, p=8.4E-4), cilium movement (GO:0003341; five genes, p=0.0012) and syntaxin binding (GO:0019905, six genes, p=0.004). Taken together, our results suggest that Atoh1 is sufficient to activate additional hair cell genes in adult utricle supporting cells compared to those induced by hair cell death and culture alone.</p><p>Although many hair cell genes were up-regulated in supporting cells after damage and <italic>Atoh1</italic> transduction, many other utricle hair cell genes (967 out of 1912 genes) were not significantly up-regulated in utricle supporting cells in either of these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). We performed GO analysis for these hair cell genes and found significant numbers of genes associated with maturation or function of hair cells. Many of these genes were associated with the GO terms âstereociliumâ (GO:0032420; 11 genes, p=4.74E-7), âdetection of mechanical stimulus involved in sensory perception of soundâ (GO:0050910; six genes, p=4.46E-4) and âauditory receptor cell stereocilium organizationâ (GO:0060088; seven genes, p=6.86E-6). We also compared our gene list to the proteins that have been previously identified in the stereociliary bundle of chick vestibular hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shin et al., 2013</xref>). 38 of the genes coding for chick utricle hair bundle-enriched proteins were also present in our purified utricle hair cells. Some of these hair bundle genes were also enriched in either Ad-tdTomato (11 genes) or Ad-tdTomato-Atoh1 (10 genes) treated cells. However, most previously characterized hair bundle genes failed to be induced in either condition, suggesting that although Atoh1 can up-regulate many hair cell genes, it does not appear to promote expression of genes associated with the mature characteristics of hair cells. Accordingly, although our Atoh1-infected cells expressed markers such as Myosin7a, we were unable to observe obvious organization of apical actin filaments into stereocilia-like processes by fluorescence microscopy after 10 days of culture.</p><p>We also observed that infection of supporting cells with Ad-tdTomato-Atoh1 virus up-regulated a significant number of genes (440 genes) that were neither present in mature hair cells, nor up-regulated by hair cell damage and culture alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Since Atoh1 also functions as a transcription factor in other cell types such as cerebellar granule cells, intestinal secretory cells and Merkel cells of the skin, we asked if any of the 440 genes activated by Atoh1 were also enriched in other Atoh1-expressing cells by examining published data sets from these tissues. Although some of these 440 genes were indeed expressed in cerebellar granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klisch et al., 2011</xref>), gut secretory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lo et al., 2017</xref>) or Merkel cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haeberle et al., 2004</xref>), we also found some of the 440 genes to be expressed in cell populations that do not express Atoh1, such as smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Himes et al., 2014</xref>) and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Habuka et al., 2014</xref>) in similar proportions to the Atoh1-expressing tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, it is unlikely that Atoh1 transduction is specifically up-regulating Atoh1 gene regulatory networks that normally function in other Atoh1-expressing cell types. Rather, it is more likely that Atoh1 is activating cryptic expression of genes that happen to contain accessible target sites in utricle supporting cells.</p><p>The transformation of supporting cells into hair cells not only involves the up-regulation of hair cell genes, but must also require the down-regulation of supporting cell genes. To determine the extent to which supporting cell genes are down-regulated after hair cell killing and culture, and whether this down-regulation can be enhanced by Atoh1, we analyzed the behavior of supporting cell-enriched genes in our RNA-seq experiments. We generated heat maps to observe the behavior of 2619 supporting cell-enriched genes in utricle supporting cells following hair cell killing and culture after infection with either Ad-tdTomato or Ad-tdTomato-Atoh1 virus. Several hundred supporting cell genes (608 were significantly down regulated in utricle supporting cells after hair cell killing and culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), including some genes associated with differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). A small number (107) of additional supporting cell genes were down-regulated when utricle supporting cells were infected with Atoh1 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Significantly, many supporting cell genes remained expressed in our cultured utricles after 10 days. Gene ontology analysis indicated that a significant number of genes remaining expressed in supporting cells were associated with GO terms such as cell adhesion, focal adhesion and integrin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Single cell RNA-seq analysis of the response of supporting cells to hair cell death and Atoh1 transduction</title><p>Our bulk RNA-seq analysis reveals that utricle supporting cells collectively up-regulate many hair cell genes after the utricle is treated with gentamicin and cultured for 10 days, and that additional hair cell genes are up-regulated by transduction with <italic>Atoh1</italic>. To determine to what extent our bulk RNA-seq data represents the averaging of varying responses of supporting cells to these conditions, we performed single cell RNA-seq analysis of purified supporting cells from utricles treated with gentamicin, infected with Ad-tdTomato or Ad-tdTomato-Atoh1 and cultured for 10 days (the same protocol as described inÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). To understand the transcriptional responses of individual cells in depth, we used the MATQ-seq technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sheng et al., 2017</xref>) that offers the advantages of a greater read depth and representation of transcripts than conventional single cell RNA-seq protocols. We manually picked, amplified and sequenced RNA from 34 individual tdTomato and 27 tdTomato-Atoh1 transduced supporting cells. We analyzed cells that had more than 1 million uniquely mapped reads, with each cell having around fifteen thousand genes identified. Of those 61 cells, 34 individual tdTomato and 22 tdTomato-Atoh1 transduced supporting cells passed quality control tests and were analyzed further.</p><p>To group single cells into respective cell types, we performed graph-based clustering followed by visualization using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Next, all 56 individual transcriptomes were computationally analyzed and the results were visualized after T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) dimensionality reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We found that the two groups of infected cells were generally well separated from each other in transcriptional space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We performed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of the 56 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) on the basis of their expression of the top 500 hair cell-specific genes identified in our initial bulk RNA-seq analysis of mature utricle hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Although we observed a heterogeneity in the relative expression of hair cell genes across individual cells, tdTomato-Atoh1 and tdTomato transduced supporting cells tended to cluster separately. Of four sub-clusters identified, one contained exclusively Atoh1 transduced cells (nÂ =Â 11 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, red cluster) and two clusters contained either exclusively tdTomato transduced cells (nÂ =Â 8 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; dark blue cluster) or almost all tdTomato transduced cells (nÂ =Â 20 tdTomato cells and nÂ =Â 1 Atoh1 cell; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, light blue cluster). A final cluster was more heterogeneous, containing 10 Atoh1 cells and six tdTomato cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, orange cluster). Many previously identified hair cell genes were expressed at higher levels in Atoh1-transduced cells compared with TdTomato alone â for example <italic>Pou4f3, Gfi1, Tmc1, Lhx3, Pvalb, Tomt, Mgat5b, Mreg</italic> and <italic>Rab15</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2015</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Moreover, our data, together with previous studies, show that Atoh1 transduction is able to promote some degree of supporting cell trans-differentiation into hair cell-like cells in the adult utricle, but not in the adult cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shou et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>). One explanation for these differences in regenerative capacity is that loci of hair cell genes may be more transcriptionally accessible in utricle supporting cells compared to their cochlear counterparts. To test this, we used ATAC-seq to evaluate the differential accessibility of hair cell gene loci in different cell populations in the utricle and cochlea. For this analysis, we focused on the 1912 genes we showed to be enriched in utricle hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As expected, ATAC-seq identified many examples of both proximal elements corresponding to the transcriptional start site (TSS) and distal elements in hair cell gene loci that were accessible in hair cells but not supporting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and supporting cell gene loci that were accessible in supporting cells but not hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, we also observed the presence of accessible DNA, indicative of relatively open chromatin, around the transcriptional start sites, intergenic regions and introns of hair cell gene loci in utricle supporting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>), suggesting that adult utricle supporting cells maintain some hair cell loci in a transcriptionally accessible state. However, these hair cell loci were nevertheless expressed at 1â2 orders of magnitude lower levels in supporting cells than hair cells. Examples of such loci are shown inÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>.Â Moreover, we saw no correlation between the expression levels of hair cell genes in either cochlear (rÂ =Â 0.04) or utricle (rÂ =Â 0.02) supporting cells and their relative chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3A,B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44328.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>ATAC-seq analysis shows hair cell gene loci are more accessible in utricle supporting cells compared to cochlear supporting cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of ATAC-seq profiles for a hair cell-specific gene, Lhfpl5, that is not expressed in supporting cells.

However, when we analyzed ATAC-seq peaks in distal regions more typically associated with enhancers, we saw that peaks that were accessible in mature utricle hair cells and supporting cells were comparatively less accessible in mature cochlear supporting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C,D</xref>). This suggests that differential chromatin accessibility may be one explanation for why mature cochlear supporting cells may not undergo spontaneous regeneration or trans-differentiation after expression of Atoh1.</p><p>Although we demonstrated that many hair cell genes can be activated in utricle supporting cells after culturing in the presence of gentamicin, and that transduction of Atoh1 can up-regulate additional hair cell genes, we nevertheless observed that almost 1000 utricle hair cell genes were not significantly up-regulated in supporting cells in either condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). It is possible that the chromatin at these loci was less accessible in utricle supporting cells compared to that of genes that were able to be up-regulated. To test this, we analyzed our ATAC-seq data to compare chromatin accessibility between hair cell genes that can be up-regulated in supporting cells after hair cell killing, or after hair cell killing and Atoh1 transduction (945 genes), versus hair cell genes that failed to be up-regulated in these conditions (967 genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

These data suggest that relative chromatin accessibility is not likely to be a significant determinant of whether a hair cell gene can be activated in utricle supporting cells after cell death or Atoh1 transduction.

We analyzed ATAC-seq peaks from both utricle and cochlear hair cells and supporting cells of different ages by de novo motif analysis to determine the representation of Atoh1 binding sequences in ATAC-seq peaks from each cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). As expected, whereas other known hair cell specific transcription factor binding motifs, including Pou4f3 and CTCF, are highly enriched in ATAC-seq peaks of adult utricle hair cells, Atoh1 binding motifs were not significantly enriched in ATAC-seq peaks of either adult utricle hair cells or supporting cells (p valuesÂ =Â 1.00E-9 and p valueÂ =Â 1 respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6âsource data 1</xref>).

It is therefore possible that when Atoh1 is expressed in mature supporting cells, it may bind to quiescent hair cell loci and render them more transcriptionally accessible. We were able to find examples of this behavior in our ATAC-seq analysis. For example, the hair cell specific gene, <italic>Rasd2</italic> contains a strong ATAC-seq peak in utricle hair cells, but the peak is not present in utricle supporting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, transduction of supporting cells with Ad-tdTomato-Atoh1 but not Ad-tdTomato renders this region accessible to a comparable degree to hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Analysis of the region of DNA corresponding to this peak confirmed the presence of an Atoh1 binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), together with binding sites for Pou, Tcf and Ascl transcription factors, and binding sites for Smad transducers of TGFÎ² superfamily signaling. Motif analysis showed binding sites for other hair cell transcription factors, including Tcf12, were also enriched in peaks that were created by transduction with Ad-tdTomato-Atoh1 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). To see if this phenomenon extended to other loci, we performed de novo motif analysis on ATAC-seq peaks identified in utricle supporting cells that had been transduced with exogenous <italic>Atoh1</italic>, with tdTomato-transduced cells acting as a control. We observed that Atoh1 binding motifs were enriched in the open regions of Ad-tdTomato-Atoh1 infected cells (P valueÂ =Â 1.00E-107; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6âsource data 1</xref>), but not in Ad-tdTomato infected cells (p valueÂ =Â 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6âsource data 1</xref>).</p><p>Together, these results suggest that activation of Atoh1 in supporting cells can either directly or indirectly reprogram the epigenetic landscape of utricle supporting cells to make some hair cell genes loci more accessible. However, increased chromatin accessibility around a given gene does not necessarily imply that gene will be transcribed. An example of this is shown for the hair cell gene <italic>Kcnj13</italic>, where Atoh1 transduction of supporting cells restores an ATAC-seq peak found in hair cells, but does not activate transcription of the gene in the transduced supporting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Moreover, we saw no changes in expression of the three genes (<italic>Gigyf2, Efhd1</italic> and <italic>Ngef</italic>) located withinÂ Â±200 kb of <italic>Kcnj13</italic>. When we compared ATAC-seq peaks unique to hair cells between induced and uninduced hair cell genes, we found about ten percent of those peaks became accessible in supporting cells after Atoh1 transduction in each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). This shows that Atoh1 is able to cause opening of the chromatin around some hair cell gene loci, but that this opening does not necessarily lead to transcription of those genes, suggesting additional transcription factors may be required to activate transcription of a given gene. Furthermore, we observed that Atoh1 transduction also leads to the opening of several hundred peaks that are not present in utricle hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplement 4A,B</xref>). This raises the possibility that some of the genes induced by Atoh1 may be activated by Atoh1 engaging cryptic binding sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Vestibular supporting cells in the adult mouse undergo a very slow rate of hair cell turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bucks et al., 2017</xref>) and do not show a significant response to Atoh1 transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, hair cell killing by aminoglycosides, extended cell culture or genetic ablation strategies appears to prime adult vestibular supporting cells to up-regulate some hair cell genes and generate hair cell-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golub et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bucks et al., 2017</xref>), and this hair cell generation can be enhanced by interventions such as Atoh1 transduction or Notch inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shou et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golub et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>). In the present study, we used a low dose of gentamicin applied for 24 hr that was sufficient to kill significant numbers of hair cells, but maintained supporting cells in a normal morphological state. Consistent with the idea that hair cell damage allows supporting cells to adopt a cell state that is more amenable to trans-differentiation into hair cells, we observed significant transcriptional changes in utricle supporting cells over a ten day period. However, these cells did not display any overt morphological features of hair cells, nor did they up-regulate canonical markers of hair cells such as Myosin7a. Adenoviral transduction of Atoh1 was required to induce expression of hundreds of additional hair cell genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). It is unclear whether the âprimedâ state of supporting cells persists for long periods after hair cell death, or whether it is an acute response to injury. Although our culture system is not suitable to answer such questions, it will be of interest to combine in vivo models of hair cell killing with transgenic methods of Atoh1 activation to measure for how long mature utricle supporting cells retain regenerative capacity after damage and hair cell loss.</p><p>The induction of hair cell genes in the utricle following hair cell death or Atoh1 transduction stands in contrast to the failure of the mature cochlea to generate hair cell-like cells after damage, and the failure of Atoh1 to promote trans-differentiation of mature cochlear supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Our ATAC-seq experiments show that the chromatin around the loci of hair cell genes common to the cochlea and utricle is more accessible in utricle supporting cells compared to their cochlear counterparts, which may underlie their higher capacity for regeneration. At present, we do not know how hair cell gene loci in utricle supporting cells are maintained in a more permissive state than cochlear supporting cells. Studies in chicken and zebrafish, which exhibit spontaneous hair cell regeneration, have demonstrated that genes involved in histone remodeling are important regulators of supporting cell proliferation. In birds, HDAC inhibition in regenerating vestibular epithelium results in decreased supporting cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Slattery et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly in zebrafish, HDAC inhibition result in reduced lateral line supporting cell proliferation and thus hair cell regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">He et al., 2016</xref>). Inhibition of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1, also known as KDM1A) in zebrafish also prevents supporting cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, a recent study showed that BMI1, part of the Polycomb repressive complex1 (PRC1), is required for supporting cell proliferation in neonatal mice by maintaining high levels of canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lu et al., 2017</xref>). Regardless of the mechanistic basis for the difference in chromatin accessibility in utricle and cochlear supporting cells, we believe it may contribute to the regenerative differences seen between these two mammalian sensory organs in mature animals.</p><p>Despite the large number of hair cell genes that could be activated in mature utricle supporting cells, we nevertheless observed almost 1000 utricle hair cell genes that were not up-regulated in supporting cells, even after hair cell killing and Atoh1 transduction. Many of these genes were associated with maturation of hair cell function, including hair bundle and kinocilium development. A recent study in which human utricle tissue was transduced with an Atoh1 adenovirus also reported phenotypes consistent with incomplete hair cell differentiation, including an absence of stereocilia and actin bundling proteins such as espin, and an absence of a cuticular plate and ribbon synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>). What are the reasons for this incomplete trans-differentiation of supporting cells to hair cells after transduction of Atoh1? One possibility is that our ten day period of culture and Atoh1 reprogramming is not sufficient to fully up-regulate the most mature hair cell genes. Studies of cellular reprogramming by transcription factors suggest that reprogramming events at the level of single cells initially proceed in a stochastic manner before an eventual entrainment of the fully reprogrammed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanna et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buganim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lujan et al., 2015</xref>). Our single cell analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), together with a recent single cell analysis of Atoh1 activation in the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yamashita et al., 2018</xref>), show a wide degree of heterogeneity in transcriptional responses to Atoh1 transduction that may underlie this incomplete transformation to hair cells. Alternatively, since Atoh1 is normally down-regulated as hair cells differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shailam et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Driver et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maass et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that persistent expression of Atoh1 after adenoviral infection actively represses genes associated with hair cell maturation that would normally be activated as Atoh1 levels decline. A third possibility is that some hair cell genes are regulated entirely independently of Atoh1 and are unaffected by Atoh1 expression. Alternatively, some hair cell genes may require additional transcription factors or co-activators for expression (for example, Gfi1 and Pou4f3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costa and Henrique, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Costa et al., 2015</xref>), and these are not up-regulated by Atoh1 expression alone. Finally, it is possible that the chromatin of some genes associated with hair cell maturation are less transcriptionally accessible in supporting cells than other genes associated with earlier steps in hair cell development. When we examined the behavior of supporting cell genes in response to hair cell killing and Atoh1 transduction, we also found many genes that remained expressed in utricle supporting cells despite 10 days of culture and Atoh1 expression. The reasons described above may also account for the persistent expression of these genes under these conditions. It is also possible that some of the genes expressed in supporting cells may act to directly or indirectly prevent access of Atoh1 to some of its target loci, and such genes might also constitute therapeutic targets.</p><p>The epigenetic and transcriptomic analysis undertaken in this study suggests that Atoh1 is not sufficient to induce expression of many hair cell genes in supporting cells, even when their chromatin is accessible. Our ATAC-seq analysis of Atoh1-transduced supporting cells suggests that chromatin accessibility of a given hair cell locus does not necessarily correlate with the ability of that locus to be transcriptionally activated by Atoh1 in utricle supporting cells. We compared the chromatin accessibility between hair cell genes that can be up regulated (945 genes) versus hair cell genes that failed to be activated (967 genes) in supporting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) but found no significant differences in the accessibility of either the transcriptional start site or enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, although we provide examples in which Atoh1 transduction can either directly or indirectly render certain hair cell loci more accessible when transduced into supporting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), we find no relationship between the opening up of chromatin at a given hair cell gene locus in response to Atoh1 and the activation of transcription from that locus in supporting cells in response to Atoh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Instead, de novo motif analysis of the chromatin peaks opened by Atoh1 shows that different sets of transcription factor binding sites are enriched in the peaks of loci that can be induced by Atoh1 compared to loci that cannot by induced by Atoh1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>Our data thus suggest that chromatin accessibility is not a good predictor of whether a hair cell gene is induced by Atoh1 in utricle supporting cells. Rather, we suggest that while Atoh1 may be sufficient to induce the expression of some hair cell genes, additional transcription factors or chromatin remodelers may be necessary to induce a full complement of hair cell genes in supporting cells. A number of transcription factors have been proposed to co-operate with Atoh1 during hair cell induction, such as Gfi1, Pou4f3, Isl1, Gata3 and targets of the Wnt signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costa and Henrique, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Costa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kuo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Walters et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yamashita et al., 2018</xref>). Systematic combinatorial testing of these transcription factors in the context of a better defined hair cell gene regulatory network will be required to define the best cocktail of hair cell transcription factors required for optimum reprogramming of a hair cell fate.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Atoh1-CreERT2</italic> (MGI: Tg(Atoh1-cre/Esr1*)14Fsh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Machold and Fishell, 2005</xref>) and Ai3 (MGI: Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm3(CAG-EYFP)Hze</sup>/J) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>) transgenic lines were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (stock numbers 007684 and 007903). <italic>Atoh1<sup>A1GFP/A1GFP</sup></italic> (MGI: Atoh1<sup>tm4.1Hzo</sup>; Jackson Laboratories stock number 013593) mice were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rose et al., 2009</xref>) and obtained from Dr. Huda Zoghbi, Baylor College of Medicine. <italic>Gfi1-Cre</italic> (MGI: Gfi1<sup>tm1(cre)Gan</sup>) mice were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2010</xref>) and obtained from Dr. Lin Gan, University of Rochester. <italic>Lfng-GFP</italic> (MGI: Tg(Lfng-EGFP)HM340Gsat) were generated by the GENSAT project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geschwind, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heintz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>).

No. N0447S), 0.1 M DTT 0.05 Î¼L, and 0.05 Î¼L RnaseOUT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. 10777019)) and 10 Î¼L of PCR-grade mineral oil (Sigma Cat. No. M8662) to prevent evaporation. MATQ-seq was performed on a Bravo Automated Liquid Handling Platform (Agilent). The lysis plate was then briefly centrifuged. Reverse transcription was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sheng et al., 2017</xref>). To distinguish the two strands, second strand synthesis was performed with a primer containing three mismatches to the first strand primer at the 3â end. The PCR products were then purified with 1.2x AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Cat. No. A63880).</p><p>To make double stranded cDNA, 20 ng of PCR product was diluted into 10Î¼Lof PCR grade water in each well of a 96-well plate and heated at 95Â°C for 30 s to melt the DNA. To perform the reaction, 10 Î¼L of enzyme mix containing 2 Î¼L 10X Thermopol Buffer, 0.6 Î¼L 10 Î¼M barcoded primer, 0.5 Î¼L 10 mM dNTPs, 0.3 Î¼L Deepvent exo-DNA polymerase (NEB, Cat. No. M0259S), and 6.6 Î¼L PCR grade water were added to each sample. The barcoded primer contains sequences specific to the first strand primer and a P7 sequence compatible with Illumina sequencer. 20 cycles of 20 s at 60Â°C and 30 s at 72Â°C were performed to add the barcoded primer to the first strand. 5 Î¼L of 50 mM EDTA was then added to each well to terminate the reaction. Samples were then pooled together and purified with 1x AMPure XP beads. 50 ng of the purified product was then tagged at 55Â°C for 5 min using the Nextera DNA library prep kit (Illumina, Cat. No. FC-121â1030). Libraries were then amplified with Nextera P5 primers and P7 primers supplied by the manufacturer to select only the amplicons with Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI) on the first strand. A Duplex-specific Nuclease (Evrogen, Cat. No. EA003) treatment was performed on 100 ng of the library to remove the ribosomal cDNA as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sheng et al., 2017</xref>). The samples were sequenced on an Illumina Nextseq500. Sequencing data have been deposited in GEO under accession codes GSE127683.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Single cell MATQ-seq analysis</title><p>For single cell data analysis, nine bases were trimmed from read two to remove amplicon index bases. Pair-end mapping was performed against the mouse genome (mm10) using STAR aligner. Gencode annotation release M10 (GRCm38.p4) was used for transcript annotation. Only reads with mapping quality over 250 were used for downstream analysis. Barcode retrieval, unique barcode counting, and gene expression quantification were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sheng et al., 2017</xref>). The mapping position of the reads was included as part of the identity of the corresponding barcodes. Only reads mapped to the exon region with correct strandness were used for gene expression quantification. tSNE plots were generated using MATLAB. Heat maps were generated using the clustergram function in MATLAB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>ATAC-seq</title><p>Approximately 5,000 FACS-sorted cells were used as input for ATAC. ATAC was performed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corces et al. (2016)</xref>. Briefly, sorted cells were spun down, FACS buffer was removed, the pellet was re-suspended in a transposase-containing reaction mixture complete with 0.05% digitonin prior to tagmentation at 37Â°C with 1000 rpm agitation for 30 min. Next, transposed DNA was purified with a Qiagen PCR MinElute kit (Qiagen 28004). Fast-ATAC libraries were purified with a 1.8X SPR purification using AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) beads following PCR amplification. Paired-end (75 Ã 75 bp) sequencing was performed on an Illumina Nextseq500 instrument. The number of biological replicates used were: Utricle hair cells (3), utricle supporting cells (3), tdTomato-infected utricles (3), Atoh1-tdTomato infected utricles (2), cochlear supporting cells (2). Each sample was sequenced to a depth of approximately 30 million reads. Sequencing data have been deposited in GEO under accession codes GSE121610.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>ATAC analysis</title><p>ATAC-seq reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using Bowtie2 with default paired-end settings. All non-nuclear and unmapped paired reads were discarded. Duplicated reads were removed with the picard MarkDuplicates function, using default settings. Peak calling for analysis was carried out with Macs2 on the merged BAM file, Macs2 callpeak --nomodel âbroad. Blacklisted regions identified by ENCODE from mm9 were lifted over to mm10 and then removed from the comprehensive peak file with the bedtools subtract module. Reads were counted for each condition from the comprehensive peak file using bedtools. Peak annotation was performed using annotatePeaks.pl (Homer). The annotated compiled peak files were used to identify which genes containing accessible peaks. For peak accessibility comparison between each condition, we isolated the called peaks that are assigned to specific groups of genes. We designated all peaks greater than 2 kb away from an annotated TSS to be enhancers. We then identified the unique and overlapping peaks between each group using bedtools. Aggregation plots were performed using annotatePeak.pl (Homer). Two normalizations were performed on the samples before the analysis. The read length of the samples was adjusted to 40 bp and the profiles were then normalized based on a set of common highly accessible region (i.e. about 100 peaks from top 1000 peaks of each sample). PCA and differential accessibility analysis were performed with the DESeq2 R package using the multicov file as input. Conditional quantile normalization was performed with the cqn R package. Motif enrichment analysis and individual condition peak calling was conducted with Homer. ATAC-seq signal heat maps were generated in Homer and visualized using Java TreeView. Bed graph generation for UCSC browser visualization of Fast-ATAC signals was performed with Homer, and all reads were normalized by read count, where scores represent read count per bp per 1 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Enhancer motif analysis</title><p>MEME suite 5.0.1 was used for de novo motif discovery and motif analysis of Atoh1 targets. Enhancer regions were extracted from the UCSD browser as an input file. The Atoh1 binding motif was extracted from the JASPAR database as the motif input. FIMO (find individual motif occurrence) were used to identify the occurrence of Atoh1 motifs on our input sequences. Subsequently, MEME was used to discover reoccurrence motifs in candidate enhancer regions and Tomtom application was used to match identified motifs to known motifs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Alyssa Crowder for expert technical assistance and past and present members of the Groves lab for help and advice, particularly Dr. Rende Gu for his invaluable assistance with demonstrating utricle dissection.

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Transcriptomic and epigenetic regulation of hair cell regeneration in the mouse utricle and its potentiation by Atoh1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor, Francois Guillemot as the Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with each other and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examines the capacity of transcription factor Atoh1 to reprogram cells in damaged mouse vestibules into hair cells. The authors use RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq analyses to show that Atoh1 fails to induce the transcription of a substantial number of hair cell-specific genes, including genes with opened chromatin, suggesting that essential co-regulators are missing for efficient repair.</p><p>The consensus from the referees is that this is a timely, well-conceived and well-executed study and that its conclusions are mostly supported by the data. However, the reviewers have identified several issues which will need to be resolved prior to publication. This should require new analysis of the data and changes in the text but little or no new.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use two different genetic labeling strategies to isolate hair and support cells from the utricle for differential expression analysis described in Figure 1. The purity of these cell populations is uncertain. What fraction of GFP+ cells isolated from the utricle of Atoh1CreER; Ai3 mice were contaminated with support cells, and what fraction of GFP- CD326+ cells were contaminated with hair cells? This information is necessary to rigorously evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the approach.</p><p>2) The number of hair cells lost in utricle explants cultured in the presence and absence of 0.1 mM gentamicin for 24 hours should be quantified.</p><p>3) The total number of support cells transduced with Ad-Atoh1-tdTomato that express Myo7a should be reported, rather than just documenting the percent of double labeled cells as shown in Figure 2F.</p><p>4) It is surprising that the massive increase in Atoh1 protein levels observed in Ad-Atoh1 compared to Ad-Tom infected cells (Figure 2C) is not represented by a similar fold increase in Atoh1 mRNA (Figure 2I). What might account for this disparity?</p><p>5) The authors primarily focus on uHC genes that are activated in uSCs in response to damage and Atoh1 transduction (Figure 3). It would also be informative to characterize uSC gene sets that are, and are not, repressed by damage and Ad-Atoh1 transduction, as they may also represent important barriers to HC transdifferentiation. Some of this data is reported for the single cell analysis in Figure 4âfigure supplement 2, but it may be worthwhile performing a more detailed characterization from the bulk RNA-seq data, highlighting candidate genes of interest.</p><p>6) Data in Figure 3B and C indicate that some genes involved in stereocilia bundle formation are upregulated in response to Ad-Atoh1 infection. Authors should comment on whether HC like-cells exhibit morphological features of uHCs and provide supporting evidence.</p><p>7) Do the 428 common hair cell genes mentioned in subsection âDifferences in the regenerative ability of utricle and cochlear supporting cells correlate with chromatin accessibility at the promoters of hair cell genesâ show near-zero expression in uSC and cSC? If not, the differential chromatin accessibility between uSC and cSC at promoters and distal elements of these genes may reflect differences in mRNA expression levels. A correlation analysis should be performed between ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data sets for each of the two cell types.</p><p>9) Is the open chromatin environment in uSCs specific for uHC genes?</p><p>10) Results in Figure 6 highlight examples where ectopic expression of Atoh1 in damaged uSCs induces chromatin accessibility at uHC specific sites that may or may not be associated with gene activation of the nearby gene. Does the activation of uHC specific genes by Atoh1 always correlate with gains in chromatin accessibility at endogenous sites? Cellular reprogramming by forced expression of transcription factors sometimes involves the activation of target genes through the use of cryptic transcription factor binding sites (Johnson et al., 2018). How often does Atoh1 activate HC specific genes through the use of ectopic sites of chromatin accessibility, i.e. ones that do not normally appear in uHCs? It may be of interest to report on these findings.</p><p>11) The Atoh1 dependent ATAC-seq peak in the terminal exon of Kcnj13 is intriguing (Figure 6C), especially given the role of exonic enhancers in the regulation of neighboring genes (Birnbaum et al., 2012). Have the authors explored the possibility that other genes in the vicinity of Kcnj13 are ectopically expressed in response to Atoh1 transduction? The authors suggest that additional transcription factors may be required to activate some uHC specific genes that are unresponsive to Atoh1, particularly in cases where ATAC-seq peaks are gained in the vicinity of uninduced genes (Figure 6âfigure supplement 3). The authors should acknowledge the alternative possibility that the nearest HC specific gene may not always be the target of the putative Atoh1 dependent enhancer.</p><p>12) A previous study on hair cell differentiation in adult mouse utricles (Lin et al., 2011; referenced in this manuscript) showed that 18 days was required for development of a clear differentiated hair cell phenotype with stereocilia development. Also, several studies in recent years have suggested that transient rather than constitutive overexpression of Atoh1 might be necessary for full differentiation of hair cells. These previous studies should be acknowledged.</p><p>13) Was the selection of 0.1 mM vs 1 mM gentamicin based on &quot;abnormal, elongated morphology&quot; of supporting cells after 24hour treatment with 1 mM gentamicin? Other than the image provided Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B, how were differences between the supporting cells quantified? Since 1 mM leads to significantly more hair cells loss than 0.1 mM and larger areas in the sensory epithelium to be 'filled' by the remaining supporting cells, isn't this expected? Without quantifying a statistically significant difference between the two conditions the current reasoning is not justified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44328.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use two different genetic labeling strategies to isolate hair and support cells from the utricle for differential expression analysis described in Figure 1.

This information is necessary to rigorously evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the approach.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we sorted hair cells or supporting cells from the utricle using our two sorting protocols and then re-analyzed the sorted cells:</p><p>- For isolating hair cells using Atoh1CreER; Ai3 mice, we stained the utricle cells using APC conjugated CD326 to mark epithelial cells; here, all the APC+ve, GFPâve cells would be considered contaminated supporting cells. We observe less than 1% of contaminating supporting cells.</p><p>- For supporting cells isolated from Gfi1-Cre; Ai3 mice and counterstained with CD326, we re-sorted the GFP -ve / CD326+ve population and analyzed GFP expression. Once again, less than 1% of the sorted cells expressed GFP, suggesting minimal hair cell contamination. We have now included the results of the re-sorting as a new Figure 1âfigure supplement 2. We can include this as a figure supplement if the reviewers wish.</p><p>The RNA-seq data obtained from our sorting was used to generate lists of utricle hair cell- or supporting cellenriched genes. When we compared the RNA-seq reads between our purified hair cells and supporting cells, we found many genes that differ by more than 5000 fold between these two populations. This observation, together with our re-sorting data above suggests that the lists of hair cell and supporting cell-specific genes are likely to be robust.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The number of hair cells lost in utricle explants cultured in the presence and absence of 0.1 mM gentamicin for 24 hours should be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot live label and follow hair cells in our explants, and so we are unable to quantify the numbers of hair cells lost from each explant during the first 24 hours of culture with gentamicin. However, we have now measured cell death and hair cell loss compared to untreated controls in the 0-24hour time period using caspase3 substrates previously used by Cunningham and colleagues to monitor cell death in the utricle. This data is now included as a new supplementary figure, Figure 2âfigure supplement 2. We note that cell death continues in the cultures after the first 24 hours, but the new data gives a reasonable impression of the effects of this moderate dose of gentamicin in the first 24 hours of treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The total number of support cells transduced with Ad-Atoh1-tdTomato that express Myo7a should be reported, rather than just documenting the percent of double labeled cells as shown in Figure 2F.</p></disp-quote><p>The number of supporting cells transduced with virus varies in each explant, so we have included data in the Results section showing the range of TdTom+/Myo7a+ cell numbers in our cultures as a new panel in Figure 2, together with the mean values. We feel that giving both the range and mean will give the reader the best impression of how our infection and reprogramming rates varied between explants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is surprising that the massive increase in Atoh1 protein levels observed in Ad-Atoh1 compared to Ad-Tom infected cells (Figure 2C) is not represented by a similar fold increase in Atoh1 mRNA (Figure 2I). What might account for this disparity?</p></disp-quote><p>The protein data in Figure 2C was obtained by infecting 293T cells and analyzing 2 days later, whereas the QPCR data in Figure 2I was obtained from infected utricles analyzed after 10 days, and so the two panels are not directly comparable. We were insufficiently clear in describing this, but we have now revised both the text and legend for Figure 2 to hopefully explain this better.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors primarily focus on uHC genes that are activated in uSCs in response to damage and Atoh1 transduction (Figure 3). It would also be informative to characterize uSC gene sets that are, and are not, repressed by damage and Ad-Atoh1 transduction, as they may also represent important barriers to HC transdifferentiation. Some of this data is reported for the single cell analysis in Figure 4âfigure supplement 2, but it may be worthwhile performing a more detailed characterization from the bulk RNA-seq data, highlighting candidate genes of interest.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed this analysis using the same approach shown in Figure 3. This new data is shown as Figure 3âfigure supplement 2. We find a similar trend to that reported in Figure 3B â we find that culturing damaged utricles alone down-regulates a significant number of supporting cell genes, and that Atoh1 further down-regulates an additional, small number of supporting cell genes. Supporting cell genes are generally much less well characterized than hair cell genes, and so none of the down-regulated genes jumped out as being noteworthy based on previously published studies. As the reviewer suggests, a significant number of our ~2600 supporting cell genes are NOT down-regulated by either damage and culture or Atoh1 transduction. It is indeed interesting to speculate whether expression of these recalcitrant supporting cell genes may serve as a roadblock to hair cell reprogramming, and whether additional hair cell transcription factors (such as Gfi1 and Pou4f3) may help overcome these impediments. We have expanded on this point in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Data in Figure 3B and C indicate that some genes involved in stereocilia bundle formation are upregulated in response to Ad-Atoh1 infection. Authors should comment on whether HC like-cells exhibit morphological features of uHCs and provide supporting evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe any obvious morphological specializations of the trans-differentiating supporting cells by light microscopy (for example, with fluorescently labeled phalloidin), either with or without Atoh1. This is consistent with the recent study from the Forge lab in which human utricles were transduced with Atoh1 adenovirus. In that study, the authors used SEM and TEM to examine their cultures, but were only able to observe small apical microvillar projections, together with occasional small projections reminiscent of kinocilia. It is possible that the transduced cells in both studies might develop more hair cell-like features with time (for example, the Lin et al., 2011 paper referenced below). Our lab is moving away from cultured utricle experiments to in vivo models of transcription factor reprogramming using transgenic mice carrying Creinducible transcription factors (including Atoh1), but these studies are still at a very preliminary stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Do the 428 common hair cell genes mentioned in subsection âDifferences in the regenerative ability of utricle and cochlear supporting cells correlate with chromatin accessibility at the promoters of hair cell genesâ show near-zero expression in uSC and cSC? If not, the differential chromatin accessibility between uSC and cSC at promoters and distal elements of these genes may reflect differences in mRNA expression levels. A correlation analysis should be performed between ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data sets for each of the two cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>In general, the RPKM values in supporting cells are 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than hair cells, although it is always a matter of judgment whether to filter/label these values as ânear zeroâ. To help the reader get an impression of these differences, we have provided examples of RPKM counts of 12 hair cell genes in hair cells and utricle and cochlear supporting cells in the main text and in a new graph (Figure 5âfigure supplement 2). We also performed a global correlation analysis of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data for each hair cell gene promoter. That suggests a very low correlation between chromatin accessibility of hair cell genes (ATAC-seq) and their RPKM in either cochlear or utricle supporting cells (r values of 0.02 and 0.03 respectively). That said, it is true that hair cell genes with higher expression levels in supporting cells display more variable chromatin accessibility signatures on average than their lowly expressed counterparts. This analysis is now provided as Figure 5âfigure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Is the open chromatin environment in uSCs specific for uHC genes?</p></disp-quote><p>It is hard to provide a clear answer to this question, as open chromatin is associated with actively transcribed genes as well as genes that are accessible but not transcribed. For example, utricle supporting cell-specific genes will obviously be accessible in supporting cells, and supporting cells â like all cells â express a variety of housekeeping genes that are maintained in a transcriptionally accessible state. To try and address the reviewerâs question with respect to hair cell genes, we filtered out genes that were did not show significant differences in expression between hair cells and supporting cells. For the remaining genes showing differential expression, we determined how many ATAC-seq peaks could be assigned to hair cell loci versus other loci. From our uSC ATAC-seq data, we found 3018 accessible peaks that can be assigned to uHC loci, and 6500 accessible peaks assigned to uSC loci. As expected, we found 26114 accessible peaks that could be assigned to other genes, such as housekeeping genes. Therefore, we do not think uHC loci have a uniquely open chromatin environment in uSCs compared to other regions of the genome. We have not included this analysis in the paper, but can add it if the referee(s) wish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Results in Figure 6 highlight examples where ectopic expression of Atoh1 in damaged uSCs induces chromatin accessibility at uHC specific sites that may or may not be associated with gene activation of the nearby gene.

How often does Atoh1 activate HC specific genes through the use of ectopic sites of chromatin accessibility, i.e. ones that do not normally appear in uHCs? It may be of interest to report on these findings.</p></disp-quote><p>To answer this question we isolated peaks from utricle HCs and Atoh1 transduced supporting cells (Ad-Atoh1), which could be annotated to genes that we found to be activated by Atoh1 expression. Next, we filtered these peaks for those which contained Atoh1 target motifs. Overall, we identified 241 peaks containing Atoh1 sites in uHCs and 281 peaks containing Atoh1 sites in Ad-Atoh1 supporting cells (now shown as Figure 6âfigure supplement 4A). Interestingly, only 70 peaks out of 542 (15.5%) overlapped between the two conditions. Next, we looked at the ATAC-seq signal from these 542 peaks and found that Ad-Atoh1 infected supporting cells do indeed possess high accessibility of sites not found in uHCs (Figure 6âfigure supplement 3B). Thus, this analysis suggests that, as the reviewer suggests, Atoh1 reprogramming frequently activates HC specific genes through ectopic sites not observed in hair cells in vivo. We have now added this to the Results section and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The Atoh1 dependent ATAC-seq peak in the terminal exon of Kcnj13 is intriguing (Figure 6C), especially given the role of exonic enhancers in the regulation of neighboring genes (Birnbaum et al., 2012). Have the authors explored the possibility that other genes in the vicinity of Kcnj13 are ectopically expressed in response to Atoh1 transduction? The authors suggest that additional transcription factors may be required to activate some uHC specific genes that are unresponsive to Atoh1, particularly in cases where ATAC-seq peaks are gained in the vicinity of uninduced genes (Figure 6âfigure supplement 3). The authors should acknowledge the alternative possibility that the nearest HC specific gene may not always be the target of the putative Atoh1 dependent enhancer.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, and we have now emphasized this in the discussion. To address this, we also searched +/- 200kb around the Kcnj13 locus. which includes Gigyf2, Efhd1 and Ngef. However, none of these genes show differences in expression between Ad-tdTomato infected cells and Ad-Atoh1 infected cells. We also mention this in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) A previous study on hair cell differentiation in adult mouse utricles (Lin et al., 2011; referenced in this manuscript) showed that 18 days was required for development of a clear differentiated hair cell phenotype with stereocilia development. Also, several studies in recent years have suggested that transient rather than constitutive overexpression of Atoh1 might be necessary for full differentiation of hair cells. These previous studies should be acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to more clearly emphasize the issues with down-regulation of Atoh1 versus constitutive overexpression in the Discussion section. Given the perdurance of doxycycline in the inner ear reported by Zuo and colleagues, it is likely that current tet-off technology may not be suitable for providing this temporally regulated expression of Atoh1 in the mature ear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Was the selection of 0.1 mM vs 1 mM gentamicin based on &quot;abnormal, elongated morphology&quot; of supporting cells after 24hour treatment with 1 mM gentamicin? Other than the image provided Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B, how were differences between the supporting cells quantified? Since 1 mM leads to significantly more hair cells loss than 0.1 mM and larger areas in the sensory epithelium to be 'filled' by the remaining supporting cells, isn't this expected? Without quantifying a statistically significant difference between the two conditions the current reasoning is not justified.</p></disp-quote><p>We were concerned that the abnormal morphology we saw in 1mM gentamicin might be reflected in abnormal patterns of gene expression in supporting cells. We chose not to pursue this rigorously with additional RNAseq experiments, simply because the 0.1mM treatment gave good hair cell death and supporting cell morphology looked similar to in vivo models of hair cell damage, such as the recent Bucks et al. paper from the Stone lab. In retrospect, we feel justified in using this concentration given that over 75% of utricle supporting cell genes do not change significantly after 10 days of this treatment, as we now show in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A.</p></body></sub-article></article>
