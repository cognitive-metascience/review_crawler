function as Notch ligands in a context-dependent manner. As these ligands share structural properties, the molecular basis for their functional difference is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the superiority of Dll4 over Dll1 with respect to induction of T cell development using a domain-swapping approach in mice. The DOS motif, shared by Notch ligands—except Dll4—contributes to enhancing the activity of Dll for signal transduction. The module at the N-terminus of Notch ligand (MNNL) of Dll4 is inherently advantageous over Dll1. Molecular dynamic simulation revealed that the loop structure in MNNL domain of Dll1 contains unique proline residues with limited range of motion. The Dll4 mutant with Dll1-derived proline residues showed reduced activity. These results suggest that the loop structure—present within the MNNL domain—with a wide range of motion ensures the superiority of Dll4 and uniquely contributes to the triggering of Notch signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>notch ligand</kwd><kwd>Dll4</kwd><kwd>Dll1</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16K08848</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hozumi</surname><given-names>Katsuto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22021040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hozumi</surname><given-names>Katsuto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Notch ligand, Dll4 needs the flexible loop structure in the MNNL domain of the extracellular region to efficiently trigger the Notch signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Notch system is highly conserved from invertebrates to mammals and regulates cell fate decisions during the development of various organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>). This system is composed of four Notch receptors (Notch1–4) and four Notch ligands, Delta-like (Dll) 1, Dll4, Jagged (Jag) 1, and Jag2 in mammals; the interaction between these receptors and ligands induces the proteolysis of the Notch receptor, resulting in the translocation of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) into the nucleus, where the binding of NICD with transcription regulators such as Rbpj and MamL1 activates several target gene transcription. It is well known that Notch system plays pivotal roles in the development of various mammalian tissues, including neuron/glia, intestine, lung, pancreas, and so on. Interestingly, the interaction between Notch receptors and ligands is different in each tissue.</p><p>The Notch system plays essential roles in T lymphopoiesis in the thymus. Loss-of-function experiments using Notch1-deficient hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and Dll4-deficient thymic epithelium in vivo clearly demonstrated that the Notch1-Dll4 interaction is pivotal for T lymphopoiesis in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Radtke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hozumi et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koch et al., 2008</xref>). It has been long believed that three-dimensional distinctive structure of the thymus was necessary for T lymphopoiesis. However, it has been found that T lymphopoiesis can be recapitulated in an in vitro monolayer-culture system, in which HPCs bear the exogenous active fragment of Notch1 or are cultured on Notch ligand-expressing stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hozumi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schmitt and Zúñiga-Pflücker, 2002</xref>). In this culture system, Dll1, as well as Dll4, can promote HSCs to differentiate into T lineage cells; however, the efficiency of Dll1 to promote HSC differentiation into T cells is lower than that of Dll4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besseyrias et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mohtashami et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>As Dll1 expression is not clearly detected in the mammalian thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heinzel et al., 2007</xref>), and the Dll1-deficient thymic epithelium remained intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hozumi et al., 2004</xref>), this in vitro result seems not be worth paying attention to. However, from the evolutionary point of view, cartilaginous fish possesses only Dll1 but not Dll4, suggesting that Dll1 is the only Notch ligand which contributes to T lymphopoiesis in the thymus of cartilaginous fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bajoghli et al., 2009</xref>). As cartilaginous fish lack the development of some major T cell sub-populations in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Venkatesh et al., 2014</xref>), the acquisition of Dll4 seems to be associated with the explosive evolution of T cell-mediated immune system. Furthermore, it has been reported that in some processes, such as the development of arterial vascular endothelium and presomitic mesoderm, Dll1 is not fully substituted by Dll4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Preuße et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tveriakhina et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, the physiological function of Dll1 and Dll4 is different. However, the molecular basis underlying this difference, and the preferential contribution of Dll4 to T lymphopoiesis is not fully understood.</p><p>Dll1 and Dll4 are type I cell-surface proteins that are composed of several distinct domains; MNNL (module at the N-terminus of Notch ligands), DSL (Delta/Serrate/Lag-2), and 8 EGF-like repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>). A study that used recombinant soluble Notch1 and Dll proteins revealed that the N-terminus of Dll1/4 spanning from MNNL to the 3<sup>rd</sup> EGF-like repeat is enough to compare the simple affinity to Notch1, which was 10-fold higher for Dll4 than for Dll1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrawes et al., 2013</xref>). Especially, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> EGF-like repeat of Dll1 are known to form a distinct secondary structure. The DOS motif is common among Dll1, Jagged1, Jagged2—but not in Dll4—which were reported to contribute to binding with Notch receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Komatsu et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, it is assumed that Dll4 binds to Notch1 with stronger affinity than Dll1 and in a different manner from other Notch ligands, as far as the truncated and soluble form of Notch receptors and ligands are concerned.</p><p>The high-resolution structure of Notch1-Dll4 was revealed using a high-affinity mutant of Dll4, showing that Dll4 binds to Notch1 via two domains, MNNL and DSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luca et al., 2015</xref>). However, the contribution of the MNNL domain to the difference between Dll1 and Dll4 with the swapping strategy has not been reported. Recently, it has been shown that functional differences between Dll1 and Dll4, observed in vivo, resides in the extracellular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tveriakhina et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, these ligands differ in their ability to activate different Notch receptors, such as Notch1 and Notch2, in vitro, which is due to their N-terminal region that encompasses MNNL to the 3<sup>rd</sup> EGF-like repeat. However, their difference cannot simply be accounted for by interfacial residues in the MNNL-DSL region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tveriakhina et al., 2018</xref>), which has been observed using high-resolution structural information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luca et al., 2015</xref>); moreover, the part(s) of the domain, which have significant functions in the interaction with Notch1, remain to be known.</p><p>In this study, we confirmed the superior function of Dll4 compared to Dll1 as a transmembrane Notch ligand; Dll1 could not promote T cell development in the BM and Dll4 could deliver Notch1-mediated signaling more prominently than Dll1 in vitro. We constructed several domain-swapping mutants of Dll1/Dll4 and estimated the ability of each domain to induce T lymphopoiesis and Notch1-mediated signaling in vitro. Among the domains previously reported, we revealed that the MNNL domain of Dll4 contributes to the stable binding to Notch1, presumably via flexible loop structure with disulfide bond including several interfacial residues within the domain. In contrast, that of Dll1 contains a similar loop structure with limited range of motion. These results suggested that Dll1 and Dll4 differently bind with Notch1 due to the different dependency on their domain structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ectopic expression of Dll4 but not Dll1 induces T cell development in the bone marrow</title><p>We established conditional transgenic mice in which one copy of <italic>Dll1</italic> or <italic>Dll4</italic> gene was transcribed by CAG promoter after a Cre-dependent gene depletion of floxed <italic>GFP</italic> cDNA with the translational termination codon at <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus (hereafter referred to as iD1 for Dll1 and iD4 for Dll4 Tg mice, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The glycosyl modification of Notch receptors by Lfng or Mfng is well known to be effective in enhancing their affinities towards Dll but reduced their affinities to the Jag family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fortini, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>). Dll1-based chimeras with Dll4-derived EGF1-2, named D1-D4E1-2 and D1-D4DSL/E1-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), lost their ability to bind to Notch receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, the activity of signal transduction via Notch1 was examined by luciferase reporter assay (TP-1 reporter, driven by 6xRbpj binding sites) with or without Lfng. Expression levels of NotchL were monitored by the expression of GFP in this experiment and almost all transfectants were comparable. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). While the high levels of NotchL expression used in this experiment made it less sensitive to the difference between Dll1 and Dll4, the effects of the domain-swapping chimeras were strongly evident. These chimeras exhibited reduced activity to transduce Notch1-mediated signaling in the reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, reduced or eliminated activity for signal transduction by D1-D4DSL and D1-D4DSL/E1-2 was seen even though these constructs were expressed even more highly than Dll1. As only D1-D4E1-2 transfectant showed the lower expression of GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), its weak activity in the reporter assay might be due to the insufficient expression. However, its binding efficiency with Notch1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and signal transduction by D1-D4DSL/E1-2 in the reporter assay were also low. Thus, it was likely that the DOS motif present in EGF1-2 of Dll1 is necessary for the function of Dll1, which was consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, these swapping mutants did not promote T cell differentiation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Conversely, Dll4-based chimeras with Dll1-derived EGF1-2, D4-D1E1-2, and D4-D1DSL/E1-2 enhanced their activities, binding to Notch1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), signal transduction via Notch1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and induction of T cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicated that the DOS motif also contributes to enhancing the activity of Dll4. Similar results were obtained with other swapping mutants containing one amino acid substitution—P<sup>260</sup> of Dll1 to N, which was conserved in the DOS motif, or vice versa—D1-P260N and D4-N258P (data not shown), as shown in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the swapping chimeras of DSL domains neither efficiently bind to Notch receptors nor induce Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating their specificity to exert full activity. These results suggested that DOS motif, shared by NotchLs except Dll4, is crucial for the functionality of Dll1 and even capable of enhancing that of Dll4 in chimera. Thus, the superiority of Dll4 cannot be explained by the difference in DSL and EGF1-2 domains, which are known to be critical for binding to Notch receptors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The swapping chimeras of DSL domain and/or the 1<sup>st</sup>/2<sup>nd</sup> EGF-like repeats between Dll1 and Dll4.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic structure of the Dll variants.

We next examined the significance of MNNL domain of Dll4 using other swapping chimera constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which included HA tag for comparing protein expression levels. This shows that the chimeras are expressed to similar absolute levels per cell. Furthermore, swapping the MNNL domain in Dll1 does not affect expression of its DOS motif as detected by HRJ1-5, although swapping the MNNL domain of Dll4 does appear to reduce its reactivity with an antibody against the Dll4 DSL domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Consistent with our in vitro and in vivo experiments, the interaction energy of Dll4/Notch1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, black line) was lower than that of D4-D1MNNL/Notch1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, red line), suggesting that the former interaction was more stable. Then, we focused our attention on the differences in the amino acid sequence of the loop structure with disulfide bond (C-C loop, dotted circle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and D</xref>) present in the MNNL domain, between Dll1 and Dll4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This is because the C-C loop of Dll1 contains a characteristic proline-rich amino acid region (PEPP-region, underline, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) that restricts the movement of the C-C loop in the MNNL domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), probably due to the conformational rigidity created by the presence of several proline residues (magenta sticks, lower panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This loop structure also includes the residues (<sup>64</sup>His and <sup>65</sup>Phe, bold green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) that comprise the binding surface of MNNL domain of Dll4 which interacts with Notch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luca et al., 2015</xref>).

The MNNL of Dll1 loses the ability to move widely with its rigidity and the EGF1-2 of Dll4 lacks the DOS motif. It has been well known that the DSL domain is highly conserved from invertebrates to mammals and is essential to maintain the structure and function of NotchLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tax et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cordle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chillakuri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kershaw et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, the additional domain, MNNL in Dll4 and EGF1-2 in Dll1, is further required for the stable interaction with Notch. We showed here that Dll1 and Dll4 differently use the neighboring domains of DSL. However, these results were mainly obtained in vitro and might be seen under conditions in the middle of the dynamic range between Notch and NotchL, where the additional domains seem to be essential. Therefore, our conclusions need to be verified in physiological condition.</p><p>Molecular basis of the interaction between Notch1 and Dll4 was provided by the high-resolution structural analysis and showed that several interfacial residues within the MNNL and DSL domains of Dll4 directly interact with Notch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luca et al., 2015</xref>). However, it was reported that the Dll4-based mutant containing an exchange of the MNNL from 65<sup>th</sup> Phe (Dll4) to Tyr (Dll1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, bold green), and of DSL with several contact residues from Dll1, did not alter its selectivity toward Notch1 characteristic of Dll4. Therefore, it was suggested that residues outside of the MNNL-DSL contact interface of Dll4 contribute to the functional characteristics of Dll4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tveriakhina et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, in this study, we demonstrate that, when approaching Notch1, the MNNL of Dll1 does not behave as that of Dll4 and that Dll1 efficiently triggers Notch1 depending on the DOS motif present in EGF1-2 of Dll1 but not Dll4. Thus, the unique approach of Dll family members is based on the domains used differently in the binding to Notch1, but not on the distinctive amino acid residues.</p><p>We observed the difference between ectopic Dll1 and Dll4 in the ability to induce and suppress T- and B-lineage cells, respectively, in the BM, where exogenous Dll proteins were expressed, at least, in both hematopoietic and mesenchymal cell lineages. Previous studies with retrovirus-mediated transduction of Dll1 or Dll4 into hematopoietic cells and transfer into lethally irradiated mice suggested the superiority of Dll4 over Dll1; however, these experiments did not ensure the sufficient expression of Dll1 to function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de La Coste et al., 2005</xref>). In our established mouse model, exogenous Dll1, as well as Dll4, clearly suppressed B cell development in the BM; however, it was not enough for the appearance of CD4, CD8-bearing immature T cells. These results suggested that Dll4 in BM transduces the Notch signaling into HPCs for T cell development more efficiently than Dll1 and confirmed that there is a different requirement regarding the threshold of Notch signaling for the suppression of B cell and the induction of T cell lineages in vivo, as previously shown in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koga et al., 2018</xref>). We have previously shown that on the monolayer culture of HPCs, Gata3 is necessary only for the induction of the T-lineage cells, but not for the suppression of B-lineage cells by Notch signaling, suggesting the presence of different mechanisms downstream of Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hozumi et al., 2008b</xref>). The quantitative difference in Notch signaling seems to be converted into the distinctive cellular events at the hematopoietic progenitor stage.</p><p>Although it has been suggested that Dll4 induces Notch1-mediated signaling more efficiently than Dll1, its quantitative evaluation was only conducted by their affinities using soluble forms of both Dll and Notch1 proteins as truncated parts of the extracellular domains and demonstrated that Dll4 binds with more than 10-fold higher affinity than Dll1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrawes et al., 2013</xref>). As NotchL triggers Notch signaling in the neighboring cells only as a transmembrane protein and not in its truncated soluble form, alterations in its levels should be quantitatively evaluated only as a transmembrane protein. In this study, we aimed to compare full-length Dll proteins as transmembrane form by measuring their serially diluted expression on stromal cells and by their ability to induce T-lineage cells. Further, we evaluated their biological effect on HPCs. Dll4 present on stromal cells supported T cell differentiation 3–6-fold more efficiently than Dll1, which seemed to be less when compared to the difference in their affinities to Notch1. HPCs express both Notch1 and Notch2 on their surface, and the latter contributes to the induction of T-lineage cells only on interacting with Dll1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besseyrias et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fiorini et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that the total signaling induced by Dll1 was mediated by Notch1 as well as Notch2, while that induced by Dll4 was through Notch1 alone. We realized that the functional difference in the ability to induce T-lineage cells should be assessed under this situation.</p><p>It is obvious that the determination of T cell fate is regulated only by the <italic>trans</italic>-activation of Notch signaling between NotchL and Dll4 on thymic epithelium (environment), and Notch1 on thymic immigrants (progenitors). In contrast, Notch-NotchL interaction seems to facilitate not only <italic>trans</italic>-activation but also <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition during the development of various tissue, because Notch signaling occurs between two equivalent progenitors in which Notch and NotchL simultaneously function, according to the lateral inhibition theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">del Álamo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>). In fact, functional difference between Dll1 and Dll4 is also observed during somitogenesis and Dll4 cannot rescue the defect of Dll1, which is explained by the difference between their action through the <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Preuße et al., 2015</xref>). This situation is not suitable due to its complexity and makes it difficult to understand the correlation between molecular events and biological responses. In this study, we showed their functional and structural difference for the T cell induction in which Notch-NotchL interaction only occurs between the cells with <italic>trans</italic>-activation, which reflected their affinities.</p><p>The MNNL domain is known to be essential for triggering Notch signaling in the immobilized short fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrawes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shimizu et al., 1999</xref>). The MNNL domain is conserved between the two NotchL families, and missense mutations were found in Alagille syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chillakuri et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, Jag1 exhibited structural similarity to the C2 domain of protein kinase C, which bears phospholipid-binding properties in a calcium-dependent manner and is also necessary for efficient Notch activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chillakuri et al., 2012</xref>). Recent study reported that the MNNL of Dll4 binds directly to Notch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luca et al., 2015</xref>), while the similarity to PKC is not detected in those of Dll ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luca et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kershaw et al., 2015</xref>), raising the question of how MNNL contributes to the binding to Notch. Here, we showed that the MNNL domain of Dll4—that contains the loop structure with disulfide bond (C-C loop) with a wide range of motion—was critical for binding to the Notch receptor and activation of the Notch pathway, a process that results in the promotion of T cell development in vitro. The Phe<sup>65</sup> and His<sup>64</sup> residues in the C-C loop partly comprise the interface that binds to Notch1, and directly interacts with the O-Fuc moiety on Thr<sup>466</sup> and Leu<sup>468</sup>/Ile<sup>477</sup> residues in the EGF12 domain of Notch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luca et al., 2015</xref>). The wide motion ensured by the flexible C-C loop structure seems to contribute to a more effective interaction with Notch1 EGF12. The actual signal transduction as assessed by luciferase reporter assay, was more affected by the substitution and insertion of unique proline residues in MNNL domain of Dll4, compared to the simple binding to Notch. This reduced signal transduction suggests that the motion of the C-C loop serves to generate the pulling force for the transendocytosis of the Notch extracellular domain. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weinmaster and Fischer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Musse et al., 2012</xref>). The Dll4 mutant with Dll1-derived MNNL was less effective than that with two proline residues, suggesting that other part(s) of MNNL play a role in the triggering of Notch signaling.</p><p>It has been recently shown that in addition to MNNL and DSL domains, the 3<sup>rd</sup> EGF-like repeat is essential for the distinctive function of Dll ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tveriakhina et al., 2018</xref>). We have confirmed that the 3<sup>rd</sup> EGF-like repeat of Dll4, but not of Dll1, plays an important role in signal transduction (unpublished data). In contrast to Dll1, which approaches the Notch receptor via the DSL domain and the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> EGF-like repeat with the DOS motif, Dll4 seems to access Notch via the MNNL and DSL domains, supported by the 3<sup>rd</sup> EGF-like repeat. The structural cooperation among these regions should be further investigated for the precise understanding of Notch-NotchL interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and constructs</title><p>We cloned cDNAs encoding the swapping mutants of Dll1 and Dll4 as below: D1-D4DSL, <italic>Dll1</italic> cDNA was digested by SalI/ScaI, removing the DSL region, and ligated with synthetic Dll4-derived cDNA encoding DSL domain flanked by 5’ SalI and 3’ ScaI sites; <italic>D4-D1DSL</italic>, <italic>Dll4</italic> cDNA was digested by AflII/ScaI, removing the DSL region, and ligated with synthetic Dll1-derived cDNA encoding DSL domain flanked by 5’ AflII and 3’ ScaI sites; <italic>D1-D4E1-2</italic>, <italic>Dll4</italic> cDNA was digested by ScaI/Bst1107I, removing the 1<sup>st</sup>/2<sup>nd</sup> EGF region, and ligated with synthetic Dll4-derived cDNA encoding the 1<sup>st</sup>/2<sup>nd</sup> EGF region flanked by 5’ ScaI and 3’ Bst1107I sites; <italic>D4-D1E1-2</italic>, <italic>Dll4</italic> cDNA was digested by ScaI/BglII, removing the 1<sup>st</sup>/2<sup>nd</sup> EGF region, and ligated with synthetic Dll1-derived the 1<sup>st</sup>/2<sup>nd</sup> EGF region flanked by 5’ ScaI and 3’ BglII sites; <italic>D1-D4MNNL</italic>, <italic>Dll1</italic> cDNA was digested by EcoRI (5’ terminal as cloning site) and ScaI, removing MNNL and DSL regions, and ligated with EcoRI/ScaI fragment from D4-D1DSL encoding Dll4-derived MNNL and Dll1-derived DSL domains; <italic>D4-D1MNNL</italic>, <italic>Dll4</italic> cDNA was digested by EcoRI and ScaI, removing MNNL and DSL regions, and ligated with EcoRI/ScaI fragment from D1-D4DSL encoding Dll1-derived MNNL and Dll4-derived DSL domains.

The authors found that ectopic expression of DLL4 but not DLL1 induced T cell development in the bone marrow. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the MNNL domain of DLL4 is necessary for the Notch signaling and that the flexible movement of the C-C loop in the MNNL domain of DLL4 was important for binding and function. These findings are valuable and novel in regard to molecular selectivity. In the revised manuscript, authors provided a good overview of the previous work and explained the unique points of the current study.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Δ-like 1 and Δ-like 4 differently require their extracellular domains for triggering Notch signaling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper from a pioneer in the field of Notch regulation of T-cell development focuses on the structural differences between DLL1 and DLL4 as ligands for Notch1. They first found that thymus immature T cells only appeared in the BM with exogenous DLL4 more efficiently DLL1. Second, more importantly, they demonstrated that the MNNL domain of DLL4 is necessary for the Notch signaling and that the flexible movement of the C-C loop in the MNNL domain of DLL4 was important for binding and function. These findings are valuable and novel in regard to molecular selectivity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are three points.</p><p>First, in regard to writing, authors did not fairly refer similar Tveriakhina's paper. Authors should write more explicitly with this paper's results, and more importantly, they should clearly mention which points are still not unanswered, which has been tackled by this manuscript.</p><p>Second, thymus in vivo results are not strongest part of this manuscript. The experiments in Figure 1 supports Figure 2, but the differences in expression level between the DLL4 expressing transgene and the DLL1 expressing transgene, in the hematopietic cells and stromal cells, make the results difficult to interpret. Authors do not need to remove these results, but they should discuss the results more carefully in light of this expression difference.</p><p>Finally, it is very important to quantitate the expression levels of the different chimeras in the main in vitro experiments, Figure 3 and Figure 4. The binding to Notch1 by a cell is hard to interpret unless we know how strongly each of the different chimeras is expressed on that cell.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Δ-like 1 and Δ-like 4 differently require their extracellular domains for triggering Notch signaling in mice&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Satyajit Rath (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>As seen in the below reviewers' comments, reviewers request no more additional experiments, but do request authors to carefully re-write the manuscript, particularly from the following points.</p><p>1) Emphasize the unique points of this study, compared with previous reports (for instance, the results of Tveriakhina et al).</p><p>2) Describe somewhere that there could be more contribution of additional domains to DII4 vs Dll1 affinity for Notch1 that would be seen under conditions more in the middle of the dynamic range.</p><p>3) It is not always clear to the readers what alternative hypotheses can be ruled out at each point.</p><p>4) Emphasize the implications of the new supplementary data.</p><p>5) It is also not clear in the text with distinguishing between effects that are clear and effects that are not.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>I can see that the revised version has dealt with some points raised by reviewers, and the manuscript has been improved clearly. However, their explanation was not adequately clarified their advantage. Advance of this manuscript would be a role of E3 domain in comparison with the Tveriakhina's work, and the main point is that the reduced number of Pro residues in a C-C loop of the MNNL domain explain the advantage of DLL4 as ligands for Notch1. It will be more understandable as a clear advantage if the authors emphasize the specific points about the previously non-covered part of the DLL4 function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>The authors have definitely improved the manuscript, and their addition of the new supplementary figures showing measurements of expression levels is particularly welcome. The work is quite interesting and suggests There is still a concern about the way Figure 3 was done and the way it was interpreted. However, this is not the most important figure in the paper, and on balance, I believe that the paper's remaining issues can be dealt with by changes in the writing. These issues are: (1) in the Discussion, still not fully explaining how the results in this paper specifically relate to the results reported by Tveriakhina et al; (2) concern about trying to compare affinities of binding under conditions that are apparently saturating; (3) needing more guidance for readers to understand how the newly included experiments successfully rule out some alternative explanations while favoring the explanations of the authors.</p><p>1) The Discussion has apparently not been updated since the previous submission, but it seemed important to include some kind of summary of how far the results of Tveriakhina et al. foreshadowed this paper, and how far this paper went beyond that previous report.</p><p>2) I thank the authors for explaining that they were trying to achieve such high levels of overexpression of the Notch ligands that they would saturate the Notch receptors in Figures 3 and 4. However, this is not a standard way to measure affinity differences, because the binding difference that could be due to affinity is overwhelmed by the high level of ligand. This is a problem with the way the experiments in Figures 3-4 are interpreted in terms of &quot;affinity&quot;. In fact, the authors see no difference between wildtype Dll1 and Dll4 in the experiments of Figures 3B and 4C in the presence of Lfng, despite the fact that they have previously shown very different affinities in Figure 2. Therefore it is not clear why this data is highlighted as a way to find out what parts of the protein account for the stronger binding.</p><p>It is surprising but fortunate for the authors that the main effects seen in the chimeras are to reduce binding, even from this extremely saturated level, when the Dll1-Dll4-DSL-E1,2 chimeras are used. In fact, stronger evidence for a true binding affinity difference is seen under different conditions (soluble Notch or soluble Δ) as shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, panels A and B. This deserves much more emphasis and should be pointed out as a separate finding on its own. But as a caveat, please also acknowledge somewhere that there could be more contribution of additional domains to Dll4 vs. Dll1 affinity for Notch1 that would be seen under conditions more in the middle of the dynamic range.</p><p>3) In the central experiments describing functional changes of the chimeras compared to wildtype, it is not always clear to the reader what alternative hypotheses can be ruled out at each point. Unfortunately, although there is valuable new evidence to support the authors' arguments in the new supplementary figure panels, very often these panels are never mentioned in the text.</p><p>4) There are still some problems in the text with distinguishing between effects that are clear and effects that are not. Figure 3 and its supplements remain a little unsatisfying because there is no independent way to compare the levels of the Notch ligand proteins expressed among all the constructs in this experiment. (In this regard, Figure 4 and Figure 6, where the HA tag is used, are much more convincing.) However, it is still possible to help guide the reader through Figure 3. For example, one construct, D1-D4-E1-2, is poorly expressed at the construct reporter level and there is no evidence presented in the paper that this particular chimeric protein is stably expressed at all (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 1, Figure 3—figure supplement 2). In a case like this, it is possible that the lack of activity is due to lack of stable protein. However, the D1-D4DSL-E1-2 construct is at least expressed well transcriptionally (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), and this construct is equally nonfunctional. It would help the reader if the phenotype of D1-D4DSL-E1-2 were highlighted more, to emphasize the loss of function where the evidence is stronger. More important is the fact that the swap of D1-E1-2 into Dll4 actually enhances its activity instead of diminishing it a very surprising result. Here also the binding evidence and expression evidence are more convincing, but again need to be emphasized more.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50979.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are three points.</p><p>First, in regard to writing, authors did not fairly refer similar Tveriakhina's paper.

Moreover, we have added a further clarified our findings in the following paragraph, which are in contrast to the results reported by Tveriakhina et al.</p><p><italic>Second, thymus</italic> in vivo <italic>results are not strongest part of this manuscript. The experiments in Figure 1 supports Figure 2, but the differences in expression level between the DLL4 expressing transgene and the DLL1 expressing transgene, in the hematopietic cells and stromal cells, make the results difficult to interpret. Authors do not need to remove these results, but they should discuss the results more carefully in light of this expression difference.</italic></p><p>We have deliberated as to why the Dll1/4 Tg mice demonstrated the differences in expression levels. However, a definite explanation has not been reached. The knock-in strategy ensures the insertion of one copy of GOI into the identical locus, and we observed the same intensity of GFP expression in every ES cell clone obtained (please refer to Materials and methods). Thus, we postulate that during or after the developmental processes in murine embryos this locus was regulated via some cis-element(s) included in the cDNAs, especially 5’ UTR (~300 kb in Dll4, ~50bp in Dll1) sequences. This estimation has been added to the revised Material and methods section.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to confirm the superiority of Dll4 over Dll1 for the induction of T lymphopoiesis.

In the revised manuscript, we have provided additional supplemental figures (for Figures 3, 4 and 6; introduced in each Figure legend) with their comparable fluorescence intensities. Some transfectants demonstrated lower expression of GFP; however, the protein levels of NotchLs (discuss later, monitored by intracellular HA staining) were comparable. Hence, we hypothesize that there seems to be a GFP threshold level, which ensures the saturating expression of the NotchL protein.</p><p>In case of transfectants shown in Figures 4 and 6, critical to obtain our experimental conclusion, we evaluated their expression using the intracellular staining with anti-HA mAb, assessing the total amount of the NotchL, and by the surface staining with anti-Dll4 mAb recognizing mainly the DSL region of Dll4 or with HRJ1-5 mAb recognizing the DOS motif at E1-2 region, detecting the surface expression of NotchL (Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). The NotchL expression in all transfectants was comparable between each Dll1/4 and Dll1/4-based chimeras; however, D4-D1MNNL demonstrated a lower expression than Dll4 as observed by anti-Dll4 mAb staining. As their protein levels evaluated by HA-stating were comparable, the affinity to anti-Dll4 mAb seemed to be affected by the replacement of the MNNL region. However, as the expression level was identical between Dll4 and D4-PP, we believe that our conclusion is accurate.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>As seen in the below reviewers' comments, reviewers request no more additional experiments, but do request authors to carefully re-write the manuscript, particularly from the following points.</p><p>1) Emphasize the unique points of this study, compared with previous reports (for instance, the results of Tveriakhina et al).</p></disp-quote><p>We add the new second paragraph in Discussion section explaining the unique points of this study compared with previous papers, especially Tveriakhina's paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Describe somewhere that there could be more contribution of additional domains to DII4 vs Dll1 affinity for Notch1 that would be seen under conditions more in the middle of the dynamic range.</p></disp-quote><p>We mention the limit of our experiment in the first paragraph in Discussion section as reviewer 2 indicated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is not always clear to the readers what alternative hypotheses can be ruled out at each point.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the suggestion of reviewer 2, we declare the implication of the reporter assay in Results section.
