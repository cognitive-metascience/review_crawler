associated with mood and motivation but the function of endogenous 5-HT remains controversial. Here, we studied the impact of phasic optogenetic activation of 5-HT neurons in mice over time scales from seconds to weeks. We found that activating dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurons induced a strong suppression of spontaneous locomotor behavior in the open field with rapid kinetics (onset ≤1 s). Inhibition of locomotion was independent of measures of anxiety or motor impairment and could be overcome by strong motivational drive. Repetitive place-contingent pairing of activation caused neither place preference nor aversion. However, repeated 15 min daily stimulation caused a persistent increase in spontaneous locomotion to emerge over three weeks. These results show that 5-HT transients have strong and opposing short and long-term effects on motor behavior that appear to arise from effects on the underlying factors that motivate actions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20975.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20975.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20975.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain controls sleep, movement and the other behaviors that an animal needs to survive. A chemical called serotonin plays an important role in controlling these behaviors as it regulates the activity of nerve cells (known as neurons) throughout the brain. Serotonin is produced by a specific group of neurons found in an area at the base of the brain called the raphe nuclei. From there, serotonin is released into other parts of the brain to influence different behaviors. Although drugs that target serotonin are widely used as antidepressants, how this chemical signal acts in the brain remains a mystery. This is due, in part, to it being technically challenging to carry out experiments on the serotonin-producing neurons.</p><p>A technique called optogenetics uses light to selectively activate or inhibit individual cells in live animals. Here, Correia, Lottem et al. use optogenetics to activate serotonin-producing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of mice. The experiments show that triggering serotonin production for a few seconds causes the mice to move around more slowly as they explore their surroundings. This short-term release of serotonin only slows the mice down if they are not already occupied with other activities, such as finding water or balancing on a moving object. These experiments suggest that serotonin decreases an individual’s motivation to move but that this can be overcome by sufficiently powerful goals. In contrast, repeatedly activating the serotonin neurons over a period of several weeks led to long-term changes of the opposite kind – the mice begin to move around more quickly.</p><p>The findings of Correia, Lottem et al. have possible implications for the use of drugs that target serotonin to treat mental disorders as it suggests important links between serotonin, movement, and the ability of the brain to change how it responds to certain situations. The next steps will be to investigate how the two different effects of serotonin are connected, which areas in the brain are involved and how best to apply these findings to clinical studies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20975.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20975.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>serotonin</kwd><kwd>dorsal raphe nucleus</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH / BD / 33277 / 2007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Correia</surname><given-names>Patrícia A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000881/2011L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lottem</surname><given-names>Eran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/51210/2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Machado</surname><given-names>Ana S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Early Career Scientist</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carey</surname><given-names>Megan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Starting Investigator Grant 640093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carey</surname><given-names>Megan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Investigator Grant 250334</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mainen</surname><given-names>Zachary F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Investigator Grant 671251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mainen</surname><given-names>Zachary F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Champalimaud Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mainen</surname><given-names>Zachary F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phasic activation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons transiently inhibits locomotion without influencing anxiety or producing reinforcement, but when repeated over many days a long-term facilitation of locomotion is produced.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Serotonin (5-HT) is a major neuromodulator that is one of the most important pharmacological targets in the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vaswani et al., 2003</xref>). Yet 5-HT has also numerous other clinically-important actions on functions including eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brewerton, 1995</xref>), aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lesch and Merschdorf, 2000</xref>), sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rosen et al., 1999</xref>), pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung et al., 1997</xref>), and perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Geyer and Vollenweider, 2008</xref>). However, the dominant conception of the 5-HT system still places mood and affect in a central position and considers other actions as side effects. To some degree different behavioral effects have been mapped to specific subsets of the 17-member receptor family, but a coherent pharmacologically-grounded theory of 5-HT function centered on affective states has been elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dayan and Huys, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Optogenetic tools provide novel viewpoints on neuromodulatory function by allowing the neurons that release a neuromodulator to be monitored and manipulated with high anatomical and genetic precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>). This allows a neuromodulatory system to be studied in terms of firing patterns with a temporal precision unavailable by pharmacological interventions. 5-HT neurons were classically thought to be regular-firing, ‘clock-like’ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jacobs and Azmitia, 1992</xref>). It is now known that, like other neuromodulatory neurons, 5-HT neurons exhibit phasic bursts of firing locked to significant behavioral events, such as stimuli, movements and rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nakamura et al., 2008</xref>). Tonic and phasic activation of the dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Niv et al., 2007</xref>) and norepinephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>) systems have distinct functional consequences. Opposite functions for phasic and tonic 5-HT have been proposed as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daw et al., 2002</xref>), but little is in fact known about the effects of phasic 5-HT firing. Optogenetic manipulations, which afford both genetic specificity and temporal control, might access phasic effects that are inaccessible by pharmacological manipulation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used an optogenetic approach to target 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), the main source of 5-HT to the forebrain, for activation. Our starting point was experiments in the open field arena, a widely used assay for spontaneous behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hall, 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seibenhener and Wooten, 2015</xref>). A long-standing theory of 5-HT suggests that it is a mediator of ‘behavioral inhibition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soubrié, 1986</xref>). This theory was motivated by data showing that 5-HT depletion increases startle responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis and Sheard, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis et al., 1980</xref>) and locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gately et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eagle et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, it has also been theorized, largely based on recordings of 5-HT neurons, that the primary function of the 5-HT system is instead the facilitation of rhythmic motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jacobs and Fornal, 1993</xref>). We found that phasic activation of DRN 5-HT neurons caused a rapid and striking decrease in locomotion, an effect of order 50%, while sparing other behaviors such as grooming.</p><p>We then examined the detailed kinematics of locomotor gait using a linear track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Machado et al., 2015</xref>). Surprisingly, in this assay we saw no effect of 5-HT activation, arguing against a motor hypothesis and suggesting a higher level underlying cause leading to motor effects. Indeed, 5-HT is strongly implicated in the control of impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dalley and Roiser, 2012</xref>), suppressing actions because it helps avoiding future punishments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dayan and Huys, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2009</xref>) or obtaining delayed rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miyazaki et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>). In either case, serotonin is thought to drive behavioral inhibition by altering the impact of the future motivating outcome. Anxiety is a prominent motivation in the open field, and mice show strong center-avoidance or thigmotaxis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Prut and Belzung (2003)</xref>). Yet, we found effects on locomotion that were not accompanied by spatial biases and yielded no positive or negative effects on anxiety measures.</p><p>It has also been theorized that 5-HT signals worse-than expected outcomes and might drive aversive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dayan and Huys, 2009</xref>). Conversely, 5-HT has also been proposed to signal reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). To test if phasic 5-HT encodes or modulates reward or punishment, we repeatedly paired phasic 5-HT stimulation with a specific location within the open field, but we found neither appetitive or aversive place preference learning. Instead we found that slowing of movement could masquerade as a place preference depending on how occupancy was assessed. These findings support previous studies showing that DRN 5-HT activation does not itself cause reinforcement learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miyazaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>). Unexpectedly, however, we found that repeated daily phasic 5-HT activation resulted in a long-term enhancement of locomotion, an effect similar in magnitude to the transient effect but opposite in sign. This observation recalls the two-to-three week window for selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) therapeutic effects to develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Machado-Vieira et al., 2010</xref>) and studies linking 5-HT activation to plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Santarelli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optogenetic activation of DRN 5-HT neurons reduces spontaneous locomotion in the open field</title><p>To activate DRN 5-HT neurons, we expressed the light-sensitive ion channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in DRN 5-HT neurons using an AAV2/9 viral vector (AAV2/9-Dio-ChR2-EYFP) injected into the DRN of SERT-Cre mice or wild-type littermate controls (WT) and implanted an optical fiber in the same location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dugué et al.

SERT-Cre and WT mice received blue light pulses in alternating 5 min blocks with 3 s light on, interleaved with 7 s light off, during stimulation blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To characterize the effects of DRN 5-HT activation we first performed a video based ethological analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choleris et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). The most frequent behaviors observed in the open field were walking and rearing, with the remainder of time spent grooming, digging or otherwise awake but relatively stationary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Scratching and jumping were observed very infrequently and were not further analyzed. DRN 5-HT activation induced a profound decrease in locomotion, (p=3.61 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, paired t-test, SERT-Cre mice, N = 15), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and a robust increase in the probability of the ‘resting’ state (p=4.75 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, paired t-test, SERT-Cre mice, N = 15), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Rearing was also reduced (p=0.0495), while digging and grooming were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, digging, p=0.536; grooming, p=0.582; paired t-test, SERT-Cre mice, N = 15). The ‘resting’ state did not correspond to freezing, as the animals did not exhibit a crouching position and often continued to make small movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969</xref>), sometimes accompanied by a lowering of the head (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). To summarize the dynamics of DRN 5-HT activation effects on behavioral state, we grouped the ‘mobile’ states (walking, jumping, rearing) and the relatively ‘immobile’ (resting, grooming, digging, scratching) and plotted their probability as a function of time relative to stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>).

We next examined whether these effects were specific to the state of the animal at the onset of stimulation. We first tested whether the effects depend on the prior speed of the animal by conditioning the speed plots by the pre-stimulation speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This conditioning procedure produces a tendency of the speed to revert back toward the mean, which can be seen even in non-stimulated blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–I</xref>). We therefore calculated the stimulation effect by subtracting speed values in equivalent non-stimulation blocks from values in the stimulation blocks ('delta speed', <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). There were significant effects on the average delta speed (post-pre intervals) for all pre-stimulation speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), as indicated by comparing delta speed between non-stimulated and stimulated trials across different speed quartiles (2-way ANOVA, stimulation, prior speed; SERT-Cre mice, N = 15; stimulation, F<sub>(1,110)</sub>=123, p=1.18 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; prior speed, F<sub>(3,110)</sub>=160, p=6.53 × 10<sup>−40</sup>; stimulation x prior speed F<sub>(3,110)</sub>=18.3, p=1.02 × 10<sup>−9</sup>), followed by paired t-tests, with Bonferroni correction (stimulation, p&lt;0.05; prior speed quartiles 1–2, n.s; other quartiles, p&lt;0.05). This analysis shows that decrease in speed produced by DRN 5-HT neuron activation was larger when the speed of the animal just prior to stimulation onset was faster. No significant changes were found for WT mice (data not shown, N = 9). This indicates that the effects of optogenetic activation of DRN 5-HT neurons were not limited to biasing animals against initiating movement, but also rapidly stopped mice even when they were already moving at relatively high speed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DRN 5-HT activation does not induce general motor impairment</title><p>These observations suggest an unconditional effect on active motor behavior and indicate a possible impairment in motor coordination during active movements.

However, this is secondary to the unanticipated finding that the primary effect on locomotor speed is highly context-dependent. This might be attributed to the strong drive to perform specific actions in those contexts. Therefore, we next turned to consider whether the effects on locomotion could be a consequence of specific affective or motivational states that might be induced by optogenetic activation of DRN 5-HT neurons. The open field assay has long been used as a screen for anxiety-related behavior in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey and Crawley, 2009</xref>). Thigmotaxis, the tendency to remain close to the walls and avoid the center of the arena, is a widely used measure of anxiety with ethological face validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choleris et al., 2001</xref>). If the observed locomotor effects were secondary to an increase (or decrease) in fear or anxiety they should be accompanied by changes in thigmotaxis or by more subtle interaction between location and stimulation effects.</p><p>We first characterized the effect of DRN 5-HT activation conditioned on the location of the mouse within the open field arena at the time of stimulation onset (center, periphery and corners; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Nevertheless, DRN 5-HT activation caused a robust decrease in speed regardless of the spatial area where the animal was located at stimulation onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>), as indicated by comparing speed between pre- and post-stimulation intervals across the different areas (2-way ANOVA, stimulation, areas; SERT-Cre mice, N = 15; stimulation, F<sub>(1,84)</sub>=250, p=2.58 × 10<sup>−17</sup>; areas, F<sub>(2,84)</sub>=18.9, p=3.99 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; stimulation x areas, F<sub>(2,84)</sub>=8.58, p=0.0238).

Animals showed a tendency to move more slowly with time spent in the box over 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Optogenetic activation caused a decrease in speed in SERT-Cre mice across all 5 min blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) as indicated by a 2-way ANOVA (stimulation, blocks; SERT-Cre mice, N = 15; stimulation, F<sub>(1,84)</sub>=67.6, p=0.0218; blocks, F<sub>(2,84)</sub>=4.36, p=0.0158; stimulation x blocks, F<sub>(2,84)</sub>=1.18, p=0.314), followed by paired t-tests for comparison between non-stimulated and stimulated trials across blocks (blocks 1–3, p&lt;0.001).

Taken together, these observations might suggest that DRN 5-HT activation could tend to decrease the frequency or duration of center excursions, increasing thigmotaxis. However, we observed no change in center occupancy between stimulated and non-stimulated blocks (2-way ANOVAs, with block and stimulation condition; stimulation, F<sub>(1,2)</sub>=0.611, p=0.516; blocks, F<sub>(2,2)</sub>=3.08, p=0.245, SERT-Cre, N = 15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

However, they do not exclude the possibility of longer-term effects. For example, some important affective and motivational effects of the dopamine system build up over longer periods and require contingency with environmental events, such as the conditioned place preference that can be produced by stimulating dopamine neurons contingent on an animal being in a certain location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McDevitt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>).

Locomotion traces, occupancy and speed heat maps for all five days of the assay for a representative SERT-Cre mouse are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>. Optogenetic activation of DRN 5-HT neurons produced a significant increase in ROI occupancy (F<sub>(4,15)</sub>=5.56, p=6.00 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, 1-way ANOVA across days; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Consistent with a movement slowing effect, we found a decrease in the average speed inside the ROI (F<sub>(4,15)</sub>=68.9, p=1.80 × 10<sup>−9</sup>, ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) and the rate of exits from the ROI (F<sub>(4,15)</sub>=26.6, p=1.17 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) across stimulated sessions for the population of SERT-Cre mice (N = 4). Post-hoc tests comparing the effect of each significant variable across sessions for SERT-Cre animals showed a significant increase in ROI occupancy by the third stimulated session and increases in rate of exits from the ROI and average speed in the ROI by the first stimulated session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,F,G</xref>, p&lt;0.05, N = 4, t-tests with Bonferroni correction). No significant effects were observed in WT mice (N = 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–G</xref> bottom) and no significant differences were found for average speed outside the ROI across sessions for either SERT-Cre or WT mice (data not shown).</p><p>These effects might be interpreted as either a place preference or as a stimulation-dependent reduction in movement speed. However, two additional observations argue for the latter interpretation. First, if stimulation reinforced the value of the ROI, we would expect mice to return more frequently to it. Contrary to this expectation, there was no change in the rate of entries into the ROI in stimulated mice (F<sub>(4,15)</sub>=0.195, p=0.937, ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The lack of change in rate of entries into the ROI despite the strong increase in occupancy indicates that mice do not approach or avoid the ROI, contrary to what is expected from either appetitive or aversive reinforcement learning. Second, if ROI stimulation induced a place preference, the effects should persist after pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). This was also not the case. ROI occupancy and rate of exits assayed on the day immediately after the pairing protocol returned to baseline levels (p&gt;0.05, post-hoc t-tests, with Bonferroni correction, comparing pre and post day, N = 4). Thus, the mice did not learn to prefer or avoid being in the ROI.</p><p>Overall, these results appear to be consistent with the hypothesis that the entire effect of ROI stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) is due to the same transient slowing effect seen in the standard open field assay in which stimulation is delivered in a spatially random fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Activation of DRN 5-HT neurons appears to promote ROI occupancy due to a decrease in movement speed within the ROI, resulting in a decrease in the rate of ROI exits. Interestingly, however, there appeared to be an increase in the effect of stimulation across days, as indicated by the fact that ROI occupancy increase did not reach significance before the third day of stimulation. In addition, there was a decrease in speed within the ROI between the pre- and post-stimulation sessions (p&lt;0.05, post-hoc t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) that was not seen in WT mice (F<sub>(4,20)</sub>=0.183, p=0.945, 1-way ANOVA across days). Together, these differences suggested the possibility that in addition to transient effects of phasic stimulation there might be longer-term, stimulation-dependent accumulation of effects in SERT-Cre animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Long-term effects of DRN 5-HT photostimulation</title><p>In order to test for possible long-term effects of optogenetic activation of DRN 5-HT neurons and to characterize the dynamics of stimulation effects over this longer period, two sets of SERT-Cre and WT mice were tested in the open field arena for &gt;3 weeks.

This long-term effect was, after 24 days, comparable in magnitude to the transient decreased evoked by stimulation, and manifested both during stimulation and non-stimulation epochs. The average speed increased in G1 from 3.50 ± 0.29 cm·s<sup>-1</sup> (day 1) to 7.11 ± 0.21 cm·s<sup>-1</sup> (day 24) during stimulation and 6.28 ± 0.74 cm·s<sup>-1</sup> (day 1) to 9.03 ± 0.36 cm·s<sup>-1</sup> (day 24) during control period. These effects were confirmed with a paired t-test, comparing pre-stim. speed in early (1–6) vs. late (19–24) sessions (p=0.00210 for G1, SERT-Cre mice, N = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and p=0.736 for G2, SERT-Cre mice, N = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) and by the difference in speed in the non-stimulated epochs between G1 and G2 mice (p=0.0192, paired t-test comparing pre-stim. speed in late sessions, SERT-Cre mice, N = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,F</xref>). The results were further corroborated using generalized linear regression analysis (see Materials and methods). We found that the slope of the regression, which corresponds to a long-term change in speed, was significantly higher than zero only in the mice that were photostimulated repeatedly throughout the experiment (G1; fitted coefficient for session, −0.03, p=0.180; intercept, 6.5, p=6.51 × 10<sup>−42</sup>; group −0.59, p=0.208; session X group interaction term, 0.15, p=1.43 × 10<sup>−5</sup>).</p><p>Long-term effects were not likely due to changes in effectiveness of stimulation, such as an increase in expression levels, since the magnitude of the transient effect was unaltered over the course of the experiment for G1 (delta speed in early vs. late sessions: −2.69 ± 0.23 vs. −2.50 ± 0.22 cm·s<sup>-1</sup> , p=0.212, paired t-test, SERT-Cre mice, N = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–H</xref>). Moreover, even after the induction of the increase in speed in G1, there was no difference in the magnitude of the transient decrease between G2 and G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,E,I</xref>; difference in speed in pre- vs. post-stimulation epochs in the initial sessions of stimulation: 2-way ANOVA with groups and sessions as main factors, sessions, F<sub>(5,5)</sub>=0.317, p=0.884; group, F<sub>(1,5)</sub>=4.10, p=0.0991). Overall, the transient and long-term effects appear to interact roughly additively.</p><p>These results indicate that repeated phasic DRN 5-HT optogenetic activation induces two independent and opposite effects: a transient slowing and a sustained speeding of movement. We infer that the sustained effect is a long-term consequence of daily stimulation. However, we considered that the increase in speed might depend on the presence of a period of stimulation on a given day, i.e., that it reflects a ‘rebound’ from stimulation. To test this we repeated the analysis using only the first 5 min block of each session. This block was never stimulated and any effects in this period could not be due to the effects of recent stimulation, but must rather reflect longer-term effects, at least carried over from the previous day. Indeed, we found a significant increase in speed even during the first non-stimulated block (early vs. late sessions, p=0.0252, paired t-test, SERT-Cre mice, N = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J–K</xref>). This suggests that the effect is present from the initial exposure of the animal to the area on a given session and does not depend on immediately preceding stimulation.</p><p>Next, we considered whether the long-term effects are somehow related to an anxiolytic effects, as speeding of movement could result from an increase in center excursions, since those tend to be accompanied by a higher velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We found no increase in center occupancy after long-term stimulation (early vs. late sessions, G1, p=0.201, paired t-test, SERT-Cre mice, N = 3; non-stimulated control G2, p=0.384, paired t-test, SERT-Cre mice, N = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>). Therefore, the sustained effects produced by 15 min per day of phasic DRN 5-HT activation, as the transient effects, do not appear to be secondary to anxiety-related effects measured by thigmotaxis.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether session-by-session changes in the magnitude of the long-term effect were predicted by corresponding fluctuations in the short-term effect. However, our analysis failed to reveal such correlations (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the interaction between the two effects, to the extent that it exists, may require more sensitive behavioral assays to be resolved.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we found that optogenetic activation of DRN 5-HT neurons produced two largely independent effects, one short-term and one long-term. The transient effect was a robust decrease in speed in the open field. It was strongly modulated by context and was not accompanied by anxiety-like behaviors or motoric impairments. The long-term effect was an increase in speed in the open field, opposite of the short-term effect, which emerged over the course of three weeks of daily stimulation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>DRN 5-HT activation suppresses locomotion in a context-dependent manner</title><p>The main immediate effect of DRN 5-HT activation was to suppress locomotion. This effect was manifested first as a bias in action selection, with time locomoting and rearing reduced and time stationary enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Non-locomotor movements such as grooming and scratching were unaffected and freezing was never observed. DRN 5-HT activation also decreased average speed during locomotion with the magnitude of the decrease positively correlated with the initial movement speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These effects had rapid onset (time constant of approximately 1 s) and offset (3 s). Additional experiments showed that they were also strikingly context dependent. First, there was no effect on performance in the accelerating rotorod, a task that requires a kind of locomotor behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Second, there was no effect on mice crossing a brightly-lit linear track to obtain water rewards at either end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, suppression of locomotion does not appear to be a direct effect on the motor system, but must instead reflect modulation of factors that drive locomotion.</p><p>The effects we observed recall long-standing observations that serotonin changes the effectiveness with which rewards and punishments drive behavior, enhancing the ability of organisms to tolerate delays before acting on such motivations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soubrié, 1986</xref>). Such ‘behavioral inhibition’ has been studied extensively in tasks in which animals must refrain from responding for a delayed reward, including the five choice serial reaction time task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harrison et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Winstanley et al., 2004b</xref>), go/no-go tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harrison et al., 1999</xref>) and waiting tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miyazaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>). The effects of 5-HT appear to be largest when forces for acting and refraining from acting are balanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soubrié, 1986</xref>). In the open field, there are no overt rewards or punishments motivating behavior. One could infer from the dramatic effects of 5-HT in this context that a normally balanced set of covert factors is shifted toward inaction by 5-HT. Conversely, the lack of effect in linear track or rotorod could reflect the inability of 5-HT to overcome strong local drives present in these contexts (obtaining water rewards and avoiding exposure to bright light in the linear track; avoiding falling in the rotarod).</p><p>In the above interpretation, 5-HT would be affecting the manner in which motivating factors such as goals drive actions. Interestingly, goal-directed actions become habitual with extended practice, after which they are no longer driven by the goals, but shift to being stimulus responses, with a corresponding change in neural substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yin et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">2005</xref>). While 5-HT affects reward waiting times it does not affect stimulus reaction times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, while 5-HT appears to modulate goal-directed actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>) it might not affect habitual actions. Although this hypothesis remains speculative, it would be consistent with the observation of DRN 5-HT activation strongly affected behavior in the open field, in which stimuli-response habits are absent, but failed to affect behavior in the rotarod and linear track, both of which might have become stimulus-response habits. Further experiments would be required to test this.</p><p>The selectivity of DRN 5-HT activation effects for certain types of behavior within the open field can also be interpreted in a similar fashion. Whereas locomotion and rearing are considered ‘voluntary’ (or type I) behaviors, grooming and scratching are considered ‘involuntary’ (or type II) behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vanderwolf, 1988</xref>). 5-HT has been linked to electroencephalographic recordings associated with type I but not type II behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vanderwolf and Baker, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vanderwolf, 1989</xref>). This is consistent with our observation that type I behaviors (i.e. locomotion) are modulated by DRN stimulation, whereas type II behaviors (e.g. grooming) seem to be unaffected by it.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>DRN 5-HT activation affects open field behavior independent of anxiety</title><p>Our data is consistent with the idea that 5-HT suppresses locomotor activity by decreasing underlying factors that promote it. These data do not reveal exactly how 5-HT achieves this, but do offer some constraints. 5-HT has been classically associated with anxiety and the thigmotaxis (center avoidance) in the open field has been widely used to assay anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Prut and Belzung, 2003</xref>). 5-HT could increase the impact of threats that favor immobility over exploration. However, we observed no effects on thigmotaxis (center avoidance) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), indicating that movement speed effects are not consequences of effects of 5-HT on anxiety but rather direct and independent effects. Our findings are consistent with a recent study showing optogenetic activation of DRN 5-HT neurons decreases locomotor activity without affecting anxiety in the elevated plus maze test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ohmura et al., 2014</xref>). Another recent study observed a transient increase in speed in the open field with DRN stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Warden et al., 2012</xref>). However in that study, both 5-HT and GABAergic neurons in the DRN were targeted, raising the possibility that the protocol was effectively inhibiting DRN 5-HT neurons by driving GABAergic neurons. Two recent studies using pharmacogenetic methods reported an increase in thigmotaxis in the open field following activation of 5-HT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Teissier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Urban et al., 2016</xref>), and one of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Teissier et al., 2015</xref>) also reported an overall reduction in locomotion. The additional effects observed could be due to the much slower kinetics of pharmacogenetic methods, which could result in a very different profile of 5-HT transmitter release. The anxiolytic effects of 5-HT appear to be mediated largely by 5-HT1a receptors. It is possible that Ohmura et al. and the present study did not observe these effects because they are not effectively activated by the optogenetic stimulation protocols employed. The 5-HT2a and 5-HT2c receptors have been associated with the effects of 5-HT on impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Winstanley et al., 2004a</xref>) and would be candidates to underlie slowing in the open field effects as well.</p><p>We found that DRN 5-HT optogenetic activation does not induce anxiety-like behaviors in the open field. However, we do not exclude the possibility that specific sub-populations of 5-HT neurons may modulate anxiety-like behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marcinkiewcz et al. (2016)</xref> showed that optogenetic activation of BNST-projecting DRN 5-HT neurons increase anxiety-like behaviors without affecting locomotion. They did not test the effects of overall DRN 5-HT stimulation. The pathway-specific effects might therefore represent an ‘off-target’ effect of this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Otchy et al., 2015</xref>) that is not present when a larger portion of the DRN is stimulated, because, it is balanced by an opposite effect through a different DRN output pathway. More experiments are also necessary to identify pathway(s) involved in the DRN 5-HT reduction in locomotion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>DRN 5-HT activation does not mediate appetitive or aversive reinforcement</title><p>Activation of DRN neurons has in some reports been associated with reward or appetitive reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), while other reports have failed to see reinforcing effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miyazaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>); reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luo et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we revisited this issue using a task nearly identical to that reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), delivering DRN 5-HT stimulation repeatedly continent on the location of the animal within a specific ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We did observe an increase in the occupancy during stimulated sessions, but this could be accounted by the decrease in speed within the ROI, consistent with inhibition of locomotion. Slowing was in turn associated with a decrease in rate of exits from the ROI. In contrast, we observed no change in the rate of entries into the ROI, i.e., mice showed no evidence of increased tendency to approach or avoid the ROI after pairing. Furthermore, ROI occupancy returned to baseline when stimulation ceased. Thus, mice showed no evidence of learning about the ROI. The increase in ROI occupancy could thus be accounted for solely by direct locomotor effects.</p><p>It is not clear whether our observations are entirely consistent with those of the previous report, in which ROI occupancy was reported to remain high after cessation of stimulation and entry and exit rates were not reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Differences between the two sets of results might instead be explained by differences in the populations of DRN neurons stimulated. Whereas we used a SERT-Cre line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gong et al., 2007</xref>) to drive ChR2 expression in 5-HT neurons, Liu et al. used the ePet1-Cre line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scott et al., 2005</xref>). The Pet-1 line has a broader expression profile, including a 5-HT-negative, glutamate-positive population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luo et al., 2015</xref>). DRN reinforcing effects appear to depend on such a glutamatergic input to the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McDevitt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qi et al., 2014</xref>) which appears to be absent in the more selective SERT-Cre line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Taking our study and other open field results together with experiments using operant training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>), we believe the evidence currently favors the view that activation of the DRN 5-HT system is not reinforcing. Thus, 5-HT may mirror the DA system in having an opposite direct effect on behavior (devigorating vs. invigorating), but it appears to have neither the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>) nor opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daw et al., 2002</xref>) learning effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Endogenous signaling of 5-HT neurons in relationship to behavioral inhibition</title><p>The above observations suggest that activating DRN 5-HT neurons does not affect locomotion by producing a reward- or anxiety-like signal. There remain a variety of possible underlying signals that might be reported by DRN 5-HT neurons and that could result in inhibition of locomotion. Broadly, these could be divided into three domains. A first set of proposals, developed largely in the domain of reinforcement learning theory, posits 5-HT to affect action selection and response vigor by biasing the value of appetitive or aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dayan and Huys, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cools et al., 2011</xref>). A second set of ideas posits a signal that modulates the cost of acting (or not-acting) itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miyazaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meyniel et al., 2016</xref>). A third set of ideas is related to the signaling of uncertainty, either in predicting events or the outcomes of ones own actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maswood et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amat et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matias et al., 2016</xref>). Uncertainty-related signals may be more complex to interpret as they could bias benefits and costs toward either action or inaction depending on the shape of the value landscape or could shift the balance between different behavioral control systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daw et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>There are a number of complexities in relating the firing patterns of DRN 5-HT neurons to the present results. First, other neuromodulators, particularly dopamine and norepinephrine, are also implicated in the same functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yu and Dayan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dayan and Yu, 2006</xref>) and 5-HT has a variety of features that suggest it acts as an opponent to dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cools et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</xref>). Our data are consistent with opponent effects of 5-HT and DA as modulators of action vigor, but not as reinforcement learning signals. Simultaneous or parallel recordings from multiple neuromodulator systems will be important for resolving the interplay between these systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matias et al., 2016</xref>). An additional complexity is that, due to differences in receptor kinetics, phasic firing and tonic firing of 5-HT neurons may convey different signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cools et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>). Because of the synchronous nature of optogenetic stimulation and the rapid onset of the transient effects, we presume that our protocol mimicked primarily phasic signaling, but we cannot exclude the possibility that it also mimics tonic signals as well. This issue may underlie some of the discrepancies between different pharmacological and optogenetic results. Finally, recordings from DRN 5-HT neurons have indicated substantial diversity in firing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nakamura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>). This might reflect more heterogeneous functions within the DRN that are not discriminated by global DRN stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Repeated daily DRN 5-HT activation induces long-term effects</title><p>We found that repeated daily exposure to optogenetic DRN 5-HT stimulation produced an unanticipated long-term effect, progressively and persistently increasing locomotion over three weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These long-term effects were not observed in control animals that were exposed to the same tests but with stimulation withheld until after three weeks. The transient and long-term effects appeared to be opposites and interacted additively. Although further experiments will be needed to address mechanisms, this opponency suggests the possibility of a direct form of compensatory action at a physiological or biochemical level. If the effects of transient DRN 5-HT activation are interpreted as suppression of the influence of motivating factors on locomotion, as suggested above, the long-term effects could represent an enhanced influence of the same motivating factors. The ability of goals to motivate behavior is critical for healthy mental function, and its absence, apathy, is a clinically important factor in many psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chase, 2011</xref>). Although our stimulation protocol was artificial, it was carried out at a rate within the physiological range of 5-HT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nakamura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>) and would likely produce only a modest increase in overall DRN 5-HT activity. For example, if each optogenetic pulse caused a spike, a neuron with a 1 Hz average firing rate would experience &lt;10% increase in total spikes over a 24 hr period. Therefore, the long-term effects might be ethologically or therapeutically relevant and long-term DRN 5-HT stimulation in the open field could be an interesting paradigm to explore in the context of animals models of affective disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Markou et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Because the persistent effects of DRN 5-HT activation accumulated gradually over many days and persisted in the absence of stimulation, we interpret them as a form of long-term plasticity. 5-HT has been described to boost plasticity in developing sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gu and Singer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jitsuki et al., 2011</xref>), possibly modulating the induction of LTP and LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kojic et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, SSRIs must be administered for several weeks before anti-depressant effects can be seen, suggesting that anti-depressant effects are not a direct and immediate consequence of changes in 5-HT function but the consequence of an adaptation requiring induction of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Branchi, 2011</xref>) or neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miller and Hen, 2015</xref>). The molecular and temporal specificity afforded by optogenetic access will facilitate the determination of the mechanism of action of the (short and) long-term effects of DRN 5-HT activation. For example, more refined targeting strategies, e.g. retrograde infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rothermel et al., 2013</xref>) or intersectional genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jensen et al., 2008</xref>), will allow the determination of the pathways involved. This may provide a new window on 5-HT-dependent plasticity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal subjects</title><p>Thirty-one adult C57BL/6 mice (19 SERT-Cre mice and 12 wild-type (WT) littermates) were used in this study.

Male and female mice (18–26 g) were group-housed prior to surgery and individually housed post-surgery and kept under a normal 12 hr light/dark cycle (tested at light phase). Mice had free access to food and water, except seven mice used in the open field test (4 SERT and 3 WT) and the seven SERT-Cre mice used in the LocoMouse assay were under a mild water deprivation protocol. In the LocoMouse experiment, water availability was restricted to the behavioral sessions. Extra water was provided if needed to ensure that mice maintained no less than 85% of their original weight. The open field experiments were run in separate batches using the following order: 1 SERT-Cre, 4 SERT-Cre and 2 WT, 4 SERT-Cre and 3 WT, 3 SERT-Cre and 2 WT, 3 SERT-Cre and 2 WT.

Lidocaine (2%) was injected subcutaneously before incising the scalp. The skull was covered with a layer of Super Bond C and B (Morita, Kyoto, Japan) to help stabilization of the implant. A craniotomy was drilled over lobule 4/5 of the cerebellum and a pipette filled with a viral solution (AAV2.9.EF1a.DIO.hChR2(H134R)-eYFP.WPRE.hGH, 10<sup>13</sup> GC/mL, University of Pennsylvania) was lowered to the DRN (Bregma −4.7 AP, −2.9 DV) with a 32–33° angle toward the back of the animal. The viral solution (1 µL) was injected using a Picospritzer II (Parker) or an hydraulic pump (UMP3-1, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), connected to a 5 μl Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV), at a rate of 0.05–0.1 µL/min. An optical fiber (200 μm core diameter, 0.48 NA, 4–5 mm) housed inside a connectorized implant (M3, Doric lenses, Quebec, Canada) was lowered into the brain, through the same craniotomy as the viral injection, and positioned 200 μm above the injection point. The implant was cemented to the skull using dental acrylic (Pi-Ku-Plast HP 36, Bredent, Senden, Germany). The skin was stitched at the front and rear of the implant. Mice were monitored until recovery from the surgery and returned to their home cage. Gentamicin (48760, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was topically applied around the implant. Behavioral testing started at least two weeks after virus injection to ensure good levels of expression.

The AOM controlled the laser power without any auditory noise and it was triggered by the behavioral control system (Bcontrol), developed by Carlos Brody (Princeton University) in collaboration with Calin Culianu, Tony Zador (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY) and Z.F.M. Light exiting the AOM was collected (KT110/M, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) into an optical fiber patchcord (200 μm, 0.22 NA, Doric lenses), connected to a second fiber patchcord through a rotary joint (FRJ 1 × 1, Doric lenses), then to a chronically implanted optic fiber cannula through an M3 connector (Doric lenses).

To overcome this limitation we performed the following two analyses:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>If indeed the magnitude of the short-term effect (<italic>speed<sub>post,</sub>(n)</italic> - <italic>speed<sub>pre</sub>(n)</italic>) is related to the change in baseline speed on the following day (<italic>speed<sub>pre</sub>(n+1)</italic> - <italic>speed<sub>pre</sub></italic>(n)) then it should also be related to the difference between the speeds during the following and preceding days (<italic>speed<sub>pre</sub>(n + 1) - speed<sub>pre</sub>(n-1)</italic>), without suffering from the above mentioned confound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Alternatively, assuming the long-term effect grows linearly with time we first performed linear regression of the long term effect as a function of sessions and then examined the correlation between the short-term effect on a particular day (<italic>speed<sub>post</sub>(n)</italic> - <italic>speed<sub>pre</sub>(n)</italic>) and the residual of the linear regression at the subsequent day (<italic>speed<sub>pre</sub>(n + 1)</italic> - <italic>predicted speed<sub>pre</sub>(n + 1)</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></list-item></list></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Systems Neuroscience Lab for many helpful discussions; Histology, Vivarium, Glass Wash and Media Preparation, Optical Imaging and Microscopy platforms, Enrica Audero, Margarida Duarte, Ana Nunes and João Cruz for technical assistance; Gonçalo Lopes and Niccolò Bonacchi for help with Bonsai software; Catherine French and Costa Lab for the accelerating rotarod; Gil Costa for support with visual diagrams and Champalimaud Research for the fruitful collaborative environment.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Naoshige Uchida (Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1), Sebastien Bouret (Reviewer #2) and Garret D. Stuber (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examined the effect of stimulating serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe (DR) to decipher functions of DR serotonin neurons. The authors performed a series of experiments to tease apart potential confounding factors and the results are carefully interpreted. The results overall advance our understanding of serotonin functions. Importantly, this study also points out important interpretational problems in a commonly used real-time place preference assay. All the reviewers agreed that this study is very interesting and warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the reviewers raised some important issues that the authors should address before publication.</p><p>Essential points:</p><p>1) As reviewer 1 points out, some conclusions are based on small numbers of animals. The authors should obtain data from more animals or interpret these results more carefully.</p><p>2) As reviewer 2 points out, the authors' conclusion that the effect of stimulation biased action selection, rather than it caused movement inhibition, is not convincing, and the authors should explain this better or reduce the tone of this conclusion.</p><p>3) The authors tend to compare effects across conditions by comparing the results of independent t tests. (e.g., subsection “Effect of DRN 5-HT photostimulation does not induce anxiety-like behavior”, second paragraph for speed as a function of spatial area; subsection “Spatially-specific DRN 5-HT optogenetic activation does not yield place preference or avoidance”, third paragraph for speed and ROI, see also subsection “Long-term effects of DRN 5-HT photostimulation”, third paragraph). I am not questioning the conclusions of the authors (that the effects are similar across conditions), but to support that claim, they should test directly for a difference between the size of the effects between the 2 conditions. This could be done (for instance) by looking at the interaction between the 2 factors, with an ANOVA, as they did in the third paragraph of the subsection “Effect of DRN 5-HT photostimulation does not induce anxiety-like behavior”. Or by computing the effect of stimulation on speed and assess the effect of session on that measure using a simple linear regression.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20975.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential points:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) As reviewer 1 points out, some conclusions are based on small numbers of animals. The authors should obtain data from more animals or interpret these results more carefully.</italic> </p><p>We performed a new set of experiments, using 4 SERT-Cre and 3 WT mice in the LocoMouse and rotarod tasks, which are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. With a total of 7 SERT-Cre and 5 WT mice, we observed similar results and maintain our claim that DRN 5-HT activation does not induce general motor impairment (please see update in subsection “DRN 5-HT activation does not induce general motor impairment”, second and last paragraphs. As for the long-term open field assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), this experiment would require a longer time scale (6-7 weeks only for the experimental execution), therefore, we hope the editor and reviewers understand that we were not able to obtain more data. However, as suggested by reviewer #2, we performed more analysis to look at the correlation between transient and chronic effects.</p><p><italic>2) As reviewer 2 points out, the authors' conclusion that the effect of stimulation biased action selection, rather than it caused movement inhibition, is not convincing, and the authors should explain this better or reduce the tone of this conclusion.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for insisting on this point. After considering this carefully, we agree with the reviewer that it is more parsimonious to interpret our results as “in terms of 'decreased motivation' (=decreased driving force for movement)<italic>”,</italic> as it was suggested. We modified our Discussion accordingly by merging and rewriting the first two sections. Please see the new discussion in “DRN 5-HT activation suppresses locomotion in a context-dependent manner” as well as corresponding changes in the Abstract and Introduction (deleted last paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) The authors tend to compare effects across conditions by comparing the results of independent t tests. (e.g., subsection “Effect of DRN 5-HT photostimulation does not induce anxiety-like behavior”, second paragraph for speed as a function of spatial area; subsection “Spatially-specific DRN 5-HT optogenetic activation does not yield place preference or avoidance”, third paragraph for speed and ROI, see also subsection “Long-term effects of DRN 5-HT photostimulation”, third paragraph).

We included a 2-way ANOVA for speed across different areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>):</p><p>“Nevertheless, DRN 5-HT activation caused a robust decrease in speed regardless of the spatial area where the animal was located at stimulation onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-D</xref>), as indicated by comparing speed between pre and post stimulation intervals across the different areas (2-way ANOVA, stimulation, areas; SERT-Cre mice, N = 15; stimulation, F<sub>(1,84)</sub> = 250.123, p = 2.58x10<sup>-17</sup>; areas, F<sub>(2,84)</sub> = 18.867, p = 3.99x10<sup>-4</sup>; stimulation x areas, F<sub>(2,84)</sub> =8.576, p = 2.38 x 10<sup>-2</sup>).”</p><p>And linear regression analysis in the long-term experiment to compare speed, sessions and groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>):</p><p>“The results were further corroborated using generalized linear regression analysis (see Experimental procedures). We found that the slope of the regression, which corresponds to a long-term change in speed, was significantly higher than zero only in the mice that were photostimulated repeatedly throughout the experiment (G1; fitted coefficient for session, -0.03, p = 0.18; intercept, 6.5, p = 6.51x10<sup>-42</sup>; group -0.59, p = 0.208; session X group interaction term, 0.15, p = 1.43x10<sup>-5</sup>).”</p><p>However, a 2-way ANOVA is not applicable in the case of the ROI analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) since the multiple ANOVAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D-G</xref>) are not related to different conditions but rather to different dependent variables (ROI occupancy, nr entries, nr exits and speed).</p></body></sub-article></article>
