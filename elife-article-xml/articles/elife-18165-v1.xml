A parsimonious model for generation of convergence sites is that cell polarity for the auxin transporter PIN1 orients up auxin gradients, as this spontaneously generates convergent alignments. Here we test predictions of this and other models for the patterns of auxin biosynthesis and import. Live imaging of outgrowths from <italic>kanadi1 kanadi2 Arabidopsis</italic> mutant leaves shows that they arise by formation of PIN1 convergence sites within a proximodistal polarity field. PIN1 polarities are oriented away from regions of high auxin biosynthesis enzyme expression, and towards regions of high auxin importer expression. Both expression patterns are required for normal outgrowth emergence, and may form part of a common module underlying shoot outgrowths. These findings are more consistent with models that spontaneously generate tandem rather than convergent alignments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18165.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18165.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18165.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants, unlike animals, are able to grow and develop throughout their lives. New leaves and flowers are made from outgrowths that constantly form at the tip of growing shoots. Groups of cells in the outer layer of the shoot tip arrange a protein called PIN1 so that it is more abundant on the cell surfaces that face towards the centre of the group. PIN1 transports a hormone called auxin out of plant cells and this “convergent” arrangement of PIN1 increases the levels of auxin in cells at the centre of the group, leading to the formation of a new outgrowth. However, it is not clear what causes these cells to position their PIN1 proteins in this way.</p><p>Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain how convergent patterns of PIN1 form. For example, according to the “up-the-gradient” hypothesis, PIN1 is allocated to the end of a cell that is next to a cell with a higher level of auxin. Abley et al. have now compared predictions from computer models with new experimental data from a plant called <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to evaluate three hypotheses for how convergent PIN1 patterns form. A computer model based on the up-the-gradient hypothesis naturally creates convergent PIN1 patterns, even if each cell starts off with the same level of auxin. On the other hand, models based on two other hypotheses generate tandem alignments of PIN1 so that auxin is transported in the same direction along lines of cells.</p><p>Next, Abley et al. tested these models using mutant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants that develop outgrowths from the lower surface of their leaves. These outgrowths form in a similar way to outgrowths at the growing shoot tip, but in a simpler context. The experiments show that the patterns of where auxin is produced in growing leaves were more compatible with the tandem alignment models than the up-the-gradient model. This suggests that plants use a tandem alignment mechanism to form convergences of PIN1 proteins that generate the local increases in auxin needed to make new outgrowths.</p><p>This study only examined a single layer of cells on the plant surface. Other cell layers also show highly organised patterns of PIN1 proteins, so a future challenge is to extend the approach to study the entire 3D structure of new shoot outgrowths.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18165.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18165.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>auxin</kwd><kwd>polarity</kwd><kwd>leaf development</kwd><kwd>CUC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/F005997/1 SABR grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coen</surname><given-names>Enrico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000324</institution-id><institution>Gatsby Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abley</surname><given-names>Katie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L008920/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coen</surname><given-names>Enrico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Models that generate tandem alignments of cell polarities are more readily compatible with the formation of PIN1 polarity patterns in plant leaf buds than the most widely accepted “up-the-gradient” model.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The development of plant shoots involves iterative formation of outgrowths. Shoot apical meristems produce leaf primordia, which in turn provide the setting for the initiation of new outgrowths such as serrations and leaflets. A common developmental module has been proposed to underlie the generation of both leaves and leaf-derived outgrowths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barkoulas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hay et al., 2006</xref>). A key feature of the module is an epidermal site of high intracellular auxin, located at the centre of convergence of the polarised auxin efflux carrier, PIN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barkoulas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benková et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reinhardt et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scarpella et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The generation of polarity convergence sites has been most commonly explained by the up-the-gradient model, whereby cells localise PIN1 towards the neighbouring cell with the highest concentration of intracellular auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bilsborough et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jönsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). This mechanism is parsimonious because it can spontaneously generate spaced centres of polarity convergence without additional assumptions about the presence of auxin sources or sinks. Molecular mechanisms accounting for up-the-gradient behaviour have been proposed to involve detection of auxin-induced stress gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heisler et al., 2010</xref>) or auxin transport sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cieslak et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>An alternative model for formation of sites of polarity convergences assumes that PIN1 becomes localised to cell membranes in proportion to the rate of auxin efflux across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mitchison, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rolland-Lagan and Prusinkiewicz, 2005</xref>). A possible molecular mechanism for how cells might sense auxin flux has recently been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cieslak et al., 2015</xref>). Although originally proposed to account for venation patterns, this flux-based model has also been shown to be compatible with the patterns of epidermal PIN1 polarity in the vegetative shoot apical meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoma et al., 2008</xref>). Polarity convergence formation can be accounted for by assuming that sub-epidermal pro-vascular PIN1 strands are induced in regions of elevated auxin and cause a local depletion of auxin from the epidermis. This depletion causes PIN1 polarities to reorient and generate a site of convergence, which then raises auxin levels at its centre through transport. A problem with this model is that it predicts a transient drop in intracellular auxin concentration during early stages of convergence formation, which is not supported experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunoud et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>A further type of model for coordinating PIN1 orientations requires neither responding to auxin gradients between cells nor sensing auxin flux. Instead, the indirect coupling model involves intracellular polarity components that can establish cell polarity without external asymmetries in auxin distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abley et al., 2013</xref>). The two polarity components each exist in two forms: a diffusible cytoplasmic form (A and B) and a more slowly diffusing membrane bound form (A* and B*). Interactions between the components leads to A* and B* being localised at opposite ends of the cell. PIN1 is recruited to the membrane by one of the components (A*), causing a polarised PIN1 distribution. Polarities of neighbouring cells are coupled indirectly through a feedback mechanism in which extracellular auxin inhibits A* and thus PIN1 accumulation. This model results in polarities being oriented away from regions of high extracellular auxin and towards regions with low extracellular auxin. It can generate coordinated polarities for a field of cells, but it is unclear whether it can generate centres of PIN1 convergence.</p><p>A convenient system for testing the models is the formation of ectopic 3D outgrowths from the abaxial leaf surface of <italic>kanadi1kanadi2 (kan1kan2)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eshed et al., 2004</xref>). These outgrowths can be considered as intermediates between leaf primordia and serrations. Similar to leaf primordia, the outgrowths emerge perpendicular to the main plane of the tissue, and like serrations, they are derived from the leaf. Because of their emergence from the abaxial lamina which can be readily imaged, these outgrowths are more amenable to time-lapse imaging than serrations which are often obscured by neighbouring cotyledon tissue and curving of the leaf edge. <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths have elevated intracellular auxin at their tips, and their formation depends on specific patterns of auxin biosynthetic enzyme expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). They provide a test bed for studying convergence site formation in a starting context which, unlike the apex, is not complicated by the prior patterns of continual primordium initiation. However, the dynamics of auxin accumulation, PIN1 polarity and expression of auxin biosynthesis genes at early stages of <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowth emergence have not been described. Moreover, the role of <italic>CUC</italic> genes, needed for formation of primordia and serrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nikovics et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aida et al., 1997</xref>) has not been determined.</p><p>We show through time-lapse imaging that, similar to leaf primordia and serrations, <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths are preceded by centres of PIN1 polarity convergence with elevated intracellular auxin. These convergent polarities arise within the context of an initial proximo-distal PIN1 polarity field and are promoted by <italic>CUC2</italic> activity. An exploration of model behaviours reveals that models may be classified into two types: those that spontaneously generate convergent aligments (e.g. the up-the-gradient) and those that spontaneously generate tandem alignments (e.g. flux-based and indirect coupling). Both types of model can account for the generation of an initial proximo-distal polarity field, followed by the formation of convergences with elevated intracellular auxin. However, unlike the convergent alignment model, tandem alignment models require the appearance of local regions with elevated auxin import. In support of tandem alignment models, we show that expression of the <italic>LAX1</italic> auxin importer is elevated in regions of polarity convergence at the tips of <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths, and that <italic>AUX/LAX</italic> importer genes are required for normal <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowth development. Additionally, we show that expression of YUCCA1 and YUCCA4 auxin biosynthetic enzymes tends to be elevated in regions of polarity divergence in <italic>kan1kan2</italic> and WT leaves, an observation which is also most readily consistent with tandem alignment models. Thus, tandem alignment models provide parsimonious explanations for the developmental module underlying outgrowth emergence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Formation of polarity convergence centres in the context of a proximodistal polarity field</title><p>To characterise patterns of epidermal PIN polarity associated with the development of <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths, a <italic>PIN1::PIN1:GFP</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benková et al., 2003</xref>) was imaged on the abaxial surface of wild-type (WT) and <italic>kan1kan2</italic> leaves. Here we focus on PIN1 since this is the predominant epidermally expressed PIN that shows polar intracellular distributions in wild-type leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guenot et al., 2012</xref>). In young <italic>kan1kan2</italic> leaf primordia, the epidermal PIN1 polarity pattern was similar to that observed in WT: PIN1 polarities were oriented towards the leaf tip in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). At later stages of development, WT leaves retained a proximo-distal polarity pattern, and then no-longer showed detectable expression of the <italic>PIN1::PIN1:GFP</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The loss of <italic>PIN1::PIN1:GFP</italic> expression did not occur uniformly throughout the WT leaf because some patches of cells retained expression for longer than other regions of the leaf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A iii</xref>). By contrast to WT, <italic>kan1kan2</italic> leaves maintained PIN1 expression until later stages of development and formed centres of PIN1 polarity convergence, located at the tips of emerging ectopic outgrowths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B iv and C iv</xref>). Cells at the centres of convergence had highly polarised PIN1, oriented towards the interface between three or four neighbouring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C iv</xref>). To determine whether the centres of convergence preceded outgrowth emergence, leaves were imaged over several days and cell lineages that gave rise to convergences traced back through the time-course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, yellow dots, arrows and lines). This revealed that cells closest to the centre of convergence at the outgrowth tip descended from one or two cells, which were already at a centre of polarity convergence prior to outgrowth emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Taken together, these findings show that, prior to <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowth emergence, centres of polarity convergence develop within a proximodistally oriented polarity field.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18165.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>PIN1::PIN1:GFP</italic> expression in young WT and <italic>kan1kan2</italic> leaf primordia.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) WT primordium of leaf 1, showing abaxial epidermis (a total of 10 leaves were imaged over 2 separate experiments).

We first characterise basic model behaviours, and then investigate the assumptions needed for each model to capture the observed polarity patterns and how they may be tested experimentally.</p><p>The flux and up-the-gradient models are implemented as in previous publications, using the simplifying assumption that auxin moves directly from cell to cell and omitting an explicit representation of the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bilsborough et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feugier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jönsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rolland-Lagan and Prusinkiewicz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoma et al., 2008</xref>). By contrast, we explicitly represent the cell wall in our implementations of the indirect coupling model. In this model, we also represent cell membranes and walls with several compartments per cell edge (allowing lateral diffusion of components to be simulated). However, as in previous work, flux and up-the-gradient models are implemented with a single compartment per edge and no lateral diffusion of components along the cell edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bilsborough et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feugier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jönsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rolland-Lagan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoma et al., 2008</xref>). With the flux-based model, we assume a linear feedback between flux and PIN1 allocation, which tends to generate broad regions of coordinated polarisation rather than narrow canalised strands that arise with super-linear feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feugier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoma et al., 2008</xref>). Details of all the model assumptions are given in the Materials and methods.</p><p>Previously simulations of up-the-gradient and flux-based models have considered polarity patterns in fields of cells all of which have the potential to polarise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jönsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rolland-Lagan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoma et al., 2008</xref>). However, to get a clearer view of the properties of each model, we begin by considering a group of cells having initially uniform auxin concentration and PIN1 distribution, and with only the central cell having the ability to relocate its PIN1 according to the rules specified by each model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). We find that the central cell becomes polarised with both the up-the-gradient and flux-based models, assuming that there are small random fluctuations (noise) in the initial concentrations of PIN1 in the cell membranes and that auxin flux from the central cell can modify the initially homogeneous auxin concentration in the neighbouring tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). In the up-the-gradient model, a cell edge with elevated PIN1 causes an increase in auxin concentration in the neighbouring cell. This elevated auxin concentration in the neighbour feeds back to cause an increase in PIN1 allocation to the cell edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A ii</xref>, purple arrow). Assuming a limited pool of PIN1 in the cell, there will be a corresponding reduction in PIN1 allocation to other cell edges. In the flux-based model polarity arises because if one cell edge has slightly elevated PIN1 (due to small random fluctuations), this edge will have a higher rate of auxin efflux, which feeds back to favour further recruitment of PIN1 to the given cell edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B ii</xref>, purple arrow). Recruitment of PIN1 to other cell edges is inhibited because the different edges of a cell compete to export auxin into surrounding cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18165.010</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Comparison of basic behaviours of indirect coupling, flux-based and up-the-gradient models.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Investigating the ability of cells to polarise in the absence of pre-established external asymmetries or polarisable neighbours for up-the-gradient (<bold>A</bold>), flux-based (<bold>B</bold>) and indirect coupling (<bold>C</bold>) models. Panels <bold>i</bold>) show the initial state of the simulations. In each simulation, all cells initially have the same auxin concentration (indicated by the intensity of green, where darker green indicates a higher concentration). In the case of up-the-gradient or flux-based models (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>), noise is present in the initial levels of PIN1 (shown by red lines at cell edges).

In this and subsequent simulations, PIN1 polarisation is indicated by black arrows, where the arrow points towards the region of the cell with highest PIN1. (<bold>A</bold>) For the up-the-gradient model, if a given cell edge has slightly elevated PIN, this causes the juxtaposed neighbour to have an increased auxin concentration.

This is due to the auto-activating and mutually inhibitory activities of membrane bound A* and B* polarity components, combined with relatively fast diffusion of their cytoplasmic forms, which generates cell polarity. PIN1 is then recruited to the membrane with high A* (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marée et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jilkine et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Thus, all three models have the potential to generate polarity in a single polarisable cell surrounded by non-polarisable neighbours in an initially uniform field of auxin concentration. For the indirect coupling model, this polarity arises through partitioning of the polarity components, while for the flux-based and up-the-gradient models it arises because small fluctuations in PIN1 distribution create variations in auxin flux or concentrations which feed back to reinforce the polarity. There is, however, a key difference between the up-the-gradient and other models. If auxin concentration in the surrounding medium remains fixed throughout the simulation (equivalent to voltage-clamping in neurophysiology), then the up-the-gradient model does not generate polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, both the flux-based and indirect coupling model present polarity even under such settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In a previous paper we overlooked the potential effect of feedback in the flux-based and up-the-gradient models for single polarisable cells, and implicitly assumed that such cells would not polarise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abley et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, we did not distinguish between lack of pre-established asymmetric cues versus lack of being able to establish asymmetric cues (e.g. through auxin transport). The above simulations show that this distinction needs to be taken into account to appreciate that, whereas the flux-based model can present intracellular partitioning (i.e. establish polarity in the absence of asymmetric cues or polarisable neighbours), the up-the-gradient model relies on its ability to change its surrounding to establish and maintain polarization. Thus, both the flux-based and up-the-gradient model share commonalities with the indirect coupling model regarding intracellular partitioning, albeit through a more indirect mechanism involving auxin transport between cells.</p><p>We next consider an array of polarisable cells in the absence of pre-established asymmetries. Noise is present in initial auxin concentrations (for the up-the-gradient and flux-based models), or in the A*-B* polarity components (for the indirect coupling model), and all cells have the ability to relocate PIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref>). In this situation the up-the-gradient model generates convergent polarities, in which spaced groups of cells orient their PIN1 polarity towards a central region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jönsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). This is because fluctuations lead to competing centres of high auxin concentration which orient polarities towards them.</p><p>By contrast, the flux-based model tends to generate swirled patterns of polarity, in which polarities are coordinated in tandem between neighbouring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Convergent polarities are disfavoured because if two cells have PIN1 oriented towards each other, both cells would experience a low net auxin efflux across their PIN1-rich ends due to transport towards them from the opposing neighbour. The low net auxin efflux would cause removal of PIN1 from the membranes and relocalisation to edges juxtaposed with a PIN1-free edge of a neighbouring cell, promoting tandem alignments.</p><p>Similar to the flux-based model, indirect coupling also generates swirled patterns of polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abley et al., 2013</xref>). Convergent alignments are disfavoured because if two cells have PIN1 oriented towards each other, both cells transport auxin to the intervening extracellular space. Accumulation of auxin in the extracellular space then inhibits A*, and therefore PIN1, in adjacent membranes. This destabilises convergent polarities and favours tandem alignments.</p><p>Thus, in the absence of pre-established asymmetries, the models spontaneously generate two types of polarity pattern. The flux-based and indirect coupling models both generate tandem alignments, and are subsequently referred to as tandem alignment models; while the up-the-gradient model generates convergent alignments, and is subsequently referred to as a convergent alignment model.</p><p>We next explore the assumptions that need to be added to these models for them to account for the epidermal PIN1 polarity patterns observed in WT and <italic>kan1kan2</italic> leaves. With each model, we attempt to capture the initial proximodistal polarity field observed in both WT and <italic>kan1kan2</italic>, where polarities are aligned in tandem along the proximodistal leaf axis with high intracellular auxin at the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We then explore the assumptions required for the formation of centres of PIN1 convergence with elevated intracellular auxin, such as those observed on the abaxial side of the main lamina at later stages of <italic>kan1kan2</italic> leaf development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The convergent alignment model has been proposed to account for the initial centre of convergence at the distal end of the leaf primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jönsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). For a proximodistal polarity field to be maintained within the growing primordium, the convergent alignment model requires maintenance of an increasing auxin concentration gradient from the leaf base to the leaf tip. One way this can be achieved is through net auxin removal at the leaf base. Net auxin removal from a region of tissue could be achieved through a decreased rate of auxin biosynthesis, an increased rate of transport away from the region, or an increased rate of auxin degradation or conjugation. Here net removal is achieved using elevated auxin degradation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Combining this assumption with an initially elevated intracellular auxin concentration at the leaf tip, a proximodistal polarity field can be maintained within an array. The intracellular auxin concentration is kept high at the distal end of the array through transport towards this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), similar to experimental observations using the <italic>DR5::GFP</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mattsson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scarpella et al., 2006</xref>). As the primordium increases in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), the auxin concentration tends to become shallow at a distance from the leaf tip. This can result in the spontaneous formation of a centre of convergence with elevated intracellular auxin within the proximal region of the lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), similar to that observed in <italic>kan1kan2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). The length of the tissue at which the polarity reversal occurs depends on the parameters values used in the model. The failure to form such a convergence centre in WT leaves could be explained by the PIN1 polarity pattern becoming fixed at early stages of development, preventing polarity reorientation. However, how this could be achieved is unclear, although it has been proposed that absence of <italic>CUC2</italic> activity may play a role in fixing polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bilsborough et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18165.012</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Formation of a proximo-distal polarity field and centres of convergence in the convergent alignment model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Formation of a proximo-distal polarity field due to the presence of an elevated initial auxin concentration at the leaf tip (orange cells) and an elevated rate of auxin removal from the leaf base (blue cells).

Here we simulate net auxin production in proximal regions with an increased auxin biosynthesis rate, but it could also be achieved with a reduced auxin degradation rate or increased auxin influx from (or decreased auxin efflux to) tissues beyond those represented in the simulation. Likewise, net removal from the leaf tip is simulated using elevated degradation, but could also occur through reduction in biosynthesis, increase in conjugation, or via transport into underlying tissue layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bayer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scarpella et al., 2006</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18165.013</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Formation of a proximo-distal polarity field in the flux-based and indirect coupling models.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Formation of a proximo-distal polarity field in the flux-based model due to the presence of elevated auxin biosynthesis at the leaf base (orange cells) and an elevated rate of auxin removal from the leaf tip (blue cells).

However, intracellular auxin concentrations tend to be lowest at the distal end of the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), inconsistent with experimental observations. This inconsistency can be avoided if the leaf tip acts as a weak instead of a strong auxin sink. The initial drop in intracellular auxin at the tip is then followed by a rise to a high level because of the transport towards this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walker et al., 2013</xref>). Another possibility is that the leaf tip has an elevated auxin import rate as well as an elevated rate of auxin removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Elevated auxin import in the distal-most cells causes increased auxin flux towards them, encouraging polarities to point distally. The elevated import also causes the distal-most cells to accumulate intracellular auxin. Although auxin is synthesised at the highest rate in the proximal-most files of cells, in the final state of the simulation, maximal auxin concentrations are found at the distal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This is due to polar transport of auxin away from the base, towards the leaf tip.</p><p>Similar to the flux-based model, with indirect coupling an initial proximodistal alignment of polarities can be generated if the proximal region (leaf base) has net auxin production (here due to elevated auxin biosynthesis generating high extracellular auxin), while the distal region (leaf tip) has elevated net auxin removal (here due to elevated auxin degradation generating low extracellular auxin). As in the flux-based model, elevated auxin degradation at the distal end of the tissue can lead to low intracellular auxin in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Combining an elevated rate of auxin import at the leaf tip with the elevated degradation ensures low extracellular auxin concentrations in this region (encouraging polarities to point distally) and allows distal cells to accumulate intracellular auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Thus, the two tandem alignment models both have similar requirements for the generation of a proximodistal polarity field with an intracellular auxin maximum in the distal region.</p><p>The predictions of the tandem alignment models for the generation of a proximodistal polarity field differ from those of the convergent alignment model. Tandem alignment models predict that the leaf base has net production of auxin, whilst the convergent alignment model predicts that this region has net auxin removal. Also, tandem alignment models require that the leaf tip has an elevated rate of auxin import and removal to account for high auxin in this region, whereas the convergent alignment model has no such requirement.</p><p>A further difference is that unlike the convergent alignment model, the two tandem alignment models do not spontaneously generate centres of polarity convergence upon an increase in tissue size (the results of simulations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–D</xref> are similar for a range of tissue sizes). Thus, with tandem alignment models, further assumptions are needed to generate centres of PIN1 polarity convergence. With tandem alignment models, a site of convergence could arise by a cell having higher levels of auxin removal, caused by export to underlying cells. This cell could be positioned in regions of elevated intracellular auxin, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoma et al, 2008</xref>. However, induction of auxin removal alone can result in a drop in intracellular auxin concentration before convergence formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoma et al., 2008</xref>), and it is unclear how such regions of elevated intracellular auxin could emerge in the proximal half of the <italic>kan1kan2</italic> abaxial lamina.</p><p>One possible explanation for the generation of convergence sites in tandem alignment models is that the proximal region of the abaxial lamina has an extended region of auxin biosynthesis. This region corresponds to the region of ectopic <italic>CUC2::RFP</italic> expression in the proximal region of young <italic>kan1kan2</italic> primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C i</xref>). In the tandem alignment models, auxin biosynthesis in this region leads to a shallow peak in intracellular auxin proximal to the distal limit of auxin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,C</xref>). This peak arises as a consequence of elevated auxin biosynthesis in this domain, together with polarised transport which shifts the position of the peak distally. If intracellular auxin above a threshold concentration activates auxin import, a region with elevated import arises, leading to a centre of polarity convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B,D</xref>). Elevated auxin removal needs to arise in addition to elevated auxin import since import alone causes very high levels of intracellular auxin to accumulate at the centre of convergence. This can disrupt convergence formation by preventing the maintenance of low extracellular auxin (in the indirect coupling model), and by increasing total auxin efflux from the central cell (in the flux-based model). Unlike the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoma et al., 2008</xref>, where only auxin removal is induced by high intracellular auxin, the combination of elevated auxin import and removal helps to ensure that a dip in intracellular auxin concentration does not occur prior to convergence formation.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18165.014</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Formation of centres of polarity convergence in the flux-based and indirect coupling models.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A proximo-distal polarity field is initially established with the flux based model due to the presence of elevated auxin biosynthesis in the proximal half of the leaf (orange cells) and elevated rates of auxin import and removal from the leaf tip (blue cells with green outlines).

Tandem alignment models require that, at the leaf tip and at the tips of outgrowths (where centres of convergence are located), the epidermis has elevated rates of auxin import and auxin removal (which could be removal into underlying tissue layers). Locally elevated auxin import is not required for the convergent alignment model, as sites with slightly elevated intracellular auxin reinforce themselves.

In its most parsimonious form, there is no need for elevated auxin import at the leaf tip or at subsequent centres of convergence with the convergent alignment model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). However, this does not make the model incompatible with elevated auxin import at these sites. If it is assumed that intracellular auxin above a threshold concentration induces elevated auxin import and removal, elevated import and removal may be induced after convergence formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11H</xref>). This does not cause disruption of the centres of convergence. Distally oriented polarities near the leaf tip may also be achieved if these cells have an elevated rate of auxin import and removal (rather than an elevated initial auxin concentration) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11H</xref>). Thus, induction of auxin import by elevated intracellular auxin concentrations is compatible with the convergent alignment model, though it renders the model less parsimonious.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title><italic>CUC2</italic> is required for locally elevated auxin import at <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowth tips</title><p>To test whether <italic>CUC2</italic> could promote the formation of <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths by influencing expression of auxin importers, we examined the expression of <italic>LAX1::GUS</italic> and <italic>AUX::AUX1:YFP</italic> reporters in the <italic>kan1kan2cuc2</italic> background.

Despite these differences, we show that general elements of outgrowth formation apply to shoot outgrowths (<italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths, primordia and serrations) regardless of their specific context. 1) Similar to leaf primordia and serrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bilsborough et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reinhardt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scarpella et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths are preceded by epidermal centres of PIN1 polarity convergence. By tracking cells, we show that these centres go on to form outgrowth tips, similar to results from tracking emerging floral primordia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, as the outgrowth develops, the centre of convergence corresponds to the distal end of a proximodistal field. 2) Like primordia and serrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bilsborough et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths are preceded by locally elevated intracellular auxin. 3) Expression of <italic>YUCCA</italic> auxin biosynthesis enzymes is elevated in the boundaries that separates leaves, serrations and <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths from the tissues that they emerged from. The axillary boundary (located in the axils of primordia and distal sides of serrations and <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths) has divergent PIN1 polarity orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). In the case of <italic>YUC4</italic>, we show that axillary expression in <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths precedes outgrowth emergence. 4) Centres of polarity convergence at the tips of leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bainbridge et al., 2008</xref>), serrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kasprzewska et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths are associated with regions of elevated epidermal expression of the auxin importer, <italic>LAX1.</italic> 5) Epidermal centres of PIN1 polarity convergence are coupled to sub-epidermal strands of cells with elevated PIN1 expression and inwardly oriented polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bayer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reinhardt et al., 2003</xref>). 6) Like primordia and serrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nikovics et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aida et al 1997</xref>), formation of outgrowths is promoted by <italic>CUC</italic> genes which become strongly expressed distal to the outgrowth. We show that in <italic>kan1kan2</italic> leaves, CUC2 promotes formation of PIN1 convergence sites and both elevated YUCCA and auxin importer expression.</p><p>Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that a common module is associated with the development of outgrowths. This outgrowth module operates iteratively, first in the creation of the leaf with a proximodistal polarity field, and then in the creation of leaf outgrowths such as serration and leaflets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hay et al.,2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bilsborough et al., 2011</xref>), or ectopic <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths. Although centres of convergence associated with elevated intracellular auxin and sub-epidermal PIN1 strands were previously shown to be associated with primordia and serrations, here we extend the notion of the outgrowth module to include elevated auxin biosynthesis and auxin import (features 3, 4 and 6 above) and show that it also applies to outgrowths emerging from the plane of the leaf. The observation that a loss of PIN1 convergences and outgrowths in <italic>kan1kan2cuc2</italic> mutants is correlated with a loss of ectopic auxin biosynthesis and import supports an important role of these features in the outgrowth module.</p><p>These observations raise the question of how the various features of the outgrowth module are generated. We found that models for PIN1 convergence site formation (feature 1) fall into two groups. Convergent alignment models (e.g. up-the-gradient) spontaneously generate spaced centres of polarity convergence in a in a field of cells with initially uniform auxin distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jönsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cieslak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heisler et al., 2010</xref>). By contrast, tandem alignment models (e.g. flux-based and indirect coupling) generate swirled patterns of tandemly aligned polarity in this context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>).</p><p>Convergent alignment models provide the most parsimonious explanation for the observed PIN1 polarity (feature 1), intracellular auxin (feature 2), and spacing of outgrowths, as all of these aspects arise naturally in a uniform field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bilsborough et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jönsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). However, there is no expectation of elevated expression of auxin biosynthesis enzymes in the regions of polarity divergence in the axils of leaves and their outgrowths (feature 3). Indeed, auxin biosynthesis in these regions can cause polarities to orient towards regions of elevated auxin biosynthesis, rather than away from them as is observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). The convergent alignment model may be reconciled with the observed expression of <italic>YUC1</italic> and <italic>YUC4</italic> auxin biosynthesis genes in regions of polarity divergence if it is assumed that this expression does not raise auxin levels sufficiently to influence polarity. Rather than playing a role in polarity reorientation, <italic>YUC</italic> expression may then be a consequence of low auxin in these regions following polarity reorientation, as expression of <italic>YUC</italic> genes has been shown to be down-regulated by auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suzuki et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>There is also no expectation of elevated auxin import in regions of polarity convergence (feature 4) for the convergent alignment model. The parsimony of the convergent alignment model arises from the reinforcement of auxin levels at centres of convergence through auxin transport without any need for additional mechanisms, such as elevated auxin import. Elevated auxin importer expression can be incorporated within a convergent alignment model, by postulating that high levels of intracellular auxin induce auxin import. This approach was adopted to account for the effect of auxin import on leaf serration development, and with suitable parameters auxin import can play a role in reinforcing convergent alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kasprzewska et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>However, with some convergent alignment models, incorporation of auxin import may have a disruptive effect. It has been proposed that cells may orient polarity up auxin gradients by responding to auxin levels in their neighbours indirectly by sensing auxin flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cieslak et al., 2015</xref>). Assuming all cells in a tissue have an equal capacity to import and export auxin, cells with elevated intracellular auxin concentration will have higher net rates of auxin flux away from them, into neighbouring cells. This flux could be sensed to orient PIN1 allocation up the auxin gradient. However, this behaviour would be disrupted by elevated levels of auxin importer expression at centres of convergence, because elevated auxin import in the high auxin cells would reduce the net flux from them into their neighbours.</p><p>Based on PIN1 data and intracellular auxin levels alone (features 1 and 2), tandem alignment models provide a less parsimonious explanation than convergent alignment models. Special mechanisms need to be postulated for tandem alignment models for PIN1 convergence sites to form, such as induction of regions with elevated auxin import and removal. The observation of sub-epidermal strands of cells with inwardly oriented PIN proteins (feature 5) fits the requirement of auxin removal for convergence formation in the tandem alignment models. However, auxin removal alone, through formation of sub-epidermal PIN1 strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoma et al., 2008</xref>) would lead to a transient dip in epidermal auxin concentrations, which is not observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunoud et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>). Here, in the simulations we present, the transient dip does not occur if centres of convergence have elevated auxin import in addition to removal. The observed elevated levels of auxin import at convergence centres (feature 4) is therefore an expected feature for tandem alignment models. A functional role for auxin import is also supported by the observed disruption of outgrowth initiation in <italic>aux1lax1lax2lax3</italic> meristems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bainbridge et al., 2008</xref>) and <italic>kan1kan2aux1lax1lax2lax3</italic> leaves. A further property of tandem alignment models is that polarities tend to become oriented away from auxin sources. It is therefore expected that sites of divergent polarity, such as the axillary regions of outgrowths would be auxin sources, compatible with elevated expression of auxin biosynthesis enzymes in these regions (feature 3). Also supporting these predictions of tandem alignment models, loss of ectopic auxin biosynthesis and import in the <italic>kan1kan2cuc2</italic> mutant correlates with a loss of PIN1 convergence points and ectopic outgrowths.</p><p>Thus, when the auxin import and biosynthesis data are considered along with the PIN1 polarity and intracellular auxin levels, tandem alignment models may give a more a parsimonious explanation for the data as a whole than convergent alignment models.</p><p>The contribution of <italic>CUC</italic> gene activity (feature 6) can be incorporated into both convergent and tandem alignment models. Our data suggest that in wild-type leaves <italic>CUC2</italic> expression is excluded from the abaxial lamina and confined to serrations by the action of abaxial identity determinants including <italic>KAN1</italic> and <italic>KAN2</italic>. According to the convergent alignment model, CUC2 may be required to enable PIN1 polarity to become reoriented rather than remaining fixed in the abaxial lamina as occurs in wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bilsborough et al., 2011</xref>). According to the tandem alignment models, ectopic expression of <italic>CUC2</italic> could drive auxin synthesis (YUCCA expression) and induction of ectopic sites of elevated auxin import and removal, and thus centres of convergence. <italic>CUC2</italic> expression distal to the outgrowth could also maintain these regions as sites of high auxin synthesis and polarity divergence.</p><p>The results presented here highlight distinctive elements in models for tissue cell polarity in plants and animals. The ability of all three plant models analysed to generate cell polarity in a non-polarising context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>) contrasts with models of animal planar cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Strutt and Strutt, 2009</xref>), where polarity is proposed to either be dependent on pre-established asymmetric cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amonlirdviman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Garrec et al., 2006</xref>) or polarisable neighbours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burak and Shraiman, 2009</xref>). Models may therefore be classified into two broad categories: those in which polarity of a cell depends on a polarising environment and those that do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18</xref>). Although most animal models belong to the first category, a version that does not require a polarising environment, termed direct coupling, has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abley et al., 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig18" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18165.025</object-id><label>Figure 18.</label><caption><title>Classification of plant and animal polarity models.</title><p>Models of plant and animal epidermal polarity may be classified according to whether they require the presence of pre-established asymmetries or polarisable neighbours (referred to as a polarising environment) for cell polarity to arise. All plant models tested can generate cell polarity without a polarising environment, whilst animal models except the direct coupling model ([4] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abley et al., 2013</xref>]) either require an asymmetric signal ([1] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Garrec et al., 2006</xref>] [2] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amonlirdviman, 2005</xref>]) or polarisable neighbours ([3] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burak and Shraiman, 2009</xref>]) for cell polarity to arise. A further classification is made according to the behaviours of groups of cells in the absence of pre-established asymmetries. In this context, the indirect coupling ([5] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abley et al., 2013</xref>]) and flux-based ([6] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mitchison, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rolland-Lagan and Prusinkiewicz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoma et al., 2008</xref>]) models of plant polarity generate swirled patterns of polarity with tandem alignments between cells. In contrast, the up-the-gradient model ([7] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bilsborough et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jönsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2006</xref>]) generates convergent alignments of cell polarities. The stress-based model of PIN1 polarity ([8] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heisler et al., 2010</xref>]) also fits in the convergent alignment category as it generates similar behaviours with respect to auxin concentrations to the up-the-gradient model. The animal models that are capable of polarising in the absence of pre-established asymmetries generate tandem alignments of polarities ([4] direct coupling model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abley et al., 2013</xref>], and (3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burak and Shraiman, 2009</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18165.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18165.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-18165-fig18-v1"/></fig></p><p>For plant models, cells may polarise in a non-polarising environment in two ways. One is through small fluctuations in polarity leading to altered auxin distribution or flux which then feeds back to enhance polarity. This occurs in the up-the-gradient and flux-based models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Berkel et al., 2013</xref>]). It contrasts with current animal models in which polarity does not feed back to influence the distribution of the extracellular ligand. Another class of plant models proposes that cells become polarised without requirement for altered distribution or flux of auxin, through processes internal to the cell, as assumed for indirect coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). It remains to be seen whether the indirect coupling model can also capture the generation of sub-epidermal strands of cells with elevated levels of membrane-localised PIN1 (feature 5). Such strands are observed experimentally during pro-vascular development and can be accounted for with a flux-based model assuming superlinear feedback between flux and PIN1 allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scarpella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bayer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rolland-Lagan and Prusinkiewicz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feugier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoma et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis illustrates the value of comparing multiple models when analysing experimental data rather than focusing on one in isolation. Each model alone can be modified to account for experimental observations, showing that fitting to data is not conclusive. However, models may differ in the predictions they make prior to the data being obtained, and the parsimony with which experimental data can be accounted for. Moreover some models may make very similar predictions even though underlying molecular mechanisms are different. For example, two types of tandem alignment model - flux-based and indirect coupling - give similar predictions for auxin import and synthesis. Similarly, a concentration-based or stress-based version of the convergent alignment model gives similar predictions for auxin turnover. Other types of experiment will be needed to discriminate between these further levels of explanation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>All <italic>kan1kan2</italic> mutants carry <italic>kan1-2</italic> and <italic>kan2-1</italic> alleles in the Landsberg erecta (Ler-0) background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eshed et al., 2001</xref>) except in the <italic>kan1kan2yuc1yuc4</italic> background, where plants carry <italic>kan1-11</italic> and <italic>kan2-5</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Formation of Polarity Convergences underlying Shoot Outgrowths&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by Detlef Weigel as the Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Joanne Chory, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your current study will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, we want to encourage you to prepare a substantially revised manuscript and consider submission of a new version to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We are in principle very interested in your model because it brings new discussion to the field, taking into account the parameters of auxin import and biosynthesis. However, we felt a few more experiments would greatly strengthen your arguments. Specifically, should you decide to resubmit, please consider:</p><p>1) A more complete documentation for different PINs and <italic>LAX</italic>s in (<italic>kan</italic>) leaves, using state-of-the-art markers;</p><p>2) Testing whether a D6 kinase type activity would improve a model (see point 4 below, and comments of reviewers 1 and 2);</p><p>3) Adding more discussion about what your model can and cannot accomplish.</p><p>In particular, we would like to see increased discussion of the following specific points:</p><p>1) The authors build their work on a previous paper (Abley 2013), in which they introduced the indirect coupling model. In this context, it is laudable that the authors clarify that their earlier conclusion that both the convergence point and the flux-based model could not create single cell polarity was erroneous. This is because previously they did not allow stochastic noise in the PIN distribution, which is however the necessary starting point for all models now, just as in a classic self-organizing reaction-diffusion model. Is this correct? If so, or any other reason, this should be explicitly stated.</p><p>2) In several places, the authors discussed auxin removal and auxin degradation. It is not clear whether the two terms mean the same thing. Does auxin transport out of a cell represent auxin removal? Auxin degradation means that auxin is destroyed, not transported out? A clear definition of the terms will be helpful.</p><p>3) To explain the phenotype of wild type with respect to the convergence point model, the authors propose at one point that &quot;PIN polarity becomes fixed early in development, preventing polarity reorientation&quot;. How would that work and is there any experimental evidence for this in the literature?</p><p>4) The characterization of regulatory mechanisms for PIN activity in recent years is not considered in the model, and maybe understandably, because it is technically difficult to assess. Nevertheless, one can no longer assume that where there's a PIN, there's auxin efflux. How robust is the model if, for instance, a parameter for non-linear PIN activation (by D6 kinases, themselves polar), for example as a function of polarity, would be introduced?</p><p>5) What are the limitations of using the mixed outgrowths of the <italic>kanadi</italic> mutants?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this paper, Abley et al. examine various models for how shoot apical meristems of plants generate auxin maxima, which become the site of new outgrowths. The most widely accepted model, the &quot;up-the-gradient&quot; model, is also the most parsimonious explanation as it spontaneously generates convergent PIN transporter alignments. Based on recent literature, suggesting that regulated auxin import and new auxin biosynthesis must also be involved, the authors looked at the ability of current models to predict sites of new leaf outgrowths. In a combination of methodologies that include both experiments and computer simulations, the authors challenge the simple model and conclude that less parsimonious models, (&quot;flux model&quot; or &quot;indirect cell-cell coupling&quot; model), make predictions that better explain the data.</p><p>This is a very nicely written paper that will initiate a new dialog in the field of auxin control of development-one of the deepest studied areas of plant biology. The time-lapse images are stunning, and I generally agree with the interpretation (with the exclusion of Figure 11B3). The Meyerowitz lab's &quot;up-the gradient&quot; model has dominated the discussion for 8 years, and I think it's time for us to consider some new ideas. Thus, I am in favor of publishing this paper. That said, some other new data has emerged in the past 8 years, in addition to the information on auxin import and auxin biosynthesis. As an example, PIN1 can localize to a side of a cell, but it is only an active transporter when it's phosphorylated by PID or one of its paralogs or one of the D6PKs. A second example is the use of <italic>kan1 kan2</italic> double mutant, which makes mixed tissue outgrowths ectopically that are best predicted by tandem alignment models. Why not just look at areas of serration? The authors imaged only epidermal tissue. Why not other layers?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper is quite nice to read and very well explained, especially how the models work and how they relate to the data is very accessible to the non-specialist reader as compared to other studies in this field. In a nutshell, the authors perform a top-down modeling approach to test which of three alternative models for auxin convergence point formation fits the data best. The data set mostly comprises time course observations of pertinent markers, at the same time taking advantage of the unusual laminar outgrowth formation in <italic>kanadi</italic> mutants. From the simulations and their match with spatio-temporal maker expression, the authors conclude that the two &quot;tandem alignment&quot; models fit the data better than another model that has been proposed to explain convergence points. Specifically, the &quot;indirect coupling&quot; tandem alignment model proposed by the authors previously appears to fit the observations best. I am not a modeler and cannot judge the technical dimension of the simulations, but trust the authors and other reviewers are competent in this field. Nevertheless, I have some questions and suggestions related to the modeling, as well as the experimental support and verification.</p><p>1) The authors build their work on a previous paper (Abley 2013), in which they introduced the indirect coupling model. In this context, it is laudable that the authors clarify that their earlier conclusion that both the convergence point and the flux-based model could not create single cell polarity was erroneous. As far as I understand, this is because previously they did not allow stochastic noise in the PIN distribution, which is however the necessary starting point for all models now, just as in a classic self-organizing reaction-diffusion model. Is this correct? If so, or any other reason, this should be explicitly stated.</p><p>2) The indirect coupling model requires two substances that establish an intracellular polarity through the interplay of differentially mobile cytosolic and membrane/apoplastic isoforms that interact with, and determine polarity of the auxin transport machinery. I suspect that the appeal of this model was linked to the discovery of the supposed interaction between Rho GTPases on one side and ABP1 on the other, including the auxin feedback on ABP1 mobility/activity as outlined in Wabnik et al. 2010, Mol Sys Biol. With ABP1 now clearly defunct in its role as extracellular auxin receptor that feeds on PIN polarity by regulating endocytic recycling of PINs (Michalko et al. F1000 Research 2016), I wonder how realistic is this model still? In all consequence, one might say that maybe an even better model could be built if it's all free fantasy. In the absence of experimentally proven candidates for substances A and B at this point, the indirect coupling model loses much of its mojo, unfortunately.</p><p>3) This brings me to my maybe major concern as an experimentalist: what is the value of the model if it is too detached from the molecular experimental reality? For instance, the characterization of regulatory mechanisms for PIN activity in recent years is not considered in the model, and maybe understandably, because it is technically difficult to assess. Nevertheless, one can no longer assume that where there's a PIN, there's auxin efflux. Thus, I wonder how robust the model is, for instance if a parameter for non-linear PIN activation (by D6 kinases, themselves polar), for example as a function of polarity, would be introduced?</p><p>4) What I am concerned about is that the model is supported by (maybe unconscious) selectivity for experimental data, in the sense that data that fit are over-emphasized while data that don't are ignored. I do not imply that this is what the authors did here, but I would like them to take into account the following considerations:</p><p>5) The imaging/modeling is exclusively based on PIN1 abundance and polarity patterns as far as I can see. Are there any valid reasons for this? Are other PINs not at all expressed in leaves? And, specifically, in the <italic>kan1 kan2</italic> background (see below)?</p><p>6) A major point to get any of the models to work is the requirement for proximo-distally separated auxin sources and sinks. Sinks can be provided in different ways, like auxin drainage through developing vasculature, but an attractive feature of the best-fit model is that auxin importers would amplify sink strength. Apparently, both <italic>AUX1</italic> and <italic>LAX1</italic> would fit the bill. One idea here is that threshold auxin levels induce either or both of them, and I imagine that would be easy to test, and quantify experimentally.</p><p>7) Given the major role assigned to <italic>AUX1</italic> and <italic>LAX1</italic> in the model fit, the experimental data are a bit disappointing. The quadruple mutant clearly has a tangible reduction in &quot;outgrowth success&quot;, but it is rather weak (from ~12 to ~8) overall. Weakening the suspected vascular drain by knocking out <italic>LAX2</italic> on top leads to a further reduction to ~5. I was wondering how these values exactly relate to the model? Are they within the models &quot;plasticity&quot; when these components are taken out? Also, is <italic>AUX/LAX</italic> polarity in the vasculature in line with the direction of drainage?</p><p>8) Regarding more experimental proof for this idea: I believe the authors could test the role of <italic>AUX/LAX</italic>s more directly. For example, does local induction of an <italic>AUX/LAX</italic> in an inducible system (maybe +/- auxin treatment) trigger laminar outgrowth? Or, does local auxin efflux inhibition after convergence point formation delay/prevent outgrowth?</p><p>9) Also, with respect to the contribution of auxin biosynthesis, could outgrowth frequency be modulated by its local pharmacological inhibition?</p><p>10) Finally, I am a little bit worried about the use of the <italic>kan1 kan2</italic> double mutant as a &quot;model&quot; for outgrowth formation. Given the genetic interaction of <italic>KANADI</italic>s with auxin response factor (e.g. Pekker et al. 2005 PC), and the finding that <italic>KANADI</italic>s are transcriptional repressors that target many auxin-related genes (notably, PIN-activating AGC kinases) (Huang et al. 2014 PC), could the observations in the <italic>kan1 kan2</italic> double mutants be deceiving? For instance, <italic>LAX3</italic> is a repressed <italic>KAN1</italic> target, therefore presumably up-regulated in <italic>kan1 kan2</italic>. This could create stochastic auxin &quot;holes&quot;, which could then trigger outgrowth, and it appears possible that the authors' observations regarding PINs etc. follow, rather than precede this event.</p><p>11) The fact that <italic>LAX3</italic> has such a prominent role in reducing outgrowth frequency despite its supposed absence in the leaf could support this idea. I suggest the authors test experimentally at higher resolution whether <italic>LAX3</italic> is ectopically expressed in <italic>kan1 kan2</italic> leaves and associated with, and/or preceding outgrowth formation. The images provided in Figure 8—figure supplement 1C are difficult to interpret, maybe early <italic>LAX3</italic> expression is carried over during leaf organogenesis and auxin sinks are predefined at this point? Also, alternative markers (fluorescent markers) could reveal hidden expression patterns frequently missed by equivalent GUS markers.</p><p>12) If not, could the impact of the <italic>lax3</italic> mutation be explained by auxin accumulation in the leaf because of a lack of drainage to the stem? Maybe this could be tested experimentally.</p><p>13) To explain the discrepant phenotype of wild type with respect to the convergence point model, the authors propose at one point that &quot;PIN polarity becomes fixed early in development, preventing polarity reorientation&quot;. How would that work and is there any experimental evidence for this in the literature?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors combined modeling, live-imaging, and mutant analyses to study the mechanisms underlying shoot outgrowth.

The results with PIN1 clearly demonstrate polarity reorientations and how these might relate to the proposed models. It is unclear what key new insights would be gained by introduction of additional markers. We hope the paper is acceptable without this additional work. We have added the following sentence:</p><p>“Here we focus on PIN1 since this is the predominant epidermally expressed PIN that shows polar intracellular distributions in wild-type leaves (Guenot et al., 2012).”</p><p><italic>2) Testing whether a D6 kinase type activity would improve a model (see point 4 below, and comments of reviewers 1 and 2);</italic> </p><p>We have added the following to the Results section:</p><p>“D6 protein kinases are polarly localized in cells independently of PIN proteins and their phosphorylation of PIN proteins is required for PIN-mediated auxin efflux (Barbosa et al., 2014, Zourelidou et al., 2009). We added a representation of D6 kinase activity to the indirect coupling model, as cell polarity in this system does not depend on PIN activity, and found that this does notqualitatively affect model behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) Adding more discussion about what your model can and cannot accomplish.</italic> </p><p>We have added the following clarification at the end of the Discussion, which points out that evaluation of models is not based only on what they can accomplish but on how they compare to other models:</p><p>“Our analysis illustrates the value of comparing multiple models when analysing experimental data rather than focusing on one in isolation. […] Other types of experiment will be needed to discriminate between these further levels of explanation.”</p><p><italic>In particular, we would like to see increased discussion of the following specific points:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors build their work on a previous paper (Abley 2013), in which they introduced the indirect coupling model. In this context, it is laudable that the authors clarify that their earlier conclusion that both the convergence point and the flux-based model could not create single cell polarity was erroneous. This is because previously they did not allow stochastic noise in the PIN distribution, which is however the necessary starting point for all models now, just as in a classic self-organizing reaction-diffusion model. Is this correct? If so, or any other reason, this should be explicitly stated.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this ambiguity out. The reason for us overlooking intracellular partitioning for flux-based and up-the-gradient models in our previous paper was not because we didn’t allow for stochastic noise in PIN distribution as the referee suggests. In all our previous work we allowed for stochastic noise in both PIN and auxin distribution, which, as the referee correctly points out, is a necessary starting point for testing any model, and such a procedure therefore was applied in all current and previous simulations in all our work. The reason for our revision arose from the fact that no one had previously applied their models to simulate single polarisable cells surrounded by non-polarisable neighbours - all previous simulations considered cell arrays in which all cells are polarisable. When performing such simulations we found that all three models can generate polarity in an initially uniform field of auxin concentration. The polarity arises in the flux-based and up-the-gradient models because small fluctuations in PIN1 distribution create variations in auxin flux or concentrations that feed back to reinforce the polarity. We have now clarified the text in the subsection “PIN1 polarity models can be classified into two groups with different behaviours” to make our reasoning more explicit, and also pointed out a key difference between the up-the-gradient model and the other models. If auxin concentration in the medium surrounding a single polarisable cell remains fixed throughout the simulation (equivalent to voltage-clamping in neurophysiology), then the up-the-gradient model does not generate polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, both the flux-based and indirect coupling model present polarity even under such settings.</p><p><italic>2) In several places, the authors discussed auxin removal and auxin degradation. It is not clear whether the two terms mean the same thing. Does auxin transport out of a cell represent auxin removal? Auxin degradation means that auxin is destroyed, not transported out? A clear definition of the terms will be helpful.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this ambiguity. We have added the following:</p><p>“Net auxin removal from a region of tissue could be achieved through a decreased rate of auxin biosynthesis, an increased rate of transport away from the region, or an increased rate of auxin degradation or conjugation. Here net removal is achieved using elevated auxin degradation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).”</p><p>We also now say:</p><p>“Here we simulate net auxin production in proximal regions with an increased auxin biosynthesis rate, although it could also be achieved with a reduced auxin degradation rate or increased auxin influx from (or decreased auxin efflux to) tissues beyond those represented in the simulation. Likewise, net removal from the leaf tip is simulated using elevated degradation, although it could also occur through reduction in biosynthesis, increase in conjugation, or via transport into underlying tissue layers (Bayer et al., 2009; Scarpella et al., 2006).”</p><p><italic>3) To explain the phenotype of wild type with respect to the convergence point model, the authors propose at one point that &quot;PIN polarity becomes fixed early in development, preventing polarity reorientation&quot;. How would that work and is there any experimental evidence for this in the literature?</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is unclear how fixing polarity would work and is a possible weakness of the convergent polarity model. We have made this clearer by changing the wording of this paragraph to read:</p><p>“The failure to form such a convergence centre in wild-type leaves could be explained by the PIN1 polarity pattern becoming fixed at early stages of development, preventing polarity reorientation. However, it is unclear how this could be achieved, although it has been proposed that absence of CUC2 activity may play a role in fixing polarity (Bilsborough et al., 2011).”</p><p><italic>4) The characterization of regulatory mechanisms for PIN activity in recent years is not considered in the model, and maybe understandably, because it is technically difficult to assess. Nevertheless, one can no longer assume that where there's a PIN, there's auxin efflux. How robust is the model if, for instance, a parameter for non-linear PIN activation (by D6 kinases, themselves polar), for example as a function of polarity, would be introduced?</italic></p><p>See response to editorial comments point 2 above.</p><p><italic>5) What are the limitations of using the mixed outgrowths of the kanadi mutants?</italic></p><p>All systems for studying outgrowths (primordia, serrations, <italic>kanadi</italic> outgrowths) have the limitation that they represent specific instances. Identifying features that are common to all of them allows general elements of outgrowth formation to be identified, irrespective of the particular system or context. To make this point clearer we have added the following text to the beginning of the Discussion:</p><p>“<italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths arise ectopically as a consequence of reduced abaxial identity, and thus differ from leaf primordia and serrations. Despite these differences, we show that general elements of outgrowth formation apply to shoot outgrowths (<italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths, primordia and serrations) regardless of their specific context.”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is a very nicely written paper that will initiate a new dialog in the field of auxin control of development-one of the deepest studied areas of plant biology. The time-lapse images are stunning, and I generally agree with the interpretation (with the exclusion of Figure 11B3). The Meyerowitz lab's &quot;up-the gradient&quot; model has dominated the discussion for 8 years, and I think it's time for us to consider some new ideas. Thus, I am in favor of publishing this paper. That said, some other new data has emerged in the past 8 years, in addition to the information on auxin import and auxin biosynthesis. As an example, pin1 can localize to a side of a cell, but it is only an active transporter when it's phosphorylated by PID or one of its paralogs or one of the D6PKs.</italic> </p><p>See response to editorial comments point 2 above.</p><p><italic>A second example is the use of kan1 kan2 double mutant, which makes mixed tissue outgrowths ectopically that are best predicted by tandem alignment models. Why not just look at areas of serration?</italic> </p><p>See response to editorial specific point 5. We have also added the following sentence to the Introduction:</p><p>“Because of their emergence from the abaxial lamina, these outgrowths are more amenable to time- lapse imaging than serrations which are often obscured by neighbouring cotyledon tissue and curving of the leaf edge.”</p><p><italic>The authors imaged only epidermal tissue. Why not other layers?</italic></p><p>We focus on epidermal tissue as it can be more readily tracked through time-lapse imaging and because it displays convergence sites. Following other layers would indeed be very interesting as well but is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This paper is quite nice to read and very well explained, especially how the models work and how they relate to the data is very accessible to the non-specialist reader as compared to other studies in this field. In a nutshell, the authors perform a top-down modeling approach to test which of three alternative models for auxin convergence point formation fits the data best. The data set mostly comprises time course observations of pertinent markers, at the same time taking advantage of the unusual laminar outgrowth formation in kanadi mutants. From the simulations and their match with spatio-temporal maker expression, the authors conclude that the two &quot;tandem alignment&quot; models fit the data better than another model that has been proposed to explain convergence points. Specifically, the &quot;indirect coupling&quot; tandem alignment model proposed by the authors previously appears to fit the observations best. I am not a modeler and cannot judge the technical dimension of the simulations, but trust the authors and other reviewers are competent in this field. Nevertheless, I have some questions and suggestions related to the modeling, as well as the experimental support and verification.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors build their work on a previous paper (Abley 2013), in which they introduced the indirect coupling model. In this context, it is laudable that the authors clarify that their earlier conclusion that both the convergence point and the flux-based model could not create single cell polarity was erroneous. As far as I understand, this is because previously they did not allow stochastic noise in the PIN distribution, which is however the necessary starting point for all models now, just as in a classic self-organizing reaction-diffusion model. Is this correct? If so, or any other reason, this should be explicitly stated.</italic></p><p>See response to editorial specific point 1 above.</p><p><italic>2) The indirect coupling model requires two substances that establish an intracellular polarity through the interplay of differentially mobile cytosolic and membrane/apoplastic isoforms that interact with, and determine polarity of the auxin transport machinery. I suspect that the appeal of this model was linked to the discovery of the supposed interaction between Rho GTPases on one side and ABP1 on the other, including the auxin feedback on ABP1 mobility/activity as outlined in Wabnik et al. 2010, Mol Sys Biol. With ABP1 now clearly defunct in its role as extracellular auxin receptor that feeds on PIN polarity by regulating endocytic recycling of PINs (Michalko et al. F1000 Research 2016), I wonder how realistic is this model still? In all consequence, one might say that maybe an even better model could be built if it's all free fantasy. In the absence of experimentally proven candidates for substances A and B at this point, the indirect coupling model loses much of its mojo, unfortunately.</italic></p><p>The indirect coupling model is a hypothesis that arose from general considerations of how tissue cell polarity might be coordinated, irrespective of the molecular players (Abley et al). It is not true that any model can be built if all is fantasy because there are limitations on what can and cannot work in principle. Indeed, the comment of the referee highlights the danger with making models that are too narrowly based on particular experimental claims which may themselves be faulty. Indirect coupling depends on a mechanism for sensing extracellular auxin concentration and ABP1 initially seemed like a reasonable candidate. We agree that recent data rules out ABP1 having this role, and like the other hypotheses (up-the-gradient, flux) the molecular players involved in sensing auxin levels or flux remain to be elucidated.</p><p><italic>3) This brings me to my maybe major concern as an experimentalist: what is the value of the model if it is too detached from the molecular experimental reality? For instance, the characterization of regulatory mechanisms for PIN activity in recent years is not considered in the model, and maybe understandably, because it is technically difficult to assess. Nevertheless, one can no longer assume that where there's a PIN, there's auxin efflux. Thus, I wonder how robust the model is, for instance if a parameter for non-linear PIN activation (by D6 kinases, themselves polar), for example as a function of polarity, would be introduced?</italic></p><p>See response to editorial comments point 2 above.</p><p><italic>4) What I am concerned about is that the model is supported by (maybe unconscious) selectivity for experimental data, in the sense that data that fit are over-emphasized while data that don't are ignored.

And, specifically, in the kan1 kan2 background (see below)?</italic></p><p>See response to editorial comments point 1 above.</p><p><italic>6) A major point to get any of the models to work is the requirement for proximo-distally separated auxin sources and sinks. Sinks can be provided in different ways, like auxin drainage through developing vasculature, but an attractive feature of the best-fit model is that auxin importers would amplify sink strength. Apparently, both AUX1 and LAX1 would fit the bill. One idea here is that threshold auxin levels induce either or both of them, and I imagine that would be easy to test, and quantify experimentally.</italic></p><p>Models should make testable predictions and we agree that this is a testable prediction of our model. However, as we already test several predictions, including the incorporation of additional data on the role of <italic>CUC2</italic>, we hope that further tests such as this could be the subject of further studies and would not be required for acceptance of this one.</p><p><italic>7) Given the major role assigned to AUX1 and LAX1 in the model fit, the experimental data are a bit disappointing. The quadruple mutant clearly has a tangible reduction in &quot;outgrowth success&quot;, but it is rather weak (from ~12 to ~8) overall. Weakening the suspected vascular drain by knocking out LAX2 on top leads to a further reduction to ~5. I was wondering how these values exactly relate to the model? Are they within the models &quot;plasticity&quot; when these components are taken out? Also, is AUX/LAX polarity in the vasculature in line with the direction of drainage?</italic></p><p>We could tweak parameters to allow the contribution of individual importers to be fitted to the data. However, our approach is not to fit the model to particular data after it has been obtained but to test specific predictions of the model. The tandem coupling models predict that there should be a mechanism for keeping extracellular auxin low at convergence centres, such as auxin import. We tested this prediction experimentally and obtained supporting data based on the expression pattern and mutants. The fact that we see a marked reduction as predicted is striking, and given the potential for redundancy of gene activity and mechanisms, it is not surprising that outgrowths were not completely eliminated. We have not looked at polarity of <italic>LAX1</italic> or <italic>LAX2</italic> in vascular tissue but the model does not have specific requirements for this.</p><p><italic>8) Regarding more experimental proof for this idea: I believe the authors could test the role of AUX/LAXs more directly. For example, does local induction of an AUX/LAX in an inducible system (maybe +/- auxin treatment) trigger laminar outgrowth? Or, does local auxin efflux inhibition after convergence point formation delay/prevent outgrowth?</italic></p><p>See response to Reviewer 2 point 6 above.</p><p><italic>9) Also, with respect to the contribution of auxin biosynthesis, could outgrowth frequency be modulated by its local pharmacological inhibition?</italic></p><p>The loss of outgrowths in <italic>kan1kan2yuc1yuc2yuc4</italic> mutants (Wang et al., 2011) shows the role of YUC genes more cleanly than using pharmacological inhibition. We mention this requirement of YUC genes in the Results section:</p><p>“<italic>A. thaliana</italic> has six YUCCA genes, three of which <italic>(YUCCA1 (YUC1), YUCCA2 (YUC2)</italic> and <italic>YUCCA4 (YUC4))</italic> are expressed in the leaf and are redundantly required for <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowth development (Cheng et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2011).</p><p><italic>10) Finally, I am a little bit worried about the use of the kan1 kan2 double mutant as a &quot;model&quot; for outgrowth formation. Given the genetic interaction of KANADIs with auxin response factor (e.g. Pekker et al. 2005 PC), and the finding that KANADIs are transcriptional repressors that target many auxin-related genes (notably, PIN-activating AGC kinases) (Huang et al. 2014 PC), could the observations in the kan1 kan2 double mutants be deceiving? For instance, LAX3 is a repressed KAN1 target, therefore presumably up-regulated in kan1 kan2. This could create stochastic auxin &quot;holes&quot;, which could then trigger outgrowth, and it appears possible that the authors' observations regarding PINs etc. follow, rather than precede this event.</italic></p><p>Pekker et al., 2005 show that ARF3 and ARF4 expression is only slightly altered in <italic>kan1kan2</italic> mutant leaves where ARF3 expression appears ectopically in <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths. However, since ARF3 is also expressed in emerging leaf primordia, this supports the similarity of <italic>kan1kan2</italic> outgrowths and leaf primordia. We thank the reviewer for the suggestion of stochastic auxin holes arising as a consequence of altered <italic>LAX</italic> expression. This of course begs the question of how such holes would be established and would require some sort of reinforcing mechanism in itself. From the data in Huang et al., 2014, it appears that <italic>LAX3</italic> expression is actually promoted by induction of KAN1-GR activity (see supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), and thus its expression would be expected to be reduced in <italic>kan1kan2</italic> mutants. There is some evidence that <italic>LAX1</italic> expression is down-regulated by KAN1 in Huang et al., 2014. However, here we show that ectopic <italic>LAX1</italic> expression is lost in <italic>kan1kan2cuc2</italic> leaves, suggesting that upregulation of <italic>LAX1</italic> in <italic>kan1kan2</italic> leaves occurs via <italic>CUC2</italic>. This is consistent with the tandem alignment models we present but less easily reconciled with a stochastic auxin hole hypothesis.</p><p><italic>11) The fact that LAX3 has such a prominent role in reducing outgrowth frequency despite its supposed absence in the leaf could support this idea. I suggest the authors test experimentally at higher resolution whether LAX3 is ectopically expressed in kan1 kan2 leaves and associated with, and/or preceding outgrowth formation. The images provided in Figure 8—figure supplement 1C are difficult to interpret, maybe early LAX3 expression is carried over during leaf organogenesis and auxin sinks are predefined at this point? Also, alternative markers (fluorescent markers) could reveal hidden expression patterns frequently missed by equivalent GUS markers.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. <italic>LAX3</italic> only has a prominent role in the <italic>aux1 lax1 lax2</italic> background. The specific contribution of <italic>LAX3</italic> in relation to other importers is not critical to our model (see response to Reviewer 2 point 7 above) and investigating its specific contribution could be the subject of a further study (see also response to Reviewer 2 point 6 above).</p><p><italic>12) If not, could the impact of the lax3 mutation be explained by auxin accumulation in the leaf because of a lack of drainage to the stem?
