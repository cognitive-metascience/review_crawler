ZFP36 RBPs are prominent inflammatory regulators linked to autoimmunity and cancer, but functions in adaptive immunity are less clear. We used HITS-CLIP to define ZFP36 targets in mouse T cells, revealing unanticipated actions in regulating T-cell activation, proliferation, and effector functions. Transcriptome and ribosome profiling showed that ZFP36 represses mRNA target abundance and translation, notably through novel AU-rich sites in coding sequence. Functional studies revealed that ZFP36 regulates early T-cell activation kinetics cell autonomously, by attenuating activation marker expression, limiting T cell expansion, and promoting apoptosis. Strikingly, loss of ZFP36 in vivo accelerated T cell responses to acute viral infection and enhanced anti-viral immunity. These findings uncover a critical role for ZFP36 RBPs in restraining T cell expansion and effector functions, and suggest ZFP36 inhibition as a strategy to enhance immune-based therapies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33057.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system must quickly respond to anything that may cause disease – from cancerous cells to viruses. For instance, a type of white blood cell called a T cell patrols the body, looking for potential threats. If a T cell identifies such a threat, it “activates” and undergoes various changes so that it can help to eliminate the problem.</p><p>One way that T cells change is by switching on different genes to make specific proteins. The information in the genes is first used as a template to produce a molecule called a messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated to build proteins. So-called RNA-binding proteins help control events before, during and after the translation stage in the process. Previous studies have shown that one particular RNA-binding protein, called ZFP36, controls the translation of proteins that are important for how the immune system recognizes the body’s own tissue and deals with cancer cells. However, it was less clear if it also helped T cells to activate and defeat viruses.</p><p>Now, using cutting-edge technology, Moore et al. have identified thousands of new mRNAs controlled by ZFP36 in mice, many of which did indeed make proteins that help T cells activate and spread throughout the body. Further experiments showed that mice that lack ZFP36 in the T cells were much quicker at responding to viruses than other mice. This suggests that ZFP36 actually restrains T cells and slows down the body’s immune system.</p><p>Knowing more about how T cells work could lead to new treatments for diseases; it may, for example, allow scientists to engineer T cells to better attack cancer cells, However, other studies have shown that mice without ZFP36 often go on to develop autoimmune diseases, which result from the immune system attacking healthy cells by mistake. As such, it seems that there is a fine line between improving the body’s immune system and increasing the risk of autoimmune diseases, and that RNA-binding proteins play an important role in managing this delicate balance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA binding protein</kwd><kwd>T cell</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>anti-viral immunity</kwd><kwd>HITS-CLIP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS034389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009784</institution-id><institution>Starr Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS081706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35NS097404</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By attenuating the translation of key mRNA targets, ZFP36 RNA binding proteins restrain the expansion and effector activity of T cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Immune responses require precise, dynamic gene regulation that must activate rapidly as threats rise and resolve efficiently as they clear. Post-transcriptional control of mRNA abundance and expression by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) is a key layer of this response that can enact rapid, signal-responsive changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kafasla et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hao and Baltimore, 2009</xref>), but knowledge of specific functional roles for dedicated RBPs remains limited.</p><p>AU-rich elements (AREs) in mRNA 3’-untranslated regions (3’-UTR) facilitate post-transcriptional control of many immune functions, including cytokine expression, signal transduction, and immediate-early transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Shyu, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shaw and Kamen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caput et al., 1986</xref>). Many RBPs bind AREs, with diverse ensuing effects on RNA turnover, translation, and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stoecklin and Mühlemann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tiedje et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">von Roretz et al., 2011</xref>). The Zinc finger binding protein 36 (ZFP36) family of proteins are prototypical ARE-binding factors with distinctive, activation-dependent expression in hematopoietic cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raghavan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carballo et al., 1998</xref>). The family includes three somatic paralogs: ZFP36 (a.k.a Tristetraprolin, TTP), ZFP36L1 (a.k.a. butyrate responsive factor 1, BRF1), and ZFP36L2 (a.k.a BRF2) with highly homologous CCCH zinc-finger RNA binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blackshear, 2002</xref>).</p><p>In many contexts, the archetypal paralog ZFP36 de-stabilizes target mRNAs by binding 3’-UTR AREs and recruiting deadenylation and degradation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks and Blackshear, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lykke-Andersen and Wagner, 2005</xref>). More recently, evidence has begun to emerge for roles in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tao and Gao, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tiedje et al., 2012</xref>) but in vivo function and context have not been established. While many aspects remain unsettled, ZFP36 is clearly critical for immune function, as its loss causes a systemic inflammatory disease in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taylor et al., 1996</xref>). A key feature of this syndrome is aberrant stabilization and over-expression of <italic>Tnf </italic>in myeloid cells, particularly macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carballo et al., 1998</xref>), where UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) analyses have further supported direct regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tiedje et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sedlyarov et al., 2016</xref>). However, this role does not fully account for ZFP36 function in vivo, as underscored by reports that myeloid-specific deletions of <italic>Zfp36</italic> do not recapitulate spontaneous autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kratochvill et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Increasing evidence points to important functions for ZFP36 proteins in adaptive immunity. Dual ablation of paralogs <italic>Zfp36l1</italic> and <italic>Zfp36l2</italic> in T cells arrests thymopoeisis at the double-negative stage, and causes lethal lymphoma linked to <italic>Notch1</italic> dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodson et al., 2010</xref>). This role in restraining aberrant proliferation was later extended to B-cell development and lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galloway et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rounbehler et al., 2012</xref>), but the severe phenotype precluded analysis of ZFP36 family function in mature T cells. Consistent with such a function, in vitro studies suggest ZPF36 regulates the expression of T cell-derived cytokines, including IL-2, IFN-γ, and IL-17, that mediate lymphocyte homeostasis, microbial response, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ogilvie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2005</xref>). The landscape of ZFP36 targets beyond these limited cases in T cells is unknown, but will be the key to understanding its emerging roles in inflammation, autoimmunity, and malignant cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patial and Blackshear, 2016</xref>).</p><p>To determine ZFP36 functions in T cells, we employed high-throughput sequencing of UV-cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) to generate a definitive set of ZFP36 RNA targets. HITS-CLIP utilizes in vivo UV-cross-linking to induce covalent bonds between RBPs and target RNAs, allowing stringent immunopurification and thus rigorous identification of direct binding events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Licatalosi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ule et al., 2003</xref>). These new ZFP36 RNA binding maps pointed to roles in regulating T-cell activation kinetics and proliferation, a function confirmed in extensive functional assays, and in vivo studies demonstrating a critical role in anti-viral immunity. Our results illuminate novel functions for ZFP36 in adaptive immunity, laying groundwork for understanding and modulating its activity in disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ZFP36 dynamics during T-cell activation</title><p>ZFP36 expression is induced upon T-cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raghavan et al., 2001</xref>).

Separate analysis of low and high MW RNP complexes showed similar transcript localization and motif enrichment, all consistent with ZFP36 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This analysis indicates the presence of large, stable ZFP36 complexes in vivo, consistent with stable multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2004</xref>). Subsequently, CLIP reads from different MW regions were pooled to maximize dataset depth.</p><p>To examine possible paralog specificity, we also mapped ZFP36L1 sites by HITS-CLIP in <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO CD4+T cells under identical conditions.

Thus, these analyses do not exclude paralog specificity at some sites, but indicate broadly overlapping in vivo RNA binding for ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 reflecting their high homology.</p><p>Secondary enriched motifs revealed additional properties of ZFP36/L1 target sites. The second top motif resembled the known recognition sequence for polyadenylation factor CFI(m)25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Venkataraman et al., 2005</xref>). Accordingly, ZFP36 binding in 3’UTRs was most concentrated in the vicinity of expected polyA sites,~50 nucleotides before transcript ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Analysis of CDS-specific binding revealed the AU-rich ZFP36 motif, along with strong enrichment of the 5’ splice site (5’-ss) consensus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Cross-link-induced truncations (CITS) clarified that CDS peaks are centered within coding exons, but supporting CLIP reads often spanned the exon-intron boundary. Thus, at least a subset of CDS binding by ZFP36 occurs prior to pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ZFP36 represses target mRNA abundance and translation during T-cell activation</title><p>We next employed RNA profiling strategies to determine the functional effects of ZFP36/L1 binding. RNAseq analysis in WT and <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO CD4 +T cells activated under conditions identical to our HITS-CLIP analyses uncovered two main effects. First, a small number of mRNAs that were silent in WT cells, including numerous immunoglobulin loci, were detected at low to moderate levels in KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). These mRNAs lacked evidence of ZFP36/L1 binding, both in HITS-CLIP data and direct motifs searches, suggesting they are not direct targets. Given established chromatin regulation of many of these loci (i.e. Ig genes) and the on-off nature of the changes, dysregulated transcriptional silencing is a potential explanation, but is likely to be a secondary effect of ZFP36 loss of function. The second main effect emerged from a global analysis, which showed ZFP36 binding in 3’UTR (p=4.44×10<sup>−16</sup>; Kolmogorov-Smirnoff [KS]) and CDS (p=5.33×10<sup>−11</sup>) correlated to subtle but highly significant shifts toward greater mRNA abundance in <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO cells, relative to mRNAs with no binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This correlation was not observed for mRNAs with binding exclusively in introns, and we did not find evidence in these data that ZFP36/L1 binding correlated with altered usage of proximal splice or polyA sites (not shown). The same pattern was also observed when considering a more stringently defined of sites set overlapping statistically robust CITS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>The overall trend in transcriptome profiling is consistent with evidence that ZFP36 represses RNA abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lykke-Andersen and Wagner, 2005</xref>). However, stratification of sites by the magnitude of ZFP36 CLIP binding allowed resolution of potentially complex effects. For 3’UTR binding, ZFP36 targets overall showed a significant shift in abundance, but mRNAs containing the top 20% most robust sites (ranked by peak height [PH], see Materials and methods) showed no significant effect. Thus, a higher degree of binding correlated with less effect on RNA abundance in the absence of ZFP36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). This trend was not observed for CDS sites, where the top 20% showed a similar shift to sites overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Thus, our analyses show a trend of negative regulation of RNA abundance in this context, but with blunted effects for highly robust binding sites in 3’UTR (see Discussion).</p><p>We next examined in more detail the effects of ZFP36 regulation for HITS-CLIP targets with highly robust 3’UTR binding in T cells. Activation marker CD69, apoptosis regulator BCL2, and effector cytokines TNF and IFNG showed significantly increased protein levels in <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO versus WT T cells 4 hr after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of these, only <italic>Bcl2</italic> showed increased mRNA abundance. <italic>Tnf, Ifng</italic>, and <italic>Cd69</italic> were all among the top 20% of targets as defined by CLIP binding magnitude (PH), thus supporting the trend in our global analyses that some highly robust binding targets show little regulation at the level of mRNA abundance in this context. The effects on protein level in the absence of changes in mRNA abundance suggested regulation of translation. We tested this principle by constructing GFP fluorescent reporters with an intact 3’UTRs (WT-UTR), or variants with the CLIP-defined ZFP36 binding site deleted (Δ-UTR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), for <italic>Cd69, Tnf, and Ifng</italic>. In 293 cells, ZFP36 strongly repressed protein expression for all three WT-UTR reporters, while showing weaker (<italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Ifng</italic>) or no (<italic>Cd69)</italic> repression of mRNA levels. Of note, the Δ-UTR constructs showed increased protein levels both in the presence and absence of ZFP36. This indicates that additional, endogenous factors are regulating these AU-rich sites in 293 cells, though Western analyses confirmed that ZFP36 paralogs are undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, ZFP36 over-expression exerted ~2 fold repression of Δ-UTR constructs, which may indicate incomplete ablation of binding or secondary effects of ZFP36 over-expression. However, repression of WT-UTR constructs was consistently greater than for Δ-UTR variants, demonstrating specific ZFP36 repression of the defined binding sites. In summary, these heterologous assays independently confirmed ZFP36 regulation of CLIP-defined targets, and support specific effects of translation, in addition to RNA stability.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33057.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ZFP36 regulates target protein levels in T cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Levels of mRNA and protein in <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO and WT T cells and ZFP36 CLIP tracks measured 4 hr post-activation for targets with robust 3’UTR ZFP36 binding.

This analysis confirmed differential, T cell-intrinsic expression of these receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). However, re-mixing WT and KO cells ex vivo neutralized these differences, indicating they are driven by secreted factors.

These results indicate that Th1 cytokines, including but not only IFN-γ, can drive an exhaustion-like phenotype.

However, the presence of its mRNA further suggests post-transcriptional control of ZFP36 paralog expression, and is consistent with functions in other contexts or stages of T cell function ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vogel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodson et al., 2010</xref>]).</p><p>Definitive determination of ZFP36 targets in T cells by HITS-CLIP, coupled with transcriptome and ribosome profiling studies, revealed that ZFP36 attenuates T-cell activation by suppressing the abundance and translation of its mRNA targets. The correlation of ZFP36 binding with reduced mRNA abundance is consistent with reports that ZFP36 can destabilize target mRNAs by recruiting degradation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fabian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lykke-Andersen and Wagner, 2005</xref>). However, our ability to stratify the relative magnitude of ZFP36 binding using CLIP resolved a more complex trend, with highly robust 3’UTR binding sites (top 20%) showing no detectable correlation with RNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). This non-uniform trend was observed for 3’UTR but not CDS targets, and affected mRNA abundance but not ribosome association. Importantly, effects on protein levels in the absence of changes in mRNA abundance were confirmed independently for robust 3’UTR binding targets <italic>Tnf</italic>, <italic>Ifng</italic>, and <italic>Cd69</italic>. It is possible that different degrees of ZFP36 association in vivo elicit distinct functional outcomes, through differential RNP localization or downstream effector recruitment. Notably, ZPF36 CLIP showed a broad MW range of ZFP36-RNA complexes with distinct biochemical properties including stability to heat, detergent, and high salt. While the current studies did not uncover distinct mRNA targets across this range, more detailed biochemical studies will be necessary to clarify potentially distinct ZFP36 complexes in vivo, and their potentially distinct roles in different cell types of the immune system.</p><p>We further present evidence that ZFP36 suppresses translation of its target mRNAs in T cells. Endogenous targets and exogenous reporters showed greater ZFP36-dependent suppression of protein versus RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and ribosome profiling in primary T cells confirmed direct effects on translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tao and Gao, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qi et al., 2012</xref>). The strongest effects were linked to a novel class of AREs in coding sequence, uncovered with ZFP36 binding maps. CDS sites correlated with repressed RNA abundance and translation, but a greater level of repression was evident in ribosome association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). Intriguingly, some ZFP36 CLIP reads in CDS sites spanned exon-intron boundaries, indicating these associations can form prior to pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). The identification of AREs in the CDS and the possibility of resulting translation control pre-programmed in the nucleus point to novel, unexplored regulatory strategies. Notably, these results differ significantly from iCLIP analyses in macrophages using exogenous GFP-tagged ZFP36, where only 3’-UTR sites correlated with target repression, and only for a ZFP36 construct with mutated MK2 phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tiedje et al., 2016</xref>). In those studies, the WT ZFP36 construct showed negligible repressive effects, contrasting with our data in 293 and T cells, and data from other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tao and Gao, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ogilvie et al., 2009</xref>). However, iCLIP data for the transduced WT ZFP36 showed low 3’UTR binding (23%), high intergenic binding (38%), and a preference for GU-rich motifs, diverging sharply from our analysis of endogenous ZFP36 and prior in vivo and in vitro characterizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brewer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Worthington et al., 2002</xref>). These differences may reflect distinct ZFP36 phosphorylation, and hence regulatory outcomes, or as yet undefined variables related to the different cellular context. A direct comparison is further confounded by the use of exogenous, transduced constructs in macrophage experiments, in contrast to our analysis of endogenous proteins in T cells. Importantly, the methods and reagents developed here allow for systematic analysis of endogenous ZFP36 proteins in future global and cell-type-specific investigations addressing these issues.</p><p>The similarity of RNA-binding maps covering both ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 (WT cells) or ZFP36L1 alone (<italic>Zfp36</italic> KO cells) supports redundancy of ZFP36 paralogs, a likely source of robustness in immune regulation. <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO cells are thus likely a partial loss-of-function due to robust ZFP36L1 expression, a notion consistent with the relatively subtle regulatory effects on RNA abundance and translation. Phenotypically, loss of <italic>Zfp36</italic> led to accelerated activation of mature T cells, but not uncontrolled proliferation or impaired development, which may again may reflect a partial loss of pan ZFP36 activity. Indeed, a prior study reported no effects when <italic>Zfp36l1</italic> was deleted in T cells, but drastic dysregulation of thymocyte proliferation upon loss of both <italic>Zfp36l1 and Zfp36l2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodson et al., 2010</xref>). These studies indicate total paralog dosage is critical, but also suggest the importance of the specific balance of ZFP36 paralogs in a defined context. Improved cell profiling methods, such as cell-type-specific tagging of RBPs, may illuminate these complexities in future studies.</p><p>The mRNA targets defined by ZFP36 HITS-CLIP span from surface molecules engaged in the earliest steps in T-cell activation to downstream signaling and transcriptional effectors. Targets were strongly enriched for regulation of proliferation and apoptosis, extending prior reports that the ZPF36 family regulates proliferation in early T- and B-cell development and cancer. In each case, the reported mechanism was distinct, spanning regulation of Notch, G1/S phase transition, and Myc, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galloway et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rounbehler et al., 2012</xref>). ZFP36 HITS-CLIP identified all of these target pathways in T cells, consistent with a central function in controlling cell proliferation. However, the phenotype of <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO T cells is novel and distinct, leading not to uncontrolled proliferation, but to accelerated effector response and resolution. The global effects of ZFP36 repression on RNA abundance and translation were widespread but subtle, and spanned many layers of T cell function. Functional validation of novel ZFP36 targets, including T-cell activation marker <italic>Cd69</italic> and apoptosis regulator <italic>Bcl2</italic>, suggest factors that likely contribute to this regulation. Analyses with cells sorted from mixed BM chimeras showed that the enhanced activation in <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO cells is T cell-intrinsic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Experiments in which these sorted cells were re-mixed ex vivo exhibited blunted differences, as compared to cells cultured separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These results indicate a role for both intracellular and secreted factors in exerting ZFP36 regulatory effects. More broadly, the combined picture of our genomic and functional data are one of many functionally diverse targets contributing to a multifaceted, finely tuned response, which is a hallmark of post-transcriptional regulatory control.</p><p>Analyses at later time points after activation in Th1 conditions revealed widespread dysregulation of <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO cells, with a gene expression signature and surface phenotype resembling T cell exhaustion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crawford et al., 2014</xref>]). Notably, and in contrast to analyses early post-activation, changes in RNA abundance 3 days post-activation were not correlated to direct ZFP36 binding. Therefore, secondary effects of ZFP36 loss pre-dominate as T cell expansion and differentiation progress in these settings. Notably, altered expression of co-inhibitory and –stimulatory receptors in <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO cells was specific to Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), and mixing experiments confirmed dependence on secreted factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, a dysregulated Th1 secretion profile including but not limited to elevated IFN-γ can push T cells to a state resembling exhaustion in vitro. More broadly, these results highlight the crucial point that subtle, but direct, regulation of a broad range of targets early after T-cell activation by ZFP36 can have striking downstream consequences in a rapidly expanding cell population.</p><p>In vivo studies of acute viral infection showed accelerated expansion and recession of virus-specific CD4 + and CD8+T cells in <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO animals. <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO T cells had higher levels TNF-α and IFN-γ protein expression than WT after peptide stimulation, and more ‘bi-functional’ TNF-α/IFN-γ co-producing cells, thought to be important for anti-viral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crawford et al., 2014</xref>). More rapid T cell expansion coincided with lower accumulated viral titers (or more rapid clearance) in <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO animals, indicating ZFP36 regulates anti-viral immunity. In mixed BM chimeras, the response kinetics of WT and <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO T cells to LCMV infection were indistinguishable. This result raises the possibility that other cell types and pathways, such as antigen presenting cells, antibody response, or innate immune regulators, could contribute to the accelerated anti-viral T cell response in <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO mice. It is noteworthy that the point of maximum T cell expansion in these chimeras was intermediate to that of <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO and WT mice. This result resembles our previous observation that WT and <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO cells sorted from BM chimeras show blunted differences in activation kinetics when re-mixed ex vivo, as compared to cells cultured separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO and WT cells exhibit cross-regulatory effects in a mixed environment that may obscure or complement cell-intrinsic differences. Given that many prominent ZFP36 targets encode secreted factors, such cross-regulatory effects are a virtual certainty.</p><p>Collectively, these in vivo studies demonstrate an accelerated T cell response to viral infection in the absence of ZFP36, which may reflect the heightened activity of multiple cell types in addition to T cells. Regardless of the initiating mechanism, the observation of enhanced LCMV clearance is likely T cell-dependent, given the central role of T cells in LCMV immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matloubian et al., 1994</xref>). Accordingly, we observed a quantitative, negative correlation between viral load and antigen-specific T cell levels in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Importantly, the enhanced anti-viral response in the chronic absence of ZFP36 in KO mice is accompanied by spontaneous inflammation and autoimmunity that worsen with age. Our results starkly illustrate the delicate balance of protective immunity against destructive inflammation, and reveal post-transcriptional regulation by RBPs as central to this trade-off.</p><p>Starting from transcriptome-wide RNA binding maps in T cells, we uncovered a crucial function for ZFP36 proteins in regulating adaptive immunity. These data suggest carefully titrated inhibition of ZFP36 might serve as a pharmacologic strategy in contexts where accelerated T cell response to challenge is desirable. Our in vivo LCMV studies demonstrate acute viral infection as one context, but application to other intracellular pathogens warrants investigation. Moreover, the ability to activate T cells to target tumor antigens and the clinical utility of checkpoint inhibitors raise the possibility of exploring ZFP36 inhibition to enhance tumor immunity. ZPF36 HITS-CLIP identified many targets central to these strategies, including <italic>Cd274</italic> (PD-L1), <italic>Pdcd1l2</italic> (PD-L2), <italic>Icos</italic>, <italic>Cd27</italic>, <italic>Cd28, Ctla-4</italic>, <italic>Btla,</italic> and <italic>Lag3</italic>, suggesting a means for concerted regulation. The autoimmune phenotype of the <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO mouse highlights an important caveat, common to parallel issues seen with clinical use of checkpoint inhibitors. The tools for cell-type-specific analysis of ZFP36, its targets, and its inhibition now exist to investigate and refine this balance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Zfp36</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>Entrez ID: 22695</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Zfp36l1</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>Entrez ID: 12192</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Zfp36l2</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>Entrez ID: 12193</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>M. musculus</italic>), <break/>strain background <break/>(<italic>C57BL6/J</italic>)</td><td>C57BL6/J</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Stock No: 000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>M. musculus</italic>), <break/>strain background <break/>(<italic>C57BL6/J</italic>)</td><td>ZFP36 KO</td><td>PMID:8630730</td><td/><td>gift from P.

In most cases, one mouse was one biological replicate. For CLIP studies 2–4 littermate mice of the same sex and genotype were pooled for each biological replicate. When performed, technical replicates deriving from the same biological replicate were averaged. For ex vivo studies, including genomic analyses, a sample size of 3–5 biological replicates was judged sufficient based on a power analysis using values from pilot studies, requiring p&lt;0.05 with 95% power. To account for greater variability, sample sizes were doubled for in vivo studies.

Pilot experiments confirmed that fixed DCs provide co-stimulatory signals to T cells and induce ZFP36 expression, though at approximately 2-fold lower efficiency than live DCs (not shown). Thus, a 15:1 T cell:DC ratio was used with fixed DCs. RT-qPCR measurements confirmed that fixation quenched recovery of DC RNA by ~100 fold (not shown), ensuring selective recovery of T cell RNA.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Douglas Black, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Moore et al. examine the role of the ZFP36 proteins in T cell activation and immune function. This family of proteins, including <italic>Zfp36</italic> (also known as TTP), <italic>Zfp36L1</italic>, and <italic>Zfp36L2</italic>, are well known mediators of mRNA instability through binding to AU-rich elements (ARE). Immune cytokines such as TNF and IFNg are among their targets. The phenotype of <italic>Zfp36</italic> loss in mice has mainly been studied in myeloid cells but it is expected that these proteins play broader roles in immune cell function. Here the authors show that the <italic>Zfp36</italic> and <italic>Zfp36L1</italic> proteins are strongly induced by T cell activation. Using an antibody cross-reactive with all the paralogs, they perform CLIP to identify a large set of RNA binding sites across the transcriptome. They compare the binding sites of both proteins identified in WT mice with those of presumably <italic>Zfp36L1</italic> alone in <italic>Zfp36</italic> KO mice. These datasets show broad overlap, yield essentially identical binding motifs with the expected ARE, and thus the two proteins apparently bind largely the same target RNAs. The authors show that transcripts containing CLIP peaks in their 3'UTR or CDS exhibit increased expression in the KO mice, as expected if the proteins mediate translational repression or targeted mRNA decay. Several transcripts exhibiting substantial binding of <italic>Zfp36</italic> in the 3'UTR, including <italic>Cd69</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic>, show minimal change in RNA levels in the KO but a significant increase in protein, implying an effect on translation. This is recapitulated in a reporter assay using the IFNg 3'UTR. RNA expression from the reporter does go down in response to co-expressed <italic>Zfp36</italic>, but the protein product shows a larger effect. They performed ribosome profiling in WT and KO mice and correlate this with RNAseq to determine translational efficiencies. They find that transcripts with <italic>Zfp36</italic> binding in the 3'UTR and more strongly with binding in the CDS exhibit increased ribosome association and translational efficiency in the KO cells. The <italic>Zfp36</italic> target set includes mRNAs for many types of proteins but is enriched for transcripts affecting cellular processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, T cell activation and others. Comparing WT and KO T cells, the authors show that the loss of <italic>Zfp36</italic> leads to reduced apoptosis and increased proliferation after stimulation. Using a transgenic carrying a β-Gal specific TCR, they show that these results hold true for true T cell activation by antigen, with the activated KO cells showing enhanced CD69 and CD25 induction. Thus, the loss of <italic>Zfp36</italic> leads to enhanced T cell activation. Generating mixed WT and KO bone marrow chimeras, they show that sorted KO cells still exhibit enhanced proliferation, but if the sorted cells are mixed back with WT this effect was reduced. It thus appears that the enhanced T cell activation is autonomous to the mutant cells but can be affected by autocrine factors if WT cells are present. Repeating some of their analyses at 3 days post stimulation rather than 4 hours, they found larger numbers and magnitudes of expression changes in the KO cells. These were not correlated with <italic>Zfp36</italic> binding, indicating they were indirect downstream effects, and overlapped with known signatures of T cell exhaustion. Looking specifically at proteins associated with exhaustion PD-1, ICOS, and LAG-3, they confirmed their increased expression and found them to be dependent on Th1 cytokines. Finally, they challenged the WT and KO mice with LCMV infection. They found that the KO mice mounted a more rapid response to virus, with increased CD4 and CD8 positive cells in both blood and spleen, increased IFN and TNF production, and decreased LCMV genomic RNA in the spleen early after infection.</p><p>There is a lot of data here and all the reviewers found the genomewide RNA binding and translation analyses for these proteins to be well done and useful. Although post-transcriptional control of cytokine production has been studied for many years, there is much to be learned regarding both its mechanisms and biology. The observation that <italic>Zfp36</italic> may be altering translation as well as mRNA decay is novel, but its underlying mechanism is not pursued. How the <italic>Zfp36</italic> regulatory program fits into the context of acquired immunity is also not understood, and in showing that <italic>Zfp36</italic> provides a brake on T cell responses, this study adds potential new understanding in this area. However, the loss of <italic>Zfp36</italic> alone, without the <italic>Zfp36L1</italic> KO, yielded often small or subtle effects. Without some assessment of the consequences of depleting both proteins, additional characterization is needed to solidify the conclusions related to the role of these proteins in T cell biology.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) LCMV infection should be performed in mixed chimeras to determine whether the degree to which the observed effects on the kinetics of the T cell response are cell intrinsic.</p><p>2) One important unaddressed issue is the mechanism driving the increase in ZNF36 expression upon CD4<sup>+</sup> activation. In the absence of a careful analysis of this, the authors should at least discuss what the RNA-Seq, HITS-CLIP and ribosome profiling suggests.</p><p>3) The authors make the assumption that the heterogeneity in Figure 1A and other western blots of ZNF36 is due to differential phosphorylation. However, the blots of individual paralogs in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 suggest that these proteins run as discrete bands. It would be interesting to see the gel in Figure 1A blotted with the paralog-specific antibodies to determine if the multiple species are a result of the distinct isoforms. This is of interest as the detection of the individual species changes over time (faster migrating species dominates in the first 1-2 hours, followed by the slower migrating species).</p><p>4) Figure 1H and many of the protein blots in Figure 2 show statistically significant differences, but are these really biologically meaningful? It seems particularly unclear that the 10% difference in IFN-γ protein in Figure 2A could give rise to the large differences in IFN-γ secretion in Figures 6 and 7. Is the latter perhaps due to an indirect effect of increased Th1 polarization? (see point 7),</p><p>5) The proposed role of ZNF36 in repressing translation is not well supported. The results of the reporter assay in Figures 2B and C are striking, but the effect on protein is much greater than observed in the endogenous gene (Figure 2A). This may not be due to binding of ZNF36 to the UTR since mutation of the binding site has an effect even in the absence of ZNF36. (Alternatively, 293 cells may express ZNF36 – a western blot should be done.) Or is this due to some other feature of the IFN-γ UTR? What is the result if the TNF or CD69 3' UTR is used? Since these endogenous genes seem to show a larger response, they may give more robust results with the reporter assay.</p><p>6) A second concern with the translation conclusion is it is unclear in Figure 3C why &quot;intron bound&quot; is used as the negative control rather than &quot;none&quot;. Transcripts that are enriched for binding in the intron may well produce mRNAs whose expression or function differs between WT and KO, confounding the interpretation of the translation differences between conditions (if that is what the GSEA score reveals – this is unclear).</p><p>7) The authors should show what percentage of cells in the in vitro activation in Figures 1 and 6 are actually polarized to a Th1 fate. Typically only a subset of the cells actually achieve the desired fate under such in vitro conditions. Given that T cells in the ZNF36 KO mice appear predisposed to a Th1 fate, it is important to assess whether the differences observed in Figure 6 are a direct effect of ZNF36 or simply reflect that a greater percentage of cells in the activation culture are Th1 cells.</p><p>8) It would be much better to use FoxP3 instead of CD25 to identify Tregs (e.g. in Figure 7—figure supplement 1F).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33057.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) LCMV infection should be performed in mixed chimeras to determine whether the degree to which the observed effects on the kinetics of the T cell response are cell intrinsic.</p></disp-quote><p>These analyses were done for this revision, and appear in Figure 7—figure supplement 3.

In the absence of a careful analysis of this, the authors should at least discuss what the RNA-Seq, HITS-CLIP and ribosome profiling suggests.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional data from analyses of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell RNAseq data that address this point. Quoting from the revised Results:</p><p>“The characterization of <italic>Zfp36</italic> as an immediate early response gene in various cell types established transcription as a mechanism of its activation-induced expression (Lai et al., 1995). […] These observations indicate that post-transcriptional mechanisms regulate expression of ZFP36 paralogs in T cells.”</p><p>And quoting from the revised Discussion:</p><p>“ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 expression are rapidly induced upon T cell activation, and gradually recede thereafter. [...] However, the presence of its mRNA further suggests post-transcriptional control of ZFP36 paralog expression, and is consistent with functions in other contexts or stages of T cell function ((Vogel et al., 2016; Hodson et al., 2010)).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors make the assumption that the heterogeneity in Figure 1A and other western blots of ZNF36 is due to differential phosphorylation. However, the blots of individual paralogs in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 suggest that these proteins run as discrete bands. It would be interesting to see the gel in Figure 1A blotted with the paralog-specific antibodies to determine if the multiple species are a result of the distinct isoforms. This is of interest as the detection of the individual species changes over time (faster migrating species dominates in the first 1-2 hours, followed by the slower migrating species).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ interpretation – the signal in Figure 1A reflects detection of two paralogs – ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 – and the balance may be shifting over time. In addition, the observed bands running well above the expected MW of ZFP36 (36 kD) are strongly consistent with previously described, hyperphosphorylated species. We have clarified and expanded our thoughts on this heterogeneity in the Results (subsection “ZFP36 dynamics during T cell activation”, second paragraph).</p><p>Regarding a deeper analysis of the dynamics of individual paralogs, we can offer further insights for the reviewers’ benefit. At the time of analysis, the blot in Figure 1A was stripped and re-probed with the ZFP36L1-specific antibody (this antibody also reacts with the significantly larger ZFP36L2, but none was detected).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33057.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33057-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Please note the diminished quality is due to the harsh conditions that were necessary for complete stripping, which was confirmed by re-probing with secondary antibody. Nonetheless, the pattern here is clearly similar to that of the pan-ZFP36 antisera, with the higher band dominating initially, and the lower band increasing over time. As in plots with pan ZFP36 sera, the higher band in these blots runs significantly above the expected MW of ZFP36/L1 (~36 kD). Since only a single paralog is represented in the re-probed blot, we interpret the higher band as hyperphosphorylated, based on its consistency with numerous prior descriptions of ZFP36 paralog phosphorylation (Ross et al., 2015; Qiu et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2006).</p><p>As the reviewers note, a ‘higher’ band is the only one detected in blots with the ZFP36-specific antibody 4 hours after activation in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D. A working ZFP36-specific antibody was not identified until a year after these time courses were done, after screening many commercial products. This antibody gave a relatively low signal, even at high titers, compared to the pan-ZFP36 and ZFP36L1/2 antibodies. While sufficient to confirm loss of ZFP36 in KO cells in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D, this antibody is not suitable for a conclusive probe of paralog isoform kinetics. However, given the high homology between ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 and their similar predicted size, it is very likely the band in question (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, ZFP36 panel) is hyperphosphorylated ZFP36, and that hypophosphorylated ZFP36 is below detection.</p><p>It is further worth noting that published RNA expression data that showed similar expression dynamics for ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 after T cell activation (for instance, the time course data from Yosef et al., 2013 – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33057.029</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33057-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>Taken together, existing evidence suggests ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 show similar patterns of expression after T cell activation. We have not included these details in the revised manuscript, because we are not aware of the necessary reagents for a full analysis and, more importantly, we lack evidence of distinct paralog functions in this context. As stated in the manuscript (Results subsection “Transcriptome-wide identification of ZFP36 target RNAs in CD4+ T cells”, third paragraph), future studies may tease out differences in paralog function, but our data suggest are large degree of redundancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1H and many of the protein blots in Figure 2 show statistically significant differences, but are these really biologically meaningful? It seems particularly unclear that the 10% difference in IFN-γ protein in Figure 2A could give rise to the large differences in IFN-γ secretion in Figures 6 and 7. Is the latter perhaps due to an indirect effect of increased Th1 polarization? (see point 7).</p></disp-quote><p>The first critical point to consider is that all of the genomic and functional analyses begin with purified, naïve T cells, and we have shown that naïve ZFP36 KO and WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiate similarly to Th1, Th17, and Treg lineages (Figure 7—figure supplement 1G, I). Therefore, the observed differences in protein levels and ribosome profiling cannot be attributed to differential Th1 skewing, and we have no evidence that loss of ZFP36 intrinsically disposes naïve T cells to a specific fate, Th1 or otherwise.</p><p>There may be understandable confusion caused by the data in Figure 7—figure supplement 1H, which shows that splenocytes stimulated directly ex vivo with PMA/ionomycin (no skewing) contain more IFNG-producing T cells in ZFP36 KO versus WT, although only marginally for CD4<sup>+</sup> cells. This data was included as part of a descriptive analysis of the in vivo T-cell compartment of ZFP36 KO mice. The splenic cells producing high levels of IFNG directly ex vivo are effector and/or memory cells, and are not the population analyzed in our other experiments. This result does indicate that Th1 effector cells are more abundant in ZFP36 KO versus WT animals at the age analyzed (6 weeks). However, this accumulation probably occurs over time, and we cannot conclude it is T cell-intrinsic. Again, when naïve T cells are sorted, and analyses are conducted in a short time window, there is no detectable difference in the ability of WT and KO cells to form Th1 cells.</p><p>The second key point to consider is that genomic and functional analyses were done at an early time point (4 hours) well before full skewing has occurred. At this point, as expected and as the reviewers note, IFNG protein expression is quite low. Full differentiation to naïve cells to Th1 cells under these conditions, with high levels of IFNG expression, takes 48-72 hours. Nonetheless, analysis of this early time point was crucial because it represents peak ZFP36 expression (Figure 1) and because we have observed that likely secondary effects pre-dominate later on (Figure 6). These analyses were designed to most effectively observe the regulatory effects of ZFP36, not the maximum biological impact of any specific target, including IFNG. That said, we agree the mentioned 10% difference does not fully account for the larger ones observed in secreted levels of IFNG in Figure 6. Crucially, the latter experiment measured secreted IFNG accumulated in culture supernatants over 3 days that are also impacted by the greater expansion of ZFP36 KO cells under these conditions, due to more rapid activation (see Results subsection “Downstream effects of ZFP36 regulation”). The compounding effect of small differences over time, combined with greater cell numbers, can readily account for the larger differences at the later time point.</p><p>Overall, these points highlight two critical themes – 1) that small effects at early time points can have a large impact in a rapidly changing and expanding cell population, such as differentiating T cells; and 2) that subtle effects on many targets, rather than large effects on individual ones, are the norm rather than the exception in post-transcriptional control. We have inserted comments in the Discussion (seventh paragraph) to make these points more effectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The proposed role of ZNF36 in repressing translation is not well supported. The results of the reporter assay in Figures 2B and C are striking, but the effect on protein is much greater than observed in the endogenous gene (Figure 2A). This may not be due to binding of ZNF36 to the UTR since mutation of the binding site has an effect even in the absence of ZNF36. (Alternatively, 293 cells may express ZNF36 – a western blot should be done.) Or is this due to some other feature of the IFN-γ UTR? What is the result if the TNF or CD69 3' UTR is used? Since these endogenous genes seem to show a larger response, they may give more robust results with the reporter assay.</p></disp-quote><p>For this revision we have generated and tested new reporters based on TNF and CD69 3’UTRs, which show results very similar to the IFNG reporter (Figure 2C). The key result from these assays is that effects on protein output are significantly greater than on RNA levels, which supports the principle of translation regulation by ZFP36. Indeed the CD69 and TNF reporters show a more pronounced effect than IFNG in this regard.</p><p>As noted by the reviewers, deleting the ZFP36 binding site had an effect on GFP protein expression both in the presence and absence of transfected ZFP36. This was also observed with the TNF and CD69 reporters, indicating it is not a unique feature of the IFNG 3’UTR. Western blots in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A rule out the endogenous expression of ZFP36 in 293 cells as a confounding factor. Rather, this effect probably reflects the activity of other ARE regulatory factors in 293 cells. Nonetheless, ZFP36-dependent effects on reporter expression are clear – we have added additional labels with fold-changes to Figure 2C and re-worked the revised results to aid interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) A second concern with the translation conclusion is it is unclear in Figure 3C why &quot;intron bound&quot; is used as the negative control rather than &quot;none&quot;. Transcripts that are enriched for binding in the intron may well produce mRNAs whose expression or function differs between WT and KO, confounding the interpretation of the translation differences between conditions (if that is what the GSEA score reveals – this is unclear).</p></disp-quote><p>This is the comparison that was done, and we have clarified this point with a more detailed explanation in the revised Results (subsection “ZFP36 represses target mRNA abundance and translation during T cell activation”, last paragraph). The GSEA score is determined by ranking all observed transcripts by the metric of interest (in this case, translational efficiency), and examining the distribution of a designated subset (in this case, ZFP36 CLIP targets) in the whole set. The requested comparison (“target” vs. “none”) is built into this design, and is the basis of the reported p-values. We included the “intron bound” set as an example of a rationally defined subset that did not show such an enrichment. This supports the specific function of CDS and 3’UTR sites in regulating translation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors should show what percentage of cells in the in vitro activation in Figures 1 and 6 are actually polarized to a Th1 fate. Typically only a subset of the cells actually achieve the desired fate under such in vitro conditions. Given that T cells in the ZNF36 KO mice appear predisposed to a Th1 fate, it is important to assess whether the differences observed in Figure 6 are a direct effect of ZNF36 or simply reflect that a greater percentage of cells in the activation culture are Th1 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed above with point 4).

We did not examine FoxP3 expression in splenic T cells directly ex vivo, but feel that a major difference in Treg presence in vivo would have been apparent in the enumeration of CD25-hi CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, which is a widely used correlate.
