aging is crucial towards understanding the underlying mechanisms. Here, using novel culturing and computational methods as well as latest analytical techniques, we mapped the proteome and transcriptome during the replicative lifespan of budding yeast. With age, we found primarily proteins involved in protein biogenesis to increase relative to their transcript levels. Exploiting the dynamic nature of our data, we reconstructed high-level directional networks, where we found the same protein biogenesis-related genes to have the strongest ability to predict the behavior of other genes in the system. We identified metabolic shifts and the loss of stoichiometry in protein complexes as being consequences of aging. We propose a model whereby the uncoupling of protein levels of biogenesis-related genes from their transcript levels is causal for the changes occurring in aging yeast. Our model explains why targeting protein synthesis, or repairing the downstream consequences, can serve as interventions in aging.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08527.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08527.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08527.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Aging is a complex process, and so many scientists use baker’s yeast as a simpler model to understand it. Although many genes that influence aging have been found, all the generated knowledge is still rather fragmented. It also remains difficult to disentangle cause and consequence. That is to say, sometimes a gene that looks like it might cause aging could simply be a gene that responds to an age related phenomenon. To unravel this puzzle of cause and effect, it is necessary to first get an idea on a system level of everything that changes as an organism ages.</p> <p>Now, Janssens, Meinema et al. have managed to map many of the molecular changes that occur as baker’s yeast ages; this is something that has yet to be achieved for any other organism. The work first involved developing a new way of growing baker’s yeast to keep and generate large cohorts of aging yeast cells in a constant environment. It also required the use of a mathematical ‘un-mixing’ tool to separate the data obtained from the aging cohort from the data from the young offspring that the yeast produce while they age.</p> <p>Janssens, Meinema et al. measured both the majority of the transcriptome and much of the proteome of baker’s yeast throughout its reproductive lifespan. The “transcriptome” refers to the collection of RNA molecules in the cell, which are produced whenever a gene is expressed. The “proteome” refers to all the proteins in the cell, which are translated from the RNA transcripts by the cell’s so-called “translational machinery”. These experiments revealed that this yeast’s proteome reflects its transcriptome less and less as it ages. In particular, this ‘uncoupling’ of the proteome from the transcriptome was seen most strongly for the proteins related to the cell’s translational machinery; these proteins accumulated with age relative to their transcripts.</p> <p>Janssens, Meinema et al. then conducted a computational network-based analysis of the data. This indicated that the uncoupling is the driving force behind the aging process. Many of the other molecular changes that occur with aging were predicted to be consequences of this uncoupling.</p> <p>These findings give a framework for many observations in the existing literature. However, it remains unclear why proteins related to translational machinery are overrepresented in aging yeast in the first place. This question should be explored in future work.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08527.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08527.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>replicative aging</kwd><kwd>proteome</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>853.00.110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bischoff</surname><given-names>Rainer</given-names></name><name><surname>Wit</surname><given-names>Ernst C</given-names></name><name><surname>Veenhoff</surname><given-names>Liesbeth M</given-names></name><name><surname>Heinemann</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comprehensive mapping of the proteome and transcriptome during the complete replicative lifespan of budding yeast predicted an increased abundance of the protein biogenesis machinery is most causal for aging.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging, the gradual decrease in function occurring at the molecular, cellular, and organismal level, is a main risk factor for cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Niccoli and Partridge, 2012</xref>). Understanding its driving force is the required step towards enabling interventions that might delay age-related disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">de Magalhães et al., 2012</xref>). While this remains an unsolved problem in biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Medawar, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mccormick and Kennedy, 2012</xref>), significant advances in the field have shown the process of aging to be malleable at both the genetic and environmental levels, indicating that it is possible for its causal elements to be dissected. The rate of aging, however, is influenced by diverse factors, including protein translation, protein quality control, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kennedy and Kaeberlein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Webb and Brunet, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lagouge and Larsson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barzilai et al., 2012</xref>). The multitude of factors involved indicates that aging is a complex and multifactorial process, where ultimately an integrated and systems-level approach might be necessary to untangle the causal forces.</p><p>Important insights into the complex process of aging originate from research on the unicellular eukaryote <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> which can produce 20–30 daughter cells before its death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mortimer and Johnston, 1959</xref>, and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wasko and Kaeberlein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denoth Lippuner et al., 2014</xref> for recent reviews). Significant contributions towards global mapping of the aging process have been demonstrated through transcriptome studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Egilmez et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lesur and Campbell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koc et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yiu et al., 2008</xref>) and genome-wide single-gene deletion lifespan measurements (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mccormick and Kennedy, 2012</xref>). However, a major task remains to comprehensively describe the molecular changes that accompany the aging process. As the exponential increase in daughter cells represents a major challenge in terms of generating sufficient numbers of aged cells, to date no comprehensive description of the changes on both the proteome and transcriptome level has been provided. Assuming that the molecular changes occurring along the replicative lifespan of yeast are, in part, responsible for its decreased viability that occurs over time, we reason that revealing the dynamic and interdependent changes that accompany this process would allow us to distinguish cause from consequence in aging.</p><p>Here, we developed a novel column-based cultivation method that allowed us to generate large numbers of advanced-age cells in a constant environment. Applying next-generation RNA sequencing and shotgun proteomics, we mapped the molecular phenotypes of aging yeast cells at 12 time points, well into advanced age where the majority of cells had died due to aging. Analysis of these dynamic and comprehensive datasets allowed us to identify a general uncoupling of protein levels from their corresponding messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. This uncoupling was most apparent in protein biogenesis-related proteins, which we found over-represented relative to their transcripts. Using computational network-based inference methods, we found that changes in these genes had the strongest ability to predict the behavior of other genes, thereby suggesting their causal role in replicatively aging yeast. On the basis of these analyses, we provide a systems-level model of aging unifying and integrating diverse observations made within the field.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Novel culture and computational methods to determine aged cell phenotypes</title><p>To obtain aged yeast cells, we bound streptavidin-conjugated iron beads to biotinylated cells (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smeal et al., 1996</xref>) from an exponentially growing culture. This starting cohort of mother cells was put into a column containing stainless steel mesh that was positioned within a magnetic field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The daughter cells do not inherit the iron beads, as the yeast cell wall remains with the mother during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smeal et al., 1996</xref>). By running a constant flow of medium through the column, we washed away the majority of emerging daughter cells. The flowing medium also provided fresh nutrients and oxygen and ensured constant culture conditions, as confirmed for pH, glucose, and oxygen levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). By maintaining multiple columns simultaneously, we could harvest cells from the same starting cohort at different time points and thus at different replicative ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Because we could retain up to 10<sup>9</sup> mother cells per column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), we could produce sufficient numbers of aged cells for performing parallel proteome and transcriptome analyses. Computer simulations showed that the age distribution broadened over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). The broadened age distribution results in a lower resolution making detecting the actual changes occurring at later time points more difficult, and we therefore harvested cells at exponentially increasing time intervals to maximize the differences between time points at later ages.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08527.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design for analysis of molecular changes during the replicative lifespan of yeast and its validation.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) Schematic overview of the column-based cultivation and data analysis pipeline with 16 parallel columns, where (zoom in) mother cells (M) containing streptavidin-bound (green triangles) iron beads (black circles) were captured on the magnetized column and aged under constant environmental conditions, while the daughter cells (D) were flushed away.

Avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (AvF) binding to the biotin-labeled cells distinguished the starting cohort of mother cells from daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Dead cells were identified using propidium iodide (PI), which fluoresces upon intercalating with the DNA of membrane-permeable dead cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). These two assays were used to determine the fractions of daughters, mothers, and dead cells in a population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>). From this data, we derived the viability of the mother cells over time, which we found to be in excellent agreement with the lifespan curve of yeast as observed in a microfluidic device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huberts et al., 2014)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Using the forward scatter of the flow cytometer as a rough proxy for cell size, we could qualitatively observe the cell size increase of live mothers that is known to occur in aging mother cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Egilmez et al., 1990</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similarly, using fluorophore-conjugated wheat-germ agglutinin, which labels bud scars that appear after every division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Powell et al., 2003</xref>), we observed an increase of bud scar staining on mother cells in the column, as also visualized by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These analyses confirmed known changes that characterize aging yeast: increased cell size and bud scars, and decreased population viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we developed a combined experimental and mathematical method to determine the molecular phenotype of aging mother cells without contributions from daughter or dead cells. The approach exploits the fact that a system of linear equations can be solved when the number of unknowns equals the number of independent equations. Specifically, while we could determine the number of mothers, daughters, and dead cells in a sample using flow cytometry, the contribution of each type of cells to the measured abundance of a particular protein or transcript was unknown. Therefore, by measuring protein and transcript abundances in three mixed samples with various proportions of mothers, daughters, and dead cells, we could mathematically un-mix the abundances. This resulted in un-mixed data for the aging mother cells. Experiments using samples containing mixed cell populations with known molecular phenotypes validated this mathematical un-mixing method for the RNA sequencing (RNAseq) transcriptome, targeted (selected reaction monitoring) proteome, and global (shotgun) proteome data with a &lt;16% average error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>To use this data un-mixing approach, we harvested three mixed samples for each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). One sample was collected from the column effluent (Mix 3, mainly daughter cells). Harvesting all cells from the column and applying a further enrichment step on a larger magnet produced the two other samples: one sample contained mainly aged mother cells (Mix 2, 80–99% mothers), while the other contained an intermediate composition compared to Mixes 2 and 3 (wash fraction, Mix 1). In each of these mixed-cell samples, we determined the fraction of mothers, daughters, and dead cells and generated the mixed-population proteomes and transcriptomes. Then, we mathematically un-mixed the proteomes and transcriptomes to obtain the molecular phenotype of aging mother cells. The data was corrected for sampling artefacts related to bead labeling and cell harvesting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>; supplemental notes 2 and 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) Samples generated at different steps during biotinylation, bead labeling, and harvesting were assessed for their similarity to a sample that has undergone all processing steps (sample D), as would the starting (bead labeled) sample of the experiment. Using targeted (SRM) proteomics focusing on 74 proteins known to be either strongly affected or not affected when comparing a processed to an unprocessed sample, we found that the presence of beads alone within a sample (sample G) was enough to match the starting bead-labeled sample (sample D). The process of bead labeling itself (sample ‘H’, where bead labeling conditions were mimicked) yielded proteomes that bore little resemblance to our bead-containing samples. (<bold><bold>B</bold></bold>) Cells and bead counts from flow cytometry. A cohort of 4.0×10<sup>8</sup> cells (pink bar, left) was labeled with beads, by adding a known number of beads (4.8 × 10<sup>8</sup> beads, pink bar , right ). The number of beads attached to a biotinylated cell population (1.2 × 10<sup>8</sup>) is the difference between free beads before (4.8 × 10<sup>8</sup> beads, pink bar, right) and after bead labeling (3.6 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells, gray bar, right). The number of cells with at least one bead was counted after bead labeling and cell enrichment on a magnet (after bead labeling, 1.2 × 10<sup>8</sup>, gray bar, left). The yield was on average 1.1 beads/cell. (<bold><bold>C</bold></bold>) The number of free beads and beads attached to the cells was determined for each sample with flow cytometry. The ratio of bead to cells increased maximally two fold in both replicates, most likely due to the detachment of cells from beads while being cultivated in the aging columns. (<bold><bold>D</bold></bold>) To study the effect of a small increase in bead concentration per sample we mixed unprocessed cells with different numbers of beads and performed targeted (selected reaction monitoring [SRM]) proteomics, using the same 74 proteins for assessment.

(<bold><bold>E</bold></bold>) Nonetheless, we found that varying the amount of beads in the sample in the range relevant to the aging experiment, did not alter the degree to which the sample was changed by the presence of the beads. The Pearson correlation of these samples to the standard (1.06 beads/cell) was higher than the correlation between two replicates of the standard.

Up to 16 columns could be run simultaneously (cartoon of red magnet with column) and harvested throughout the aging procedure (cartoon of lifespan curve, fraction surviving at each age). Time points were exponentially spaced, and covered by two partially overlapping replicate campaigns (R1 and R2, dots showing time points), of 14 and 8 time points, respectively. For each time point, either two or three samples were required for mathematical un-mixing of the population, that is, early time points (blue dots), contained mainly live mother and daughter cells, without mortality in the population, and therefore required only two samples for the mathematical un-mixing of two unknowns. While later time points (red dots), contained increasing levels of dead cells, and required three samples for the mathematical un-mixing of three unknowns. Replicate 1 consisted of an unprocessed sample, five time points requiring two samples for un-mixing, and 9 time points requiring three samples for un-mixing, totaling 38 samples. Replicate 2 had in the same way 23 samples, and together the two replicates consisted of 61 samples, which were processed with shotgun proteomics and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) transcriptomics. After ‘omics’ data was collected, a bead correction was applied to proteome data coming from samples containing beads (see methods), and quality assessment of sequencing data removed four sets of samples from the transcriptome (see methods). The subsequent 61 proteome samples and 50 transcriptome samples were used for mathematical un-mixing, which resulted in mother-specific data for the proteome (R1, 15 time points, and R2, 9 time points) and transcriptome (R1, 12 time points, R2, 8 time points). Corresponding daughter-specific data also resulted from the un-mixing procedure (not depicted in schematic).

Using another microfluidic platform and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Vph1 protein as a marker for the vacuole, it was found that the vacuole increased in size more rapidly than the cell itself, suggesting a net increase of Vph1 protein levels to occur in the aging cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2012</xref>]. Our data shows Vph1 levels to increase with aging, in line with these observations.

To compare the changes between the proteome and transcriptome, we determined the non-parametric Spearman rank correlation, and found a starting correlation of 0.75, a value in agreement with other single-study comparisons between yeast proteomes and transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Csárdi et al., 2015</xref>). When comparing this correlation in time, however, we found that it declined steadily with age, down to a correlation of 0.70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The decrease in correlation between the proteome and transcriptome means that they do not change synchronously.

In contrast, the expression of gene products in quadrants 2 (Q2) and 4 (Q4) were ‘uncoupled’, meaning that the changes in protein levels did not follow the changes in transcript levels. In Q2, the proteins were over-represented relative to their transcripts, that is, there were more proteins per transcript in older cells than in younger cells. Of all analyzed transcript–protein pairs, 38.4% were located in Q2, suggesting a global tendency towards relative protein overabundance with aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

However, our dynamically resolved, comprehensive data offered the possibility to suggest causal relationships.</p><p>To elucidate the causal order of changes during aging, we reconstructed a high-level directional network revealing the interdependences of changes in transcript expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, we defined each transcript’s expression profile as a network node, and an edge between each pair of nodes as a partial correlation between the nodes’ expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Next, we determined the directionality of the edges, indicated by arrows. We defined directionality to represent the ability of a transcript’s profile to predict the profile of another transcript. Concretely, when looking at two connected nodes, the node that could be explained by the connected node was considered as the responsive node, while the predicting node was considered to be the causal node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). This relation defined the directionality of the edge. Any transcript that had no predictive ability and could not be predicted by any other transcript was removed from the network analysis. Following this, the nodes were clustered by maximizing the global modularity of the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Csardi and Nepusz, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Finally, the clusters were ranked based on the ratio of causal (outward arrows) to responsive nodes (inward arrows) per cluster to determine the higher-level causal relations existing between clusters. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the optimal sparsity of the network and the cut-off for the partial correlation among transcript profiles, through which we established that the network was a robust representation of the datasets (supplemental note 4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table S7, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 6–source data 1</xref>).

The standardized partial variances are the variances once the effect of the related profiles has been removed by regression analysis. For each of the connected node pairs (e.g. ‘m’ and ‘n’), the direction goes from the profile with the highest standardized partial variance to the lowest. Basically, for a profile with a lower standardized partial variance, much of its variability is explained by the profiles connected to it, while for a profile with a high standardized partial variance, less of its variability is explained by the profiles associated to it. The latter profile has thus a higher ability to predict the first one than vice versa, and makes a profile with high standardized variance causal over a profile with a low standardized variance.

The most causal cluster of the proteome network was enriched for chaperone proteins, reflecting a cellular response to internally changing conditions. Such conditions could include metabolic restructuring in response to an increased cell size or to aggregating proteins that are accumulating due to altered protein complex stoichiometry. Furthermore, we found that the causal clusters of the proteome network tended to be expressed according to their transcriptional message (i.e. coupled expression; Q1, Q3), while the responsive clusters represented increasingly uncoupled expression (Q2, Q4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This both confirmed the response of the cell to the accumulating changes occurring during aging and indicated that the effects of uncoupled protein expression are progressive over time. We see the clear downstream consequences during aging emerging in the proteome, including metabolic shifts, stoichiometric loss, aggregating proteins, and protein overproduction. All of these point to pathways and processes that may become dysfunctional with aging, any of which may ultimately result in cell death.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using our newly developed culturing and computational methods and state-of-the-art proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we generated the first systems-level molecular phenotype of replicatively aging yeast. The comprehensiveness of the data allowed us to discover that protein biogenesis machinery genes, including ribosome, tRNA synthesis, and translation regulation genes, have their protein levels uncoupled from their mRNA levels during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the data allowed us to pinpoint the transcripts of these genes as having the strongest ability to predict the behavior of others transcripts during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Finally, we observed metabolic changes, protein stress responses, and changes in the stoichiometry of many protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>).</p><p>Based on these analyses, we propose a model whereby the uncoupling of protein levels of biogenesis-related genes from their transcript levels is causal for the changes occurring in aging yeast. The model proposes that proteins of the translation machinery that are uncoupled from transcript levels accumulate in cells with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As the biogenesis genes are themselves involved in translation, their uncoupling might contribute to further uncoupling of the proteome from the transcriptome as a whole. This general uncoupling has degenerative effects (i.e. cell size increase, protein aggregations and loss of stoichiometry in protein complexes), that stimulate transcriptional responses in the cell (i.e. metabolic changes and activated stress responses), which further contributes to changes in the proteome. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of other causes even further upstream, the uncoupling of the protein biogenesis machinery is likely an early driver of replicative aging in yeast.</p><p>A question remains as to why the biogenesis-related class of proteins we identified as having protein levels uncoupled from their transcript levels become over-represented in replicatively aging yeast in the first place. Ribosome footprinting has shown these proteins to be highly translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>), and protein turnover experiments have shown them to be highly stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belle et al., 2006</xref>); thus, it is possible that their overabundance may result from the combination of the dynamics of protein biogenesis, protein turnover, and mRNA stability. Interestingly, the ribosomal proteins themselves showed a low degree of loss of stoichiometry at the protein complex level in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), supporting the idea that they are still active and contributing to uncoupling in the cell. In any case, the uncoupling of protein and transcript levels has downstream consequences for the cell that may explain many phenotypes of aging. First, cell size may increase due to protein overproduction and result in metabolic changes. Second, proteins being overproduced at different rates will alter protein complex stoichiometry. Many documented phenotypes of aging may result from this, including the formation of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erjavec et al., 2007</xref>), increased reactive oxygen species formation by a dysfunctional mitochondrial transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laun et al., 2001</xref>), and loss of gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). The sum of these may ultimately lead to system failure for the organism.</p><p>Directly targeting certain failing protein complexes or downstream deleterious effects results in replicative lifespan extension, but we suggest that many of these effects will prove to be cell type- and growth condition-specific. Our model predicts that a more robust extension of lifespan may be possible in many organisms by targeting the causal factor in aging, protein biogenesis. Indeed, altering the rates of protein production (i.e. translation) or degradation (i.e. autophagy) have repeatedly been shown to influence longevity across a wide range of organisms (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wasko and Kaeberlein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cuervo, 2008</xref>). The translation activators, target of rapamycin (TOR) and S6 kinase, fall into this category, and decreases in their activity result in increased lifespan in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fabrizio et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaeberlein et al., 2005</xref>), worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vellai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pan et al., 2007</xref>), flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kapahi et al., 2004</xref>), and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lamming et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Selman et al., 2009</xref>), as does calorie restriction and drugs such as rapamycin, which are also modulators of protein biogenesis pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, deletions in ribosomal subunit components have positive effects on lifespan in both yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steffen et al., 2008</xref>) and worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2007</xref>).

(ii) The gene product networks (i.e transcriptome or proteome) were generated, based on the gene profiles of the respective time course datasets, using the R package GeneNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schaefer et al., 2015</xref>). This included generating an undirected network by calculating the partial correlation among gene profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 4A</xref>). (iii) Following this, a directed network was generated from the undirected network, based on an assessment of a gene profile’s ability to predict another gene profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schaefer et al., 2015</xref>). (iv) The nodes in the network were clustered together, using the method in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">de Magalhães et al., 2012</xref>) using the R package igraph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Csárdi et al., 2015</xref>). The causal in/out connections among genes were calculated for all the network clusters and listed in a direction matrix (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref> Table S7). (v) A high-level directional network was generated, where the clusters were plotted in the order of their causal ranking by drawing the direction matrix as arrows between the clusters. (vi). A sensitivity analysis was made to determine the optimal sparsity of the networks and the cut-off for the partial correlation among gene profiles.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Hjalmar Permentier, and members of the Veenhoff, Chang, and Heinemann laboratories for constructive discussions.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior Editor), Karsten Weis (Reviewing Editor), and two reviewers.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>This manuscript describes a novel column-based mother enrichment method to map dynamic transcriptome and proteome changes during the yeast replicative aging process. The authors perform a careful computational analysis to separate the contribution from mother, daughter and dead cells at each time point, and they discover new molecular changes that have not been previously identified. In particular, they find a progressive decoupling of the proteome from the transcriptome for biogenesis genes during aging.</p> <p>There was a consensus amongst the reviewers that this work describes interesting and important observations and that this manuscript could be published in <italic>eLife</italic> upon appropriate revision. In particular, the reviewers felt that some of the key conclusions are overstated and need to be toned down, and that further experiments are needed to strengthen the results.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic>1) The authors contend that they have isolated late age mothers. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> they show a progressive decline in viability. How do they know that cells didn't die simply because they stayed longer in the column? They rely on additionanl criteria, but that data appears less convincing. Staining for bud scars provides the replicative age, and they track that with WGA intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, the difference is ~ 2-fold, from start to finish. Why doesn't the signal increase more? One would expect that by 72h most cells would have &gt;20 scars, while close to the start only ~2-3 scars. Likewise, cell size increases {less than or equal to} 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Others reported that the size increase is ~ 4-fold (DOI: 10.4161/cc.10.1.14455). Addressing these issues is important, for their thesis that properly aged cells have been isolated.</p> <p>2) They report a strong un-coordination between the transcriptome and the proteome, getting worse in later stages. They obtained data for 1494 proteins and 4904 mRNAs. Hence, they did not sample &gt;1/2 of the proteome. Still, sampling 1494 gene products represents a substantial dataset. My concerns have to do with their transcriptome/proteome comparisons. It has been argued that log2 comparisons (which is what they are doing) maybe prone to artifacts (PNAS, 107: 21487). A comprehensive comparison of available proteome, transcriptome and ribosome profiling data in yeast found widespread errors due to noisy data and incomplete coverage (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005206), accounting for most of the discrepancies between mRNA and protein abundance. The data here are internally controlled, since the same methods are applied throughout the time series. Nonetheless, since proteome/transcriptome discrepancies are central, it will be prudent to analyze their data with different statistical models, and report on the overlap. They should also report how their findings for the early time points (which should be very similar to populations sampled previously) stack up against the literature.</p> <p>3) They conclude that changes in the translation machinery are causal to the aging process. This may be true, and fits well with the literature. However, as I understand it, they exclusively rely on the directionality of the network they have built (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For that, they look at whether the profile of a given gene product could predict the profile of another gene product. The ones that could <italic>not</italic> be predicted were clustered as causal. Hence, the approach appears to rely on <italic>negative</italic> evidence (lack of predictability) to arrive at such a powerful conclusion. For such a conclusion, I think some additional kind of evidence must be provided. At a minimum, they should look at the numerous mutations (mostly loss-of-function, but some gain-of-function) that have been reported to extend longevity in yeast. What is the enrichment for these gene products in their various clusters? Also, can they point to some new, unidentified ones from their study and test directly their role in determining replicative lifespan?</p> <p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic> 1) The authors found that the biogenesis genes are enriched in the gene cluster, the transcriptional changes of which are &quot;most causal&quot; (ranked number 1) to other transcriptional changes during aging. They then immediately claim in the subsection “Network interference identifies protein biogenesis related genes as casual in yeast aging” that &quot;Taken together, as the biogenesis transcripts were the most predictive of all the changes we measured, our analyses support a model whereby the uncoupling of protein levels of biogenesis-related genes from their transcript levels is causal for the changes occurring in aging yeast&quot;. We think the authors need to better explain their reasoning here, because it is a key claim in the paper.</p> <p>Specifically, we would like to understand the following: (a) Is the decoupling of protein levels from transcript levels of biogenesis genes the causal factor for the transcriptiome changes, or the changes of both transcriptome and proteome, or their global decoupling during aging? (b) What is the mechanism for the decoupling to cause transcriptome changes, since it appears that the authors came up with this claim from their transcriptional network analysis? (c) If the authors want to claim that the decoupling of protein levels from transcript levels of biogenesis genes can cause the global decoupling of the proteome and transcriptome during aging (with which we are totally fine), then the best evidence would seem to arise from a similar network analysis for the decoupled time series of the decoupled genes (Q2 and Q4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The network correlation analysis of the transcriptome in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> seems less than ideal in supporting this claim.</p> <p>To summarize this point, the authors present very rich and impressive data, but we believe that they need to be more specific about what they mean in order to draw such strong conclusions. A titrated summary would be sufficiently interesting: The decoupling of biogenesis protein levels from their transcript levels through some early-life molecular regulation (e.g. a general stress response?) can drive the global decoupling of the proteome and transcriptome, which is a consequence of aging and an important molecular phenotype of aged cells. Here, the overabundance of biogenesis genes is an early event driving a specific molecular consequence of aging, rather than the cause of all the transcriptome and proteome changes during aging.</p> <p>2) It is stated that only 30% of the cells are alive at the final (12th) time point and the rest have died due to aging. Is it possible that since the majority of cells have died, some of the observed proteomic/transcriptomic changes could actually be conducive towards halting aging rather than driving it? Put another way, in a sense, this method is selecting for long-lived cells and thus, some of the changes could reflect beneficial changes rather than deleterious ones, which is why those cells are still alive after so many replications. For example, transcriptional inhibition of biogenesis genes is a major aspect of the general stress response (which has been observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) that promotes longevity. Is it possible that these long-lived cells are a subpopulation with very high stress response levels and the method is biased toward these responses?</p> <p>3) The authors should do a better job organizing and illustrating the rich dynamic data they have collected. For example, what is the fold-change time series (protein and transcript) of different gene groups (glycolysis, stress response, mitochondria)? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> did not provide information about actual fold-change values. Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> only shows 72 hr aged samples. It would be interesting to see how various gene groups alter their locations in the quadrant plots over time. In addition, the extraction of the detailed data from the supplemental tables is overly difficult. This point is especially important given the utility and importance of the dynamic data to the community. The authors need to facilitate access and plotting of the data (like the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>) in a straightforward manner. We would strongly suggest a dedicated website.</p> <p>Technical concerns:</p> <p>Since the authors presented a novel mother enrichment method, a few control experiments might be needed to further validate the approach:</p> <p>1) The preparation for cell loading takes about 90 minutes and may involve a number of stress responses, including starvation in PBS and low temperature in 4 C water. Would the whole loading and column culturing processes affect the fitness and lifespan of cells? In accordance with this concern, the authors actually observed the induction of a number of general stress genes even at the early phase of lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To prove that the cells are aging normally, a lifespan curve of cells growing under this column condition and a comparison with the lifespan curve of cells growing on regular culture plates (microdissection) or microfluidics (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2012</xref>) is sufficient.</p> <p>2) It would be more convincing if the authors were able to use conventional methods to confirm the protein expression and transcriptional changes of a couple of the most interesting genes they identified (e.g. biogenesis genes?). For example, they could use biotin-affinity sorting or a genetic mother enrichment program to collect old mother cells, and use q-PCR and westerns to measure the transcription and expression levels.</p> <p>3) Single mother cells divide with different rates and therefore at later time points the method collects mother cells with mixed ages. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2E</xref>, mother cells have a very wide distribution of ages at 44 hr and 68 hr. Does this complicate data interpretation? Is it possible to further separate mother cells into different age groups? At the very least a thorough and convincing discussion is needed.</p> </body></sub-article> <sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08527.050</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub> <body><p>Reviewer 1:</p> <p><italic>1) The authors contend that they have isolated late age mothers.

Addressing these issues is important, for their thesis that properly aged cells have been isolated.</italic> </p> <p>The reviewer notes the flow cytometry measurements presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> (WGA staining for bud scars) and D (forward scatter) show a lower fold change with age than expected for bud scar increase and cell size increase, which makes the reviewer question if the cells in our experiment were properly aging. Indeed, in the way we had annotated and described the data of the figure, it was incomplete and could thus be wrongly understood (see following explanation). We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have fixed this in the revised manuscript.</p> <p>The forward scatter measurements are only a very rough proxy for cell size, and the measurements of WGA intensity (which should be indicative for bud scars) were not corrected for the background fluorescence. Thus, true fold changes cannot be retrieved from these measurements. Furthermore, the reported WGA intensity values are just median WGA intensities of a mixed cell samples, rather than of separate mother and daughter populations (reason: overlapping spectral properties of the fluorophores for WGA (bud scar detection) and for Avidin (mother cell detection) made simultaneous use impossible). Thus, in addition, the reported WGA intensity is an underestimate of the true fluorescence intensity of mother cells. This was indeed not clearly indicated. We clarified these points in the revised version in the main text and legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In addition, we added a confocal image of bud scars for readers to see bud-scar covered, late-age cells coming from the columns (which we could easily obtain from the column due to their enrichment).</p> <p>Importantly, while as indicated above the WGA intensity and cell size proxy are qualitative assessments of aging in the column, the best indication that cells on the columns age properly is a comparison of the lifespan curves obtained from cells on our columns in comparison with classical lifespan data. To generate a high-quality lifespan curve from the cells as aged on our columns, for this revised version, we analyzed more data than we did previously (i.e. we used data from all mother cells in the column ( = from mixes 1, 2 and 3, and weighted by number of cells in each mix) rather than only data from the mother cells in mix 2 as we did previously). When comparing the resulting column-based lifespan curve with the lifespan curve generated with the microfluidic device (using the same strain and medium; 10.1073/pnas.1410024111) we found an excellent agreement (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which demonstrates proper aging of the cells on our columns.</p> <p><italic>2) They report a strong un-coordination between the transcriptome and the proteome, getting worse in later stages. They obtained data for 1494 proteins and 4904 mRNAs. Hence, they did not sample &gt;1/2 of the proteome. Still, sampling 1494 gene products represents a substantial dataset. My concerns have to do with their transcriptome/proteome comparisons. It has been argued that log2 comparisons (which is what they are doing) maybe prone to artifacts (PNAS, 107: 21487). A comprehensive comparison of available proteome, transcriptome and ribosome profiling data in yeast found widespread errors due to noisy data and incomplete coverage (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005206), accounting for most of the discrepancies between mRNA and protein abundance. The data here are internally controlled, since the same methods are applied throughout the time series. Nonetheless, since proteome/transcriptome discrepancies are central, it will be prudent to analyze their data with different statistical models, and report on the overlap. They should also report how their findings for the early time points (which should be very similar to populations sampled previously) stack up against the literature.</italic> </p> <p>This is a good point. To address this point, we have performed further correlation analyses between the proteome and the transcriptome using multiple statistical tests, both on log2 and non-log2 transformed data (Pearson, Pearson with log2 transformation, Spearman, and Kendall). The results are presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>. Here, regardless of the statistical test used, we obtained the same results, namely a reduction of correlation between the proteome and transcriptome.</p> <p>In addition, because the study mentioned by the reviewer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://10.1371/journal.pgen.1005206">Doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005206</ext-link>) has pointed out that a Spearman correlation may be more robust against noise and outliers in dataset comparisons, we have used the Spearman correlation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, and for consistency, also for all other comparisons in the main figures. (Note, none of our original conclusions have changed).</p> <p>As for the early time point comparison with the literature: we have noted in the main text that our correlation of the proteome and transcriptome is similar to what other studies have found in yeast: &quot;To compare the changes between the proteome and transcriptome, we determined the non-parametric Spearman rank correlation, and found a starting correlation of 0.75, a value in agreement with other single-study comparisons between yeast proteomes and transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Csárdi et al., 2015</xref>).&quot;</p> <p><italic>3) They conclude that changes in the translation machinery are causal to the aging process. This may be true, and fits well with the literature. However, as I understand it, they exclusively rely on the directionality of the network they have built (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For that, they look at whether the profile of a given gene product could predict the profile of another gene product. The ones that could</italic> not <italic>be predicted were clustered as causal. Hence, the approach appears to rely on</italic> negative <italic>evidence (lack of predictability) to arrive at such a powerful conclusion. For such a conclusion, I think some additional kind of evidence must be provided. At a minimum, they should look at the numerous mutations (mostly loss-of-function, but some gain-of-function) that have been reported to extend longevity in yeast. What is the enrichment for these gene products in their various clusters? Also, can they point to some new, unidentified ones from their study and test directly their role in determining replicative lifespan?</italic> </p> <p>This is also a good point. We realize that we did not mention an important aspect of our analysis. Note that the transcripts of the most causal cluster need to fulfill two criteria: these transcripts need to be less predicted by other transcripts (the negative evidence the reviewer is referring to), but in parallel they are required to have predictive ability on other transcripts (this is therefore a ‘positive’ requirement). Transcripts that do not have predictive ability, and are also themselves not predicted by others are removed from the analysis, when we move from the undirected network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1C</xref>) to the directed network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1E</xref>). In the revised manuscript we have explained better how the network is built and have clarified this aspect.</p> <p>Due to the concern that the reviewer had with our analysis, the reviewer suggested we look at mutants that have published effects on lifespan and to compare their position in our transcriptome network. We hope that with clarifying the aspect above, such ‘validation’ with longevity mutants is no longer necessary. In fact, note that such a validation would rest on the assumption that genes that affect lifespan should be in more causal positions in the network. Unfortunately this is not necessarily true – i.e. a gene that has a product in a protein complex that losses stoichiometry with age may be downstream in the causal chain – but may nonetheless be vital for lifespan regulation.</p> <p>Reviewer 2:</p> <p><italic>1) The authors found that the biogenesis genes are enriched in the gene cluster, the transcriptional changes of which are &quot;most causal&quot; (ranked number 1) to other transcriptional changes during aging. They then immediately claim in the subsection “Newtwork interference identifies protein biogenesis related genes as casual in yeast aging” that &quot;Taken together, as the biogenesis transcripts were the most predictive of all the changes we measured, our analyses support a model whereby the uncoupling of protein levels of biogenesis-related genes from their transcript levels is causal for the changes occurring in aging yeast&quot;. We think the authors need to better explain their reasoning here, because it is a key claim in the paper. Specifically, we would like to understand the following: (a) Is the decoupling of protein levels from transcript levels of biogenesis genes the causal factor for the transcriptiome changes, or the changes of both transcriptome and proteome, or their global decoupling during aging? (b) What is the mechanism for the decoupling to cause transcriptome changes, since it appears that the authors came up with this claim from their transcriptional network analysis? (c) If the authors want to claim that the decoupling of protein levels from transcript levels of biogenesis genes can cause the global decoupling of the proteome and transcriptome during aging (with which we are totally fine), then the best evidence would seem to arise from a similar network analysis for the decoupled time series of the decoupled genes (Q2 and Q4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The network correlation analysis of the transcriptome in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> seems less than ideal in supporting this claim. To summarize this point, the authors present very rich and impressive data, but we believe that they need to be more specific about what they mean in order to draw such strong conclusions. A titrated summary would be sufficiently interesting: The decoupling of biogenesis protein levels from their transcript levels through some early-life molecular regulation (e.g. a general stress response?) can drive the global decoupling of the proteome and transcriptome, which is a consequence of aging and an important molecular phenotype of aged cells. Here, the overabundance of biogenesis genes is an early event driving a specific molecular consequence of aging, rather than the cause of all the transcriptome and proteome changes during aging.</italic> </p> <p>We agree that causality is a strong term. Indeed, inferring causality from omics data is a grand challenge. We agree that in the prior version of the manuscript we made at a too early stage statements that rather belong to a discussion. Accordingly, we have toned down the bold statements in the Results section, and instead we have expanded the Discussion. Here, we elaborate on the reviewer’s question, showing how it may be the case that the decoupling of protein levels from transcript levels of biogenesis genes (specifically) is causal in aging. We now make clear that we propose a model that is up for discussion: The model suggests that translation machinery can accumulate in young age (specifically decoupling the translation machinery’s proteins from transcripts, seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), further contributing to decoupling of the proteome from the transcriptome as a whole (since the translation machinery accounts for protein abundances, seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and finally causing transcriptional responses in the cell (seen as responsive clusters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and protein complex deregulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Furthermore, we acknowledge the possibility that causes upstream of the translation machinery may still be contributing to aging, which is also covered in the expanded Discussion. We hope that with these adjustments we have adequately addressed this comment of the reviewer.</p> <p><italic>2) It is stated that only 30% of the cells are alive at the final (12th) time point and the rest have died due to aging. Is it possible that since the majority of cells have died, some of the observed proteomic/transcriptomic changes could actually be conducive towards halting aging rather than driving it? Put another way, in a sense, this method is selecting for long-lived cells and thus, some of the changes could reflect beneficial changes rather than deleterious ones, which is why those cells are still alive after so many replications. For example, transcriptional inhibition of biogenesis genes is a major aspect of the general stress response (which has been observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) that promotes longevity. Is it possible that these long-lived cells are a subpopulation with very high stress response levels and the method is biased toward these responses?</italic></p> <p>The reviewer suggests that the changes we observed to occur with aging may reflect an enriched subpopulation of longer-lived cells, and thus the proteome/transcriptome we measure would eventually not be reflecting the natural aging process of a single cell. If this were the case, this would indeed be an important concern. Notably, this is an inherent problem to all population-level yeast aging studies. The best evidence against it, which we have described in the revised manuscript, is the validation of the protein abundance changes we measured with independent experiments. Specifically, when we compared single cell data obtained with GFP-tagged strains analyzed in microfluidic chips (the stress reporter HSP104 and TEF1), we found similar protein expression profiles with both methods and no evidence for a long lived subpopulation with different Hsp104 or Tef1 profiles. Thus, we conclude that our dynamic population-averaging data is not caused by the presence of specific long-lived subpopulations. We alert the reader of this potential issue in the main text, which is supported by a new supplementary figure.</p> <p><italic>3) The authors should do a better job organizing and illustrating the rich dynamic data they have collected. For example, what is the fold-change time series (protein and transcript) of different gene groups (glycolysis, stress response, mitochondria)? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> did not provide information about actual fold-change values.</italic> </p> <p>To meet this concern, we added new figures to show the actual fold change of the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>) and transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3B</xref>) that contribute to the 2-fold enrichment presented for the proteome in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and for the transcriptome in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3A</xref>. Additionally, to further illustrate all dynamic fold changes we moved a supplemental figure into the main figures, creating a new main figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Note that this results in the renumbering of figures. Finally, to provide further illustration of the data, we have added two examples of a protein complex losing stoichiometry with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, the proteasome and the vacuolar proton-transporting V-type ATPase, V1 domain, respectively).</p> <p><italic>Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> only shows 72 hr aged samples. It would be interesting to see how various gene groups alter their locations in the quadrant plots over time.</italic> </p> <p>To address this concern, we have made a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>) showing the ‘co-expression map’ at various time points in the aging process, highlighting subgroups of genes that contribute to the enrichment scores.</p> <p><italic>In addition, the extraction of the detailed data from the supplemental tables is overly difficult. This point is especially important given the utility and importance of the dynamic data to the community. The authors need to facilitate access and plotting of the data (like the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>) in a straightforward manner.</italic> </p> <p>We have added individual supplemental tables of the final dataset, separate from the other tables used to generate the data. In this way, the final data of the aging proteome and aging transcriptome are easily accessible, and we have specified this in the text. These new tables are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 2–source data 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 2–source data 4</xref> for the final proteomes and transcriptomes, respectively.</p> <p><italic>We would strongly suggest a dedicated website.</italic> </p> <p>We have made contact with Dr. João Pedro de Magalhães, the curator/creator of various well known databases on the biology of aging (i.e. GenAge, AnAge, and the Digital Ageing Atlas), and are making arrangements to have an online, publically available, easily searchable database, making available our final proteome and transcriptome aging datasets in an integrated format. Such websites take time to develop, though we plan for this website to be operational by the end of the year.</p> <p><italic>Technical concerns:</italic> </p> <p><italic>Since the authors presented a novel mother enrichment method, a few control experiments might be needed to further validate the approach: 1) The preparation for cell loading takes about 90 minutes and may involve a number of stress responses, including starvation in PBS and low temperature in 4 C water. Would the whole loading and column culturing processes affect the fitness and lifespan of cells? In accordance with this concern, the authors actually observed the induction of a number of general stress genes even at the early phase of lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To prove that the cells are aging normally, a lifespan curve of cells growing under this column condition and a comparison with the lifespan curve of cells growing on regular culture plates (microdissection) or microfluidics (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee SS et al., 2012</xref>) is sufficient.</italic> </p> <p>The comparisons of lifespan curves in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> demonstrate normal aging on the columns.</p> <p><italic>2) It would be more convincing if the authors were able to use conventional methods to confirm the protein expression and transcriptional changes of a couple of the most interesting genes they identified (e.g. biogenesis genes?). For example, they could use biotin-affinity sorting or a genetic mother enrichment program to collect old mother cells, and use q-PCR and westerns to measure the transcription and expression levels.</italic> </p> <p>To address this point, we compared our data with information from the literature for single protein changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3–figure supplement 4</xref>). Here, we have found good agreement. Specifically, we observed the protein levels of Hsp104, Tef1, and Vph1 levels to increase with age, consistent with what was previously described (references 1 and 2 below), protein levels of Nup116 and Nsp1 to decrease, as previously described (reference 3 below), Nup53 and Nup170 to be more stable (references 3 and 4 below) and levels of Tpo1 to increase and then to decrease, also as previously described (reference 4 below).</p> <p>References:</p> <p>1) Age related increase of Hsp104 and Tef1: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0048275</p> <p>2) Age related increase of Vph1: doi:10.1073/pnas.1113505109</p> <p>3) Age related decline of Nsp1 and Nup116, while no significant changes were seen for Nup100 and Nup53: doi:10.1083/jcb.201412024</p> <p>4) Age reated increase of Nup170: doi: 10.7554/eLife.03790.</p> <p>5) Age related increase and decrease of Tpo1: doi:10.1038/ncb2085</p> <p>6) Lifespan extension from Ras2 overexpression: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/content/269/28/18638.long">http://www.jbc.org/content/269/28/18638.long</ext-link></p> <p>7) Lifespan extension from Mxr1 overexpression: doi:10.1073/pnas.0307929101</p> <p>8) Lifespan extension from Vma1 overexpression: doi:10.1038/nature11654</p> <p>Furthermore, we note that the main text already described a comparison with prior transcriptome studies (where aged cells were generated with conventional methods), with which we also found good agreement (provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that our datasets have been validated by both general and targeted studies looking at abundance changes in replicatively aging yeast.</p> <p><italic>3) Single mother cells divide with different rates and therefore at later time points the method collects mother cells with mixed ages. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2E</xref>, mother cells have a very wide distribution of ages at 44 hr and 68 hr. Does this complicate data interpretation? Is it possible to further separate mother cells into different age groups? At the very least a thorough and convincing discussion is needed.</italic> </p> <p>The broad age distribution does not complicate the analysis but rather limits the resolution at higher ages. A further separation in age groups is not possible without extensive FACS sorting, which would most certainly affect the measured transcriptome and proteomes. We acknowledge the problem of broadening of the age distribution in the results section of the manuscript, but also now emphasize it in the Results section.</p></body> </sub-article> </article>
