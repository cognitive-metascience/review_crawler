The consequences of <italic>CLN3</italic> mutation on the progression of the disease, on neuronal transmission, and on central nervous network dysfunction are poorly understood. We used <italic>Cln3</italic> knockout (<italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup>)</italic> mice and found increased anxiety-related behavior and impaired aversive learning as well as markedly affected motor function including disordered coordination. Patch-clamp and loose-patch recordings revealed severely affected inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission in the amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellar networks. Changes in presynaptic release properties may result from dysfunction of CLN3 protein. Furthermore, loss of calbindin, neuropeptide Y, parvalbumin, and GAD65-positive interneurons in central networks collectively support the hypothesis that degeneration of GABAergic interneurons may be the cause of supraspinal GABAergic disinhibition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Batten disease</kwd><kwd>cln3</kwd><kwd>synaptic dysfunction</kwd><kwd>GABA</kwd><kwd>Hippocampus</kwd><kwd>Amygdala</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 581 [TP A7]</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Toyka</surname><given-names>Klaus V</given-names></name><name><surname>Sommer</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB/TR 166 [B2]</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geis</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB/TR 58</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lange</surname><given-names>Maren D</given-names></name><name><surname>Pape</surname><given-names>Hans C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center for Sepsis Control and Care</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geis</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>IZKF University Hospital Jena</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grünewald</surname><given-names>Benedikt</given-names></name><name><surname>Geis</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Impaired GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic function and loss of interneurons in the amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum cause characteristic disease symptoms in a mouse model juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL or Batten disease) is the most prevalent inherited neurodegenerative disease in childhood caused by autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>CLN3</italic> gene. The clinical syndrome consists of gradual visual loss, motor and cognitive decline, ataxia, seizures, psychiatric abnormalities, and death in the third or fourth decade of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jalanko and Braulke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haltia and Goebel, 2013</xref>). The CLN3 protein is a transmembrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ratajczak et al., 2014</xref>) localized in synapses, in early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Uusi-Rauva et al., 2012</xref>), and in the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Getty et al., 2013</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>CLN3</italic> gene and its homologues have been analyzed in various species including mice, <italic>Drosophila,</italic> and yeast, revealing multiple biochemical defects and interactions at the cellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tuxworth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luiro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chandrachud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mitchison et al., 1999</xref>). The existing mouse models for JNCL are based on a <italic>Cln3</italic> deletion (<italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic>) or on knock-in mutations of <italic>Cln3</italic> (e.g. <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic>). They are valuable tools for studying JNCL, since they resemble many phenotypic and histopathological abnormalities of the human disease, and these deficits can be attenuated by AAV-mediated restoration of CLN3 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eliason et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kovács and Pearce, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weimer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosch et al., 2016</xref>). How these molecular changes induce the neurological symptoms of the JNCL is still unknown. Recent studies using extracellular field potential recordings showed that axonal excitability is altered in the hippocampal CA1-region and the visual cortex of the <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burkovetskaya et al., 2017</xref>). It is speculated that early changes in the balance of glutamate and GABA may contribute to seizure development and neurodegeneration, as neurons in <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice seem to be exceptionally vulnerable to glutamate excitotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pears et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Finn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kovács et al., 2006</xref>). Counteracting this imbalance by pharmacological means has an ameliorating effect on disease symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kovács et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2011</xref>). To date, the consequences of these alterations in transmitter activity on neuronal and CNS network function have not yet been elucidated and direct experimental evidence of synaptic dysfunction caused by dysfunctional CLN3 is lacking.</p><p>Here, we studied the <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mouse model of JNCL with a combined approach of neurophysiological, behavioral, and immunopathological investigations analyzing synaptic and network function in the CNS. We found that synaptic transmission is severely disturbed in the amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum accounting for progressive disease signs in the <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mouse model. Moreover, the loss of GABAergic interneurons in the amygdala-hippocampal complex may cause increased anxiety-like behavior and defective aversive learning. Disinhibition of Purkinje cells (PCs) may be responsible for cerebellar ataxia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synaptic transmission defects in the amygdala are associated with anxiety related behavior in <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice</title><p>Psychiatric abnormalities and anxiety are common features and a major cause of disability in JNCL patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bäckman et al., 2001</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">, 2005</xref>). We first evaluated anxiety- and exploration-related behavior of Cln3<italic><sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice and wild-type (wt) littermates.

Therefore, we tested synaptic transmission in the lateral amygdala (LA) as the central region for processing of fear-related signals at the age of 14 months. We performed whole-cell recordings from LA principle neurons (PNs) in acute amygdala slice preparations (schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and analyzed GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) as well as glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs).

The IPSCs were recorded in the presence of DNQX and AP5, the EPSCs in the presence of bicucullin.

Our principal finding is that GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission is critically affected in supraspinal centers leading to heightened anxiety, neurocognitive dysfunction, and defects in motor coordination. We suggest that these syndromatic features of this complex disease are largely caused by synaptic dysfunction and disturbed presynaptic release properties and by loss of distinct classes of interneurons.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Reduced learning abilities and increased anxiety behavior in <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice is based on defective synaptic transmission</title><p>We put special emphasis on the analysis of anxiety behavior and learning deficits in the <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice, since comorbidity of affective disorder and severe cognitive abnormalities is common in JNCL patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Santavuori et al., 1993</xref>). Due to the progressive cognitive impairment, the assessment and quantification of other psychiatric abnormalities in JNCL patients including anxiety is difficult and may therefore be largely underestimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bäckman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bäckman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2007</xref>). In the <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mouse model, we here identified several abnormalities that may indeed mimic abnormal features in patients with JNCL. Specifically, <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice developed a progressive decrease of explorative behavior over lifetime and a significant increase in anxiety-like behavior using complementary test paradigms at the age of 7 and 14 months. Moreover, in line with previous experiments using a light-cued T-maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wendt et al., 2005</xref>), we observed that <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice develop deficits in contextual fear learning and cued fear memory. As the amygdala-hippocampal complex is of particular importance in memory formation and in fear processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kesner, 2013</xref>), these deficits are best explained by the severely afflicted synaptic transmission at late time points which we found in the hippocampus and the amygdala.</p><p>Disturbed synaptic transmission and impaired short-term plasticity are in line with the proposed dysfunction of CLN3 protein, along with the neurodegenerative processes in patients and in the respective mouse models. CLN3 is localized in synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Luiro et al., 2001</xref>), in axonal compartments, and in synaptic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oetjen et al., 2016</xref>). The proposed role of CLN3 in endocytosis and endosomal functions provides a direct link to short-term plasticity and suggests a role of CLN3 in neuronal transmission. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Luiro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lojewski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lou et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, sorting and correct membrane-insertion of AMPA- and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is regulated by endosomal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Park et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jacob et al., 2008</xref>) and these processes may not function because of loss or dysfunction of CLN3. Furthermore, dysfunctional CLN3 may lead to deficits in spine morphology and to a reduced number of active synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golabek et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Esteves da Silva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Padamsey et al., 2017</xref>).

Different from our study, synaptic transmission was not evaluated directly by single-cell recordings in this study. Increase in synaptic strength was measured by extracellular recordings and was discussed as a compensatory mechanism to keep neuronal activity in a normal range. Considering the precautions with respect to different animal models, diverse recording methods, and different neuronal networks that have been analyzed, we here propose that synaptic transmission deficits are causative factors of disease instead of compensatory regulatory mechanisms. This assumption is based on our more direct and extensive functional evaluations showing consistent results in several and independent systems in the CNS.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Loss of interneurons in the amygdala and hippocampus directly contributes to defective GABAergic signaling and affects local networks <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice</title><p>In addition to the functional deficits, we found a partial loss of specific subclasses of interneurons in the amygdala and in the hippocampus while the overall number of neurons was unaltered in both regions thus suggesting a cell-type specific neuronal loss of GABAergic interneurons. We suggest that this neuronal loss may directly contribute to the abnormal GABAergic synaptic transmission in the amygdala and the hippocampus of <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice and thereby foster the imbalance of network inhibition and excitation. Deficits in the <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice as shown here resemble those of the GAD65 knockout mouse and other animal models with impaired inhibition in the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stork et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sangha et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lange et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geis et al., 2011</xref>). The loss of distinct subgroups of interneurons in these regions may therefore at least partly account for disturbed GABAergic inhibition and heightened anxiety-like behavior. Parv<sup>+</sup> and Calb<sup>+</sup> cells constitute the vast majority of interneurons in the basolateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sah et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, a reduction of Parv<sup>+</sup> and Calb<sup>+ </sup>interneurons as shown here likely contributes to decreased sIPSC frequency and reduced eIPSC amplitude in the PN of the amygdala. NPY<sup>+ </sup>interneurons inhibit PNs in the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tasan et al., 2016</xref>) and Calb<sup>+ </sup>interneurons coordinate hippocampal-amygdala theta-oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bienvenu et al., 2012</xref>) known to be associated with retrieval of learned fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seidenbecher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pape et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, hippocampal theta input to the amygdala shapes feed forward inhibition to gate heterosynaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazelot et al., 2015</xref>), which in turn seems critical for cued-specific signal integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lange et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, in other mouse models, for example in <italic>Gad65<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice a reduction in theta oscillations is associated with deficits in retrieval of fear-related memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mańko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergado-Acosta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lange et al., 2014</xref>). Parv<sup>+ </sup>interneurons are involved in regulating PN activity during aversive associative learning, thereby controlling the strength of associative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, a reduction of these interneuron subclasses together with the compromised presynaptic function due to CLN3 dysfunction may lead to disinhibition of amygdala networks and finally be the pivotal mechanism explaining decreased cued learning performance and increased anxiety-levels in <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nuss, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the hippocampus, we also found reduced numbers of Parv<sup>+</sup> and NPY<sup>+ </sup>interneurons as well as a reduction of GAD<sup>+ </sup>interneurons. The decreased eIPSC amplitude in GC of <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice after stimulation of the outer molecular layer may be a direct consequence of reduced NPY<sup>+ </sup>interneurons. Large numbers of NPY receptor-positive synapses are found on dendrites of GC and a substantial population of the molecular layer perforant path-associated neurons are NPY<sup>+ </sup>interneurons, whose axon collaterals are largely constrained to the outer and medial molecular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sperk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hosp et al., 2014</xref>). Concordantly, the reduced number of Parv<sup>+</sup> cells may directly contribute to the reduction of eIPSC after stimulation within the granule cell layer. The Parv<sup>+</sup> basket cells with their widespread axonal arborization in the GC layer innervate mainly the perisomatic parts of the GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kraushaar and Jonas, 2000</xref>) Loss of both Parv<sup>+</sup> and NPY<sup>+ </sup>interneurons contributes to the reduction of spontaneous and evoked IPSC in dentate GC of <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>Parv<sup>+ </sup>interneurons exert feedforward – and feedback inhibition in the hippocampus and may therefore be crucial for pattern separation and generation of network oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). In the dentate gyrus, this could contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability reducing the threshold for the development of temporal lobe seizures that often occur in JNCL patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang and Buckmaster, 2009</xref>). Selective loss of NPY<sup>+ </sup>interneurons seems to precede cognitive impairment in a mouse models of accelerated senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sawano et al., 2015</xref>) and might therefore be particularly detrimental in disease progression also in the <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mouse model and JNCL patients. Recently, it has been shown that NPY itself is important for neuroprotection and modulation of synaptic plasticity, memory, anxiety-related behavior, and stress resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gøtzsche and Woldbye, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reichmann and Holzer, 2016</xref>), all of which are core features in JNCL. Furthermore, there is compelling evidence that NPY acts as an endo- and exogenous anticonvulsant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erickson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Noè et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, reduced levels of NPY<sup>+</sup>, Parv<sup>+</sup>, Calb<sup>+</sup> and GAD<sup>+ </sup>interneurons in the amygdala-hippocampal complex may collectively contribute to a large number of key symptoms in <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice and JNCL. Taken together, we provide evidence that central disinhibition in <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice is likely caused by both synaptic dysfunction and loss of GABAergic interneurons. This may contribute to the imbalance of transmitter systems and may explain disturbed transmitter cycling and decreased amount of GABA as reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Salek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pears et al., 2005</xref>).

We here found significantly enhanced PC simple spike firing and disturbed timing in <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice. Parallel fibers not only excite PCs but also the adjacent interneurons within the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex which themselves have inhibitory connections onto the PCs accounting for a feed-forward inhibitory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mittmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apps and Garwicz, 2005</xref>). Upon parallel fiber stimulation, this inhibitory input onto the PCs follows the excitatory inputs from the parallel fibers at short intervals. The inhibitory inputs curtail the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) by short-circuiting the membrane through opening of GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor-associated chloride channels. This ensures exact time-dependent summation of incoming EPSPs leading to synchronized PC firing. The observed abnormalities with increased simple spike firing rate and loss of synchronization after parallel fiber stimulation in the <italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice are best explained by a dysfunction of local inhibitory networks as seen in mice lacking GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wulff et al., 2009</xref>). This hypothesis is further corroborated by the loss of GAD-positive interneurons in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex. Thus, similar to the changes in the amygdala-hippocampal complex, motor deficits in this mouse model of Batten disease are likely resulting from disturbed supraspinal cerebellar synaptic organization and GABAergic inhibition.</p><p>In contrast, we could not find evidence for defective synaptic transmission onto spinal motoneurons as determined by H-Reflex recording.

Investigators performing behavioral tests, histological analyses, and electrophysiological studies were blinded as to the genotype of the mice.</p><p>For surgery and in vivo electrophysiological recordings animals were anesthetized using a xylazine-ketamine solution (8 mg/kg xylazine and 80 mg/kg body weight ketamine; Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany). For tissue harvesting, mice were deeply anaesthetized using isoflurane (Forene, AbbVie) and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline and freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). Tissue was harvested and immediately frozen in −37°C cold methyl butane and subsequently stored at −80°C. For electrophysiological in vitro slice recordings, animals were deeply anaesthetized and decapitated. Slices of the respective brain regions (hippocampus, amygdala, or cerebellum) were prepared using a VT1200 S Microtome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral testing</title><p><italic>Cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice and wt littermates were tested for motor performance, coordinative function, muscle strength, anxiety-related behavior, and aversive learning in standardized behavioral testing procedures in a blinded manner. Behavioral testing was performed at the time points of 3, 7, and 14 months. Time points of behavioral testing are indicated in the Figures and Figure Legends for each test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RotaRod</title><p>Motor performance was tested with an accelerating RotaRod (TSE Systems Inc.,Bad Homburg, Germany ). Acceleration was set to increase from 5 to 30 rpm until testing month 7 and from 5 to 50 rpm for all later time points (accounting for the training effect in RotaRod testing over time). Initially, animals were trained on 5 consecutive days to obtain stable baseline values. During the experiment animals were tested monthly. The time staying on the rod was automatically measured and stored on a PC using TSE software. The median of the three best runs out of 5 trials on one day was used for later analyses. Data for the 3-month time point was obtained from a single experimental group, and data for the 7- and 14-month time points were from three independent groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Rope climbing</title><p>Animals were trained to climb on a vertically strained customary cord (1.5 mm in diameter, length 100 cm) to reach a platform where they were rewarded with water and oatmeal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kashiwabuchi et al., 1995</xref>). The time was recorded from first contact with the rope until the animals had reached the platform with all four limbs. Experiments were stopped after 60 s if the animal was not able to reach the platform within this time and the measure of 60 s was used for analysis. Each experiment consisted of five trials and the median value of the best three runs was used for further analysis. To assess climbing performance and coordination of the hind limbs, we developed a non-linear score ranging from 1 to 4 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>): (1) The mouse uses all four limbs in an alternating manner over the complete distance. (2) The mouse uses the hind limbs in an alternating manner more than half of the distance. (3) The mouse never uses the hind limbs in an alternating manner. (4) The mouse is not able to grasp the rope with the hind limbs. The median of the trials was used for further analysis. Videos were taken for each animal to confirm the scoring by another independent investigator who was blinded as to the genotype. Data for the 3-month time point were obtained from a single experimental group, and data for the 7- and 14-month time points were from three independent groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Forelimb grip strength</title><p>Forelimb grip strength of <italic>Cln3</italic><sup>Δex1-6</sup> mice and wt littermates was tested using a grip strength meter (TSE Systems Inc.). Mice were held at the proximal part of the tail and allowed to grasp a horizontal metal bar. Mice were then pulled away and the pull force until the mice unclasp the bar was recorded. Eight trails within 2 min were performed for each mouse and median values were taken for further analysis. Data for the 3-month time point were obtained from a single experimental group, and data for the 7- and 14-month time points were from three independent groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Gait analysis</title><p>Gait analysis was performed according to Kunkel-Bagden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kunkel-Bagden et al., 1993</xref>) at the age of 7 and 14 months. In short, hind feet of mice were painted with blue ink and mice were then placed in a narrow tunnel so that the mice move straight forward and leave footprints on subjacent sheets of white paper. The parameters of the footprints (right and left stride length, stride width and angel between hind feet) were analyzed by a blinded and experienced experimenter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Open field</title><p>The OF was a square-shaped box (50 × 50 × 40 cm) made of Perspex XT, a black opaque material semi-permeable for infrared light (TSE Systems Inc). The apparatus was illuminated by infrared LEDs from below, and activity monitoring was conducted using an IR sensitive CCD camera (GKB Security Corporation, Taichung, Taiwan) along with the computerized video tracking software VideoMot2 (TSE Systems Inc.). The OF arena was subdivided into a center zone (25 × 25 cm) and the surrounding periphery. The illumination at the floor level slightly decreased from the center (200 lux) to the periphery (150 lux), due to shadows arising from the walls of the OF. Mice were placed into the periphery zone adjacent to the wall and allowed to freely explore the apparatus for 5 min. Parameters measured by the automated system included total distance travelled, time spent in either center or periphery zone, and number of entries into each zone. Additional parameters including rearing behavior and grooming activity were scored as indicators of explorative and anxiety-related behavior. After completion of the test, the OF was cleaned with 70% alcohol between trials ensuring identical experimental conditions for all subsequent tests. Data were obtained from two independent experimental groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Elevated plus maze</title><p>The plus-shaped maze was made of grey Perspex (TSE Systems Inc.) and had two sets of opposing arms (30 × 5 cm) extending from a central platform (5 × 5 cm). Two arms were enclosed on either side by 15 cm high, opaque walls. The remaining two arms were open and surrounded by a slightly raised lip (0.25 cm). The device was elevated 50 cm above floor level. Illumination intensity was 200 lux on the open arms, 120 lux on the intersection, and 40 lux on the closed arms. Mice were placed in the central area, facing one of the open arms, and then allowed to freely explore the maze for 5 min. The number of arm entries, the amount of time spent in the open and closed arms, and the total distance travelled were recorded using an automated video tracking system (VideoMot2; TSE Systems Inc.). An arm entry was defined by all four feet being set in the respective arm. In addition, other behavioral parameters were scored manually, including rearing and grooming behavior. Before the next trial the EPM was thoroughly cleaned ensuring identical experimental conditions for all subsequent tests. Data were obtained from two independent experimental groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Dish test</title><p>Mice were placed in a commercial Petri glass dish (150 × 15 mm) and the time was measured until the mice stepped out of the dish with all four feet. This latency is taken as an indicator for explorative behavior. Dishes were cleaned with 70% Ethanol between each trial. Data was obtained from two independent experimental groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Fear conditioning</title><p>FC was performed in two experiments with two separate groups of animals. First experiment was performed using an automated fear conditioning system from TSE Systems Inc., and the second group was tested on a system from Ugo Basile S.R.L. (Gemonio, Italy) with the same testing parameters in both experiments. Since experience of aversive stimuli would compromise the results of repetitive testing FC was only performed once for each animal at the age of 14 months. All tests were video-recorded, and the videos from both experiments were automatically scored for freezing using the ANY-Maze software (Stoelting Co. Wood Dale, Illinois, USA) ; freezing detection threshold: 2 s) by the same blinded investigator. The testing chamber in both setups was illuminated with a light intensity of 100 lux throughout the entire experiment. During the conditioning phase (day 0), mice were placed in the conditioning chamber and allowed to briefly explore the novel environment for 2 min before a 80 dB strong 10 kHz sinusoidal tone was presented for 20 s as an auditory cue. During the last 2 s of the tone, a 0.75 mA foot shock was administered. An 80 s inter-trial interval preceded another identical trial. Following the last tone plus shock paired stimulus, mice remained in the chamber for 60 s before they were removed and placed back to the home cage. Fecal boli and urine were removed and the apparatus was cleaned with 70% alcohol.</p><p>Cued fear testing was performed 1 day and 7 days after the conditioning trial. Mice were tested in the same chamber, but in a modified, ‘novel’ environment. To achieve this, the grid floor was covered with a grey, opaque PVC plate with a handful of woodchip bedding. The Perspex arena was made opaque by covering it with black-and-white patterned stripes. A novel olfactory cue was provided using 3% acetic acid solution for cleaning instead of 70% alcohol. Mice were then gently placed into the chamber and allowed to explore the altered environment for 2 min. Subsequently, the auditory cue (80 dB, 10 kHz sinusoidal tone) was presented for 3 min and behavioral responses were recorded. After termination of the tone, mice remained in the chamber for 30 s before they were returned to the home cage.</p><p>Contextual fear testing was performed at 2 and 8 days after the conditioning session. Mice were placed into the original conditioning chamber in the absence of the tone for 5 min and behavioral responses were recorded. After removal of the animals the apparatus was cleaned.</p><p>During the entire behavioral experiments, responses of mice were monitored by an observer blinded as to genotype of the mice and videotaped in a coded way for double-check analysis. For each test, the time spent freezing and the latency to the first freezing event were scored manually following a standardized protocol. Data were obtained from two independent experimental groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Neurophysiological recordings</title><sec id="s4-11-1"><title>Whole-cell recordings of lateral amygdala projection neurons</title><p>Coronal slices (300 µm) containing the amygdala from 14-month-old mice were prepared on a vibratome, incubated at 34°C for 20 min, and stored thereafter at room temperature (RT). Single slices were placed at RT in a submersion chamber and were perfused with extracellular solution (aCSF-1) containing (in mM): 120 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 22 NaHCO3 and 20 glucose. The pH was set to 7.35 by continuously gassing with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub>. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed using an EPC-10 patch-clamp amplifier at a sampling rate of 10 kHz. The recordings were done on principal neurons (PNs) in the lateral amygdala (LA), which were identified morphologically and by their action potential pattern in response to depolarizing current injections during current-clamp recordings. The PNs show a low number of generated action potentials and a typical adaptation of action potential generation as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sah and Lopez De Armentia, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lange et al., 2012</xref>). Patch-pipettes (2.2–2,8 MΩ; borosilicate glass; Clark Electromedical Instruments) for miniature (m), spontaneous (s) and evoked (e) inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were filled with a solution for each individual experiment as follows (mM): NaCl 10, KCl 110, EDTA 11, HEPES 10, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 0,5, Phosphocreatine 15, MgATP 3, and NaGTP 0.5. The pH was set to 7.25. The isolated IPSCs were recorded in voltage-clamp mode at a membrane potential of −70 mV in the presence of AP5 (D-(-)−2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid; 50 µM; Abcam) and DNQX (6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione disodium salt; 10 µM; Abcam) to block NMDA- and AMPA-receptors. For recording of miniature (m), spontaneous (s), and evoked (e) excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), patch-pipettes were filled with (mM): NaCl 10, K-gluconate 88, K<sub>3</sub>-citrate 20, HEPES 10, BAPTA 3, Phosphocreatine 15, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 0,5, MgATP 3, and NaGTP 0.5. For isolation of glutamatergic EPSCs, recordings were performed with GABA<sub>B</sub>-and GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptors being blocked in the presence of CGP 52432 (3-[[(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)-methyl]amino]propyl(diethoxymethyl)-phosphinic acid; 2 µM, Abcam) and gabazine (6-Imino-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)−1(6 hr)-pyridazinebutanoic acid hydrobromide; 25 µM; Abcam). EPSCs and IPSCs were recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV. Extracellular stimulation for the recording of evoked postsynaptic currents (ePSCs) was performed using a bipolar tungsten stimulation electrode, placed locally in the LA. Amplitudes of ePSCs were measured and averaged from five consecutive PSCs with an interval of 15 s. Values were averaged from different neurons and are presented as the mean amplitude (in pA). Miniature and spontaneous postsynaptic currents were recorded over a time period of 300 s (60 traces with 5 s duration). For measuring of mIPSCs and mEPSCs TTX (1 µM, Biotrend) was applied.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Whole-cell recordings of dentate gyrus granule cells</title><p>Transversal hippocampal slices (300 µm) from 14-month-old mice were prepared on a vibratome, incubated in aCSF-2 (mM): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 Glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO4, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> at 32°C for 30 min, and subsequently stored at RT and continuously purged with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub>.

Recordings were were made from visually identified dentate granule cells (GC) and were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geis et al., 2010</xref>). In short, patch-clamp pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (3–3,7 MΩ; GB200F-10; Science Products, Hofheim, Germany) and filled with intracellular solution (mM): 145 KCl, 10 Hepes, 0,1 EGTA, 2 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub> for the recording of IPSCs.

IPSCs were recorded in the presence of CNQX (10 µM; 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) and AP5 (50 µm mM; both Tocris Bioscience). For the recording of EPSCs, CGP 52432 and gabazine was added. For measuring of mIPSCs and mEPSCs TTX (1 µM) was applied. All recordings were performed at RT. For stimulation of afferent fibers borosilicate glass pipettes (4–5 MΩ) filled with aCSF-2 were used and placed in the granule cell layer (GCL) or the outer molecular layer (OML) to stimulate different types of inhibitory synaptic inputs onto the GC. For the recoding of eEPSC, the lateral perforant path was stimulated. The stimulation frequency was 0.3 Hz and stimulation strength was adjusted to the minimal strength for eIPSC. For analysis of eESPC after lateral perforant path stimulation, an in-out curve was conducted. For recording of paired pulse depression (PPD) of eIPSC stimulation strength was increased by 50% to reduce the number of stimulation failures. For analysis of paired pulse fascilitation of ESPC in lateral perforant path, the stimulation intensity was set to 100 pA.</p><p>Whole cell path clamp recordings in the amygdala and the hippocampus were excluded when the initial membrane potential was more positive than −60 mV or changed by more than 20% during recordings and when series resistance was more than 20 MΩ or changed by more than 20%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-3"><title>Loose patch recordings in cerebellar slices ex-vivo</title><p>Coronal slices (300 µm) of the dissected mouse cerebellum at the age of 14 months were prepared using a vibratome and were incubated in a preparation solution containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 Glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO4, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

PCs were visually identified (assisted by DODT gradient optics, Luigs and Neumann, Ratingen, Germany) and recordings were performed with an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA, Ludwigshafen, Germany). For recording spontaneous activity, loose patch recordings were made from PCs with low-resistance (2–2.5 MΩ) borosilicate pipettes filled with aCSF-2. Evoked responses were elicited by stimulating parallel fibers about 200 µm away from the PC bodies with an additional pipette containing aCSF-2.

Region of interest was defined under a 5x objective. Stereological counting was performed with a 400x magnification for NPY and NeuN and 200x for all other stainings. Grid and counting frame size were adjusted for every staining to obtain at least 1 to 3 counts per dissector but kept constant for all animals per staining.

The estimated population is given as cells*mm<sup>−3</sup>.</p><p>For analysis of interneuron counts in the amygdala, stereology was not performed because the estimated coefficients of error where too high. This is due to the uneven distribution of cell types throughout the area of interest (contour of the amygdala) and its smaller size. To obtain reliable measurements for group comparison, interneurons were counted in unbiased fashion after the following procedure. Cell counting was performed by the same investigator blinded to the experimental groups and to the genotype of each animal. We performed quantification in 5–7 transversal sections spanning the entire amygdala complex from bregma −0.8 mm to −2.3 mm assuring that not only subfields of the amygdala are analyzed. Each section for every interneuron and NeuN stain was separated by seven adjacent sections (spacing of 210 µm) so that oversampling of neurons, also of probably enlarged interneurons is avoided. We used an Axioplan two microscope, 20x Plan Neofluar objective, AxioCam MRc 5, Axovision software, and MosaiX module (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and for each of the 5–7 slices per staining compound images were made. Contours of the area of interest were drawn and cells were counted offline using ImageJ. Nuclei intersecting the uppermost focal plane and the lateral boarder areas were excluded from the count to avoid oversampling. The density of immunoreactive neurons for each animal was determined by dividing the total number of positive cells by the total sampled surface.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Defective synaptic transmission causes disease signs in a mouse model of Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jonathan D. Cooper (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Grünewald et al. describes a comprehensive series of carefully conducted experiments revealing evidence for increased anxiety and impaired synaptic transmission in a mouse model of juvenile Batten disease (JNCL), a fatal inherited neurodegenerative storage disorder that affects children and young adults. The experimental work comprises a remarkable amount of data, ranging from state-of-the-art electrophysiology to animal behavior to histology. Using a <italic>cln3</italic> knockout mouse model they provide detailed neurophysiological analyses in together 4 different functional systems in the CNS (hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum, spinal cord). They uncover disturbed GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission in 3 of these areas (excluding spinal cord) as causative pathomechanisms underlying characteristic disease symptoms. Functional experiments are paralleled by extensive behavioral analyses and quantitative immunohistology showing loss of certain subtypes of interneurons. Together, this is a complete work on many functional and cellular aspects in the <italic>cln3</italic> mouse model. The findings are important for understanding this devastating disorder of children and young adults and set a milestone in research on JNCL. The reviewers had rather minor issues that need to be addressed by the authors.</p><p>Essential revisions:a) The data clearly reveal increased anxiety by both dish test and more conventional open field and elevated plus maze testing. Although the age at which dish testing was conducted is clearly stated, it is not immediately apparent what age the open field and elevated plus maze testing were performed at (without referring to the Materials and methods).

First, cell counting was performed by the same investigator blinded to the experimental groups and to the genotype of each animal. Second, we performed quantification in 5-7 transversal sections spanning the entire amygdala complex assuring that not only subfields of the amygdala are analyzed. Here, each section for every interneuron stain was separated by 7 adjacent sections (spacing of 210 µm) so that oversampling of neurons, even of probably enlarged interneurons is avoided. Third, nuclei intersecting the uppermost focal plane and the lateral boarder areas were excluded from the count to avoid oversampling. The density of immunoreactive neurons for each animal was determined by dividing the total number of positive cells by the total sampled surface. Cell density (Cells per mm2) was calculated separately for each slice and median value for each mouse brain was used for statistical analysis. This is now stated in detail in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Cell quantification”).</p><p>We performed complete new series of NeuN stains and quantitative analysis in the amygdala, hippocampus (subfields CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus) and cerebellum to obtain quantitative data of the overall number of neurons in these areas. Here, we did not find any differences in cell count in all of these areas, thus suggesting a primary effect on the respective interneuron subtypes.

This is now clearly stated in the figure legend, Results, and Materials and methods section. Different from all other behavioral tests, we do not have sequential information of fear-related behavior at different ages. Since experience of aversive stimuli would compromise the results of repetitive testing at later time points, repetitive testing for fear conditioning is not possible. We have now included a short explanation in the Material and methods section (subsection “Fear Conditioning (FC)”, first paragraph).</p><p>We performed large series of new immunostains and assessed the number of NeuN positive neurons in the hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebellum. Stereological analysis showed unchanged NeuN positive cell count in all of these regions, also in the subfields(CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus) of the hippocampus (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition to the overall cell counts in the hippocampus we now also show the data for interneuron subclasses in the dentate gyrus, as well as the CA1 and CA3 subfield of the hippocampus separately (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Parvalbumin and NPY positive interneurons were primarily reduced in the CA3 subregion whereas GAD positive interneurons were significantly reduced in the CA1 region. However, analysis showed trends also in the other subregions of the hippocampus toward reduction of these interneurons subclasses as well. Therefore, we suggest not over-interpreting the reduction of interneuron subclasses to a certain subregion of the hippocampus.

This is most likely due to the higher demand on motor function and coordinative movements. We performed the rope climbing test in a way that the mice have to climb up 100 cm of vertical strained rope. We suppose that similar dyscoordinative behavior would also be present when mice would climb down the rope, however, we did not formally test this.</p><p>The reviewer is right, RotaRod testing is quite variable depending on a variety of influential factors. As an example, in a previous study (Kovacs and Pearce, 2015), <italic>Cln3<sup>∆ex1-6</sup></italic> and <italic>Cln3<sup>∆ex7/8</sup></italic> mice were tested on two different genetic backgrounds, 129S6/SvEv and C57BL/6J, on the rotarod at 3 and 6 months of age. Only <italic>Cln3<sup>∆ex1-6</sup></italic> males on the 129S6/SvEv background displayed a deficit in the rotarod test (at both 3 and 6 months). Furthermore, it is known that environmental factors have a strong influence on the behavioral test results. We have previously shown that environmental factors specific to a geographical location can change the body weight, motor coordination and motor learning capability of wild type mice commonly used as controls in transgenic studies (Kovacs and Pearce, 2013). In that study, we found that the type of mouse diet was partially responsible for the location-specific differences.</p><p>Moreover, we have now included additional data from gait analysis at the age of 7 and 14 months showing unchanged stride length, distance and angle between the hind limbs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, Results: subsection “Cerebellar dysfunction underlying motor deficits in <italic>cln3<sup>Δex1-6</sup></italic> mice”, first paragraph, Materials and methods subsection “Gait analysis”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) The data for altered firing of cerebellar Purkinje cells are both robust and highly interesting in likely revealing a possible explanation for the impaired co-ordination of Cln3 mice (especially in the absence of any overt effects on spinal inhibition – very interesting in itself given a recent paper documenting spinal pathology in another form of NCL).
