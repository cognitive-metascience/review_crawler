Here, we targeted whole-cell recordings to two classes of inhibitory GABAergic neurons in layer 2/3 of the barrel cortex of awake head-restrained mice and correlated spontaneous membrane potential dynamics with cortical state and whisking behavior. Using optogenetic stimulation of single layer 2/3 excitatory neurons we measured unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (uEPSPs) across states. During active states, characterized by whisking and reduced low-frequency activity in the local field potential, parvalbumin-expressing neurons depolarized and, albeit in a small number of recordings, received uEPSPs with increased amplitude. In contrast, somatostatin-expressing neurons hyperpolarized and reduced firing rates during active states without consistent change in uEPSP amplitude. These results further our understanding of neocortical inhibitory neuron function in awake mice and are consistent with the hypothesis that distinct genetically-defined cell classes have different state-dependent patterns of activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neocortex</kwd><kwd>membrane potential</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>GABAergic neurons</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>network activity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030B_166595</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petersen</surname><given-names>Carl CH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-ADG-293660</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petersen</surname><given-names>Carl CH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Membrane potential recordings in awake mice from two genetically defined classes of neocortical inhibitory neurons reveal their distinct patterns of activity and unitary excitatory synaptic inputs, which are differentially modulated by behavior and local network activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In cortical excitatory neurons, reduced low-frequency neocortical EEG or local field potential (LFP) activity, such as that observed during active behaviors, consistently correlates with a decrease in membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) variance through a reduction in the amplitude of low-frequency V<sub>m</sub> fluctuations, accompanied, on average, by V<sub>m</sub> depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Steriade et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Timofeev et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Crochet and Petersen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Poulet and Petersen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yamashita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bennett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Polack et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Much less is known regarding V<sub>m</sub> and its relationship to action potential (AP) firing in inhibitory GABAergic neurons during various states of awake neocortical activity and during active behaviors. In layer 2/3 (L2/3) mouse primary somatosensory whisker barrel cortex (wS1), fast-spiking inhibitory neurons were found to decrease AP firing during whisking with little change in mean V<sub>m</sub> but decreased V<sub>m</sub> variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gentet et al., 2010</xref>).

The hyperpolarization of Sst neurons is thought to be driven by increased firing of VIP-expressing GABAergic neurons, which strongly inhibit Sst neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pi et al., 2013</xref>). The reduction in AP firing rate of Sst neurons during Active states may disinhibit distal dendrites of nearby excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gentet et al., 2012</xref>), perhaps promoting non-linear dendritic excitation important for sensorimotor integration and perceptual decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the V<sub>m</sub> of Sst neurons only showed low-amplitude slow fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>) and little correlation with LFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), neither of which were affected by Quiet vs Active states. Sst neurons in L2/3 mouse barrel cortex are therefore functionally relatively uncoupled from the surrounding neuronal network, within which all other cell-types show highly correlated low frequency V<sub>m</sub> fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Poulet and Petersen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gentet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gentet et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to prominent inhibitory input from VIP neurons, Sst neurons receive excitatory synaptic input, which shows strong frequency-dependent facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Reyes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kapfer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pala and Petersen, 2015</xref>). Short-term synaptic plasticity together with cell-type- and layer-specific circuits likely contribute to the relatively decoupled V<sub>m</sub> dynamics of Sst neurons compared to other types of nearby neurons.</p><p>Nicotinic enhancement of uEPSPs has recently been reported on Sst neurons in wS1 of anesthetised mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Urban-Ciecko et al., 2018</xref>), and acetylcholine is known to be released during whisking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eggermann et al., 2014</xref>). However, in our study with limited sample size, optogenetically-evoked uEPSPs in Sst neurons had similar amplitude during Quiet and Active epochs, suggesting comparable local excitatory drive across states. Future studies with a larger sample size, and with additional classification of subtypes of Sst neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Muñoz et al., 2017</xref>), may well reveal state-dependent synaptic transmission onto Sst neurons in awake mice. Furthermore, it is possible that diverse synaptic inputs (for example from different sources such as from thalamus, or different cell-types in different layers of various cortical regions) onto Sst neurons might be differentially modulated by diverse cortical and behavioral states, and in future experiments it will be particularly important to measure synaptic transmission during execution and learning of goal-directed behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PV-expressing GABAergic neurons</title><p>V<sub>m</sub> recordings from PV cells revealed that these fast-spiking GABAergic neurons are strongly modulated across Active and Quiet states. During Quiet states PV neurons were on average hyperpolarized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and exhibited large V<sub>m</sub> variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) in the slow frequency range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>) highly correlated with the LFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Conversely, during Active states, the V<sub>m</sub> of PV neurons depolarized together with a reduction in V<sub>m</sub> variance, V<sub>m</sub> slow fluctuations and V<sub>m</sub> correlation with LFP. Despite depolarization, the AP firing rate of PV neurons reduced significantly during the Active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), presumably because the decreased V<sub>m</sub> variance prevented an increased frequency of V<sub>m</sub> excursions above AP threshold. Consistent with these observations, decreased firing of fast-spiking neurons was also previously noted in L2/3 of wS1 during whisking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gentet et al., 2010</xref>), and during licking events accompanied by whisking in a whisker detection task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sachidhanandam et al., 2016</xref>). These results appear to suggest that a reduction in the firing rate of PV neurons in L2/3 of wS1 typically accompanies whisking. The reduced firing rates of PV neurons during Active states will presumably disinhibit the surrounding neuronal network, perhaps promoting synaptic computations amongst the excitatory pyramidal neurons. Studies with larger sample size considering subtypes of PV neurons and comparing across various behavioral conditions will be important to further our understanding.</p><p>Optogenetic stimulation of a single nearby excitatory pyramidal neuron appeared to evoke uEPSPs with increased amplitude during Active states across the small sample of synaptically-connected postsynaptic PV neurons in our data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>). An increased amplitude of incoming L2/3 excitatory synaptic input could contribute to driving the depolarized average V<sub>m</sub> in PV neurons during the Active cortical state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F</xref>). Depolarization reduces the electrical driving force for glutamatergic conductances and therefore cannot explain increased amplitude of uEPSPs. In future experiments, it will be of interest to investigate whether state-dependent changes in the input resistance, or other aspects of dendritic integration, as well as the concentration of diverse neuromodulators might play a role in regulating synaptic efficacy through various presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms. Importantly, PV neurons receive synaptic inputs from many sources, which could be differentially regulated giving rise to complex state dependent V<sub>m</sub> dynamics. Understanding the mechanisms regulating synaptic transmission during behavior remains an important challenge, necessary for a causal understanding of cortical circuit function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal preparation, surgery, and habituation to head-restraint</title><p>Six 5–10 week old female and male PV-IRES-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</xref>) mice and five 5–10 week old female and male Sst-IRES-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>) mice crossed with CAG-Lox-STOP-Lox-tdTomato (LSL-tdTomato) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>) were used in accordance with protocols approved by the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office (authorisation VD1628).

Electroporation of a single non-tdTomato neuron per PV-Cre x LSL-tdTomato or Sst-Cre x LSL-tdTomato mouse was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kitamura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pala and Petersen, 2015</xref>). In brief, a glass pipette with a resistance of 10–17 MΩ was filled with the same solution used for whole-cell recordings (see below) to which Alexa 488 dye (50–100 μM) (Invitrogen), and plasmid DNA pAAV-Syn-Chronos-eGFP (100 ng/μl) (kindly provided by Thomas Oertner) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) were added. A two-photon microscope (Prairie Technologies) was used to visualize the pipette and the tdTomato-negative cell somas as dark shadows over a brighter background. The pipette was inserted in the brain through the intact dura and brought into close contact with the cell body of the target neuron and 50 pulses of negative voltage step (0.5 ms, –12 V) were delivered at 50 Hz using a pulse generator (Axoporator 800A, Molecular Devices).

The recording chamber was filled with Ringer solution and capped with silicone elastomer (Kwik-Cast, WPI). Mice were returned to their home cage and left to recover from anesthesia for a minimum of 2 hr. Mice were head-restrained under the two-photon microscope, the silicone elastomer cap removed and the agarose gel cleared from the non-sealed part of the craniotomy.

Portions of the recordings not assigned to either W or NW categories were not considered in the analysis. Epochs of high and low LFP power in the 1–5 Hz frequency band were identified for each recorded <italic>Chronos</italic>-expressing neuron and each postsynaptic neuron. Briefly, for each recorded trial of spontaneous and optogenetically-evoked activity, the LFP was down-sampled to 2000 Hz, low-pass filtered at 200 Hz (forward and reverse direction) and the power in the 1–5 Hz band was computed using a sliding FFT (window size: 2 s, overlap: 10 ms). A distribution of the 1–5 Hz power values was generated for each recorded neuron and portions of the recording were assigned to ‘Low 1–5 Hz LFP power (L)’ if their corresponding FFT power values were smaller than the 40th percentile of the distribution. Similarly, portions of the recording were assigned to ‘High 1–5 Hz LFP power (H)’ if their corresponding FFT power values were larger than the 60th percentile of the distribution. The ‘Active’ state was then defined as periods of recording displaying Low 1–5 Hz LFP power together with whisking, while the ‘Quiet’ state was defined as periods with High 1–5 Hz LFP power without whisker movement.</p><p>Electrophysiological properties of PV and Sst neurons were quantified as follows. Mean V<sub>m</sub> and standard deviation (SD) of V<sub>m</sub> were computed for spontaneous periods of recording excluding APs. The V<sub>m</sub> <italic>vs</italic> LFP cross-correlation was computed for segments of spontaneous activity of 1 s duration. The V<sub>m</sub> was offset by its average value and normalized by its standard deviation and the LFP was low-pass filtered at 200 Hz. To compute the V<sub>m</sub> FFT spectrum and FFT amplitude in the 1–5 Hz frequency band, the V<sub>m</sub> was median-filtered to remove APs. Segments of spontaneous activity of 1 s duration were used to compute the V<sub>m</sub> FFT.</p><p>To quantify the light-evoked AP responses of the presynaptic <italic>Chronos</italic>-expressing neurons, an AP was considered as optogenetically evoked if its peak occurred within 10 ms of the onset of the 1 ms light stimulus. AP latency was defined as the time elapsed between light stimulus onset and AP peak time. AP jitter was defined as the standard deviation of the AP latency.</p><p>To quantify the properties of the light-evoked uEPSPs, an optogenetic stimulus-triggered smoothed V<sub>m</sub> average was computed, excluding stimuli with postsynaptic APs occurring in a 50 ms window starting 20 ms before stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pala and Petersen, 2015</xref>). We analyzed 54 ± 32 (mean ± SD, median 50) stimuli during the Quiet state (n = 10 cells) and 32 ± 18 (34) stimuli during the Active state (n = 10 cells). uEPSP amplitude was calculated as the difference between the mean V<sub>m</sub> averaged over a 0.25 ms window centered at the peak of the uEPSP and the mean baseline V<sub>m</sub> averaged over a 0.25 ms window taken immediately prior to the onset of the uEPSP. The uEPSP onset latency was defined as the time at which the smoothed first derivative of the V<sub>m</sub> exceeded a threshold of 100 mV/s for PV neurons and 60 mV/s for Sst neurons. The uEPSP peak was defined as the first time at which the smoothed first derivative of the V<sub>m</sub> became negative post uEPSP onset. The uEPSP rise time corresponded to the time elapsed from 20% to 80% of the amplitude on the rising phase of the averaged uEPSP. Classification of an optogenetic stimulus in a given category (Quiet/Active) required that 20 ms prior to stimulus onset and 30 ms post stimulus onset continuously be assigned to that category.</p><p>Population data are represented as mean ± SD in bar plots. In box plots, the median and interquartile range are shown with whiskers extending from the smallest data point comprised within 1.5x the interquartile range of the 1<sup>st</sup> quartile to the largest data point comprised within 1.5x the interquartile range of the third quartile.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Yang Dan as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, the authors make targeted patch-clamp recordings to examine the excitatory synaptic inputs to parvalbumin-expressing (PV) and somatostatin-expressing (SOM) interneurons in the barrel cortex of awake mice during different cortical states and whisking behaviors. They optogenetically activated single excitatory neurons and measured the evoked uEPSPs. They showed that during desynchronized cortical state, PV-expressing interneurons are depolarized and receive larger uEPSPs, whereas during whisking Sst neurons are hyperpolarized but showed no change in uEPSPs.</p><p>Previous studies from this group of investigators showed distinct effects of brain and behavioral states on the firing rates of PV and Sst neurons. By measuring the excitatory inputs into each subtype, the current study provides new insights into the synaptic mechanism underlying the firing rate modulation. In addition, they found differential effects of cortical state vs. whisking behavior on modulating the membrane potential dynamics of PV and Sst neurons, which will no doubt inspire future studies on the underlying mechanism. Methodologically, the approach builds on their 2015 paper (Pala and Petersen, 2015) which addressed similar questions, but here they carry out the experiments in awake mice while tracking LFP and whisker movements. These are highly challenging experiments and the recordings are of high quality. The dataset is valuable and the results are potentially interesting for our understanding of synaptic integration in defined interneuron populations in the awake cortex, though the authors could to more to explain the significance of their findings to a wider audience.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- The n's are generally quite low which might lead to erroneous conclusions (see e.g. Figure 4D, PV Q vs W is not significant – even though 4/5 cells go up. The same can be seen in more graphs in Figure 4). Given that Figure 4 provides the only really novel results in this manuscript – attempting to link what is already known in the literature about how interneurons react to changes in state and whisking to the excitatory input that they receive from local pyramidal cells – and recognizing that these experiments are extremely difficult – if a few additional n's could be added to the dataset in Figure 4 it would greatly strengthen the study. If this is not practical, the authors should perhaps tone down their claims to reflect the limitations of the data.</p><p>- A related concern is on the conclusion that &quot;PV neurons are modulated more strongly by cortical state, while Sst neurons are modulated more strongly by whisking behavior&quot;. Looking at Figure 2, although there are differences in the magnitude and significance levels of the modulation by cortical state and whisking, the trends tend to be in the same direction. This raises some question as to whether the difference is sensitive to how H and L LFP powers are defined. Are the observed differences robust to whether the threshold is set at 40th percentile? Since in Figure 1C, lower 1-5 Hz LFP power occurs in both Q and W behavioral states, can the authors compare the PV and Sst activity between Q and W within the low LFP state? In addition. the authors claim that PV neurons do not change firing when cortical state changes – however, Figure 1 shows how the slow LFP fluctuations changes the PV firing to a burst-like firing pattern. Additional analyses to demonstrate the robustness of the result will be helpful.</p><p>- A major concern of the analysis that has been done is that the &quot;whisking&quot; state and the &quot;LOW 1-5Hz&quot; state are obviously strongly correlated (as shown in Figure 1). However, it seems that they did not correct for this when analysing their data (making sure that the amount of whisking is matched when comparing cortical states and vice versa). Therefore, it is unclear, if e.g. the reduction in 1-5Hz power in PV neurons during whisking is actually due to the whisking or because the whisking periods coincide with &quot;Low 1-5Hz&quot; periods which correlate with a reduced 1-5Hz power in PV neurons (Figure 2D). The same problem applies to all plots in Figure 2 and Figure 4C-J.</p><p>- The single-cell electroporation technique is elegant but also tricky. Based on the loose-patch access, there could be leaking and labeling of neurons nearby. Only one example image is shown in Figure 1. Some quantification and more images for the recordings would be important to demonstrate the unitary stimulation. It would also be important to show how stable the recording of the same neuron is, whether there is any change of the access in different brain or behavioral states.</p><p>- The unitary excitatory input examined in this study is the intralaminar (l2/3) local input. The major excitatory inputs for a L2/3 PV neuron could be from L4 or thalamic neurons, and it could be different for Sst neurons. It would be very helpful for the authors to discuss how these different inputs could shape the membrane potential dynamics of l2/3 PV and Sst inhibitory neurons respectively.</p><p>- The authors include &quot;behaviour&quot; in the title, leading the reader to expect that the animal was actively engaged in some task, but the authors were simply referring to &quot;whisking or not&quot;. They should consider removing 'behaviour' from the title.</p><p>- The Discussion section sticks very close to the data and the authors give almost no consideration to how their findings relate to cortical function and current models of cortical processing of sensory input. This should be addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35869.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this study, the authors make targeted patch-clamp recordings to examine the excitatory synaptic inputs to parvalbumin-expressing (PV) and somatostatin-expressing (SOM) interneurons in the barrel cortex of awake mice during different cortical states and whisking behaviors.

We have rewritten the Discussion section to help explain implications of our results. However, the manuscript is submitted as a Short Report, preventing lengthy Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- The n's are generally quite low which might lead to erroneous conclusions (see e.g. Figure 4D, PV Q vs W is not significant – even though 4/5 cells go up.

These experiments are very difficult to perform, and, unfortunately, at the moment there is no one in our laboratory trained in these techniques to carry out further such experiments. We agree that n numbers are low, and that we should tone down our conclusions. We have therefore made important changes to the manuscript, including new analyses and explicitly pointing out important limitations in our study in terms of sample size:</p><p>Abstract: “During active states, characterized by whisking and reduced low-frequency activity in the local field potential, parvalbumin-expressing neurons depolarized and, albeit in a small number of recordings, received uEPSPs with increased amplitude.”</p><p>Subsection “Sst-expressing GABAergic neurons”: “However, in our study with limited sample size, optogenetically-evoked uEPSPs in Sst neurons had similar amplitude during Quiet and Active epochs, suggesting comparable local excitatory drive across states. Future studies with a larger sample size, and with additional classification of subtypes of Sst neurons (Muñoz et al., 2017), may well reveal state-dependent synaptic transmission onto Sst neurons in awake mice. Furthermore, it is possible that diverse synaptic inputs (for example from different sources such as from thalamus, or different cell-types in different layers of various cortical regions) onto Sst neurons might be differentially modulated by diverse cortical and behavioral states, and in future experiments it will be particularly important to measure synaptic transmission during execution and learning of goal-directed behaviors.”</p><p>In subsection “PV-expressing GABAergic neurons”: “The reduced firing rates of PV neurons during Active states will presumably disinhibit the surrounding neuronal network, perhaps promoting synaptic computations amongst the excitatory pyramidal neurons. Studies with larger sample size considering subtypes of PV neurons and comparing across behavioral conditions will be important to further our understanding.</p><p>Optogenetic stimulation of a single nearby excitatory pyramidal neuron evoked uEPSPs with increased amplitude during Active states across the small sample of synaptically-connected postsynaptic PV neurons in our data set (Figure 4B,D). An increased amplitude of incoming L2/3 excitatory synaptic input could contribute to driving the depolarized average V<sub>m</sub> in PV neurons during the Active cortical state (Figures 2A and 4F). Depolarization reduces the electrical driving force for glutamatergic conductances and therefore cannot explain increased amplitude of uEPSPs. In future experiments, it will be of interest to investigate whether state-dependent changes in the input resistance, or other aspects of dendritic integration, as well as the concentration of diverse neuromodulators might play a role in regulating synaptic efficacy through various presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms. Importantly, PV neurons receive synaptic inputs from many sources, which could be differentially regulated giving rise to complex state dependent V<sub>m</sub> dynamics. Understanding the mechanisms regulating synaptic transmission during behavior remains an important challenge, necessary for a causal understanding of cortical circuit function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A related concern is on the conclusion that &quot;PV neurons are modulated more strongly by cortical state, while Sst neurons are modulated more strongly by whisking behavior&quot;. Looking at Figure 2, although there are differences in the magnitude and significance levels of the modulation by cortical state and whisking, the trends tend to be in the same direction.

The main figures of the manuscript now focus on a comparison of the two predominant cortical and behavioral states: Quiet periods defined as epochs with high 1-5 Hz LFP power without whisker movement, and Active periods defined as epochs with low 1-5 Hz LFP power accompanied by whisker movement. The main story of the manuscript now compares cell-type-specific differences in V<sub>m</sub> dynamics, V<sub>m</sub> vs LFP correlations, and uEPSPs across these Quiet and Active periods.</p><p>We also carried out the further analyses suggested by the reviewers regarding the relative prominence of the modulation of PV and Sst neurons by cortical state versus whisking. In Figure 2—figure supplement 3, we compare the V<sub>m</sub> dynamics and LFP vs V<sub>m</sub> correlation between periods of Whisking and Non-Whisking occurring solely during the Low 1-5 Hz LFP power. We find that none of the metrics used to quantify PV neuron activity are changed by whisking behavior, whereas the mean V<sub>m</sub> of Sst neurons is significantly more hyperpolarized during Whisking compared to Non-Whisking epochs.</p><p>Similarly, we compare periods of Low and High 1-5 Hz LFP power during Non-Whisking epochs and find that PV neuron V<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>m</sub> vs LFP correlation are significantly modulated by changes in cortical state in the absence of whisker movements, but not Sst neurons. These two new analyses plus our initial analysis, which we now show in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, therefore provide further support for differential cortical state vs whisking-related modulation of PV and Sst neurons. On P. 4 we write: “Separate analyses of whisking-related and cortical state-related V<sub>m</sub> modulation suggested that PV neurons may be relatively more strongly modulated by cortical state, whereas Sst neurons may be relatively more strongly modulated by whisking (Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 3).”</p><p>We investigated whether changes in analysis thresholds affected our results, by changing the LFP 1-5 Hz power threshold from 40<sup>th</sup> percentile to 33<sup>rd</sup> percentile. We recomputed all analyses shown in Figure 2 and found the results to be robust.</p><p>The pattern of PV firing indeed changes comparing Quiet and Active states. During Quiet states the V<sub>m</sub> fluctuates on a slow time-scale and action potentials are only fired during the depolarized epochs. Following the reviewer’s comment, we computed the inter-spike interval (ISI), to examine burst firing of action potentials within 50 ms of each other, which seems to be prominent in both states, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>:</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35869.015</object-id><label>Author response image 1</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35869-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A major concern of the analysis that has been done is that the &quot;whisking&quot; state and the &quot;LOW 1-5Hz&quot; state are obviously strongly correlated (as shown in Figure 1).

The main story of the manuscript now compares cell-type-specific differences in V<sub>m</sub> dynamics, LFP vs V<sub>m</sub> correlations, and uEPSPs across these Quiet and Active periods.</p><p>In parallel, we carried out further analyses to better tease apart the contribution of cortical state and whisking behavior to the modulation of PV and Sst neurons. Figure 2—figure supplement 3 shows the results of two additional analyses, which focus on periods of Whisking and Non-Whisking during Low 1-5 Hz LFP Power only, and on periods of High and Low 1-5 Hz LFP Power during epochs lacking whisker movements. The results of such analyses seem to indicate a stronger modulation of PV neuron by cortical state compared to whisking, whereas Sst neurons are less affected by changes in cortical state while being more sensitive to whisker movements. The results of these new analyses plus our initial analysis (now reported in Figure 2—figure supplement 2) are mentioned in subsection “Vm dynamics in PV and Sst neurons across cortical and behavioral states” of the manuscript: “Separate analyses of whisking-related and cortical state-related modulation suggested that PV neurons may be relatively more strongly modulated by cortical state, whereas Sst neurons may be relatively more strongly modulated by whisking (Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The single-cell electroporation technique is elegant but also tricky.

Furthermore, in every experiment, we carefully visualized the electroporated area using the 2-photon microscope and verified that only a single neuron was transfected before proceeding to the recordings. There were no experiments in which there was any doubt about the number of presynaptic neurons. We have extensive experience in this technique (Yamashita et al., 2013; Pala and Petersen, 2015), and have carried out careful anatomical investigations (Yamashita et al., 2018).

Furthermore, it is possible that diverse synaptic inputs (for example from different sources such as from thalamus, or different cell-types in different layers of various cortical regions) onto Sst neurons might be differentially modulated by diverse cortical and behavioral states, and in future experiments it will be particularly important to measure synaptic transmission during execution and learning of goal-directed behaviors.”</p><p>Subsection “PV-expressing GABAergic neurons”: “Studies with larger sample size considering subtypes of PV neurons and comparing across behavioral conditions will be important to further our understanding.”</p><p>Subsection “PV-expressing GABAergic neurons”: “Importantly, PV neurons receive synaptic inputs from many sources, which could be differentially regulated giving rise to complex state dependent V<sub>m</sub> dynamics. Understanding the mechanisms regulating synaptic transmission during behavior remains an important challenge, necessary for a causal understanding of cortical circuit function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors include &quot;behaviour&quot; in the title, leading the reader to expect that the animal was actively engaged in some task, but the authors were simply referring to &quot;whisking or not&quot;. They should consider removing 'behaviour' from the title.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed ‘behavior’ from the title.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The Discussion section sticks very close to the data and the authors give almost no consideration to how their findings relate to cortical function and current models of cortical processing of sensory input. This should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the Discussion section and tried to add ideas about the potential functional significance of our findings. We hope the reviewers find the manuscript to be improved.</p></body></sub-article></article>
