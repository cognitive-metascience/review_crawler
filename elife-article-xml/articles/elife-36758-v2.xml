Well-defined electron density maps reveal that the pore is dramatically dilated on its cytosolic side in comparison to the slender closed pore. Cations and anions bind in different regions of the open pore, informing mechanisms for ion permeation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity. Opening of the pore requires the release of cytosolic latches.

These cytosolic calcium signals regulate a plethora of processes including gene transcription, cell motility, exocytosis, and cell metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clapham, 2007</xref>). Short-lived increases in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] can be generated by the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through ion channels such as the IP3R channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clapham, 2007</xref>). A second, more long-lasting elevation in cytosolic calcium occurs by the opening of Orai channels in the plasma membrane that allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to flow into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hogan et al., 2010</xref>). The driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is substantial: the negative voltage inside the cell is an attractive force and in the same direction as the chemical gradient for Ca<sup>2+</sup> – approximately 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] outside the cell and 20,000–fold lower inside the cell (~100 nM). Despite these driving forces, Orai conducts ions approximately 100-times slower than most Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Orai has a single channel conductance of only ~20 fS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Prakriya and Lewis, 2006</xref>]), and this probably serves important physiological roles: it would prevent overwhelming the cell with Ca<sup>2+</sup> when the channel opens and would restrict the Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation to a small region around the channel. Since the nature of the open pore is not yet known, it is unclear how Orai limits the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, but the physiochemical environment of the opened pore will undoubtedly be distinct from ion channels with high conductance. Orai is one of the most Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective channels known and the structure of an opened pore could also provide insight into how the channel achieves such exquisite selectivity.</p><p>Calcium influx through Orai is necessary for activation of immune response genes in T cells and a range of other physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feske et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lacruz and Feske, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>). Mutations in Orai have been implicated in a spectrum of maladies. Generally, loss-of-function mutations cause immune system dysfunction, including severe combined immunodeficiency-like disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feske et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lacruz and Feske, 2015</xref>). Gain-of-function mutations of Orai have also been identified. These result in constitutive activation of the channel and have been associated with tubular aggregate myopathy and Stormorken syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lacruz and Feske, 2015</xref>).</p><p>There are three Orai proteins in humans (Orai1-3). <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> contains one ortholog (Orai), which shares 73% sequence identity to human Orai1 in the transmembrane region, and is the most studied non-human Orai channel. The channels have broad tissue distribution and are tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hogan et al., 2010</xref>). In the quiescent state before activation, the ion pore of Orai is closed to prevent aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux through the plasma membrane. The channel is activated by the depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and as such it was characterized as the calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel responsible for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) before the molecular components were known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoth and Penner, 1992</xref>). Orai was identified as the protein that forms the channel’s pore and STIM was identified as its regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feske et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prakriya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vig et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yeromin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Recent studies have uncovered the general mechanism of channel activation, which is distinct from the activation mechanisms known for other channels (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hogan and Rao, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>). As a result of depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> within the ER, STIM, which is a single-pass membrane protein resident to the ER, localizes to regions where the ER and plasma membranes are separated by only 10–20 nM. Here, STIM physically interacts with cytosolic regions of Orai to open its pore. We previously determined the X-ray structure of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Orai in a ‘quiescent’ conformation with a closed ion pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2012</xref>). The conformational changes that lead to opening and the conformation of the opened pore are unknown.</p><p>The X-ray structure of the quiescent conformation provides a foundation to understand the molecular basis for the function of Orai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2012</xref>). The channel is formed from an assembly of six Orai subunits that surround a single ion pore, which is perpendicular to the plasma membrane in a cellular setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2012</xref>). Although the oligomeric state revealed by the X-ray structure was a surprise, further studies have shown that the functional state of human Orai1 is also as a hexamer of subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yen et al., 2016</xref>). Each Orai subunit contains four transmembrane helices (M1-M4) and a cytosolic M4-ext helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Amino acid side chains on the M1 helices from the six subunits form the walls of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast to many ion channels, amino acid side chains establish the dimensions and chemical environment along the entirety of the pore. The M2 and M3 helices form a shell surrounding the M1 helices and shield them from the membrane. The M4 helices are located at the periphery and contain two segments, M4a and M4b, delineated by a bend at a conserved proline residue (Pro288). Following M4b, the M4-ext helices extend into cytosol. The M4-ext helices from neighboring subunits interact with one another through pairwise helical coiled-coil packing, which creates a belt-like arrangement surrounding the channel on its intracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mutation of the hydrophobic residues that mediate the coiled-coils has been shown to prevent channel activation by STIM, possibly by reducing the affinity for STIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Navarro-Borelly et al., 2008</xref>). Because the cytosolic domain of STIM also contains coiled-coil regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fahrner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stathopulos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), it has been proposed that STIM interacts with the M4-ext helices through a coiled-coil interaction and that the structure represents a quiescent conformation prior to the binding of STIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36758.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The quiescent conformation –latched with a closed pore.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overall structure of Orai, from PDB ID 4HKR, in a ‘quiescent’ conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2012</xref>).

Red spheres mark the location of anomalous difference electron density attributed to iron, perhaps bound as (FeCl<sub>6</sub>)<sup>3-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2012</xref>). The complex anion (IrCl<sub>6</sub>)<sup>3-</sup> also binds in these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2012</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-36758-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>How STIM binding causes the channel to open is an intense area of research, and many questions remain including those as fundamental as how many STIM molecules bind to the Orai channel in the activated complex (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>). An NMR study of a complex between a portion of the M4-ext helix of Orai and a small cytosolic fragment of STIM containing its coiled-coil regions 1 and 2 (CC1 and CC2) provides the only three-dimensional structural information for the complex of these proteins to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stathopulos et al., 2013</xref>). However, the relevance of this structure to the full assembly is unclear, in part because the portion of STIM in the complex is missing a key region (coiled coil region 3; CC3) that is necessary for channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawasaki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>) and in part because data suggest that the N-terminal region of M1 also interacts with STIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2009</xref>). Ultimately, because both the structure of Orai and its mode of activation are so distinct from the structures and activation mechanisms that are understood for other channels, structural information on the Orai-STIM complex using full-length proteins will be most informative for understanding how STIM activates the channel on a molecular level.</p><p>The X-ray structure of the quiescent conformation of Orai revealed that the closed pore is approximately 55 Å long, narrow, and impermeant to ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2012</xref>). It contains four sections: a glutamate ring on the extracellular side that forms the selectivity filter (comprising Glu178 residues from the six subunits), a ~15 Å-long hydrophobic section, a ~15 Å-long basic section, and a cytosolic section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mutation of the residue corresponding to Glu178 in human Orai1 (Glu106) to aspartate disrupts Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prakriya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vig et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yeromin et al., 2006</xref>). The walls of the basic section are formed by three amino acids from each of the six M1 helices that are conserved as lysine or arginine in Orai channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mutation of the top basic residue in human Orai1 (R91W, corresponding to K163W in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Orai) causes a severe combined immune deficiency-like disorder by preventing channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Derler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feske et al., 2006</xref>). The presence of 18 basic residues (three from each of the six subunits) within the pore of a cation channel is highly unusual and would presumably establish an electrostatic barrier that opposes Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation in the closed state. We found that the closed conformation of the basic region serves as a binding site for anion(s) that stabilize the arginine/lysine residues in close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2012</xref>). In the structure, an iron complex that co-purifies with the channel, which may be (FeCl<sub>6</sub>)<sup>3-</sup>, binds at the center of the basic residues like a plug. While the physiological ligand may or may not be an iron complex, it would seem that the plug would need to be displaced to allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation through the pore when the channel is open.</p><p>A structure of Orai with an open pore would markedly advance our understandings of the channel but structural studies of the complex between Orai and STIM are complicated by the low affinity of the interaction and because the stoichiometry between Orai and STIM is not fully established. Gain-of-function mutations of Orai provide a potential experimental avenue for capturing a structure of an open pore because STIM would not necessarily be required for channel activation. Certain mutations of M1 residues that line the pore create constitutively active channels but these channels have reduced selectivity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in comparison to STIM-activated Orai, which suggests that their pores have non-native conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McNally et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamashita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). The H134A mutation of human Orai1, on the other hand, does not line the pore and has been shown to generate an activated channel with high selectivity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the absence of STIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frischauf et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yeung et al., 2018</xref>). The high selectivity and the normal inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship of the H134A mutant suggest that this mutation induces a conformation of the pore that is highly similar to the conformation of the pore when Orai is activated by STIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frischauf et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yeung et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we introduced the corresponding amino acid substitution into <italic>Drosophila</italic> Orai (H206A), confirmed that it generates a constitutively active channel, and determined its X-ray structure. The structure reveals a dilated pore and conformational changes in cytosolic regions that must ‘unlatch’ for the pore to open. In another set of experiments, we determined structures of the wild-type channel and of a mutant that corresponds to one that causes immune deficiency in humans. These structures reveal an ‘unlatched-closed’ conformation that is a structural hybrid of the quiescent and open conformations, and this indicates that unlatching, while necessary, does not necessarily cause pore opening. In additional experiments, we investigated ion-binding properties of the open pore to gain insight into Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selectivity and block by trivalent lanthanides. The studies reveal mechanisms for pore opening and give insight into the basis of store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Constructs of Orai used for structural studies function as CRAC channels</title><p>Orai from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (hereafter referred to as Orai) was selected for functional and structural studies on the basis of its good biochemical stability in detergent-containing solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2012</xref>). The previously determined X-ray structure of Orai in the quiescent conformation was obtained using construct that contained the regions necessary for STIM-activation but its ability to be activated by STIM had not been evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2007</xref>). In that construct (herein denoted ‘Orai<sub>cryst-RR</sub>’), a poorly conserved N-terminal region and a few C-terminal amino acids were removed, and two proline residues were replaced by arginine in the hypervariable M3-M4 loop (P276R and P277R mutations) in order to obtain well-diffracting crystals. The structures presented here are based on a nearly identical construct (herein denoted ‘Orai<sub>cryst</sub>’) that only differs from Orai<sub>cryst-RR</sub> in that the two M3-M4 residues are present as their wild-type proline counterparts.

We find that both the previously crystallized construct and one with a wild-type M3-M4 loop operate as CRAC channels that can be activated by STIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Extensive optimization of crystallization conditions improved the quality of H206A Orai<sub>cryst</sub> crystals from an initial diffraction limit of 20 Å resolution to 6.7 Å resolution. Despite the modest resolution of the optimized crystals, we were able to discern the conformation of the channel by calculating electron density maps using non-crystallographic symmetry averaging, which can be applied when there are multiple copies of the polypeptide in the crystallographic asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bricogne, 1974</xref>). In this case, the asymmetric unit contains 24 Orai subunits, which are arranged as four complete channels. The 24-fold non-crystallographic symmetry allowed us to accurately determine the crystallographic phases and obtain electron density maps of excellent quality, which delineate all α-helices of the channel and resemble maps calculated using considerably higher resolution diffraction data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>, Materials and methods).

We have shown previously that the basic region of the closed pore binds anions and that the crystallized protein contains an iron complex within the basic region that co-purifies with the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2012</xref>). Anomalous difference electron density for iron is not observed in the structure of H206A Orai<sub>cryst</sub>, indicating that the iron complex is not present in the open pore, which is in accord with the dramatic widening of the basic region. To investigate the possibility that anions could bind in the basic region in the open pore, we collected diffraction data from H206A Orai<sub>cryst</sub> that was crystallized in iodide (I<sup>-</sup>). I<sup>-</sup> has similar properties to the cellularly abundant Cl<sup>-</sup> anion and would be identifiable by its anomalous X-ray scattering. We observed robust anomalous difference electron density for I<sup>-</sup> that is centrally located within the basic region of the open pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The presence of I<sup>-</sup> there provides evidence that the basic amino acids are exposed to the pore and that anion(s) can bind in the basic region when it is open. We suspect that a few anions would coat the sides of the basic region in a cellular context. In the open conformation, the basic region is large enough to accommodate a centrally located Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion that is surrounded by anions and/or water molecules. (The Cα positions of Lys<sup>159</sup> residues on opposite sides of the pore are ~24 Å apart).

We chose serine because it is a small hydrophilic residue that would eliminate positive charge from this region and because the R91S mutation in human Orai1 (corresponding to K163S in Orai) forms a functional channel when expressed with STIM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Derler et al., 2009</xref>). However, we did not detect ion flux through SSS Orai<sub>cryst</sub>, suggesting that is not constitutively open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This does not appear to be due to gross misfolding of the channel because protein solubilized by detergent from the proteoliposomes exhibits a monodisperse size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) profile that is analogous to the profile of protein that was used to determine the X-ray structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, we find that Orai channels with the R155S/K159S/K163S (SSS) mutations do not form functional CRAC channels when co-expressed with STIM in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Flow cytometry using an antibody that binds to the extracellular side of Orai demonstrates that SSS Orai is expressed in the plasma membrane of the cells at a similar level to wild type Orai and SEC suggests that SSS Orai is properly folded in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B,C,D</xref>). The inability of SSS Orai to be activated by STIM could be due to constitutive closure of the pore and/or disruption of the interaction with STIM. These somewhat surprising results are an indication of the importance of the basic region in the function of the channel and provide fodder for further study.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36758.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>SSS Orai<sub>cryst</sub> is neither constitutively active nor forms functional CRAC channels when expressed with STIM.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Proteoliposome-based sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) flux assay.

However, we also obtained crystals of Orai<sub>cryst-RR</sub> in the same I4<sub>1</sub> crystal form and with nearly identical cell dimensions as for the unlatched-closed conformation (unit cell dimensions: a = b = 265.5 Å, c = 224.2 Å, α=β=γ=90°). Although these crystals diffracted poorly (to ~9 Å resolution) and thus we did not pursue an X-ray structure, the correspondence of the crystal form indicates that Orai<sub>cryst-RR</sub> can also adopt a conformation with straightened M4/M4-ext helices. On the other hand, one might wonder if the P276R and P277R mutations could induce the pairing of the M4-ext helices observed what we refer to as the quiescent conformation. This possibility seems unlikely for the following four reasons: (1) Our data indicate that the Orai<sub>cryst-RR</sub> construct functions normally as a CRAC channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). (2) The amino acid substitutions were made to residues on the extracellular side of the channel, whereas the M4-ext helices are located on its intracellular side. (3) The M3-M4 loop varies dramatically among Orai channels both in terms of length and amino acid sequence. For example, the sequence of the corresponding region of human Orai1 is KQPGQPRPTSKPPASGAAANVSTSGITPGQA (in single letter amino acid code; a sequence alignment can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al. (2012)</xref>). Furthermore, Orai from the deer tick <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> has an M3-M4 loop whose sequence is identical to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Orai except for Pro276 and Pro277, which are arginine and aspartate in that species, respectively, making it very similar to that of Orai<sub>cryst-RR</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2012</xref>). (4) The configuration of M4/M4-ext observed in the quiescent structure requires bends at the conserved Pro288 and SHK hinges. In support of a functional role for these bends, mutation of these hinge regions, which would presumably destabilize the quiescent conformation as discussed in more detail below, tend to activate the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nesin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The X-ray structures of Orai suggest that an equilibrium exists between bent and unbent conformations of M4/M4-ext. Molecular constraints may bias this equilibrium during crystallization, and we hypothesize that STIM binding does so in a cellular context (as discussed later). In the absence of STIM, we suspect that fully bent (e.g. as observed in the quiescent structure) and fully straight (e.g. as observed in the unlatched-closed structure) conformations of M4/M4-ext are representative of a range of M4/M4-ext conformations that could be present in a cellular environment. Nevertheless, the ability of the M4 and M4-ext helices to adopt the configuration observed in the quiescent conformation, the sequence conservation of the hinges involved in the bends necessary to permit this conformation, and that the tendency of the M4-ext helices to pair is satisfied in the quiescent conformation, suggest physiological relevance for this conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Unlatching of M4b/M4-ext is necessary for pore opening</title><p>Comparison of the structures of the quiescent, unlatched-closed and open conformations indicates that the M4b and M4-ext regions must undergo conformational changes for the pore to open. In the quiescent conformation, the three sets of paired M4-ext helices create an assembly surrounding the intracellular side of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Bends at both Pro288 and the SHK motif are necessary for this configuration. As a result of the bend at Pro288 observed in the quiescent conformation, M4b interacts with M3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). In the open structure, the interaction between M4b and M3 is no longer present due to the repositioning of M4b that is enabled by unbending at Pro288 and the unpairing of M4-ext helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). If the interaction between M4b and M3 of the quiescent conformation were present, or if the M4-ext helices were paired, the rigid body motion of M1-M4a that underlies pore opening could not occur due to steric interference between M3 and M4b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). We conclude that the paired M4-ext helices and the concomitant interactions between M4b and M3 of the quiescent conformation constitute ‘latches’ that must be released for the pore to open. In belt-like fashion, the latches constrain the outer diameter of the intracellular portion of the channel and prevent the widening observed in the H206A structure. Thus, when the latches are fastened, they stabilize the pore in a closed conformation. Complete straightenings of the M4/M4-ext helices (e.g. analogous to the conformations of the M4/M4-ext helices observed in the structures of H206A, WT, and K163W Orai<sub>cryst</sub>) may not be necessary for the pore to open because there could be enough space for pore dilation with slight bends at the Pro288 and SHK hinges. Rather than forming rigid helices, we hypothesize that the Pro288 and SHK hinges provide flexibility to M4b and M4-ext when the latches are released. The straightened conformations of the M4/M4-ext helices in the crystal structures may represent only one conformation of these mobile regions along a continuum of unlatched conformations that would permit, and necessarily precede, the opening of the pore. The structures of the unlatched-closed conformation reveal that release of the latches does not necessarily open the pore: the pore is closed despite the M4b and M4-ext helices adopting the same conformation that they do in the H206A structure. Thus, while necessary, unlatching is not sufficient to open the pore.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36758.020</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Unlatching is necessary for pore opening.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Quiescent conformation (PDB ID: 4HKR) highlighting interactions between M4b and M3.

Congruently, Pro245 of human Orai1, which corresponds to Pro288 of Orai, has been characterized as a residue that helps stabilize a closed state of the channel - mutation to any other residue, which would favor straightening of the bend at this position, and thus destabilize a quiescent-like conformation, has an activating phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nesin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palty et al., 2015</xref>). Further, certain mutations of human Orai1 within and around the SHK hinge also create active channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Because unlatching is necessary, but not sufficient, to open the pore, these mutations may increase the probability that the channel is open in the absence of STIM and/or they may increase the binding affinity for STIM. The drastic effects of mutations within the regions that we identify here as hinges suggest that properly functioning hinges are important for the conformational changes that underlie channel activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>While the most pronounced structural differences between the closed and open pores are within the basic region, we find that removal of the basic region by mutation of these residues to serine does not form a constitutively open channel. On the other hand, mutations within the hydrophobic region of the pore (e.g. F99C or V102A of human Orai1 or V174A of Orai) give rise to leaky channels, albeit with diminished selectivity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McNally et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamashita et al., 2017</xref>). Although we cannot discern the conformations of amino acid side chains in the open structure, and thus there is a high degree of uncertainty when discussing the dimensions of the pore, the repositioning of the M1 helices in the opened pore indicates that the hydrophobic region widens markedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). We hypothesize that this widening, which accompanies the dramatic dilation of the basic region, is critical for ion permeation and that the hydrophobic region functions as a ‘gate’ – a variable constriction that prevents or permits ion conduction. Local conformational changes in the hydrophobic region and particularly at Phe171 (Phe99 in Orai1), such as changes in side chain rotamer conformations and/or the proposed slight rotation of M1 along its helical axis, which would move Phe171 further away from the central axis of pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamashita et al., 2017</xref>), cannot be discerned from the X-ray diffraction data, but would be consistent with it, and these could contribute to pore widening and gating. High-resolution structural information of an opened pore, and preferably of an Orai-STIM complex, is necessary to discern the detailed physiochemical environment along the pore that permits ion flow. Nevertheless, both structural and functional analyses point to the conclusion that while the conformational changes in the pore are more dramatic within the basic region, that they also extend through the hydrophobic region and to its extracellular side.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36758.021</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical dimensions of the open pore.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The closed pore from the 3.35 Å resolution structure of the quiescent conformation of Orai (PDB 4HKR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2012</xref>).

The proximity of the carboxylate moieties within the glutamate ring undoubtedly elevates the pKa values of the Glu178 side chains dramatically, such that they each would carry only a fraction of their −1 charge at physiological pH on average. (We estimated the pKa values of the Glu178 side chain carboxylates using a finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann method, as implemented in the MCCE program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Georgescu et al., 2002</xref>), and obtained values &gt; 7, but caution that there is a large amount of uncertainty in these calculations. Nevertheless, it is well-established, in general, that amino acids in proteins can have dramatically altered ionization properties due the local environment of the surrounding protein compared with isolated amino acids in aqueous solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bashford and Karplus, 1990</xref>]).</p><p>The structure provides context to the following hypothetical ion selectivity mechanism involving multiple ions in single file that is partially derived from what is known about ion selectivity mechanisms in Cav channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sather and McCleskey, 2003</xref>). In the physiological context of approximately 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> outside the cell, we suspect that the selectivity filter of Orai toggles between having one and having two Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions present (although the two sites may have different free energies). When one Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is bound, it would likely be centered within the glutamate ring, whereas when two are present, the ions would be positioned with one above the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). The mutual repulsion between two Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions would allow either one to dissociate from the filter and when the lower one does it would begin to move through the pore. A single Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion remaining in the filter would not be easily displaced without the binding of a second Ca<sup>2+</sup> and thus its presence would block conduction of monovalent cations. Higher resolution structural information would undoubtedly provide additional insights into the mechanisms of ion selectivity in Orai.</p><p>Studies have shown that the M4-ext region of Orai interacts with a cytosolic portion of STIM that has a propensity to form coiled-coils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawasaki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Mutation of the residues corresponding to Ile316 and Leu319 in human Orai1, which mediate the coiled-coil packing in the crystal structures, prevents the interaction of Orai1 with STIM1 and subsequent channel activation (L273S and L276D mutations of human Orai1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Navarro-Borelly et al., 2008</xref>). In accord with the unlatching we observe, an additional body of evidence suggests that channel activation involves conformational changes in the M4-ext helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Navarro-Borelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Palty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tirado-Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). One possible mechanism of STIM binding is that unlatching would expose the M4-ext regions and make them available for interaction with STIM. Our observation that the unlatching of M4b from M3 does not necessarily open the pore is consistent with studies indicating that STIM1 can bind to loss-of-function mutants of human Orai1 that have constitutively closed pores, such as the pore-lining R91W mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Derler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McNally et al., 2013</xref>). Congruently, we observe that the corresponding K163W mutant of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Orai can adopt an unlatched conformation with a closed pore.</p><p>An important finding from our work is that the pore cannot open from the quiescent conformation directly. The paired M4-ext helices of the quiescent conformation necessitate the bend between M4a and M4b at Pro288 and they stabilize the interaction of M4b with M3 that would prevent the pore from opening. Therefore, the activation of Orai by STIM must involve different conformations of M4/M4-ext than those observed in the quiescent structure. On the other hand, the pore would be free to open once the latches are released. A logical hypothesis, which certainly requires further study, is that STIM activates the channel by binding to an unlatched conformation similar to what is observed in the unlatched-closed structure. An aspect of this hypothesis that is worth reiterating is that the M4 and M4-ext need not be perfectly straight for unlatching or for STIM binding.</p><p>Comparison of the three conformations of Orai revealed by the X-ray structures and the considerations mentioned above engender a hypothetical sequence for channel activation that proceeds from a quiescent state prior to interaction with STIM, through an unlatched conformation, and culminates with an open pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig12video1">Figure 12—video 1</xref>). In the quiescent conformation, clasped latches (e.g. the interactions between M4b and M3, which are stabilized by paired M4-ext helices) constrain the outer cytosolic diameter of the channel and prevent the pore from opening. Unlatching, that is, the release of the M4b-M3 interaction and the unpairing of M4-ext helices, could happen transiently and spontaneously, and would expose cytosolic docking sites for STIM. The engagement of STIM with Orai, via molecular interactions that remain to be resolved, would stabilize an unlatched conformation and the widening of the pore that permits Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Richard S Lewis as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher Miller (Reviewer #2); Alexander Sobolevsky (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Orai channels mediate store-operated calcium entry in nearly all cells and are essential regulators of the immune response, muscle development and function, and cellular activities such as gene expression, motility, and secretion. This paper by Hou et al. builds upon their earlier crystal structure of Orai in the closed state by describing an open state and a potential intermediate state between open and closed. Orai channels bearing the H206A mutation are constitutively open, and their crystal structure indicates an unexpectedly large dilation of the inner pore structure, with the C terminal (M4-ext) helices extending away from the channel rather than engaging in coiled-coil pairs as in the closed structure. They show that this extension is not sufficient to open the channel but may constitute a &quot;latch&quot; that must be released to allow pore dilation and opening. This paper is highly significant for providing insights into the mechanism of pore opening and the first view of the open pore structure of the Orai channel which suggests mechanisms underlying ion permeation and selectivity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers were highly enthusiastic about the work, calling it a crystallographic tour-de-force in which the authors make a 7 Å resolution structure speak clearly, and noted the clever usage of NCS averaging and employment of heavy atoms to strengthen the models and identify functionally important regions. No additional major experiments were thought necessary to support the conclusions, but a number of issues were identified that should be addressed in a revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>1) Is the H206A Orai<sub>cryst</sub> channel fully representative of the open state of native Orai activated by STIM binding? The main evidence for this comes from electrophysiological characterization of H134A Orai1 (the human homolog), which is rather sparse: it has a normal inwardly rectifying I/V and reversal potential in 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, compared to WT (Frischauf et al., 2017). This is a fairly limited characterization, and does not show that the pore is identical to STIM-activated WT Orai. In one reviewer's experience and in published studies (McNally et al., 2012), high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels mask moderate changes to the selectivity filter, which are easily detected under divalent-free conditions from measurements of the Na/Cs permeability ratio and K1/2 for Ca<sup>2+</sup> block. Given the lack of detailed information about permeation in H206A channels, the authors should acknowledge a degree of uncertainty about how closely the H206A resembles STIM-activated WT Orai and note that a more complete characterization will have to be done to firmly assign this structure to the naturally-occurring open state.</p><p>2) Is the WT Orai<sub>cryst</sub> structure, with its straightened M4-ext helices and closed pore, truly an intermediate in the activation sequence? This argument rests heavily on the idea that the &quot;quiescent&quot; form of Orai from the previous paper (with crossed M4-ext) is a naturally occurring state that somehow has to straighten the M4-ext's before it can bind STIM and open. However, the previous study made mutations in the 3-4 loop (P276R/P277R) that change the conformation of the M4s (Figure 8D) and help crystal formation through interactions of the crossed M4-ext's downstream of the coiled-coil. This raises the question of whether the crossed conformation occurs naturally or is a consequence of the mutations. In this regard, it would be good to know if the previous mutant could be activated by STIM, implying that it functions normally. Some discussion of this point, and the influence of the mutations in promoting the crossed configuration, would be helpful. An alternative view would be that the straight M4-ext conformation represents the true resting state of the channel and not an intermediate.</p><p>3) The repositioning of Ba<sup>2+</sup> in the open structure is significant. The authors should consider discussing this in light of work on the upper gate (Yamashita et al., 2017) which proposed a rotation of the upper part of the M1 helix. Rotation of the side chains could create a favorable site for binding in the plane of the glutamates.</p><p>4) Comparison of the Orai open and closed states makes an impression that the hydrophobic region of the pore changes very little with channel opening (Figure 4A). In the closed state, this region apparently blocks permeation as a hydrophobic seal. Does this region open enough for ions to go through? Of course, MD simulations might help to answer this question but given that this study is already overwhelmed with experiments and that MD results might also be ambiguous, can the authors provide additional analysis of their open state structure that might answer this question? For example, measuring the HOLE profile for the open state, similar to the one presented in Figure 1B for the closed state, even under the assumption of the same side chain conformations, might be helpful. Such a profile, for example, will give an opportunity to discuss whether the predicted expansion-type pore opening is wide enough (e.g. compared to pore openings in other ion channels) to support ion permeation or whether it would require rotations of pore-lining helices to &quot;hide&quot; the hydrophobic side chains, as proposed by the experiments of Yamashita et al. (2017).</p><p>5) Subsection “X-ray structure of H206A Orai<sub>cryst</sub> reveals an open conformation”, last paragraph: the authors postulate that the free-energy difference between closed and open may be only a few H bonds. This may apply to the H206A mutant, but is there any indication that the H206-S165 H bond would be broken during normal activation by STIM? Or any mutagenesis on Ser165 that bears upon H-bonding in the closed-open balance?</p><p>6) The SSS Orai protein does not conduct constitutively in liposomes, but is this because it is stuck in the closed state or because it fails to assemble properly? The V174A mutant is not a good control here, as it does not have the SSS mutations. It would be fairly straightforward to express SSS Orai with STIM in S2 cells and test for its ability to allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx after ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion. If it does, one would be able to say that the triple ring of basic residues is not solely responsible for channel closure in the resting state.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Structures reveal opening of the store-operated calcium channel Orai&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below (numbered as in the original review):</p><p>1) The new text here is a bit vague, and I suspect most readers will conclude that the H134A open state is identical to the STIM-induced open state. They are probably not identical, as Yeung et al. (2018) show that STIM1 shifts the Vrev of H134C to more positive potentials (i.e. it is not quite as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective as WT). It would be more accurate to describe it as &quot;highly similar&quot; rather than &quot;analogous&quot; to more clearly indicate it is not identical.</p><p>2) The new data in Figure 2 showing normal function of Orai<sub>cryst-RR</sub> in HEK cells are very clean, and the fact that it can be crystallized in the I4<sub>1</sub> form with a similar cell dimension clearly shows that the RR mutations do not prevent the extension of the M4 helices (subsection “Cloning, expression, purification and crystallization”, last paragraph).

The main evidence for this comes from electrophysiological characterization of H134A Orai1 (the human homolog), which is rather sparse: it has a normal inwardly rectifying I/V and reversal potential in 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, compared to WT (Frischauf et al., 2017). This is a fairly limited characterization, and does not show that the pore is identical to STIM-activated WT Orai. In one reviewer's experience and in published studies (McNally et al., 2012), high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels mask moderate changes to the selectivity filter, which are easily detected under divalent-free conditions from measurements of the Na/Cs permeability ratio and K1/2 for Ca<sup>2+</sup> block. Given the lack of detailed information about permeation in H206A channels, the authors should acknowledge a degree of uncertainty about how closely the H206A resembles STIM-activated WT Orai and note that a more complete characterization will have to be done to firmly assign this structure to the naturally-occurring open state.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We agree and now acknowledge this in the revised manuscript (in the Introduction and the “X-ray structure of H206A Orai<sub>cryst</sub> reveals an open conformation” section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is the WT Orai<sub>cryst</sub> structure, with its straightened M4-ext helices and closed pore, truly an intermediate in the activation sequence? This argument rests heavily on the idea that the &quot;quiescent&quot; form of Orai from the previous paper (with crossed M4-ext) is a naturally occurring state that somehow has to straighten the M4-ext's before it can bind STIM and open. However, the previous study made mutations in the 3-4 loop (P276R/P277R) that change the conformation of the M4s (Figure 8D) and help crystal formation through interactions of the crossed M4-ext's downstream of the coiled-coil. This raises the question of whether the crossed conformation occurs naturally or is a consequence of the mutations. In this regard, it would be good to know if the previous mutant could be activated by STIM, implying that it functions normally. Some discussion of this point, and the influence of the mutations in promoting the crossed configuration, would be helpful. An alternative view would be that the straight M4-ext conformation represents the true resting state of the channel and not an intermediate.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments. In the revised manuscript, we refer to the conformation with straightened M4/M4-ext helices and a closed pore as the “unlatched-closed” conformation. We now include data showing that the previously-crystallized construct from Hou et al. (2012), which contains the P276R/P277R mutations, functions as a CRAC channel that can be activated by STIM (Figure 2). We also note that the P276R/P277R construct also crystallizes in the same crystal form as the “unlatched-closed” conformation, and this indicates that Orai with the P276R/P277R mutations can have straightened M4/M4-ext helices. The structures indicate that the M4/M4-ext helices can adopt multiple conformations due to different degrees of bending at the Pro288 and SHK hinges. We hypothesize that the conformations of the M4/M4-ext helices are quite dynamic in the cell and that the conformations observed in the crystal structures represent only snapshots of particular conformations within an ensemble of possible ones. Nevertheless, our data indicate that unlatching (which we define as the unpairing of adjacent M4-ext helices and the release of the M4b-M3 interaction, and not necessarily complete straightening of M4/M4-ext) is necessary to allow the opening of the pore that is observed in the H206A open structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The repositioning of Ba<sup>2+</sup> in the open structure is significant. The authors should consider discussing this in light of work on the upper gate (Yamashita et al., 2017) which proposed a rotation of the upper part of the M1 helix. Rotation of the side chains could create a favorable site for binding in the plane of the glutamates.</p></disp-quote><p>Whether the M1 helix rotates slightly when the channel opens is interesting. However, it is not possible to discern this from our data. Subtle widening or shifting of the glutamates, which may or may not involve helix rotation, could cause the repositioning of Ba<sup>2+</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Comparison of the Orai open and closed states makes an impression that the hydrophobic region of the pore changes very little with channel opening (Figure 4A). In the closed state, this region apparently blocks permeation as a hydrophobic seal. Does this region open enough for ions to go through? Of course, MD simulations might help to answer this question but given that this study is already overwhelmed with experiments and that MD results might also be ambiguous, can the authors provide additional analysis of their open state structure that might answer this question? For example, measuring the HOLE profile for the open state, similar to the one presented in Figure 1B for the closed state, even under the assumption of the same side chain conformations, might be helpful. Such a profile, for example, will give an opportunity to discuss whether the predicted expansion-type pore opening is wide enough (e.g. compared to pore openings in other ion channels) to support ion permeation or whether it would require rotations of pore-lining helices to &quot;hide&quot; the hydrophobic side chains, as proposed by the experiments of Yamashita et al. (2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We now include a figure showing the approximate dimensions of the open pore based on the atomic coordinates (Figure 11). Although there is a large degree of uncertainty in this analysis due to the low resolution of the diffraction data, the widening of the hydrophobic region appears to be sufficient to allow ion flow. Due to the limited resolution of the data, we prefer to refrain from speculating further. The relatively narrow hydrophobic region of Orai in comparison to other open channel pores may be one reason that Orai conducts ions considerably slower than most other ion channels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “X-ray structure of H206A Orai<sub>cryst</sub> reveals an open conformation”, last paragraph: the authors postulate that the free-energy difference between closed and open may be only a few H bonds. This may apply to the H206A mutant, but is there any indication that the H206-S165 H bond would be broken during normal activation by STIM? Or any mutagenesis on Ser165 that bears upon H-bonding in the closed-open balance?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not intend to speculate on possible changes in hydrogen bonding and have removed the phrase from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The SSS Orai protein does not conduct constitutively in liposomes, but is this because it is stuck in the closed state or because it fails to assemble properly? The V174A mutant is not a good control here, as it does not have the SSS mutations. It would be fairly straightforward to express SSS Orai with STIM in S2 cells and test for its ability to allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx after ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion. If it does, one would be able to say that the triple ring of basic residues is not solely responsible for channel closure in the resting state.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a substantial amount of additional data on SSS Orai (Figure 7, and Figure 7—figure supplement 1). Purified SSS Orai appears to be properly folded as judged by SEC (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A). The V174A mutant is only included to demonstrate that the assay (Figure 7A) is capable of detecting Na<sup>+</sup> flux. We now show that SSS Orai does not function as a CRAC channel when co-expressed with STIM in HEK239 cells (Figure 7B). This somewhat surprising result is discussed briefly.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below (numbered as in the original review):</p><p>1) The new text here is a bit vague, and I suspect most readers will conclude that the H134A open state is identical to the STIM-induced open state. They are probably not identical, as Yeung et al. (2018) show that STIM1 shifts the Vrev of H134C to more positive potentials (i.e. it is not quite as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective as WT). It would be more accurate to describe it as &quot;highly similar&quot; rather than &quot;analogous&quot; to more clearly indicate it is not identical.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, the wording in has been changed to “highly similar”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The new data in Figure 2 showing normal function of Oraicryst-RR in HEK cells are very clean, and the fact that it can be crystallized in the I4<sub>1</sub> form with a similar cell dimension clearly shows that the RR mutations do not prevent the extension of the M4 helices (subsection “Cloning, expression, purification and crystallization”, last paragraph). These data should be shown as a figure supplement. But the main question here was whether the latched state is really the physiological &quot;quiescent&quot; state, or is induced by the pro to arg mutations. Assuming that WT Oraicryst was never observed in the latched state, please explain in the text why you think the mutations are unlikely to artificially induce the latched state.</p></disp-quote><p>In the section entitled “Additional X-ray structures reveal an unlatched-closed conformation” we now explain why we think that the pro to arg mutations are unlikely to artificially induce the latched state. Because Figure 2 supports the conclusion that the Orai<sub>cryst-RR</sub> construct functions normally, and because inclusion of the experiments shown in Figure 2 was requested during the review process, we would like to retain Figure 2 as a main figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The new diagram of the pore profile (Figure 11) looks good.
