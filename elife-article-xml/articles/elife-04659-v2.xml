conditions. Although nuclear export of tRNAs has been well documented, the import machinery is poorly understood. Here, we identified Ssa2p, a major cytoplasmic Hsp70 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, as a tRNA-binding protein whose deletion compromises nuclear accumulation of tRNAs upon nutrient starvation. Ssa2p recognizes several structural features of tRNAs through its nucleotide-binding domain, but prefers loosely-folded tRNAs, suggesting that Ssa2p has a chaperone-like activity for RNAs. Ssa2p also binds Nup116, one of the yeast nucleoporins. Sis1p and Ydj1p, cytoplasmic co-chaperones for Ssa proteins, were also found to contribute to the tRNA import. These results unveil a novel function of the Ssa2p system as a tRNA carrier for nuclear import by a novel mode of substrate recognition. Such Ssa2p-mediated tRNA import likely contributes to quality control of cytosolic tRNAs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04659.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04659.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04659.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants, animals, and fungi all store their DNA inside their cells within a structure called the nucleus, which is surrounded by a nuclear envelope that separates it from the rest of the cell. This DNA contains the instructions to build proteins, but proteins are actually built elsewhere in the cell, outside of the nucleus. This means that the instructions must first be copied and then carried out through pores in the nuclear envelope before they can be decoded to build the protein.</p><p>Outside of the nucleus, molecules called transfer RNAs (or tRNAs for short) are involved in the decoding process by carrying the required building blocks to the cell's protein-making machinery. The tRNA molecules can also shuttle back and forth, in and out of the nucleus. In yeast and mammals, the localization of the tRNA molecules depends on the availability of nutrients; if nutrients are scarce, then more tRNAs are moved into the nucleus. While the mechanism by which tRNAs exit the nucleus is well characterized, little is known about the movement in the opposite direction.</p><p>Takano et al. have now analyzed how tRNAs are transported into the nucleus in yeast cells by identifying the proteins that bind tightly to them. These experiments revealed that a protein called Ssa2p interacts with tRNAs. This protein belongs to a large family of proteins called Hsp70 chaperones that assist other proteins to fold into their correct shapes.</p><p>Takano et al. observed that Ssa2p tends to bind to tRNAs that are poorly folded, suggesting that it may work like other well-known chaperones. Furthermore, cells that lack Ssa2p were shown to be unable to efficiently transport tRNAs into the nucleus when nutrients were limited. These results together demonstrate that the yeast protein Ssa2p acts as a carrier for transporting tRNAs into the nucleus; further work is now required to understand whether this mechanism is also found in other species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04659.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04659.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>tRNA</kwd><kwd>nuclear import</kwd><kwd>Hsp70</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (RNA regulation) 23112708</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yoshihisa</surname><given-names>Tohru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yoshihisa</surname><given-names>Tohru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) 22570139, for Challenging Exploratory Research 26650009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yoshihisa</surname><given-names>Tohru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A major cytoplasmic chaperone, Ssa2p, acts as a nuclear import carrier for tRNAs upon nutrient starvation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most cytoplasmic RNAs are exported unidirectionally from the nucleus across the nuclear envelope (NE) after their birth and appropriate processing in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lei and Silver, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grünwald et al., 2011</xref>). tRNAs, however, are unique among major classes of cytoplasmic RNAs in that they shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shaheen and Hopper, 2005</xref>; for review; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yoshihisa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Phizicky and Hopper, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hopper, 2013</xref>). The first indication of nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of tRNAs was the discovery of cytoplasmic splicing of pre-tRNAs in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yoshihisa et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2007</xref>) in spite of the existence of small amounts of mature tRNAs in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarkar and Hopper, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grosshans et al., 2000</xref>). Subsequently, we and others demonstrated that mature tRNAs move from the cytoplasm back into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shaheen and Hopper, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takano et al., 2005</xref>). Nuclear import of tRNAs has also been observed in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zaitseva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shaheen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyagawa et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that eukaryotic cells are equipped with mechanisms that allow bidirectional movement of tRNAs between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.</p><p>The export of tRNAs has been well studied. Importin β-family proteins have been identified as tRNA carriers across the nuclear pore complex (NPC) on the NE. Los1p/exportin-t is considered as a primary export carrier of mature tRNAs in yeast, plants, and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arts et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hellmuth et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kutay et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarkar and Hopper, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li and Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook et al., 2009</xref>). Besides, yeast Los1p exports pre-tRNAs for cytoplasmic splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarkar and Hopper, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yoshihisa et al., 2003</xref>). Msn5p/exportin-5, another importin β homologue, provides an alternative export pathway in yeast and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohnsack et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calado et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Okada et al., 2009</xref>) while Msn5p/exportin-5 is the main carrier of tRNAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Büssing et al., 2010</xref>). These importin β proteins appear to play different but overlapping roles in the export of mature tRNAs in the yeast; Los1p exports both newly synthesized and re-imported tRNAs while Msn5p exports only re-imported tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eswara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murthi et al., 2010</xref>). In both cases, the export of spliced or mature tRNAs is coupled to a tRNA quality control step governed by nuclear aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) to support efficient export of aminoacylated tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lund and Dahlberg, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azad et al., 2001</xref>). Efficient tRNA export relies on both nuclear and cytoplasmic factors, like Utp8p, Utp9p, Cex1p, so on<italic>.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McGuire and Mangroo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Strub et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eswara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nozawa et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, mechanisms of tRNA import into the nucleus are only poorly characterized. Nuclear import of tRNAs can be blocked by depletion of intracellular ATP, indicating that the process is energy-dependent. However, tRNA import can also operate even in the absence of a gradient of GTP-bound Ran across the NE, which is the main energy source for many macromolecular transport mediated by importin β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grünwald et al., 2011</xref>). It is known that various types of tRNAs are imported into the nucleus. Both authentic tRNAs and some types of damaged tRNAs, such as CCA-less tRNAs, are imported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takano et al., 2005</xref>). Wybutosine formation on tRNA-Phe<sub>GAA</sub> is initiated by nuclear Trm5p after cytoplasmic splicing of pre-tRNA-Phe<sub>GAA</sub>, indicating that nuclear import of a spliced intermediate precedes this modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ohira and Suzuki, 2011</xref>). In addition, spliced tRNA species but hypomodified and possessing 5′- and 3′ extensions, which are accidentally leaked from the nucleus in certain mutants, are retrograded into the nucleus to be repaired or degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kramer and Hopper, 2013</xref>). These findings are in great contrast to the above-mentioned selective export of aminoacylated mature tRNAs. Collectively, tRNA import and export mechanisms with different specificities were predicted to maintain the quality of pre-existing mature tRNAs in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yoshihisa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kramer and Hopper, 2013</xref>). However, identity of the carrier that mediates tRNA import remains totally unknown. One possible import carrier is an importin-β homologue Mtr10p, which was originally identified as an import carrier for Npl3p, as mRNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Senger et al., 1998</xref>), and was shown to cause a defect in tRNA import when mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shaheen and Hopper, 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, no evidence has been reported for tRNA binding by Mtr10p.</p><p>Notably, balance between the import and export of tRNAs across the NE is determined by the physiological conditions. For instance, depletion of various nutrients, such as amino acids, phosphate, and glucose, results in nuclear accumulation of tRNAs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hurto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Whitney et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, such alteration of tRNA localization affects translation efficiency of certain mRNAs that encode enzymes for amino acid biosynthesis, suggesting that retrieval of tRNAs from the cytosol has, at least, a regulatory role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu and Hopper, 2013</xref>). To alter the tRNA balance, signal transduction pathways mediated by PKA and TOR, but not Gcn2p, facilitate this transport regulation in the yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Whitney et al., 2007</xref>). Although several kinases were shown to act on the regulation of tRNA transport, tRNA export carriers Los1p or Msn5p are not phosphorylated in vivo according to the nutrient status, and they are not substrates for PKA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pierce et al., 2014</xref>). Similar regulation could operate not only in fungi, but also in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shaheen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyagawa et al., 2012</xref>), while some reports argue that this is specific to some fungal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chafe et al., 2011</xref>). A model was proposed that, while tRNA import is constitutive, export is fine-tuned, depending on the growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eswara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murthi et al., 2010</xref>). However, evidence is lacking for constitutive import of tRNAs at the same rate irrespective of nutrient conditions. It is thus essential to identify the factors mediating the tRNA import, which are possible targets of the regulation.</p><p>Here, we describe the identification and characterization of Ssa2p, one of the major cytosolic Hsp70 in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Werner-Washburne et al., 1987</xref>), as a potential tRNA import carrier. While Hsp70 proteins are a class of molecular chaperones that bind and release proteins with exposed hydrophobic segments in an ATPase cycle-dependent manner to affect protein conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Young et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</xref>), in vivo and in vitro data indicate that Ssa2p plays a pivotal role in nuclear import of tRNAs, and that this process is achieved through a novel mode of substrate recognition through its nuclear binding domain (NBD).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of Ssa2p as a novel tRNA import factor</title><p>To search for carrier(s) of tRNA import into the nucleus, a biochemical approach was adopted to identify new tRNA-binding proteins. We previously showed that both full-length and CCA-less tRNAs are imported into the nucleus, and that this nuclear import is ATP-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takano et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, we postulated that the putative import carrier(s) does not recognize the 3′ end of tRNAs and binds tRNAs in a nucleotide triphosphate-dependent or sensitive manner. To identify such proteins, tRNA-agarose was prepared, in which yeast tRNAs were immobilized via their 3′ ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, a yeast cytosolic fraction depleted of endogenous tRNAs by anion exchange chromatography was applied to the tRNA-agarose in the presence or absence of 3 mM ATP. Bound proteins were subsequently eluted from the tRNA-agarose with 1.5 M NaCl. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the intensity of some bands varied depending on the absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> closed arrowheads) or presence of ATP (open arrowheads). Bands in the eluates marked by arrows were then subjected to peptide fingerprinting. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Tef1p (eEF1A in the yeast) and Eno2p (enolase) were identified, both of which are already known as tRNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nagata et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Entelis et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, RNA binding proteins, such as Pab1p, Gbp2p and Sro9p, were also detected. Among the proteins associated with the tRNA-resin in an ATP-sensitive manner, Ssa1p and/or Ssa2p, two major cytosolic Hsp70s with highly homologous sequences, were of interest because mammalian Hsp70 (Hsc70) was shown to interact with an AU-rich element, which defines short-lived mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henics et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laroia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, the yeast <italic>ssa1</italic> mutant strain exhibits defective degradation of mRNAs possessing this AU-rich element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duttagupta et al., 2003</xref>).

When analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-FLAG antibody and by Northern blotting with an anti-mature tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), only immunoprecipitates of Ssa2p-FLAG in the absence of ATP contained tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> at levels above background, indicating that the Ssa protein we identified as a tRNA-binding protein was Ssa2p.</p><p>Next, the question whether Ssa2p is indeed involved in the nuclear import of tRNAs in vivo was addressed. tRNA import was assessed by measuring nuclear accumulation of tRNAs in a <italic>los∆1 msn5∆</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takano et al., 2005</xref>) and by examining nuclear accumulation of tRNAs under nutrient starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shaheen and Hopper, 2005</xref>). First, an <italic>ssa1∆</italic> or <italic>ssa2∆</italic> mutation was introduced into the <italic>los1∆ msn5∆</italic> strain, and the localization of tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub>, encoded by intron-containing genes and initiator tRNA-Met (tRNA-iMet) encoded by intronless genes was analyzed by FISH. Under normal growth conditions, the <italic>los1∆ msn5∆</italic> cells accumulate large amounts of mature tRNAs in the nucleus. This tRNA gradient across the NE was abolished by treating the cells with 2-deoxyglucose and NaN<sub>3</sub> and was re-established by removing these drugs in the presence of thiolutin, an inhibitor of all the three RNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). If Ssa2p is involved in the nuclear import of tRNAs, the <italic>los1∆ msn5∆ ssa2∆</italic> mutant would accumulate less mature tRNAs in the nucleus and fail to re-establish the tRNA gradient across the NE during energy recovery. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, neither the <italic>ssa1∆</italic> nor <italic>ssa2∆</italic> mutants exhibits altered tRNA localization in a <italic>los1∆ msn5∆</italic> background. Furthermore, <italic>ssa2∆</italic> mutant cells re-established the tRNA gradient across the NE after energy depletion like the other strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, bottom row). These results indicate that neither Ssa2p nor Ssa1p plays a major role in tRNA import under normal growth conditions.</p><p>Then, an effect of the <italic>ssa2</italic> mutation on tRNA import was assessed under the conditions of nutrient starvation. Wild-type, <italic>ssa1∆</italic>, and <italic>ssa2∆</italic> cells cultured in the YPD medium were transferred to the amino acid-starvation medium SD+Ura, Ade (SD), and the localization of tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> and tRNA-iMet was analyzed by FISH. While the wild-type and <italic>ssa1∆</italic> cells accumulated both tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> and tRNA-iMet in the nucleus under these conditions within 2 hr, relatively lower amounts of tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> and tRNA-iMet were observed in the <italic>ssa2∆</italic> nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also examined three other tRNA species, tRNA-Lys<sub>CUU</sub>, tRNA-Lys<sub>UUU</sub>, and tRNA-Tyr<sub>GUA</sub>, in FISH, and found that all the tRNAs were apparently affected by <italic>ssa2∆</italic> mutation while the effects of <italic>ssa1∆</italic> mutation were not obvious if any (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The extent of nuclear accumulation under starvation conditions and the effect of <italic>ssa2∆</italic> were variable among tRNA species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and its supplement). To confirm difference of the two <italic>ssa</italic> mutations in tRNA accumulation upon starvation more in detail, quantitative analyses of the FISH images were carried out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, table). While the average nuclear accumulation indices (NAIs), rations of nuclear FISH signals against cytosolic signals, of tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> in the wild-type, <italic>ssa1∆</italic>, and <italic>ssa2∆</italic> cells were nearly equal when the cells were grown in YPD, the NAIs of these strains became 1.52 ± 0.09, 1.58 ± 0.10, and 1.14 ± 0.25, respectively, when the cells were starved, revealing an apparent difference between tRNA import in the wild-type cells and that in the <italic>ssa2∆</italic> cells. We noticed that, under the starvation conditions, variation of NAIs of individual cells increased if compared with that in the rich medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) while average NAIs of biological replicates fell into a narrower range. Deletion of either of the other two <italic>SSA</italic> genes, <italic>SSA3</italic> and <italic>SSA4</italic>, which are only expressed under stress conditions, had no impact on tRNA accumulation under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, table). When the effect of simultaneous deletion of <italic>SSA1</italic> and <italic>SSA2</italic> genes was examined, the double deletion did not result in the obvious additive effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Thus, we examined whether Ssa2p acts in the same pathway as Mtr10p, using an <italic>ssa2∆ GAL7p-MTR10</italic> double mutant strain. As some controversy exists regarding the involvement of Mtr10p in the tRNA import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shaheen and Hopper, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chafe et al., 2011</xref>), the promoter shut-off strain was used to circumvent any possible adaptation effects due to the <italic>MTR10</italic> deletion, which causes a strong growth defect. These strains were grown in YPGal medium and then grown in YPD for 18 hr to shut-off the expression of <italic>MTR10</italic> before being subjected to nutrient starvation. As reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shaheen and Hopper (2005)</xref>, nuclear accumulation defects were evident in the <italic>MTR10</italic> shut-off strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>mtr10</italic>↓). The <italic>MTR10</italic> shut-off had a stronger effect on tRNA distribution than the <italic>ssa2Δ</italic> single mutation. The double mutant showed an additive decrease in the signal intensity of nuclear tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>ssa2Δ mtr10</italic>↓), and signal quantification revealed that the average NAI of the starved double mutant (0.87 ± 0.04) was clearly below those observed for the <italic>mtr10</italic> and <italic>ssa2Δ</italic> single mutants (0.98 ± 0.04 and 1.11 ± 0.07, respectively), and was far below that observed for the wild type strain (1.30 ± 0.10). Student's <italic>t</italic>-test indicated that the probability that the NAIs of the <italic>mtr10</italic> single and <italic>mtr10 ssa2∆</italic> double mutants were the same was only 0.037 while the difference between those of the <italic>mtr10</italic> single and <italic>mtr10 ssa1∆</italic> double mutants was not significant (p = 0.92). Similar quantitative results were obtained for tRNA-iMet (data not shown). These results support the idea that Ssa2p and Mtr10p act independently in parallel pathways for tRNA import under starvation conditions.</p><p>If the nuclear import of tRNAs by Ssa2p is up-regulated under starvation conditions, localization of Ssa2p may be affected by starvation. Thus, localization of FLAG-tagged Ssa proteins was monitored by immunofluorescence. While clear exclusion of Ssa1p and Ssa2p from the nucleus was observed both in rich and poor media, a slight but distinct increase in the nuclear signals of both Ssa proteins was observed when the cells were incubated in SD+Ura, Ade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In summary, these results indicate that Ssa2p plays a pivotal role in the nuclear import of tRNAs under starvation conditions, while the other Ssa proteins, including Ssa1p, have a minor, if not at all, role in this process. Furthermore, Ssa2p may provide a novel nuclear transport pathway independent of Mtr10p.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>In vitro properties of Ssa proteins as tRNA binding proteins</title><p>To investigate biochemical characteristics of the interaction between Ssa proteins and tRNAs, we examined the ability of recombinant Ssa proteins to bind tRNAs directly in vitro. Interactions between mammalian Hsc70 and short-lived RNAs with the AU-rich element were previously demonstrated by the label transfer assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henics et al., 1999</xref>). A similar assay was first employed to test whether yeast Ssa proteins bind the AU-rich element in vitro. Both Ssa1p and Ssa2p received radioactivity from <sup>32</sup>P-labeled (AUUU)<sub>5</sub> RNA but not from (ACCC)<sub>5</sub> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and label transfer was dependent on UV-irradiation and sensitive to ATP. Besides, no label transfer was observed when BSA was used as a control protein. These results demonstrate that the yeast Hsp70s have the ability to bind certain RNA molecules.</p><p>Next, tRNAs were used as label transfer substrates. Both Ssa1p and Ssa2p received radioactivity from <sup>32</sup>P-labeled tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> in an ATP-sensitive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>) with only a marginal difference between the capacity of the two Ssa proteins to recognize the tRNA in vitro. This is in marked contrast to the effects of <italic>ssa1∆</italic> and <italic>ssa2∆</italic> mutations on tRNA import in vivo. Because a tRNA possesses an un-paired adenosine on its 3′ terminus, this adenosine might be recognized by Ssa proteins as an analogue of ADP or ATP, which is usually bound by the nucleotide-binding cleft of Hsp70s. To exclude this possibility, label transfer was examined using CCA-less tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub>, which starts with the 5′ guanosine and ends with the 3′ cytidine. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, both Ssa1p and Ssa2p received radioactivity efficiently from the CCA-less tRNA. Label transfer with an intron-containing pre-tRNA was also performed and revealed that Ssa proteins bind tRNAs irrespective of their anticodon loop structure. When the specificity of tRNA recognition by Ssa proteins was tested by competition experiments with short RNAs, chemical amounts of in vitro-transcribed tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> efficiently competed with the radioactive amount of tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> for label transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lanes ‘tRNA’) while only limited competition was observed with single-stranded homo-oligo-ribonucleotides (A<sub>30</sub>, U<sub>30</sub>, and G<sub>30</sub>) or a double-stranded homo-oligomer (A-U)<sub>30</sub>. These results indicate that Ssa proteins specifically recognize tRNAs in an ATP-sensitive manner via a mechanism that is not mediated through the 3′ end adenosine or the anti-codon loop of tRNAs, and that these properties resemble those observed in vivo.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04659.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Ssa proteins directly and specifically interact with tRNAs in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In vitro-transcribed tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> molecules shown in the lower panel (full-length [full], CCA-less [-CCA], and precursor [pre]) were subjected to label transfer assays with recombinant Ssa1p or Ssa2p in the absence (−) or presence (+) of 2.5 mM ATP. <sup>32</sup>P-labeled Ssa proteins are indicated by an arrowhead.

In particular, tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> was a potent substrate for label transfer while tRNA-Phe<sub>GAA</sub> was a very poor substrate irrespective of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled nucleotides used for in vitro transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results suggest that Ssa proteins bind only a subset of tRNAs, or that appropriate positioning of radiolabeled nucleotides on a tRNA molecule is essential for efficient label transfer. To distinguish between these two possibilities, competition experiments were performed with radiolabeled tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> and various non-labeled tRNAs. These experiments allowed us to examine the difference in affinity between unmodified and fully-modified tRNAs, as well. Chemical amounts of tRNAs were transcribed in vitro, and several isoacceptor tRNAs were purified from yeast by chaplet column chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suzuki and Suzuki, 2007</xref>). Competition experiments revealed that all tRNAs, including tRNA-Phe<sub>GAA</sub>, competed with radiolabeled tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> for label transfer even though their competition efficiencies were variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). It should be noted that unmodified tRNAs-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> was a more potent competitor than the fully-modified tRNA. These results indicate that various tRNAs are recognized by Ssa proteins with different affinities and that certain nucleotide positions of a tRNA molecule may offer the sites for this recognition. The above results also show that Ssa proteins recognize differences in structural characteristics between unmodified and fully-modified tRNAs.</p><p>We next examined if, in addition to the primary sequence, the higher-order structure of tRNAs is required for efficient label transfer to Ssa proteins. For this purpose, we first used hybridization of the tRNA substrate with an antisense oligonucleotide to disrupt the tRNA secondary structure. Indeed, an antisense oligonucleotide against the 5′ half of tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub>, but not an unrelated oligonucleotide, inhibited the label transfer only when hybridized with the substrate by denaturation and annealing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Heat denaturation and quick cooling of the tRNA substrate alone did not affect label transfer efficiency, probably due to rapid refolding of the tRNA molecule. The above possibility was further tested with tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> mutants that exhibit altered tRNA structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Introduction of G18A and U54C mutations, which disrupts the interaction between the D and TΨC loops, reduced label transfer efficiency. On the other hand, destabilization of the acceptor stem by introducing G69C or G68C substitutions resulted in higher label transfer efficiency, while a C67G mutation reduced the efficiency of label transfer. Both of these positive and negative effects induced by acceptor stem mutations were minimized by compensatory mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, gray bars). Similar partial destabilization of the acceptor stem of other tRNA species is recognized as the degradation flag by CCA transferase to introduce an unusual CCACCA sequence instead of the normal CCA to the 3′-end of the tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wilusz et al., 2011</xref>). We tested whether Ssa proteins also prefer such mutant tRNAs. Indeed, replacement of the acceptor stem of human tRNA-Leu<sub>AAG</sub> with acceptor-like stems from unstable tRNA-like noncoding RNAs (mouse MALAT1-associated cytoplasmic small RNA and MEM β RNA) enhanced recognition by Ssa2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This is also true even for single replacement of the G1-C71 Watson-Crick pair with the non-Watson-Crick pair (G1•U71) in tRNA-Arg<sub>UGC</sub>. These results suggest that Ssa proteins recognize the overall structure of tRNAs, and prefer tRNAs with a destabilized acceptor stem but with a stable core structure.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04659.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Ssa proteins recognize higher order structures of tRNAs and prefer a destabilized acceptor stem.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <sup>32</sup>P-labeled tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> was mixed without (no, white bar) or, with its anti-sense (Pro<sub>UGG</sub>, black bar) or unrelated control (anti-sense of Trp<sub>CCA</sub>, gray bar) oligo-DNA. tRNA/oligo-DNA mixtures were heat-denatured and annealed to form DNA-RNA hybrids (‘heat and annealing’) as indicated on the left.

Thus, we examined whether Ssa proteins utilize their SBD for recognition of tRNAs.

We introduced several mutations altering conserved amino acid residues in the nucleotide-binding cleft to GST-Ssa-NBD fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mutations affecting efficiency of ATP hydrolysis and its activation, namely F66L and K69Q, enhanced tRNA binding while those compromising nucleotide binding/exchange (G199D) reduced the binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Those mutations in the NBD that alter structural response to the nucleotide state (E228Q, D229N) caused virtually no changes in the tRNA binding. These results indicate that particular residues in the NBD are responsible for tRNA recognition by Ssa proteins, and that the structural features of the ATP/ADP binding state are important for the tRNA binding. Interestingly, the NBDs of Ssa1p and Ssa2p responded differently to these mutations; the Ssa1p-NBD responded more strongly to F66L and K69Q than the Ssa2p-NDB. More prominently, E173S and T201A, which affect the nucleotide binding/exchange, only caused negative effects on the Ssa2p-NBD, suggesting that these differences in in vitro-binding of tRNAs might be the reason why Ssa2p but not Ssa1p is responsible for nuclear import of tRNAs in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ssa proteins interact with a certain nucleoporin</title><p>If Ssa2p is directly involved in the transport of tRNAs through the NPC, Ssa2p needs to interact with nucleoporins (Nups), components of the NPC.

Hsp40/DnaJ co-chaperones accelerate the ATPase activity of Hsp70s and pass specific substrates to corresponding Hsp70s to control their functionality in a spatiotemporal manner, while co-chaperones, GrpE, Bag-1, and Hsp110, act as nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Young et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</xref>). To examine whether certain yeast homologues of DnaJ are involved in nuclear accumulation of tRNAs under starvation conditions, three major cytoplasmic DnaJ proteins, Sis1p, and Ydj1p, which are specific for Ssa proteins, and Zuo1p, which is specific for another class of cytoplasmic Hsp70s, Ssb proteins, were chosen for further analyses. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, both the <italic>sis1-151</italic> and <italic>ydj1∆</italic> mutants showed an apparent defect in the nuclear accumulation of tRNAs under starvation conditions while the <italic>zuo1∆</italic> mutant cells were able to accumulate tRNAs in the nucleus.

If the ATPase activation of Ssa2p is required for tRNA import in the cytosol, a nuclear NEF for Ssa2p may contribute to nuclear import, as in the case of GEF for Ran GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grünwald et al., 2011</xref>). In yeast, such an NEF is Snl1p, a Bag-1 homologue localized on the nucleoplasmic side of the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63a">Sondermann et al., 2002</xref>).

Nevertheless, the effects of the <italic>sis1</italic> and <italic>ydj1</italic> mutations support the assumption that the ATPase cycle of Ssa2p plays an essential role in tRNA import.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Hsp70 is a versatile Swiss Army knife for the protein world through its binding and releasing of protein substrates with destabilized structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Werner-Washburne et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nelson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">James et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daugaard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vos et al., 2008</xref>). Unexpectedly, in the biochemical search for factors driving the nuclear import of tRNAs, we identified a major cytosolic Hsp70, Ssa2p, as a novel tRNA-binding protein that affects tRNA distribution under starvation conditions. Although Ssa2p has a highly homologous counterpart, Ssa1p, our findings, especially in vivo results, revealed difference between Ssa2p and Ssa1p in their involvement in nuclear import of tRNAs. And the following lines of evidence support the idea that Ssa2p has a novel function in intracellular dynamics of tRNAs as their nuclear import carrier. First, the <italic>ssa2∆</italic>, but not <italic>ssa1∆</italic>, mutant is defective in nuclear accumulation of the tRNAs analyzed so far under nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Besides, the <italic>ssa1∆ ssa2∆</italic> double mutant does not show any additive defect in tRNA import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Because we have not analyzed all the isodecoder tRNAs in the yeast, there remains a possibility that nuclear import of certain tRNAs is driven by Ssa1p. Second, Ssa2p binds various tRNA species specifically and directly both in vivo and in vitro, while tRNA binding of Ssa1p was only observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig4">Figures 1D, 4</xref>). We noticed that mutations in the conserved residues in the NBD of the Ssa proteins affect the tRNA binding ability in vitro differently between Ssa1p and Ssa2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). A possible explanation for the difference between the in vivo and in vitro results is that, in vivo, an auxiliary factor(s), such as co-chaperones regulating the ATPase cycle of Ssa2p, may confer specificity to Ssa2p as a tRNA import factor, or that the small difference in the tRNA binding of the two NBDs in vitro is enhanced to yield labor assignment between Ssa1p and Ssa2p in vivo when these multi-functional proteins are surrounded by variety of protein and RNA substrates. Third, Ssa proteins are known to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and their nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution is regulated according to environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shulga et al., 1999</xref>). Indeed, we observed a marginal but reproducible increase in the nuclear pool of Ssa2p-FLAG upon amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Such alteration of transport carrier distribution was reported recently for Los1p, Msn5p, so on upon glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang and Hopper, 2014</xref>). Fourth, Ssa proteins interact with the FG-repeat region of Nup116p, and support association of tRNAs to Nup116p, suggesting that Ssa2p can enter the NPC with tRNAs under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Fifth, we demonstrated the involvement of Sis1p and Ydj1p, major cytoplasmic DnaJs for Ssa proteins, in tRNA import in vivo, while such effect is not observed in the <italic>zuo1∆</italic> mutant, which is defective in Ssb-protein specific DnaJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These results collectively suggest that tRNA loading onto Ssa2p may be assisted by these cytosolic co-chaperones specific for the Ssa proteins, and ATP hydrolysis by Ssa2p may drive upward transport of tRNAs across the NPC. Therefore, Ssa2p is the first factor that assists tRNA import by direct binding to tRNAs, shuttles between the cytosol and the nucleus, interacts with the NPC component, and couples the tRNA transport with energy release.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04659.021</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Major cytosolic DnaJ homologues of Ssa proteins are involved in tRNA import under starvation conditions.</title><p>tRNA localization under starvation conditions in mutants of major cytoplasmic DnaJ homologues (<italic>SIS1</italic>, <italic>YDJ1</italic> and <italic>ZUO1</italic>) or a nuclear Bag-1 homologue (<italic>SNL1</italic>) was analyzed by FISH.

Although we could not completely negate the above possibility so far, these data rather support the idea that Ssa2p and Mtr10p form parallel and independent pathways, as the case of Los1p and Msn5p in tRNA export. Another potential non-importin candidate for an Ssa2p import carrier is Opi10p, a yeast homologue of Hikeshi, which functions as a nuclear import carrier of mammalian Hsp70 under heat stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kose et al., 2012</xref>).

Although there are several other possibilities for involvement of the Ssa2p chaperone system in tRNA import, from the collective pieces of experimental results, we primarily propose that Ssa2p acts as an import carrier of tRNAs across the NPC. Since the <italic>ssa2∆</italic> phenotype is only obvious under starvation conditions, Ssa2p may provide a secondary pathway to accommodate high demand for the tRNA import under these conditions. In other words, the Ssa2p pathway may confer a regulatory capability to the tRNA nuclear import, responding to growth conditions like the case of tRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murthi et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang and Hopper, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pierce et al., 2014</xref>). We speculate that Ssa2p also has some contribution to basal nuclear import of tRNAs under normal conditions by co-operating with the Mtr10p pathway, and that quantitative regulation of the Ssa2p pathway, but not complete on-and-off, enables enhancement of nuclear import under starvation conditions.</p><p>As mentioned above, we observed a direct interaction between Ssa proteins and tRNAs, which is governed by a mode different from that for recognition of protein substrates by Hsp70. tRNA binding is saturable and is competed specifically by other tRNA molecules but not by a protein substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figures 4, 6A</xref>). We also found that tRNA binding takes place through the NBD, but not through the SBD, of Ssa proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). On the other hand, Ssa proteins bind tRNAs that lack an adenosine at their 3' terminus, so that a tRNA molecule is not just a mimic of monomeric adenine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Examination of the crystal structure of bovine Hsc70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>) indicates that the ATP-binding cleft is too narrow to accommodate the acceptor stem of the tRNA molecule while the several mutations introduced into this region affected tRNA binding of Ssa proteins, especially Ssa2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), suggesting that the ATP/ADP-binding state of Ssa2p alters an unidentified tRNA-binding interface on the NBD.</p><p>While disruption of the overall tRNA structure decreases the tRNA affinity for Ssa proteins, some mutations on the acceptor stem enhance Ssa protein recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, Ssa proteins prefer unmodified tRNAs to fully-modified tRNAs for their binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Therefore, Ssa proteins appear to recognize some characteristics of the three-dimensional structure of tRNA molecules, though preferably loosely-folded structures of tRNAs. Although the tRNA import system(s) seems to accept a variety of tRNA species, including matured and stably folded tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takano et al., 2005</xref>), such preference for unmodified or loosely-folded tRNAs may well contribute to the quality control of cytosolic tRNAs. Recent studies of rapid tRNA decay (RTD), which degrades hypomodified aberrant tRNAs in the cytosol, revealed that the RTD system also recognizes tRNAs with some defects in their acceptor stem, and a part of such aberrant tRNAs are degraded by the nuclear exonuclease Rat1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandrov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whipple et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wilusz et al., 2011</xref>). Because the above characteristics of the NBD of Ssa proteins are similar to those of the SBD with respect to protein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deshaies et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tanaka et al., 2002</xref>), we postulate that the NBD possesses a chaperone-like activity for tRNAs in recognizing their structural features, and may contribute to substrate selection for the nuclear RTD through tRNA import, if such tRNAs escape from the cytoplasmic RTD.</p><p>Although there may be other potential roles of Ssa2p in nuclear import of tRNAs, binding and releasing of tRNAs by Ssa2p, which is likely coupled with transport across the NPC, could constitute an intrinsic step for the tRNA import. An attractive idea is that tRNA import is driven by the ATPase cycle of the Hsp70 in a similar manner to the nuclear import driven by the Ran GTPase cycle. The Ssa2p-mediated pathway may function as a regulatory pathway for tRNA import to adapt nutrient stress by using the heat-shock protein in a novel mode of action. Future studies should reveal the detailed molecular mechanism, by which Hsp70 contributes to tRNA import into the nucleus and its regulation upon nutrient stress.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast genetic techniques are essentially described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guthrie and Fink (1991)</xref>, and other molecular biological techniques are in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sambrook and Russell (2001)</xref>. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Preparation materials used in the experiments</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Immobilized tRNA resin</title><p>Immobilization of tRNAs on an agarose matrix was performed according to the method published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hermanson et al.

Any one of these experiments (or alternatives) that would provide evidence that Ssa2 is a direct transport mediator would significantly strengthen the case and the paper</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for your valuable comments. We also noticed that there are several possibilities of indirect involvement of Ssa2p in nuclear import of tRNAs, such as a substrate selector or mediator for import carrier loading, etc<italic>.</italic>, but did not mention these in the original version in detail to clarify our main interpretation. As suggested by the reviewers, we tested whether Ssa proteins can interact with nucleoporins, and allow tRNAs to interact with nucleoporins by solution binding assays. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and corresponding description in Results “Ssa proteins interact with a certain nucleoporin”, we could demonstrate that Ssa proteins indeed can interact with the FG-repeat region of Nup116p by the conventional pull-down assay with GST fusions while no positive data were obtained with Nup100p and Nsp1p in addition to the control, GST alone. We could not confirm Ssa2-dependent interaction between Nup116p and tRNAs by the pull-down assay, probably from rather high off-rate of tRNAs from Ssa proteins. However, a variant of the low affinity binding assay developed by Rexach's group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patel et al. (2007)</xref> Cell, 129, 83-96] allowed us to demonstrate that Ssa proteins can mediate interaction between Nup116p and tRNAs in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We now postulate that Ssa proteins may interact with the NPC through specific interaction with certain Nups, such as Nup116p. Indeed, several reports indicate that even importin β has different affinities to different Nups [Ben-Efraim and Gerace (2001), J Cell Biol, 152, 411-417: Phytila and Rexach (2003) J Biol Chem, 278, 42699-42709]. We also mentioned this assertion in Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) tRNA binding. Unfortunately, tRNA in vitro and in vivo binding do not entirely match because both Ssa1 and Ssa2 bind tRNAs in vitro whereas as only Ssa2 does so in vivo. Whereas it is quite possible that factors are missing in vitro that restrict Ssa1 from binding tRNA in vivo, the authors should be cautious. First, the authors show that the label transfer assay allows both Ssa1 and Ssa2 to bind non-tRNA substrates (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1"><italic>Figure 4–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>). Second, only a single tRNA is reported for the in vivo pull-down studies and only 2 tRNAs are monitored in vivo. Regarding tRNA FISH,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref> <italic>(SD</italic> ssa1Δ<italic>) shows an affect on tRNAPro nuclear accumulation whereas accumulation is ssa1Δ independent in the statistics,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>; is there a problem with</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref><italic>?</italic></p><p>We still do not understand the reason why our tRNA binding data in vitro and FISH data in vivo do not match completely, and we are in our way to investigate this problem for future publication. As commented by the review members, we also suspect that some factor(s) is missing in our in vitro analysis, or that there is labor assignment between Ssa1p and Ssa2p among different isodecoder tRNAs. We had not analyzed every yeast isodecoder in FISH, but additional several FISH analyses yielded similar difference between <italic>ssa1Δ</italic> and <italic>ssa2Δ</italic> so far (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2<italic>–</italic>figure supplement 2</xref>, a newly added supplement of this figure, and corresponding description in Results). Thus, we still think that Ssa2p is mainly involved in tRNA import while contribution of Ssa1p to this process is minor, if any. However, we tone-downed our assertion in the Discussion.</p><p>Also, the reviewers pointed the FISH data of <italic>ssa1Δ</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> seems to indicate some effect on tRNA import. We noticed that certain cells showed lower accumulation of tRNAs in the starved nuclei in the <italic>ssa1Δ</italic> cells while others were not. In the beginning, we did suspect that <italic>ssa1Δ</italic> might show weak tRNA import defects. This is why we did quantification of NAIs of individual cells to convince ourselves. However, finally, the quantitative data revealed that there is no statistical difference between the wild type and <italic>ssa1Δ</italic> strains. In addition, we adjusted the signal range of FISH images in the same set of experiments with the same high and low cut-off values. This may imply lower accumulation of tRNA-Pro in the panel in question.</p><p><italic>3) Do Ssa2 and Mtr10 independently affect tRNA subcellular dynamics?

Although we still believe that statistical difference among <italic>ssa2Δ</italic>, <italic>mtr10</italic>, and <italic>ssa2Δ mtra10</italic>-double is relevant, according to the reviewers' suggestion, we softened out assertion in the revised version (see Results and Discussion).</p><p>Regarding to the Ssa2p involvement in tRNA import under the normal growth conditions, we do not have intention to argue that Ssa2p acts as a tRNA import factor only under starvation conditions, but our original Discussion may mislead the readers in that way. As mentioned in Introduction, tRNA import seems to be constitutive under variety of growth conditions. However, there is no positive data that the capacity of tRNA import is constant under any growth conditions. We wanted to present a possibility that regulation of Ssa2p-driven tRNA import pathway may contribute to alteration of tRNA distribution upon nutrient stress to some extent. Therefore, we changed the Discussion according to the reviewers’ suggestion.</p><p><italic>4) Role of co-chaperones?</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>is not of the same high quality as the FISH studies in the other figures.
