In Drosophila, the mushroom body (MB) is the major site of associative odor memory formation. Previously we described the anatomy of the adult MB and defined 20 types of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) that each innervate distinct MB compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2014b</xref>). Here we compare the properties of memories formed by optogenetic activation of individual DAN cell types. We found extensive differences in training requirements for memory formation, decay dynamics, storage capacity and flexibility to learn new associations. Even a single DAN cell type can either write or reduce an aversive memory, or write an appetitive memory, depending on when it is activated relative to odor delivery. Our results show that different learning rules are executed in seemingly parallel memory systems, providing multiple distinct circuit-based strategies to predict future events from past experiences.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16135.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16135.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neuromodulator</kwd><kwd>associative learning</kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>mushroom body</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aso</surname><given-names>Yoshinori</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>Gerald M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Aso et al., 2014a; Aso et al., 2014b), cell-type-specific drivers and optogenetics are used to control the local release of dopamine and reveal that distinct learning rules are implemented in parallel memory units.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals use memories of past events to predict the future. In some cases, an animal is best served by making a prediction based solely on their most recent experience. In others, a series of experiences is integrated to make a probabilistic prediction, discounting an event experienced only once. How are such different strategies implemented in the brain? One idea is that individual components of a memory—often called engrams—are simultaneously stored in distinct sub-circuits whose outputs can then be combined upon recall to affect behavior. These sub-circuits would vary in their rules for writing, updating and retaining these engrams, having differences in synaptic plasticity and circuit properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hikosaka et al., 2014</xref>). Experiments aimed at uncovering the mechanisms by which different forms of memory are established and maintained, and then coherently coordinated to drive behavior, are facilitated by using a model system in which the relevant cells and circuits can be identified and manipulated either individually or in specific combinations. In this report, we describe experiments performed in such a model system, the olfactory circuitry of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</p><p>Neuronal circuits for learning associations often share a common architecture: a large array of anatomically similar neurons that represent the sensory environment converge onto a much smaller number of output neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luo, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dean et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Punishment or reward activates modulatory neurons that in turn cause changes in the synaptic weight matrix between the neurons representing the sensory cues and the output neurons, resulting in memory formation. The mushroom body (MB) shares this architecture and is the major site of associative learning in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heisenberg et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubnau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>). Odor identity is represented by a pattern of sparse activity in the ~2000 Kenyon cells (KCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Laurent and Naraghi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perez-Orive et al., 2002</xref>), whose parallel axons form the lobes of the MB. The dendrites of MB output neurons (MBONs) and terminals of dopaminergic input neurons (DANs) tile the KC axons; the extent of the arbors of individual MBONs and DANs overlap precisely, defining 15 distinct compartmental units that tile the MB lobes of adult Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16135.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Learning rules in one MB compartment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Conceptual diagram of memory circuit organization.

(<bold>D</bold>) Top: Training protocols. For odor delivery, valves were open for 60 s. For training, thirty 1 s pulses of red light (627 nm peak and 34.9 µW/mm<sup>2</sup> at the position of the flies) were applied over 60 s starting 5 s after valve opening. Experiments were done reciprocally: In one group of flies, odor A and B were 3-octanol and 4-methylcyclohexanol, respectively, while in a second group of flies, the odors were reversed. All flies went through the same initial training and test protocol, and then the flies, without removal from the arena, went through one of the four diagramed training and test protocols. Bottom: Time course of the performance index (PI) during first test period (from 4–6 min of the experiment; left) and second test period (from 10–12 min of the experiment; right). The PI is defined as [(number of flies in the odor A quadrants) - (number of flies in odor B quadrants)]/(total number of flies). The average PI of reciprocal experiments is shown. The overall PI, which is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> was calculated by averaging the PIs from the final 30 s of each test period (indicated by the black horizontal line on the time axis).

Each compartment contains only one of the three major classes of KCs: γ, α′/β′ and α/β. Anatomical data suggest that each MBON samples from ~90 to ~2000 KCs in one or two compartments, while each KC forms <italic>en passant</italic> synapses on 5–6 types of MBONs along its axon in the lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aso et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2014a</xref>). During associative learning, each DAN is thought to modulate KC-MBON synapses only in its target compartment(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hige et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the information encoded by KC activity might contribute to multiple distinct engrams by compartmental specific modulation of KC-MBON <italic>en passant</italic> synapses. A large body of previous work has established that the KCs, MBONs and DANs innervating individual compartments are differentially involved in forming memories with different valence—that is, appetitive and aversive memories—and with different stabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zars et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Isabel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Claridge-Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sejourne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Trannoy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Placais et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pai et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamagata et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huetteroth et al., 2015</xref>).

Believing that a reduction in complexity will be essential to understand the roles played by DAN inputs to different MB compartments, we utilized intersectional split-GAL4 drivers to express CsChrimson, a red-shifted channelrhodopsin, in specific cell types (see Materials and methods). While activation of CsChrimson in these driver lines provides a stimulus that is unlikely to occur naturally, it allowed us to separately examine the memory components induced by individual DAN cell types.</p><p>We developed an olfactory arena that allows fine temporal control of both odor delivery and DAN activation using optogenetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; detailed construction documents are included as a <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In this arena, freely moving flies can be repeatedly trained and tested without the manual handling or temperature changes required in previous assays, thereby minimizing variability that might obscure subtle behavioral effects. These methods allowed us to systematically examine the properties of memories induced in different MB compartments, including: (1) the temporal pairing requirements of odor presentation and DAN activation; (2) the amount of training required for memory formation; (3) retention time; (4) weakening of the conditioned response induced by either DAN activation in the absence of odor presentation or by odor presentation in the absence of DAN activation; (5) the ability to learn new associations; and (6) the capacity to store multiple memories.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Assessing the learning rules in one compartment</title><p>Dopamine signaling to KCs has been implicated in both learning and forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schroll et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tomchik and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gervasi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Placais et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shuai et al., 2015</xref>). However, it has not been determined if a single DAN cell type can drive both processes within the same compartment. Pairing one of two odors with activation of PPL1-γ1pedc, results in robust aversive memory to the paired odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). That memory is fully retained after 10 min (blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) but has largely decayed by 24 hr (Figure 3B). Presentation of the odors alone a few minutes after training resulted in a modest reduction in the conditioned response (orange line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A second activation of the same DAN a few minutes after training in the absence of odor can almost completely abolish the conditioned response (red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Recent imaging data of the γ4 MBON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>) suggest that this reduction most likely results from restoration of the response of the MBON to the odor; that is, erasure of the memory. If, after the first training, contingencies are reversed such that the other odor is presented paired with DAN activation, the first memory is reduced and a memory of the new association is formed (purple line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that the same DANs can write a new memory or reduce an existing conditioned response, enabling the flexibility to rapidly change the associations formed between a conditioned stimulus (CS), the odor, and an unconditioned stimulus (US) represented by dopamine release.</p><p>In classical conditioning, both the rate of learning and the valence of the resultant memory depend on the relative timing between the CS and the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christian and Thompson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerber et al., 2014</xref>). Our ability to precisely control DAN stimulation and odor presentation enabled us to examine the CS-US timing relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We found that when PPL1-γ1pedc stimulation fell within a 30-s time window following the onset of a 10-s odor presentation, an aversive memory was formed (negative PI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that DAN stimulation that precedes odor presentation by 20 to 60 s induced an appetitive memory (positive PI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These observations are consistent with the notion that it is the predictive aspect of CS-US timing that matters. When the timing is such that the CS predicts a subsequent aversive US, animals learn to avoid the CS. However, animals can also learn that the CS predicts the end of an aversive US, and are consequently attracted to the CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tanimoto et al., 2004</xref>). It has been suggested that this timing dependency could result from the dynamics of the biochemical signaling cascade acting downstream of dopamine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yarali et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Pairing activation of PPL1-γ1pedc with odor has been shown to depresses the subsequent spiking rate of the MBON from the γ1pedc compartments in response to the trained odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hige et al., 2015</xref>). In behavioral assays, optogenetic activation of this MBON was shown to attract flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that DAN activation paired with an odor produces an aversive behavioral response to that odor by decreasing the MBON’s attractive output. Thus our data can be most easily explained if this single DAN can bi-directionally alter the strength of KC-MBON synapses depending on the presence and relative timing of odor-driven KC activity; a full testing of this model awaits additional physiological measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Comparing rules for writing memory across compartments</title><p>In order to compare the parameters of learning in different MB compartments, we selected a set of additional split-GAL4 drivers that express at similar and high levels in different DAN cell types (diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; primary imaging data documenting expression patterns can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.janelia.org/split-gal4">http://www.janelia.org/split-gal4</ext-link>).

We found that two sets of DANs, PPL1-α3 alone (MB630B) or the combination of PPL1-γ2α′1 and PPL1-α′2α2 (MB099C) can induce 1-day and 4-day aversive memory after spaced training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that the effects of spaced training can be implemented in individual compartments. Making memory formation dependent on repetitive training might be beneficial by allowing an animal to ignore spurious one-time events. Recent work has shown that the γ2α′1 compartments play key roles in both sleep regulation and long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sitaraman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haynes et al., 2015</xref>). The observation that co-activation of PPL1-γ2α′1 and other DANs synergistically prolongs memory retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2012</xref>) raises the possibility that PPL1-γ2α′1 might act broadly to facilitate memory consolidation by promoting sleep after learning.</p><p>We found that a particular DAN’s ability to induce the formation of immediate, 1-day and 4-day memories is not correlated. For example, immediate memory after a single pairing with activation of PPL1-α3 (MB630B) was barely detectable, although multiple activations resulted in 4-day memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, PPL1-γ1pedc (MB320C) activation resulted in robust immediate memory acquisition after a single round of training, but its activation failed to induce 4-day memory even after extensive spaced training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results imply the stability of memory is an intrinsic property of the MB compartment, rather than a consequence of the training protocol. In this view, repetitive training with naturalistic stimuli that activate many DAN cell types would recruit additional compartments with slower acquisition rates and the behaviorally assayed retention of memory would reflect the combined memories formed in different compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). It remains an open question whether short-term memories are converted into long-term memories as biochemical changes in the same synapses or whether these memories are formed separately and in parallel. For olfactory learning in Drosophila, our data are consistent with a model in which memory formation and consolidation can occur independently and in parallel in individual MB compartments; this view does not exclude the possibility that network activity facilitates memory consolidation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Comparing rules for updating memory</title><p>We found that the memories induced in different compartments have different stabilities, displaying different dynamics of spontaneous memory decay over a 1-day period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>).

It would make sense for a memory to be diminished when the contingency upon which it is based is found to be unreliable. Consistent with this idea, repetitive spaced training with these same DANs can induce 1-day memory that is resistant to DAN activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The differences we observed between compartments suggest that they weigh the importance of the reliability of the correlation between CS and US differently.</p><p>The α1 compartment differed from the other compartments we tested in that it was resistant to memory reduction by DAN activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This compartment plays a key role in long-term appetitive memory of nutritious foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamagata et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huetteroth et al., 2015</xref>) and has an unusual circuit structure: its MBON (MBON-α1) appears to form synapses on the dendrites of the DAN that innervates the α1 compartment (PAM-α1) forming a recurrent circuit necessary for long-term memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>). The α1 compartment also showed the least ability to replace an older association with a new one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This observation suggests that the initial memory may not be affected by the second training, resulting in co-existing appetitive memories for both odors. Indeed, flies were able to retain associations between each of two odors and PAM-α1 (MB043C) activation, while only the most recently learned association was remembered with PPL1-γ1pedc (MB320C) activation (3F). The higher memory capacity of the α1 compartment is not due to generalization, since training with one odor pair did not affect the innate odor preference observed with a different, untrained odor pair. Thus two distinct strategies for updating memories appear to be used in different MB compartments: (1) writing a new memory, while diminishing the old memory; or (2) writing a new memory, while retaining the old memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Processing of conflicting memories</title><p>Our results suggest that memory formation in each compartment is largely parallel and independent, with compartmental specific rules for updating memories. Such a model of independent memory storage should allow appetitive and aversive memories to be simultaneously formed for the same odor in different compartments. We tested this idea by simultaneously activating DANs to α1 and γ1pedc while exposing flies to an odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). When flies were tested immediately after training, the odor was strongly aversive, but the same odor became appetitive after 1 day. These results are most easily explained by simultaneous formation of an aversive memory in γ1pedc and an appetitive memory in α1, with rapid decay of the memory in γ1pedc and slow decay in α1 resulting in a shift in valence of the conditioned response over time. However, the fact that we observed strongly aversive immediate memory, rather than an intermediate response, suggests that the MB network non-linearly integrates these conflicting signals. The known feedforward connection between γ1pedc and α1 provides a possible circuit mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al. 2014a</xref>).

Following the first memory test, flies were trained with a 1-min exposure of odor A (the odor previously paired with sugar) and electric shock (twelve 1.25 s pulses of 60V) in the olfactory arena and then with odor B without shock. Odor preference was measured immediately after the second training (Test 2). For comparison, wild type flies starved for same period were conditioned with electric shock and tested immediately (Test 3).

By analyzing individual memory components–or engrams–induced by local dopamine release, we found that the interpretation of a common odor representation carried by sparse KC activity to multiple compartments could be modified differently in each of those compartments. We do not know the mechanisms that generate these distinct learning rules. They could arise from differences in the dopamine release properties of different DAN cell types or from local differences in the biochemical response to dopamine signaling in each MB compartment. For example, KCs express four distinct dopamine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crocker et al., 2016</xref>), which might be deployed differently in each compartment. Or they could originate from circuit properties: we know from anatomical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>), behavioral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>) and functional imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Owald et al., 2015</xref>) studies that MB compartments can communicate through connections between their extrinsic neurons, the DANs and MBONs, as well as by a layered network within the MB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In the mammalian brain, associative memories are also stored as distributed and parallel changes with partially overlapping functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herry and Johansen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hikosaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tonegawa et al., 2015</xref>); for example, different populations of dopaminergic neurons develop representations of a visual objects’ value with distinct learning rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). We expect many of the underlying strategies and mechanisms may be shared between flies and other species. Our work provides a foundation for experiments aimed at understanding the molecular and circuit mechanisms by which distributed memory components are written with distinct rules and later integrated to guide memory-based behaviors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>Crosses of split-GAL4 lines for DANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>) and 20xUAS-CsChrimson-mVenus in attP18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) were kept on standard cornmeal food supplemented with retinal (0.2 mM all-trans-retinal prior to eclosion and then 0.4 mM) at 22°C at 60% relative humidity in the dark.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, Liqun Luo, and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Josh Dubnau (Reviewer #1); Yi Zhong (Reviewer #2); Leslie C Griffith (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers, as well as the Reviewing Editor, are highly enthusiastic about the significance, and most of the critiques can be addressed by textual changes. However, the first critique of Reviewer 1 regarding back-crossing represents substantial amount of work if the current data were collected from flies that had not been back-crossed to a common genetic background. We hope that these flies were indeed back-crossed and it was an omission in the methods. If they had not been, after much discussion among the Reviewers and Reviewing Editor, we think that it is necessary to perform additional controls to exclude the possibility that the differences reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">2</xref> are due to different backgrounds of flies harboring individual transgenes.</p><p>[We note that in the Aso et al., 2014 paper, you used many conditional manipulations (e.g. shibire).

Here this is not the case, and there are direct comparisons between lines and conclusions drawn in a comparative sense between the cell types.]</p><p>Specifically, we suggest that you perform standard electric shock/sugar training paradigms with each of the key strains (Chrimson included), and examine short term and long term memory. If each of these strains you use has comparable conditioned responses to electric shock and sugar, we can be more certain that the differences with light-induced training are due to cell-type specific Chr expression, not something in the strain background.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The MB are a highly studied neural center of associative olfactory memory and learning in flies. A large body of prior work establishes that odor driven CS inputs are represented as sparse patterns of activity within the large ensemble of MB Kenyon cslls. US driven dopaminergic neuron inputs are thought to converge onto MB Kenyon cells in the MB lobes, which is the site of Kenyon cell synapses with output neurons. Recent work has established that the different sub-types of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) and output neurons (MBONs) are each restricted within zones of the MB lobes. The anatomical organization of the MB Kenyon cell sub-types also implies that the DAN/MBON zones are restricted to sub-types of Kenyon cells. Layered onto this anatomical model is a large body of work that demonstrates that memory is processed through a series of genetically dissectible phases, that rely on different sub-sets of the MB Kenyon cells. This manuscript investigates very interesting questions about how the anatomical organization of the DANs and MBONs into sub-zones provide functional modules upon which each of the memory phases after appetitive vs aversive memories are built. The questions being asked are important and the world view that the authors propose is beautiful. So on a deep level, I am highly enthusiastic. Unfortunately, however, I have several foundational critiques that undermine the major conclusions of this study. This is really unfortunate, because I think that if properly done, this could be a really important piece of work. Below I outline in roughly descending order of importance, the issues that I have with this study in its current form.</p><p>1) If my read of the Methods section is accurate, the authors have made no attempt to control the genetic backgrounds in any of their experiments. This is a fundamental and in my view fatal flaw. There is a long and rich history of this, and it is well established that for all quantitative behavioral traits, genetic background needs to be controlled between all groups for which differences in phenotype are used to draw conclusions. In this case, the authors have used Gal4, and Gal4 reagents that were generated on an outbred background. So every single line has a founder effect, which means that the genetic background of every single strain used is completely unique. As a result, all bets are off in terms of how we interpret differences in magnitude of performance, kinetics of memory decay, and even olfactory acuity and locomotion behaviors that underlie the memory performance. Any and all of the 'rules' that are discovered here that govern how activation of a given DAN might contribute to short term or long-term memory, or to its extinction, etc., could just as easily be due to differences in the kinetics and processing of memory between genetic backgrounds. If I had to guess from my own personal experience, I would wager that a decent fraction of observed quantitative differences between different DANs will fail to reproduce when the genetic backgrounds are equilibrated. We simply cannot fill the literature with this sort of doubt.</p><p>2) The authors state up front that strong optogenetic activation of a single class of neuron may not reflect real physiological US inputs. Although some reviewers may have an issue with that, I actually have no conceptual problem with it: I buy the argument that this is a good framework by which to pick apart the rules that govern plasticity at each DAN:KC:MBON zone. However, it is essential to do this sort of analysis in parallel with 'real' learning in which a real US is used (sugar reward, electric shock or some other aversive stimulus). And then within the context of a real US, it is important to query the contribution of that DAN to performance. Otherwise, the insight that we gain from activating a DAN in place of the US is severely reduced.</p><p>Critiques that need to be addressed with text revisions:</p><p>3) The major dopamine receptor that is established to mediate the US inputs is the type 1 receptor, DopR. Mutations in DopR can be rescued by expression only in MB (Kim et al) and in the case of aversive memory, expression of this receptor only in MB γ neurons is sufficient to fully restore all stages of memory. Given this, how do the authors interpret the fact that activation of DANs that are restricted to zones outside γ lobes are able to induce aversive memories? Is there a different Dopamine receptor at play? Or should we conclude that DANs also co-release other transmitters that are not acting through a dopamine receptor? I am not arguing that the authors need to resolve this issue experimentally, but they cannot ignore this.</p><p>4) Long term memory in this field has an operational meaning that is mis-applied here. When this field uses this term, we mean memory that requires new protein synthesis. In general, it has been required for any new behavioral assay that one use inhibitors of protein synthesis and/or establish a requirement for the CREB gene and/or show a difference between massed versus spaced training. Here, the authors use a spaced training protocol, and then refer to a long lived trace as long-term memory. But we really don't know whether this is the same consolidated form of memory that others have discussed. Moreover, the text confounds the impact of multiple training sessions on acquisition versus consolidation.</p><p>5) The accepted historical nomenclature for Pavlovian literature is flaunted badly. Extinction has a specific meaning in the literature, and it does not involve presentation of the US absent the CS. So activation of DANs after training should not be called extinction, and it shouldn't be said to extinguish memory. And even in the cases where CS+ is presented post training, it is not clear that the decrement in performance is due to extinction. If I read the methods correctly, this is a degradation of avoidance under continuous odor exposure. So this easily could be due to (e.g.) sensory adaptation. Extinction has specific definitions, and there are behavioral tests for whether extinction has taken place. Similarly, the term 'relieve learning' is not really correct. I realize that this term has been used by Tanimoto et al. But the larger literature on Pavlovian learning has already established terms: conditioned excitation and conditioned inhibition. Relief learning is a rediscovery of CI and CE.</p><p>6) The discussion of parallel vs. sequential memory formation is superficial. Isabel et al. and Blum et al. do not impact this issue in the way the authors have implied, and I don't think the findings in this paper bear on this discussion in a compelling way.</p><p>In sum, I very much like the outlook and the over-all approach. But this manuscript does not provide compelling data to support the main conclusions. I realize that the bar I am setting would require (e.g.) back-crossing all lines to the same strain and then repeating most or all of the experiments. But this bar has been set, appropriately, by a consensus in this field that conclusions that are drawn from behavioral comparisons with uncontrolled genetic backgrounds do not withstand the test of time. We all live by this standard.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors systematically analyzed the impacts of artificial activation of several DAN subsets on olfactory memory formation, retention, extinction, extinguishment and reverse.

However, we note that the split-GAL4 stocks that we used are much more similar in background than the stocks that the reviewer correctly notes have proved problematic in the past. Those stocks were often genetic mutations or enhancer trap GAL4 lines in widely different genetic backgrounds. While the split-GAL4 lines we used were not back-crossed, these lines are in similar genetic backgrounds: the AD and DBD DNA constructs used in the split-GAL4 lines were injected into the same set of recipient stocks and inserted into the same landing sites, and the X chromosome in all split-GAL4 lines was exchanged with that of a common stock. Also, unlike in many previous experiments that studied the behavioral effects of mutations, we do not test these split-GAL4 lines as homozygotes, but as a population of the heterozygous progeny of a cross between a specific split-GAL4 line and a common 20xUAS-CsChrimson-mVenus stock, thus masking the effect of any recessive genetic differences between the split-GAL4 stocks.</p><p><italic>2) The authors state up front that strong optogenetic activation of a single class of neuron may not reflect real physiological US inputs.

Otherwise, the insight that we gain from activating a DAN in place of the US is severely reduced.</italic></p><p>We agree that studying the effects of blocking specific DANs after presentation of a “real” US (shock or sugar) will be needed to fully understand associative learning. However, interpreting the results of such experiments is complicated by the fact that shock or sugar activate multiple DANs (Kirkhart, C. &amp; Scott, K. 2015; Mao, Z. &amp; Davis, R. L. 2009; Liu, C. et al. 2012) and almost certainly, given previous studies (Aso et al., 2012) and the results we present in this paper, induce partially redundant memories in multiple compartments in parallel. Thus making conclusions about the roles of individual DANs by studying the behavioral effects of their inactivation is not straightforward and would, at a minimum, require construction of strains that would allow different, specific combinations of DANs to be inactivated together. These experiments are technically challenging and beyond the scope of the current study. Indeed, avoiding the complications of redundancy was a major motivation of our current study’s experimental design: inducing memory in defined compartment(s) by optogenetic stimulation and then assaying memory dynamics using behavioral assays.</p><p><italic>Critiques that need to be addressed with text revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>3) The major dopamine receptor that is established to mediate the US inputs is the type 1 receptor, DopR. Mutations in DopR can be rescued by expression only in MB (Kim et al) and in the case of aversive memory, expression of this receptor only in MB γ neurons is sufficient to fully restore all stages of memory. Given this, how do the authors interpret the fact that activation of DANs that are restricted to zones outside γ lobes are able to induce aversive memories? Is there a different Dopamine receptor at play? Or should we conclude that DANs also co-release other transmitters that are not acting through a dopamine receptor? I am not arguing that the authors need to resolve this issue experimentally, but they cannot ignore this.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, we showed that PPL1-α3 can induce 1-day and 4-day memory after 10x spaced training. These data fit well with previous reports that <italic>rutabaga</italic> rescue in α/β KCs can restore LTM (Blum 2010), but appear at first glance to be inconsistent with the results reported in Qin et al. 2012 that showed full restoration of both immediate and 1-day memory in DopR1 mutants by driving DopR1 in γ KCs but not in α/β KCs. There are many possible explanations for such lack of agreement, including the use of other dopamine receptors in α/β Kenyon cells. Indeed, α/β and γ Kenyon cells have been reported to express high levels of four different dopamine receptors (Crocker et al., 2016). We added a statement about the presence of multiple dopamine receptors to the text.</p><p><italic>4) Long term memory in this field has an operational meaning that is mis-applied here.
