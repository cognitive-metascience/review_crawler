molecular basis is largely unknown. Previously, using FRET-based microscopy, we observed heterogeneity in cellular c-di-GMP levels. In this study, we show that c-di-GMP heterogeneity in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is promoted by a specific phosphodiesterase partitioned after cell division. We found that subcellular localization and reduction of c-di-GMP levels by this phosphodiesterase is dependent on the histidine kinase component of the chemotaxis machinery, CheA, and its phosphorylation state. Therefore, individual cell heterogeneity in c-di-GMP concentrations is regulated by the activity and the asymmetrical inheritance of the chemotaxis organelle after cell division. c-di-GMP heterogeneity results in a diversity of motility behaviors. The generation of diverse intracellular concentrations of c-di-GMP by asymmetric partitioning is likely important to the success and survival of bacterial populations within the environment by allowing a variety of motility behaviors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01402.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01402.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01402.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacterial populations have traditionally been assumed to be made up of identical cells. However, while the bacteria within a population may be genetically identical, individual cells have different growth rates, metabolisms and motilities, among other things. This ‘phenotypic heterogeneity’ has been observed in many different species of bacteria, and in some cases it can be attributed to changes in the concentration of molecules called second messengers that help to relay signals from the external environment to targets within the cell.</p><p>It can be challenging to monitor changes in the concentration of specific molecules inside cells, but researchers recently developed a form of microscopy based on FRET (short for Forster resonance energy transfer) that can measure the levels of a second messenger molecule called cyclic di-guanylate (c-di-GMP) inside individual cells. This technique was used to study <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, a bacterium that has a single corkscrew-shaped propeller that enables it to swim through liquid. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> divides to form two daughter cells—one with a propeller and one without.</p><p>Although the daughter cell that does not have a propeller quickly grows one, FRET-based microscopy revealed that the daughter cell with a propeller had less c-di-GMP than the daughter without a propeller, but the reasons underlying this difference and its effects on bacterial behavior were not clear.</p><p>Now Kulasekara et al. show that the cell that inherits the propeller contains an enzyme that degrades c-di-GMP, and that the low levels of this second messenger molecule—caused by the enzyme being concentrated near the base of the propeller, and the presence of a protein (CheA) that enables the bacteria to swim towards sources of nutrients—result in faster swimming speeds and increased responsiveness to nutrients. In other words, although the two daughter cells are genetically identical, they behave quite differently because of the different levels of this second messenger molecule.</p><p>The existence of heterogeneity within a bacterial population likely leads to increased success and survival within changing diverse environments, and this work sets the stage for similar investigations into what establishes heterogeneity in other bacterial populations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01402.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01402.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic></kwd><kwd>FRET</kwd><kwd>biosensor</kwd><kwd>c-di-GMP</kwd><kwd>chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>heterogeneity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5U54AI057141-09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kulasekara</surname><given-names>Bridget R</given-names></name><name><surname>Kamischke</surname><given-names>Cassandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Kulasekara</surname><given-names>Hemantha D</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Samuel I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2007047910</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kulasekara</surname><given-names>Bridget R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R21NS067579-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kulasekara</surname><given-names>Hemantha D</given-names></name><name><surname>Christen</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Samuel I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Real time measurements of c-di-GMP in individual cells reveal an unexpected mechanism by which the chemotaxis machinery controls c-di-GMP heterogeneity, thereby regulating flagellar-based motility.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Single cells in an isogenic population display heterogeneity in a variety of physiological parameters including growth rate, chemotaxis, metabolism, nutritional acquisition, and tolerance to noxious stimuli including antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shibata and Ueda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lidstrom and Konopka, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wakamoto et al., 2013</xref>). Second messenger-based signaling, having a global impact on cellular physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Romling et al., 2013</xref>), can be a mechanism by which environmental signals are rapidly translated into phenotypic heterogeneity. However, such mechanisms for generating phenotypic heterogeneity have yet to be described for many cell types, including bacteria. Nucleotide-based second messengers including cAMP and cyclic dinucleotides perform crucial functions within prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corrigan and Grundling, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kalia et al., 2013</xref>). The bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP is synthesized and degraded by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs) to regulate diverse processes including cell-cycle progression, motility, and exopolysaccharide production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Romling et al., 2013</xref>). Traditional bulk culture-based biochemical measurements cannot determine the variation of second messenger levels within populations. To measure c-di-GMP concentrations in individual cells, our laboratory developed a genetically encoded FRET-based biosensor using the <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium c-di-GMP binding protein YcgR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christen et al., 2010</xref>). FRET microscopy analysis using this biosensor revealed that the concentration of the second messenger c-di-GMP varies bimodally in populations of diverse bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>One species we examined, <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, in contrast to other well-studied gram-negative bacteria, exhibits an asymmetric cell cycle in that the two daughter cells have unique morphologies and functions. Only the daughter swarmer cell with a polar flagellum is motile, and only the stalk cell, with the exopolysaccharide containing holdfast, can undergo cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsokos and Laub, 2012</xref>). It has been known that a c-di-GMP synthesizing enzyme, PleD, is localized and activated in the stalked cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paul et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aldridge et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, bimodal distribution of c-di-GMP was not a surprising observation for <italic>C. crescentus</italic>. However, the features that facilitate preferential PleD localization to the stalked cell pole are undetermined. Other species we examined, including <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium, and <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christen et al., 2010</xref>), all produce morphologically similar progeny. Therefore, heterogeneity in c-di-GMP levels for these bacteria was a surprising observation.</p><p>Other than the example of <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, little is known about individual variation of microbes as a product of cell division. Often the possibility of heterogeneity is evoked to explain surprising phenotypes, such as variability in the susceptibility of bacterial populations to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhar and McKinney, 2007</xref>). Current knowledge suggests variation resulting from cell division could occur through several mechanisms including inherent cellular polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dworkin, 2009</xref>). Cellular heterogeneity can also result from processes that are stochastic including mutations, unequal partitioning of less abundant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>), or alterations in gene expression as a result of phase variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henderson et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, although cellular differentiation is not morphologically obvious, cells possess a single polar flagellum. The daughter cell that does not inherit the flagellum following cell division rapidly synthesizes a new flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suzuki and Iino, 1980</xref>). The daughter cell with the lower c-di-GMP concentration after cell division was previously demonstrated to inherit the single polar flagellum, suggesting this asymmetry is not a stochastic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christen et al., 2010</xref>). In this work, we define the mechanism that generates <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> c-di-GMP heterogeneity during the cell cycle. We have discovered that the chemotaxis machinery, the signal transducing system required for directed bacterial navigation, additionally activates a PDE to generate low c-di-GMP levels in flagellated cells. This PDE is localized to the flagellated cell pole by the chemotaxis machinery, indicating that asymmetry in organelle distribution during cell division results in the bimodal distribution of c-di-GMP. This heterogeneity in c-di-GMP levels in turn controls flagellar-based motility behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A specific PDE, encoded by PA5017, is required for c-di-GMP heterogeneity</title><p>Using FRET-based microscopy, we imaged cells from single time points to visualize heterogeneity in c-di-GMP levels. Use of an automated method to segment cells and analyze their fluorescence intensity allowed us to determine that 20% of wild type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 cells reproducibly exhibit c-di-GMP concentrations less than 200 nM during exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,G</xref>). <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> encodes multiple isoforms of DGCs and PDEs. We hypothesized that the activity of one or more of these c-di-GMP metabolizing enzymes is responsible for c-di-GMP heterogeneity and therefore screened a transposon mutant bank for mutants with altered levels of c-di-GMP. Out of a potential 38 enzyme homologs, we did not identify any single <italic>dgc</italic> genes required to maintain the population of cells with high c-di-GMP, suggesting more than one DGC is involved in synthesizing c-di-GMP during exponential growth. However, we identified one gene, PA5017, responsible for maintaining the population of cells with reduced c-di-GMP levels. Previous characterization has shown that the protein encoded by this gene is a PDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roy et al., 2012</xref>).

Therefore, we constructed a functional Pch-mCherry fusion to simultaneously characterize the location of Pch and measure cellular c-di-GMP levels. Pch-mCherry exhibited polar localization in 50% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Using time-lapse FRET imaging, we observed that polarly localized Pch-mCherry is partitioned to a single cell following cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, Pch-mCherry localizes to the pole of the incipient daughter cell that exhibits reduced cellular c-di-GMP following cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

We observed that an <italic>flhF</italic> deletion also causes Pch-mCherry foci to delocalize from the pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C,D</xref>). Nevertheless, biosensor activity showed that <italic>flhF</italic> mutant cells are able to maintain c-di-GMP heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel). Thus, the flagellum, but not its polar positioning, is required for the maintenance of low c-di-GMP concentrations. These data suggested that Pch may bind to a flagellar component. However, an intact flagellar basal body rod-hook structure is additionally required for expression of the chemotaxis machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dasgupta et al., 2003</xref>), which is also polarly localized in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guvener et al., 2006</xref>).

For many species of bacteria, counter clockwise rotation of the flagellum propels the cell forward in a smooth, straight trajectory, and clockwise rotation causes the cell to tumble and reorient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berg and Brown, 1972</xref>) or, in the case of the cell with a unipolar flagellum, to reverse and then reorient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wadhams and Armitage, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qian et al., 2013</xref>). The chemotaxis machinery modulates the bacterial trajectory by controlling the frequency of clockwise rotational events. Clockwise rotation is initiated by phosphorylated CheY binding to the flagellar rotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2006</xref>) and MCPs control the rate of CheY phosphorylation by CheA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vladimirov and Sourjik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hazelbauer and Lai, 2010</xref>).

Methylation specifically decreases MCP affinity for its ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sourjik and Berg, 2002</xref>) and increases CheA kinase activity. MCP methylation functions to provide memory of the past few seconds of the cell’s environment and render cells sensitive to changes relative to recent conditions. When cells are in a uniform environment, the resulting steady-state kinase activity initiates a low basal rate of cell reversals, conferring a random walk trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berg and Brown, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vladimirov and Sourjik, 2009</xref>).

We found that this phosphotransfer mutant conferred by the CheAH49N allele had no effect on Pch-mCherry localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, c-di-GMP levels increased relative to wild type, as more than 90% of cells exhibited greater than 200 nM intracellular c-di-GMP, decreasing heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We obtained a similar result for the <italic>cheR</italic> deletion strain, which confirms the result from the CheA kinase mutant because CheR stimulates auto-kinase activity of CheA.

Exponential phase cells were prepared in the same manner as for c-di-GMP quantification. Cell motility was subsequently monitored in the same growth medium, but with the addition of viscous 1% methyl cellulose to reduce swimming velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schneider and Doetsch, 1974</xref>) and facilitate the capture of cell trajectories by video microscopy. To exclude other forms of motility that require surfaces, we imaged cells at a focal plane 50 microns above the coverslip.

Conversely, ectopically reducing c-di-GMP to levels lower than wild type, utilizing a PDE expressing strain, increased the population of cells with mean velocities between four and eight microns/s and decreased the population of amotile cells. These results indicate that the c-di-GMP levels in wild-type cells have a physiological role in modulating cell velocity, as both reducing and increasing c-di-GMP levels affects velocity.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01402.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Cells with increased c-di-GMP exhibit decreased velocity and reversals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histogram of mean cellular velocity.

In this environment, cells utilize the chemotaxis machinery to exhibit reverse movement, not in response to a chemical gradient, but due to the effect of steady-state kinase activity. Approximately 25% of the wild-type cells exhibited at least one reversal in direction for trajectories of 25 microns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Reversals were increased in cells ectopically expressing a PDE as at least 60% of cells exhibited one or more reversals.

These data indicate that c-di-GMP levels act to create heterogeneity not only in cell velocities but also in modulating chemotaxis machinery output. For organisms such as <italic>E. coli</italic>, the effect of c-di-GMP on reversals and velocity is mediated by the PilZ domain protein, YcgR that binds the flagellar rotor or stator upon forming a complex with cyclic di-GMP. We deleted the homolog of this gene in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, PA3353, and found this gene did not have a significant effect on either velocity or reversal rate, as both were similar to that of wild type. This result suggests, in the conditions used for the assay, that this PilZ domain protein does not mediate reduction of cell velocity or inhibition of flagellar motor reversals by c-di-GMP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The use of a biosensor that enables real time measurement of c-di-GMP in individual cells allowed us to define an unexpected mechanism by which the chemotaxis machinery controls c-di-GMP heterogeneity, thereby regulating flagellar-based motility. We identified the PDE activity of Pch as necessary for the maintenance of low c-di-GMP and for generating asymmetry in c-di-GMP levels following cell division. We also found that Pch is not sufficient to generate low c-di-GMP levels but additionally requires an intact flagellar apparatus as well as the chemotaxis machinery protein CheA for its localization and activity. Our results from imaging and co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest Pch binds to CheA or a CheA-associated protein, targeting it to the pole. As CheA is part of the chemotaxis machinery and is normally localized to one cell pole, this localizes Pch to the pole of a single daughter cell following cell division. Together these events contribute to differential c-di-GMP levels in daughter cells following cell division.</p><p>It is likely that complex formation between Pch and CheA occurs via an adaptor protein. Only CheW-like and response regulator receiver domains have been characterized to interact with CheA orthologs. Pch lacks such domains, and as receiver domains are typically phosphorylated by histidine kinases, it is unlikely Pch is phosphorylated by CheA. Pch possesses, in addition to an EAL domain that confers PDE activity, GAF, PAS, and PAC sensory input domains and a degenerate GGDEF domain. GGDEF domains confer DGC activity when functional, and have been shown to interact with receiver-like adaptor domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2004</xref>). This interaction suggests that an unidentified receiver domain protein could serve as an adaptor mediating an association between the Pch GGDEF domain and CheA. As receiver domains are often phosphorylated by histidine kinases, this putative adaptor could also modulate the control of Pch activity in response to CheA phosphorylation. One of the multiple domains in Pch may also modulate additional, uncharacterized protein–protein interactions. Evidence for additional interactions includes the observations that Pch-mCherry localization appears to be more diffuse in the <italic>cheA</italic> deletion than in the <italic>fliF</italic> deletion. FliF is required for assembly of a flagellar basal-body rod-hook structure that facilitates secretion of the FliA anti-sigma factor, FlgM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karlinsey et al., 2000</xref>). FlgM secretion enables FliA mediated expression of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> flagellar regulon Class IV genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dasgupta et al., 2003</xref>). Other, unidentified proteins within the FliA regulon, whose expression is abrogated in the <italic>fliF</italic> mutant, could therefore mediate the difference in Pch-mCherry subcellular localization observed between the <italic>fliF</italic> and <italic>cheA</italic> deletions. Such an interaction could facilitate the transport and localization of Pch to the chemotaxis machinery, or modulate its turnover in the cell. Interestingly, the Pch PDE has been shown to be activated by another molecule controlled by external signals, cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roy et al., 2012</xref>). We observed that a minority of cells exhibited high c-di-GMP concentrations, yet showed polarly localized Pch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In these cells, Pch could be lacking a specific form of allosteric activation. Consistent with this possibility, Pch has several putative sensory input domains that could bind additional, yet to be identified allosteric effectors.</p><p>The requirement for the chemotaxis machinery to stimulate c-di-GMP turnover ensures that heterogeneity in c-di-GMP levels occurs preferentially in motile and chemotactic competent populations. c-di-GMP inhibits motility of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium by reducing cell velocity and inhibiting tumbling events. In this study, we found that reducing cyclic di-GMP levels in the chemotaxis competent <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> population enables increased cell velocities and reversals. Therefore, heterogeneity in c-di-GMP levels within a population confers diversity in cell reversal rates and in cell velocities. Populations of motile <italic>E. coli</italic> cells have been noted to exhibit a variety of chemotaxis responses to chemical gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koshland, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spudich and Koshland, 1976</xref>). These authors and others have speculated that populations with diversity in such behavior may have an advantage when encountering a variety of chemical gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vladimirov and Sourjik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sourjik and Wingreen, 2012</xref>). Although our observations were performed in a uniform environment, it is likely that the diversity in c-di-GMP levels in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> also generates variation in the chemotactic response to a variety of chemical gradients and may therefore be a strategy to maximize survival in unpredictable environments.</p><p>This work indicates that population differences in the second messenger, c-di-GMP, are not simply stochastic but involve a specific molecular mechanism associated with the variation in cellular inheritance of specific organelles. In this regard, it is interesting to speculate that similar mechanisms for generating heterogeneity may be associated with other organelles such as pili, paralogous chemotaxis clusters, or flagella, which are inherited in an uneven fashion even in organisms with multiple flagellar organelles such as <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ping, 2010</xref>). Organelle-based partitioning of cellular proteins could therefore be a broader mechanism by which bacteria generate cellular diversity within populations after cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial isolates and plasmids</title><p>We used strain <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolate PA14 to generate all results, except when mapped transposon mutants were utilized.

All null mutations were created as in-frame deletion mutants in the PA14 isolate. The chromosomal in-frame deletions and point mutations were constructed at the native loci in the chromosome using allelic exchange with pEX18 Gm or pEX2Gm vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schweizer and Hoang, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rietsch et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The CheA fusion to mTurquoise2 (mTq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goedhart et al., 2012</xref>) and the FliM fusion to mKate2 (Evrogen, Moscow, Russia) were constructed at the native chromosomal locations in PA14 using the pEX18 Gm system. These two fluorescent proteins were chosen for their better resistance to photobleaching, maturation, and brightness. The CheA-mTurquoise2 (mTq) C-terminal fusion was made by fusing the <italic>cheA</italic> gene with the fluorophore at the 3′ end using the GTGGSGGS encoding flexible linker.

A minimum of four fields was acquired for each data set where at least three biological replicates were collected for each data set.

Identical adjustments were made for images of the same protein–fluorophore fusions in all strain backgrounds. To adjust brightness in fluorescence images, we altered the parameters of a transfer function defined by the three parameters of an image’s lookup table (LUT), the minimum, maximum, and gamma values. The maximum LUT value of these 16-bit images was chosen to be just greater than the 99th percentile of the pixel intensity distribution from the wild-type strain of a protein–fluorophore set. A protein–fluorophore fusion in the wild type background typically exhibited the greatest signal intensity. For Pch-mCherry, this resulted in a LUT range of 0–10,000. The timelapse image of Pch-mCherry was collected using an exposure time of 800 ms instead of 1 s and microscopy was performed near the end of the lamp’s lifetime, meaning that the illumination was not comparable to that of the other images. Therefore, we set the LUT range from 0 to 4500, utilizing selection parameters mentioned above. For Pch-Yfp, the LUT range was 0–4000, and for CheA-mTurquoise, the LUT range was 0–12,000. For FliM-mKate2, the range was from 0 to 5500. All LUTs utilized a gamma value of 0.8.</p><p>We selected different contrast adjustments for the fluorescence image when part of the phase/fluorescence channel overlay; however the same contrast parameters were still applied for all strains expressing the same protein–fluorophore fusion. It was necessary to use different contrast adjustments for this type of overlay because only a single color was used to represent fluorescence intensity and it was therefore more difficult to discern pixels with lower intensity. This is especially true for the strain backgrounds that result in a diffuse localization pattern, because the protein is effectively distributed to a much larger volume, reducing signal. The maximum LUT value was chosen such that the localization pattern of the strain with the most diffuse protein–fluorophore could be visualized and was typically 60–70% of the maximum LUT value above. For Pch-mCherry, this corresponded to a range of 0–6000 for all strains. All LUTs utilized a gamma value of 0.8.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Cell segmentation and fluorescence intensity analyses were performed using custom written Matlab software that was used previously for analysis of bacterial single cell microscopy data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LeRoux et al. (2012)</xref>. Prior to analysis in Matlab, images for the measurement of biosensor activity were preprocessed in ImageJ. To correct sub-pixel registration defects both Cfp and Yfp images were aligned to the Fret image using the Plugin TurboReg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thevenaz et al., 1998</xref>) and background was subtracted using the rolling ball subtract background menu option, automated by a custom written Plugin. These were the only changes made to the raw fluorescence intensity images. In Matlab phase images were used for automated segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LeRoux et al., 2012</xref>). The segmentation defined the boundaries of individual cells used in all analyses of fluorescence intensities. The cells not expressing the biosensor (less than 5% of cells) were excluded from the analysis by removing those cells with Yfp average arbitrary fluorescence units of less than 1500. In this study, net Fret (nFret) is defined as the average Fret intensity minus the average Cfp intensity multiplied by the spectral bleedthrough coefficient for Cfp into the Fret channel. This was calculated for these exposure conditions for the cells expressing mCyPet alone to be 0.46. The original nFret equation subtracts bleedthrough from Yfp into the Fret channel as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xia and Liu, 2001</xref>). Because imaging mYPet significantly increases photobleaching over time, our calculation of nFret does not include subtracting Yfp from the Fret signal. Polar intensity was defined as the area residing within either the end of the cell along the long axis within one fourth of the length of the cell. Polar localization is defined by a locus intensity score of greater than 14 where the locus must be within 7 pixels of the cell pole. Individual fluorescent foci were isolated using a watershed-based segmentation algorithm and fit using a Gaussian point-spread function. To ensure that only bright, localized foci were used in analysis, a score was assigned to each focus proportional to the ratio of the peak intensity value to the standard deviation of the fit function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Criteria for the identification of putative DGCs and PDEs involved in c-di-GMP heterogeneity</title><p>Transposon insertion mutants were characterized by the difference in the percentage of cells containing less than 200 nM c-di-GMP as compared to the parental strain, wild type PAO1. 72% of wild type PAO1 cells exhibit c-di-GMP levels less than 200 nM. 80% of transposon insertions exhibited a difference relative to wild type of 10%. The remaining mutants, except for those in PA5017, exhibited a difference of less than 15% relative to wild type. The PA5017 transposon mutants exhibited a difference of greater than 60%. We chose to follow up on this result in the strain PA14, because we observed that PAO1 cells lose expression of the biosensor. PA14 expression is stable, and, although fewer PA14 cells exhibit low levels of c-di-GMP, abrogating PA5017 still has a dramatic effect on c-di-GMP levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Biosensor calibration</title><p>The binding curve of the c-di-GMP biosensor in response to ligand was determined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christen et al.

It was previously verified that FRET from purified biosensor as measured by microscopy gives a dose-response binding curve similar to that as measured by a spectrofluorometer. Levels of FRET as measured by microscopy corresponding to saturated or unsaturated biosensor were determined by measuring biosensor activity in cells expressing the ectopic <italic>C. crescentus</italic> DGC or PDE.

Fluorophores mYPet and mCyPet exhibit different photobleaching curves, meaning that the amount of FRET influences the rate at which bleaching occurs. Therefore, we determined bleaching correction factors by dividing the populations of cells into those that exhibit high or low FRET and took the average of these two numbers to prevent any bias in apparent bleaching that would occur because of disparate number of cells exhibiting high and low FRET.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Single cell motility image acquisition</title><p>Cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.3 in LB, resuspended in fresh LB, and diluted 1:1 in 2% methyl cellulose.

The cells were observed using a mock darkfield set-up combining a Ph3 condenser annulus with a 20× objective. With these settings, one pixel equals 0.533 microns.

Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elife.elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “c-di-GMP heterogeneity is generated by the chemotaxis machinery to regulate flagellar motility” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably reviewed by a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors and two reviewers who discussed their comments before reaching the following decision.</p><p>All three reviewers are enthusiastic about the study by Kulasekara et al., which investigates the mechanism underlying c-di-GMP heterogeneity in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. While most of the data are complete and convincing, the manuscript would be improved if the authors addressed the following:</p><p>1) The manuscript would come full circle if a direct link between CheA and PA5017 were established. The current data demonstrate that CheA and PA5017 function together because a CheA mutant shows loss of heterogeneity and both proteins co-localize at the pole. However, the data do not show that this effect is direct. Could the authors provide evidence that CheA interacts with PA5017, for example by performing in vivo pull down experiments?</p><p>If the effect is direct, the authors need to discuss the mechanism. It is intriguing that the response regulator CheY is not required but the kinase activity of CheA is. Based on the discussion in the text, the authors propose that CheA modulates the PDE directly, by interaction with one of its several domains. This is surprising because PA5017 appears to lack a receiver domain. Has a CheA-type protein ever been shown to phosphorylate non response-regulator domains in a physiologically meaningful process? It is easier to postulate that an as yet unidentified response regulator protein mediates signal from CheA to PA5017. Such regulation is documented and there are many proteins containing both a receiver domain and a DGC/PDE domain (PleD for example). While the identification of this receiver is beyond the scope of the manuscript, this possible mechanism should be mentioned.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: What are the relative levels of PA5017 in the strains carrying mutations in the different flagella and chemotaxis genes (i.e., can any of the differences in effects be explained by differences in the levels of the PDE)? Also, can the authors explain the different localization patterns seen for the different mutants?</p><p>3) The fluorescence localization data is only shown as overlays with the corresponding phase contrast images. This is not good practice because mounting overlay images requires contrast adjustment, potentially masking significant fluorescent signals. Unprocessed fluorescent images should also be shown in addition to the overlay images. In addition, given that the measured distance of the separation of the CheA-mTurquoise/FliM-mKate2 is within the diffraction limit, the CheA-mTurquoise/PA5017-YFP pair and CheA-mTurquoise/FliM-mKate2 pairs cannot be compared.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01402.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The manuscript would come full circle if a direct link between CheA and PA5017 were established. The current data demonstrate that CheA and PA5017 function together because a CheA mutant shows loss of heterogeneity and both proteins co-localize at the pole. However, the data do not show that this effect is direct. Could the authors provide evidence that CheA interacts with PA5017, for example by performing in vivo pull down experiments</italic>?</p><p>We successfully performed in vivo pull downs that verify CheA and PA5017(Pch) are part of the same protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) indicating CheA and PA5017 form a complex.</p><p><italic>If the effect is direct, the authors need to discuss the mechanism. It is intriguing that the response regulator CheY is not required but the kinase activity of CheA is. Based on the discussion in the text, the authors propose that CheA modulates the PDE directly, by interaction with one of its several domains. This is surprising because PA5017 appears to lack a receiver domain. Has a CheA-type protein ever been shown to phosphorylate non response-regulator domains in a physiologically meaningful process? It is easier to postulate that an as yet unidentified response regulator protein mediates signal from CheA to PA5017. Such regulation is documented and there are many proteins containing both a receiver domain and a DGC/PDE domain (PleD for example). While the identification of this receiver is beyond the scope of the manuscript, this possible mechanism should be mentioned</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers have an excellent point and we have modified the Discussion to reflect the possibility that PA5017 (Pch) both associates with and is activated via an adaptor protein. The fact that we identified a protein complex does not preclude this possibility. We have incorporated the discussion of such an interaction in the discussion, citing the example of PleD.</p><p><italic>2)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>: What are the relative levels of PA5017 in the strains carrying mutations in the different flagella and chemotaxis genes (i.e. can any of the differences in effects be explained by differences in the levels of the PDE)? Also, can the authors explain the different localization patterns seen for the different mutants</italic>?</p><p>To determine whether any effects were due to altered levels of the PDE, we quantified intensity from PA5017-mCherry (Pch-mCherry) expressed in the different mutant backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that the <italic>fliF</italic> mutant had reduced levels of Pch-mCherry (PA5017-mCherry) however the <italic>cheA</italic> deletion did not. We have addressed these findings in the text.</p><p><italic>3) The fluorescence localization data is only shown as overlays with the corresponding phase contrast images. This is not good practice because mounting overlay images requires contrast adjustment, potentially masking significant fluorescent signals. Unprocessed fluorescent images should also be shown in addition to the overlay images</italic>.</p><p>We have added images of fluorescence intensity to accompany all overlays. However, we disagree that contrast adjustment is not good practice when studying low copy number proteins in bacteria; in fact we found contrast adjustment was necessary to visualize any signal. The fact that an image requires contrast adjustment means that the average fluorescent signal is significantly less than the maximum intensity value for the image’s bit depth. Furthermore, adjusting contrast does not mask significant fluorescent signals if the contrast adjustments are made to represent the range of intensities within an image. We carried out such efforts, as outlined in the Materials and methods section. Additionally, we would like to remind the reviewers that we imaged all protein-fluorophore fusions that are expressed under native control of the promoter and present in single copy, rather than protein-fluorophore fusions expressed off of a multi copy plasmid from an inducible promoter. We intentionally chose this methodology as an optimal means for visualizing protein localization, as it preserves the native stoichiometry between the protein-fluorophore fusion and any interacting partners. As expected, we have maintained the contrast adjustment across each set of individual protein-fluorophore fusions. Finally, these images were included to illustrate the differences in protein-fluorophore localization; however, we hope that the more extensive analysis entailing the automated quantitation of protein localization will also be persuasive in convincing the reviewers of the validity of our results.</p><p><italic>In addition, given that the measured distance of the separation of the CheA-mTurquoise/FliM-mKate2 is within the diffraction limit, the CheA-mTurquoise/PA5017-YFP pair and CheA-mTurquoise/FliM-mKate2 pairs cannot be compared</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the two pairs should not be compared because we used different sets of filters, which could have different degrees of error. To remedy this problem, we have repeated measurements comparing the CheA-mTurquoise/FliM-mKate2 and CheA-mTurquoise/PA5017mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>). Using these two pairs of fluorophores allows us to use the same pair of filters for both strains. Therefore, the error introduced by using the same pair of filters should be identical, and the calculated distance between fluorophore centroids can then be compared. In this instance, the diffraction limit does not apply because we are comparing the distance between centroids from two different fluorophores.
