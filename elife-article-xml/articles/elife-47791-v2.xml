proteostasis. Hsp70 chaperones negatively regulate the activity of Hsf1 via stress-responsive mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here, we have reconstituted budding yeast Hsf1-Hsp70 activation complexes and find that surplus Hsp70 inhibits Hsf1 DNA-binding activity. Hsp70 binds Hsf1 via its canonical substrate binding domain and Hsp70 regulates Hsf1 DNA-binding activity. During heat shock, Hsp70 is out-titrated by misfolded proteins derived from ongoing translation in the cytosol. Pushing the boundaries of the regulatory system unveils a genetic hyperstress program that is triggered by proteostasis collapse and involves an enlarged Hsf1 regulon. The findings demonstrate how an apparently simple chaperone-titration mechanism produces diversified transcriptional output in response to distinct stress loads.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hsf1</kwd><kwd>heat shock response</kwd><kwd>heat shock protein</kwd><kwd>Hsp70</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Swedish Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAN2018/711</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andréasson</surname><given-names>Claes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Swedish Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAN2016/361</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andréasson</surname><given-names>Claes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015-05094</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andréasson</surname><given-names>Claes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andréasson</surname><given-names>Claes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Starting Grant 758397</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedländer</surname><given-names>Marc R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015-04611</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedländer</surname><given-names>Marc R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hsp70 restricts DNA binding activity of Hsf1 to control the width and amplitude of the heat-shock regulon.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) is an ancient eukaryotic transcription factor that adjusts the cellular proteostasis system to changing stress loads by inducing the expression of a large set of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morimoto, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Åkerfelt et al., 2010</xref>). During acute heat shock, unfolded proteins accumulate in the cell resulting in the rapid and transient activation of Hsf1 that counteracts the harmful proteotoxic effects by inducing the expression of protective chaperones and aggregation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Richter et al., 2010</xref>). This core heat shock response (HSR) is a conserved transcriptional program that depends on the induced binding of Hsf1 as a trimer to promoters that harbour heat-shock elements (HSEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sorger and Nelson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sorger and Pelham, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wiederrecht et al., 1987</xref>). The target promoters also receive signals from other stress-induced pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verghese et al., 2012</xref>). In budding yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>), the metabolic-stress transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 (Msn2/4) associate with stress-response elements (STREs) present within many Hsf1 target promoters, leading to an expanded HSR that integrate stress-induced metabolic and proteostatic perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martínez-Pastor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schmitt and McEntee, 1996</xref>).</p><p>Regulation of Hsf1 activity to match the cellular load of unfolded proteins is central for maintaining proteostasis. In mammals, Hsf1 is kept latent by multiple layers of regulation, including cytosolic sequestration and monomerization, and stress triggers activation via nuclear targeting and induced DNA-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Yeast Hsf1 is subject to more fundamental regulation and resides in the nucleus and is responsible for both basal and stress-induced gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jakobsen and Pelham, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Solís et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wiederrecht et al., 1988</xref>). Hsf1 is considered to be regulated by a titratable chaperone repressor according to a model originally adapted from bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Craig and Gross, 1991</xref>). Accordingly, chaperones bind and repress Hsf1 and are titrated away by unfolded or misfolded proteins under stress conditions. The chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90 have been implicated in the regulation of Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abravaya et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zou et al., 1998</xref>). Recently evidence from the yeast model has been presented to support the notion that Hsp70 directly regulates Hsf1 as a titratable repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). First, Hsp70 (Ssa1 and Ssa2) binds Hsf1 and this association is transiently decreased by heat shock. Second, overexpression of Hsp70 (Ssa2) together with its J-domain cochaperone Ydj1 attenuates Hsf1 activity. Finally, eliminating transcriptional induction of Hsp70 as part of the HSR results in prolonged Hsf1-activation following heat-shock. A peptide in the CE2 subdomain of Hsf1 has been implicated as an important regulatory site for the association of the Hsp70 repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Høj and Jakobsen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jakobsen and Pelham, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, Hsp70 functions as the titratable chaperone repressor of Hsf1.</p><p>A simple scenario that explains chaperone titration is based on the direct competition between Hsf1 and substrates for binding to the Hsp70 substrate-binding domain (SBD). Hsp70 transiently associates with hydrophobic peptides of unfolded and misfolded proteins via its SBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rüdiger et al., 1997</xref>). Initially, substrates weakly associate with the SBDβ of ATP-bound Hsp70 and induce ATP hydrolysis and then become trapped by the closing SBDα lid subdomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mayer and Bukau, 2005</xref>). Substrates in the cytosol are released by nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) of the Hsp110 (Sse1 and Sse2) and armadillo (Fes1) classes that accelerate the exchange of ADP for ATP and thereby trigger opening of the SBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bracher and Verghese, 2015</xref>). Fes1 employs a specialized release domain (RD) to enable the efficient dissociation of persistent Hsp70 substrates such as misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gowda et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, <italic>fes1</italic>Δ cells exhibit strong constitutive activation of Hsf1 suggesting that this NEF is involved in Hsf1 latency regulation at the level of substrate release from Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gowda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gowda et al., 2018</xref>). Yet presently it is unclear whether Hsp70 handles Hsf1 as a canonical substrate and how NEFs influence the interactions. Moreover, the compartmentalized proteostasis system presents a spatial arrangement of significance for the chaperone titration model since both latent and transcriptionally active Hsf1 resides in the nucleus, while the bulk of its titratable negative regulator Hsp70, including the NEFs, are cytosolic and interact with newly translated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morán Luengo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sorger, 1991</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we reconstitute the Hsf1-Hsp70 interaction and isolate activation complexes that bind HSEs and are negatively regulated by excess Hsp70. Hsp70 binds Hsf1 via its canonical SBD providing direct support for the model of direct competition between chaperone substrates and Hsf1. During heat shock, these activating substrates are derived from the misfolding of cytosolic translation products. Unleashing Hsf1 from Hsp70 control reveals a cryptic hyper-stress program with a widely broadened gene-target signature and much amplified transcriptional effects. Thus, our data provides mechanistic insight into how Hsf1 activity is regulated by Hsp70 to modify the HSR regulon.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstitution of large Hsf1-Hsp70 complexes with regulated HSE-binding activity</title><p>To investigate how Hsf1 is regulated by Hsp70, we reconstituted a complex of yeast Hsf1 and Hsp70 Ssa1 by coexpression in <italic>E. coli</italic> together with the J-domain protein Sis1. Following tandem-affinity purification with matrices specific for Ssa1 (6 × His SUMO; Ni<sup>2+</sup>-IDA) and Hsf1 (Strep Tag II; Strep-Tactin Sepharose) a complex with the apparent stoichiometry of Hsf1 and Ssa1 3:1 was isolated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Sis1 did not copurify with the complex but did as expected interact with Ssa1 in the first affinity purification step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horton et al., 2001</xref>). The purified complex eluted as a single peak during size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with an estimated size close to 600–700 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Addition of increasing levels of ATP dissociated the complex quantitatively, consistent with the notion that Hsf1 is associated specifically with Hsp70-ADP and perhaps bound by its closed SBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To test the functionality of Hsf1 in the complex, we employed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and assessed the capacity of the isolated complex to bind HSE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The complex bound specifically to the 26 bp HSE-containing DNA fragment as evidenced by competition with unlabeled probes. Addition of the EMSA probe to native gels demonstrated that the intact Hsf1-Ssa1 complexes bind HSEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Consistent with this notion, addition of Ssa1-reactive serum resulted in that a fraction of the EMSA probe migrated as an ATP-sensitive supershifted smear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In the same line, the Hsp70 Ssa2 was found to interact in vivo with the Hsf1-dependent promoter of <italic>HSC82</italic> by ChIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, supplementation of the Hsf1-Ssa1 complexes with additional Ssa1 at low micromolar levels decreased HSE binding in a titratable manner as evidence by decreased signal of bound as well as of free oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). With the exception of the condition in which the highest concentration of Hsp70 was applied, ATP supplementation did not significantly impact on the inhibitory effect that excess Hsp70 exerted on Hsf1 DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). SEC analysis of Hsf1-Ssa1 complexes revealed that addition of Ssa1 resulted in the formation of Hsf1-containing supercomplexes that eluted earlier from the column than the largest size marker (669 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken the characterization of the reconstituted Hsf1-Ssa1 complex together, Hsf1 resides in Hsp70 complexes that populate at least two conformations; activation complexes that are competent of binding HSEs and larger latency complexes that are unable to bind DNA. Excess Hsp70 pushes the equilibrium towards the latency complexes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47791.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reconstitution of large ATP-sensitive Hsf1-Hsp70 complexes with chaperone regulated HSE-binding activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Recombinant Hsf1-Ssa1 complexes (Input; IN) were immobilized onto Strep-Tactin Sepharose (StrepTag II in Hsf1) in the presence of 0, 1, 5 or 10 µM ATP and after washing, bound protein was eluted (<bold>E</bold>) with desthiobiotin. The Ssa1/Hsf1 densitometric signal ratios from silver staining were quantified.

Briefly, the photoactivatable amino acid p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (pBPa) was incorporated by amber codon suppression at amino acid position 423 of the Ssa1 SBDβ (Ssa1<sub>E423BPa</sub>). We have recently shown that Ssa1<sub>E423BPa</sub> readily crosslinks to bound substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gowda et al., 2018</xref>). UV exposure of cells expressing Ssa1<sub>E423BPa</sub> resulted in widespread formation of crosslinked species that were detectable by western analysis as protein migrating larger than 70 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The overall crosslinking efficiency was not affected by a 3 min heat shock of the cells at 43°C prior to the UV irradiation. This shows that Hsp70 engages substrates under non-stressful as well as under stressful conditions. Western blotting demonstrated that Ssa1<sub>E423BPa</sub>-bound Hsf1 via its SBD under non-stressful conditions and that the interaction between Ssa1 and Hsf1 exhibited a 77% decrease when cells were heat shocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). As an alternative approach, we induced the misfolding of newly synthesized proteins by supplying the cultures with the proline ring analogue azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AzC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fowden et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trotter et al., 2002</xref>). This condition that efficiently activates Hsf1, reduced the levels of crosslinking between Hsf1 and Ssa1<sub>E423BPa</sub> to undetectable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). Similarly, performing the assay in <italic>fes1</italic>Δ cells that constitutively activate Hsf1 and accumulate misfolded proteins resulted in undetectable crosslinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). Thus, Hsp70 SBD interaction with Hsf1 decreases under Hsf1-inducing conditions explaining how misfolded proteins activate Hsf1 DNA-binding activity by titrating Hsp70 away from Hsf1-Hsp70 complexes.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47791.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Heat shock negatively regulates Hsp70 binding of Hsf1 via its SBD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Photocrosslinking (UV) of yeast cells grown at 30°C or subjected to a 3 min heat shock (HS) at 43°C that express Ssa1-HA with photoreactive Bpa (pBPa) incorporated at amino acid position 423 of the Hsp70 SBDβ in cells.

The overall crosslinking profile of Ssa1<sub>E423BPa</sub> remained unaltered in Sse1-NLS expressing cells suggesting that the bulk cytosolic Hsp70 substrate interactions were retained despite the increase nucleotide exchange in the nucleus. In contrast, Hsp70 crosslinking to Hsf1 was almost undetectable in Sse1-NLS expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These findings are consistent with the scenario that Sse1-NLS accelerates specifically the release of substrates from Hsp70 in the nucleus, including Hsf1. To address this, we measured the activity of Hsf1 using a minimal promoter with HSEs that drive the expression of yeast Nanoluciferase (yNLuc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Masser et al., 2016</xref>). Cells expressing Sse1-NLS displayed a threefold higher promoter activity compared to control cells expressing Sse1 carrying four point mutations (A280T, N281A, N572Y, E575A) that inactivate the NEF function (Sse1*-NLS), Sse1 with a nuclear export signal (Sse1-NES) or empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Polier et al., 2008</xref>).The effect was specific for Hsf1 since a derivative of the reporter with the HSEs exchanged to Msn2/4-responsive STRE elements did not display a change in activity when Sse1 was targeted to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Also, the Hsf1-dependent gene expression induced by Sse1-NLS was detectable on total protein level as increased levels of Hsp70, Hsp90 and Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Protein aggregate analysis showed that Sse1-NLS did not trigger protein aggregation suggesting that it does not hamper general protein folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). A 30 min heat-shock at 37°C gave an even more striking effect on the Sse1-NLS-induced activation of Hsf1 as measured by <italic>HSP104</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). While Sse1-NLS expressing cells under non-stressful conditions exhibited 5.5-fold higher transcript levels than cells with vector control or Sse1*-NLS, a transient heat shock revealed hyperactivation of Hsf1 with transcript levels 24.4-fold above the basal control levels. In contrast, vector control and Sse1*-NLS cells displayed a modest increase of <italic>HSP104</italic> transcript levels of 3.0- and 4.5-fold, respectively. The observed hyperactivation of Hsf1 and the induced loss of interaction with Hsp70 by Sse1-NLS demonstrate that specifically nuclear Hsp70 binding is required for Hsf1 latency control under both normal and stress conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Heat-shock activates Hsf1 by the misfolding of newly synthesized proteins</title><p>During heat shock, protein misfolding is considered the trigger for activation of Hsf1 via Hsp70 chaperone titration. We set out to investigate the role that newly translated proteins play in heat-shock-induced activation of Hsf1. First, we induced misfolding of newly synthesized proteins by transiently feeding cells with the proline ring analogue AzC. Consistent with earlier studies, we found that misfolding of newly translated proteins by AzC-induced Hsf1 activation within the first 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trotter et al., 2002</xref>). Pleotropic stress-activation of Msn2/4 was observed first 60 min after the AzC addition. In contrast, 30 min heat-shock at 37°C rapidly activated both Hsf1 and Msn2/4-dependent transcription with a peak in intensity after 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Combining the treatment of AzC and heat-shock revealed strong positive synergistic effects on Hsf1 activation, as determined by qPCR analysis of <italic>SSA4</italic> and <italic>HSP104</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, increasing the pool of newly translated proteins that are unable to fold properly due to incorporation of AzC results in more efficient heat-shock-induced titration of Hsp70.</p><p>We directly tested the impact that decreasing of the pool of newly synthesized proteins has on heat-shock-induced activation of Hsf1. Cycloheximide (CHX) was added to arrest translation right before a 15 min heat shock. Newly translated proteins constitute the main source of aggregating species in growing yeast cells and using the Hsp104-GFP marker we could confirm that CHX efficiently blocked the accumulation of heat-induced protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, under identical experimental conditions we observed a fourfold reduction of <italic>SSA4</italic> transcript levels when arresting translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As an alternative experimental approach to reduce ongoing translation, we acutely starved <italic>leu2</italic> auxotrophic cells for leucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). After 30 min of leucine starvation, translation rates had dropped significantly as evidenced by much decreased levels of the short-lived protein yNlucPEST expressed from the constitutive <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Under these conditions, heat shock at 37°C did not support any detectable Hsp104-GFP foci formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and importantly, resulted in fivefold lower levels of <italic>SSA4</italic> transcripts compared to the non-starved control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In summary, inducing misfolding of newly synthesized proteins is sufficient to activate Hsf1 and ongoing protein synthesis is required for its heat-shock-induced activation. Our data suggest that the aggregation-prone character of newly synthesized proteins makes these species highly proficient in titrating Hsp70 away from nuclear Hsf1 latency complexes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47791.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Heat shock activates Hsf1 by the misfolding of newly synthesized proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Micrographs of Hsp104-GFP in cells grown at 25°C and heat shocked (HS) for 15 min at 37°C either with or without the addition of CHX. The white scale bar is 5 μm.

Repression of transcripts that encode ribosomal proteins is a hallmark of the yeast heat shock response and depends of a set of transcriptional regulators that functions parallel to Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Causton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rudra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wade et al., 2004</xref>). Overall, the behavior indicates that <italic>fes1</italic>Δ cells mount a hyper-stress program in response to heat-shock as a result of more induced damage by the treatment or as a result of sensitized regulatory circuits, for example severe Hsp70 out-titration.</p><p>We asked if also wildtype cells could access the hyper-stress program by analyzing the transcript levels of the diagnostic <italic>CUP1</italic> gene under more extreme heat-shock conditions. In wild-type cells, the RNA-seq analysis showed that <italic>CUP1</italic> responds to heat shock at 37°C by transcriptional downregulation, yet in <italic>fes1</italic>Δ cells it is induced by heat shock as part of the hyper-stress program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). <italic>CUP1</italic> transcript analysis in wild-type cells by qPCR replicated the downregulation of transcription at 37°C and revealed that more extreme heat-shock conditions (45°C for 30 min) allowed also wild-type cells to induce the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). The <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter contains a minimal low-affinity HSE, suggesting that activation of the hyper-stress program involves increased levels of active Hsf1 due to severe out-titration of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sewell et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, the accumulation of persistent Hsp70 substrates changes Hsf1-dependent as well as other stress regulation to display hyper-induction/repression characteristics with greatly amplified transcriptional effects both when considering gene targets and induction amplitudes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Heat shock titrates the soluble pool of Hsp70</title><p>We asked if the Hsf1 activation and also the hyper-stress activation was the result of reducing the soluble Hsp70 pool by sequestration by aggregation-prone proteins. We performed protein-aggregate analysis by lysing cells using a high-pressure homogenizer followed by differential centrifugation of the lysates supplemented with nonionic detergent. Heat shocking WT cells at 37°C resulted in a somewhat changed pattern of proteins in the aggregate fraction compared to the unstressed 25°C condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). Importantly, a prominent band migrating at 70 kDa was enriched in the aggregate fraction and was identified as Hsp70 using anti-Ssa1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Analysis of soluble and aggregate fractions showed that soluble Ssa1 was transferred to the aggregate fraction upon heat-shock and that arresting translation using cycloheximide hindered both the induced aggregation and the titration of the soluble Hsp70 pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). On average, only 47% of the original soluble pool of Ssa1 remained after the heat shock showing efficient titration of the chaperone. When performing the analysis in <italic>fes1</italic>Δ cells, we found that the mutant accumulated large amounts of proteins and Hsp70 in the aggregate fraction already when cells were grown at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Accordingly, under non-stressful conditions the lion share of constitutively trimerized Hsf1 is organized in nuclear latency complexes in which Hsp70 restricts the transcription factor from binding HSEs. Hsp70 dynamically engages the latency complexes via its canonical SBD. Under stress conditions, the pool of available Hsp70 decreases as a result of chaperone titration by the accumulation of aggregating misfolded chaperone substrate proteins. The decreased availability of Hsp70 transforms Hsf1 latency complexes into 600–700 kDa activation complexes that bind HSEs and activate transcription. The main source of titrating substrate proteins during heat shock are newly translated polypeptides. Under hyper-stress conditions, protein misfolding and aggregation become wide-spread and protein aggregates sequester Hsp70. Consequently, Hsf1 is unleashed from Hsp70 latency control. The much-increased levels of active Hsf1 promote the occupancy of HSEs, including low-affinity HSEs (HSE<sup>L</sup>), thus triggering a hyper-stress transcriptional program with a wide target signature and much increased transcriptional amplitude. Our data support a model where the nuclear pool of available Hsp70 tightly controls Hsf1 DNA-binding capacity and represses a genetic emergency program that is triggered by proteostasis collapse.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47791.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model that show how Hsf1 is negatively regulated by the nuclear pool of Hsp70.</title><p>Summative graphical model of our current understanding of Hsf1 regulation. See Discussion for details.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47791-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our model is based on the nuclear localization of Hsf1 and the subcompartmentalized organization of the proteostasis system in the cytosol and nucleus as autonomous but still communicating pools. Experimentally, support of such autonomy was obtained by the finding that expression of the cytosolic NEF Sse1 in the nucleus triggers strong activation of Hsf1. Such strong deregulation of Hsf1 suggests that the nuclear and cytosolic Hsp70 pools are not immediately exchangeable via trafficking through the nuclear pores. Nevertheless, we find evidence for communication between the cytosol and nucleus. Newly translated proteins, which are produced in the cytosol are potent activators of Hsf1 when they misfold and similarly, impairing the release of persistent misfolded substrates from Hsp70 in the cytosol (<italic>fes1</italic>Δ) results in strong activation of Hsf1. Thus, the nucleus and cytosol communicate in the regulation of Hsf1, which likely involves transfer of Hsp70 and its substrates between the cytosol to the nucleus. Indeed, certain proteins that misfolded in the cytosol have been shown to target the nucleus where they are compartmentalized <italic>en route</italic> proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gardner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Prasad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prasad et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Samant et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the J-domain protein Sis1 is an important factor for the nuclear targeting of misfolded proteins suggesting that this Hsp70 co-chaperone is directly involved in Hsf1 regulation by delivering the titrating substrates to the nuclear Hsp70 pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gardner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Prasad et al., 2010</xref>) The implication of our data is that the regulation of Hsf1 latency relies on the compartmentalization of the proteostasis system between the cytosol and the nucleus. Nevertheless, the subcellular site(s) of Hsp70 titration by misfolded proteins remains to be determined. Upon mild heat shock we observe that half of the soluble Hsp70 (Ssa1) population is transferred to the aggregate fraction and under Hsf1 hyper-induction conditions (heat shocked <italic>fes1</italic>Δ cells) only 10% of the population remains soluble. Thus, the extent of the effect shows that the soluble pool of Hsp70 is titrated globally in the cell under Hsf1-inducing conditions.</p><p>Our reconstitution experiments show that Hsf1 and Hsp70 are sufficient components to form an ATP-sensitive activation complex that is competent of binding HSEs. The estimated size of the complex of 600–700 kDa and the Hsf1-Hsp70 stoichiometry of 3:1 is not readily compatible with a single trimer of Hsf1 in complex with one Hsp70 (Hsf1 = 93 kDa; Hsp70 = 70 kDa: 3 × 93 kDa + 70 kDa = 349 kDa). Instead the size fits better with two Hsf1 trimers each carrying a single Hsp70 (6 × 93 kDa + 2 × 70 kDa=698 kDa). Hsf1 has previously been observed to form oligomers larger than trimers that may correspond to hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sorger and Nelson, 1989</xref>). Supplementing it with an excess of free Hsp70 impedes HSE binding. In light of the DNA-binding activity of the 600–700 kDa complex and our finding that dissociation of this complex by ATP does not result in increased binding of HSEs, we consider this complex to be the transcriptionally active form of Hsf1. Consistent with this notion, &gt;669 kDa Hsf1-HSE complexes derived from yeast-cell-free lysates migrate slower on gels when mixed with Hsp70 antibodies and this effect is attenuated by ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonner et al., 1994</xref>). Similarly, Hsf1 complexes &gt; 670 kDa have been observed in lysates derived from <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clos et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Westwood et al., 1991</xref>). Neither these studies nor our reconstitution address whether other proteins than Hsf1 and Hsp70 are present in the cellular activation complexes. At present, we can rule out that the J-domain protein Sis1 is a stable constituent of the complexes since we co-expressed it with Hsp70 and Hsf1 and still it did not co-purify with the activation complexes. Our in vitro data show that an excess of free Hsp70 pushes the activation complexes into latency complexes that are unable to bind HSEs. In vivo crosslinking shows that Hsp70 binds Hsf1 directly via its SBDβ and that this interaction weakens when cells are heat shocked or stressed by the buildup of misfolded proteins (AzC and <italic>fes1</italic>Δ). Addition of ATP to the EMSA assays did not efficiently hinder formation of the latency complexes. We do not favor the interpretation that Hsp70-ATP binds Hsf1, rather we consider that the EMSA assay relies on a gel electrophoresis step that rapidly depletes free Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP and thereby enables binding of Hsp70-ADP early during gel running. Thus, the regulatory interactions between Hsp70 and Hsf1 depend on the intrinsic Hsp70 ATPase cycle. We consider that these dynamics are central for cellular titration of the Hsp70 chaperone repressor and also explains why we obtain an activation complex rather than a latency complex when purifying Hsf1-Hsp70 from <italic>E. coli</italic>. Previous studies highlight the hydrophobic CE2 motif of Hsf1 as an important site for latency regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Høj and Jakobsen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jakobsen and Pelham, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>). Hsp70 occupancy of this and other binding sites may represent the difference between the activation and latency complexes. In support of this notion, a just published study identified an additional negative regulatory Hsp70 binding site in the N-terminal activation domain of Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peffer et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, the N-terminal activation domain has recently been implicated in regulating the DNA binding activity of Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>). Together with our data these findings suggest that multiple Hsp70-binding sites control Hsf1 affinity for DNA. Independent of the exact regulatory Hsp70-bindings sites, chaperone titration should be understood in the context of complexes between trimeric Hsf1 and multiple Hsp70s.</p><p>The chaperone repression titration model raises questions regarding what protein species functions as the stress sensor. Our finding that Hsf1 engages the canonical Hsp70 SBD indicates that the transcription factor in principle competes with any Hsp70 substrate. Newly synthesized proteins are strong candidates as the stress sensors and that upon their misfolding will function as Hsp70 titrating agents. This notion is supported by our observation that inactivation of Fes1, a cytosolic NEF that specifically releases misfolded proteins from Hsp70, triggers unsurpassed activation of Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gowda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gowda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gowda et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, blocking translation at either the initiation or elongation step diminishes Hsf1 activation in response to heat shock. In the same line, inducing misfolding of newly synthesized proteins using the proline analogue AzC activates Hsf1 and triggers synergistic potentiation when combined with heat shock. The notion that newly translated proteins are stress sensors also gains support from literature. Furthermore, it is known that newly translated proteins readily misfolds by stress. Specifically, heat shock leads to increased degradation of newly synthesized but not of long-lived cytosolic proteins and formation of aggregates decorated by Hsp104 requires ongoing translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Medicherla and Goldberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). In light of this data it is interesting to consider what kind of newly translated proteins functions as the stress sensors for Hsf1 latency regulation. Organellar and secretory proteins are prime candidates. Many are synthesized in the cytosol and are maintained in unstructured conformations by Hsp70 until they are translocated over membranes into the organelles. Consistent with the notion that these species misfold in the cytosol and regulate Hsf1, stress specific to the ER has been reported to activate Hsf1 likely as a result of hampered protein translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu and Chang, 2008</xref>). Similarly, mutations in the tail-anchored pathway activates Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schuldiner et al., 2008</xref>). Another candidate class of Hsp70 titrating proteins is the ribosomal proteins and support for their involvement in Hsf1 activation has recently been obtained by experimentally impairing ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tye et al., 2019</xref>). On the biochemical level, the amyloid forming peptide aβ42 that is derived from a transmembrane domain has recently been shown to decrease the interaction between Hsp70 and Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, the actual contribution of a newly translated polypeptide to Hsf1 activation will depend on how well it titrates Hsp70. This in turn is affected by a multitude of characteristics including how fast the protein folds, how chaperones impact on the folding process, how the folding is affected by the stressor, how aggregation-prone the protein is and how the misfolded species interact with Hsp70. In the end, it is likely that a plethora of different proteins function in concert to regulate Hsf1 latency via Hsp70 titration.</p><p>Our transcriptional data show that yeast cells accommodate a cryptic genetic hyper-stress program that upon activation involves a widely broadened gene-target signature and much amplified transcriptional effects. The finding shows that in WT cells the bulk of Hsf1 is maintained latent under non-stressful conditions as well as after heat shock. A simple mechanistic interpretation to explain the induction of this hyper-stress program is that the increased concentration of Hsf1 activation complexes results in intensified occupancy of HSEs, including low affinity and obstructed sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erkine et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giardina and Lis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santoro et al., 1998</xref>). This interpretation explains both the broadened gene-target signature and the much-amplified transcriptional effects. Interestingly, the activation of a cryptic Hsf1 hyper-stress program in yeast is reminiscent of the induction of non-canonical and distinct genetic programs elicited by Hsf1 in cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mendillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scherz-Shouval et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, the cells employ Hsf1 to induce specific oncogenic and malignancy genes that are distinct from the classical HSR target genes. Despite that the here identified hyper-stress program in yeast involves other gene targets than the mammalian programs, we speculate that the fundamental mechanism of chaperone titration may underlie the expanded Hsf1 regulons in both yeast and cancers. Accordingly, like in the yeast model also mammalian cells harbor a large pool of latent Hsf1 that can become mobilized by the accumulation of persistent misfolded proteins that are associated with the malignant phenotype. This increased pool of constitutively active Hsf1 allows it to reach normally inaccessible genes and together with other transcription factors and chromatin modifiers to induce alternative regulons. To summarize our conceptual contribution, we find that an apparently simple chaperone-titration mechanism can produce diversified transcriptional outputs in response to distinct stress loads.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AMY31</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">For details see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cytoplasmic protein misfolding titrates nuclear Hsp70 to activate Hsf1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kevin Morano (Reviewer #2); David Pincus (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The transcription factor Hsf1 is conserved in eukaryotes and induces expression of molecular chaperones following heat shock and other environmental stresses. Despite the deep conservation of this transcriptional circuit, the biochemical mechanisms that control Hsf1 activity have remained unclear. The Hsp70-Hsf1 regulatory circuit has been the subject of renewed interest in the last few years, and this report addresses several less well understood features of control of the ancient heat shock response (HSR) in yeast through biochemical reconstitution and in vivo analyses. The studies seek to add three important contributions to the field: (1) Hsf1 can bind Hsp70 and DNA at the same time; (2) Hsf1 is a typical Hsp70 client; (3) Excess Hsp70 removes Hsf1 from DNA; (4) Cytosolic misfolded proteins are primary Hsf1 agonists. The reviewers are in agreement, however, that additional experimental support is necessary to support these interpretations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Hsf1 can bind Hsp70 and DNA at the same time:</p><p>a) A direct demonstration of Hsp70 in DNA bound complexes is essential to draw this conclusion. Specifically, Hsp70 association with Hsf1 at target gene promoters in cells by ChIP to the Ssa2 or <italic>HSC82</italic> promoter under non heat shock conditions and/or supershift of the DNA bound complexes assessed by EMSA in vitro would significantly strengthen this interpretation.</p><p>b) It is also not clear how the stoichiometry between Hsf1 and Hsp70 was determined to be 3:1. (The complex is 620 kDa; Hsf1 = 115 kDa; Hsp70 = 70 kDa. 3*115+70 = 415). A 3:3 stoichiometry, at 555 kDa would also be consistent with the apparent mobility. Based on the UV crosslinking, a denatured monomer of Hsf1 binds to Hsp70, so what is the evidence that a trimer only has a single Hsf1 bound?</p><p>c) The data that ATP relieves Ssa1-mediated inhibition of DNA binding is less compelling. There appears to be no effect at the 5X Ssa1 excess condition, and only minimal at 10X.</p><p>2) Hsf1 is a typical Hsp70 client:</p><p>a) The interpretation of the experiments is unclear on this point. Do the authors consider the observed effects to be due to Sse1 modulating Ssa1 nucleotide status and SBD binding to Hsf1 or to substrates in general (i.e., direct or indirect)? It is possible both scenarios are true, but they have not been distinguished. Clarification and direct experimental support, such as UV crosslinking to measure the interaction between Hsp70 and Hsf1 in WT cells treated with AzC, in Sse1-NLS cells under control conditions, and in <italic>fes1</italic>∆ cells under control and heat shock conditions, are needed to solidify this component of the model.</p><p>b) The subcellular site of competition for Hsp70 is unclear. The authors favor the nucleus, but no experimental support is offered. Either the model should be directly tested, or this strong interpretation should be removed from the manuscript.</p><p>c) Figure 4: the effects of AzC on both the HSR and the Msn2/4-mediated ESR have been well-established and it is not clear where the novelty lies in these experiments. Likewise the Hsp104-GFP behavior with CHX is well known – repetition/confirmation in this figure is probably unnecessary. However the leucine starvation experiments are a nice touch. Based on these data, it would be expected that Hsp104 would also not localize to puncta after leucine starvation – the authors should demonstrate this to complete the orthogonal validation of the nascent chain misfolding hypothesis.</p><p>3) Excess Hsp70 removes Hsf1 from DNA:</p><p>The data that ATP relieves Ssa1-mediated inhibition of DNA binding is less compelling. There appears to be no effect at the 5X Ssa1 excess condition, and only minimal at 10X. The lack of statistical treatment of these data (and indeed the entire manuscript) further reduces confidence in possible effects.</p><p>What is not clear is how the addition of excess Ssa1 modifies this complex to reduce DNA binding as shown in Figure 1E. What is the difference between the DNA binding-competent complexes and the so-called latency complexes? Does the molar excess of Ssa1 lead to supercomplexes with Hsf1 that could be detected by SEC or native PAGE? Does Hsf1 remain trimerized and bound to the same amount of Hsp70 after dissociating from DNA?</p><p>4) The manuscript also explore the impact of impaired cytosolic Hsp70 client release on the degree of Hsf1 de-repression. Reviewer support for this line of inquiry was significantly less enthusiastic given the fact that the authors' lab and others have previously demonstrated that cells lacking Fes1 constitutively activate the HSR specifically through Hsf1. Based on the input from reviewers, this aspect of the manuscript should be removed or alternatively extended:</p><p>a) The physiological relevance of this effect is unclear. Is there evidence that wildtype cells access this gene expression program with different levels and/or types of stress?</p><p>b) Why is this hyperactivation happening, and what are the genes that are differentially expressed and what is special about them besides the GO assignments?</p><p>c) The presentation of the RNA-seq data should be improved. The number of genes called as upregulated and downregulated seems to be an arbitrary choice of the z-score threshold, and the heat map clusters are unlabeled and therefore uninformative. A less opaque analysis would be two volcano plots showing all genes in the genome, where fold change of <italic>fes1</italic>∆/WT (in control and heat shock conditions) on the x-axis and a p-value for the significance based on the biological replicates on the y-axis. This will more clearly show across the genome how different the two strains are in the two conditions.</p><p>d) The authors should also examine the full sets of functionally-defined Hsf1 and Msn2/4 target genes (Pincus et al., 2018 for Hsf1, Solis et al., 2016 for Msn2/4) rather than just cherry picking 5 genes. The major result of the RNA-seq seems to be that the same genes are induced in WT and <italic>fes1</italic>∆, but just to a greater magnitude in the <italic>fes1</italic>∆ cells. This suggests that Hsf1 is just on to a higher gear – i.e., fully dissociated from Hsp70 – but not doing anything qualitatively different. A prediction here is that RNA seq in heat shocked <italic>ssa1/2∆</italic> double mutant would look the same as <italic>fes1</italic>∆. If the authors want to claim that Hsf1 has an expanded target gene repertoire in this situation, they will have to provide further evidence (e.g., ChIP Hsf1 to these new genes).</p><p>e) Figure 5J: the observation that additional Hsp70 (or at least a protein migrating near 70 kD – no antibody verification of the presumed chaperone band is provided) associates with the pellet in heat-shocked <italic>fes1</italic>∆ mutants is intriguing but incomplete. Namely, how much of the material observed is due to new synthesis vs. additional aggregating substrate? More importantly, is the soluble pool of Hsp70 visibly reduced? The experiment tracks input and concentrated pellet, which gives the impression that much of the Hsp70 has partitioned to the pellet. However the soluble pool composed of Ssa1/2 and the newly induced Ssa3/4 may not change.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47791.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Hsf1 can bind Hsp70 and DNA at the same time:</p><p>a) A direct demonstration of Hsp70 in DNA bound complexes is essential to draw this conclusion.

The reference to this figure has been introduced in the Results:</p><p>“Following tandem-affinity purification with matrices specific for Ssa1 (6×His-SUMO; Ni<sup>2+</sup>-IDA) and Hsf1 (Strep Tag II; Strep-Tactin Sepharose) a complex with the apparent stoichiometry of Hsf1 and Ssa1 3:1 was isolated (Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).”</p><p>We have also clarified the part in the Discussion that describes the stoichiometry of the purified Hsf1-Hsp70 complexes (please note that yeast Hsf1 is 93 kDa):</p><p>”The estimated size of the complex of 600-700 kDa and the Hsf1-Hsp70 stoichiometry of 3:1 is not readily compatible with a single trimer of Hsf1 in complex with one Hsp70 (Hsf1 = 93 kDa; Hsp70 = 70 kDa: 3 × 93 kDa + 70 kDa = 349 kDa). Instead the size fits better with two Hsf1 trimers each carrying a single Hsp70 (6 × 93 kDa + 2 × 70 kDa = 698 kDa).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The data that ATP relieves Ssa1-mediated inhibition of DNA binding is less compelling. There appears to be no effect at the 5X Ssa1 excess condition, and only minimal at 10X.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out that we may have overstated the effect of ATP addition and have now modified the description of the data in Results to better reflect the data. The experimental setup is not ideal since it relies on a preincubation with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP but these highly charged molecules are rapidly removed from the buffer as soon as the electrical field of the gel running is applied thus potentially allowing Hsp70 to bind Hsf1.</p><p>We have modified the EMSA protocol by omitting EDTA, adding MgCl<sub>2</sub> to the buffers and increasing ATP concentrations as well as used agarose instead acrylamide gels but the assays give the same result regarding HSE binding. New EMSA data has been introduced as Figure 1—figure supplement 1F. This panel shows the modest effect of ATP but importantly, the experiment now also clearly shows the increase of unbound HSE oligo upon Ssa1 addition to the Hsf1-Ssa1 complexes.</p><p>We have changed the Results to better describe the data and have included a new EMSA assays in Figure 1—figure supplement 1F:</p><p>“Interestingly, supplementation of the Hsf1-Ssa1 complexes with additional Ssa1 at low micromolar levels decreased HSE binding in a titratable manner as evidence by decreased signal of bound as well as of free oligonucleotides (Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-F). With the exception of the condition in which the highest concentration of Hsp70 was applied, ATP supplementation did not significantly impact on the inhibitory effect that excess Hsp70 exerted on Hsf1 DNA binding (Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 1F).”</p><p>We have changed the Discussion to present our concerns regarding ATP supplementation in the EMSA assays:</p><p>“Addition of ATP to the EMSA assays did not efficiently hinder formation of the latency complexes. We do not favour the interpretation that Hsp70-ATP binds Hsf1, rather we consider that the EMSA assay relies on a gel electrophoresis step that rapidly depletes free Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP and thereby enables binding of Hsp70-ADP early during gel running.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Hsf1 is a typical Hsp70 client:</p><p>a) The interpretation of the experiments is unclear on this point.

It is possible both scenarios are true, but they have not been distinguished. Clarification and direct experimental support, such as UV crosslinking to measure the interaction between Hsp70 and Hsf1 in WT cells treated with AzC, in Sse1-NLS cells under control conditions, and in fes1∆ cells under control and heat shock conditions, are needed to solidify this component of the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the Hsf1-Ssa1 UV-crosslinking experiments with AzC supplementation and in <italic>fes1</italic>∆ cells as well as with cells expressing Sse1-NLS. The new results have been incorporated in the manuscript as Figure 2C-F and Figure 3E. The Results section has been updated with the following sentences describing the new data and explaining or view of Sse1-NLS action:</p><p>“Western blotting demonstrated that Ssa1<sub>E423BPa</sub> bound Hsf1 via its SBD under non-stressful conditions and that the interaction between Ssa1 and Hsf1 exhibited a 77% decrease when cells were heat shocked (Figure 2A-B). […] Similarly, performing the assay in <italic>fes1</italic>Δ cells that constitutively activate Hsf1 and accumulate misfolded proteins resulted in undetectable crosslinking (Figure 2E-F).”</p><p>On Sse1-NLS action:</p><p>“Next, we directly tested Hsp70 client binding in cells expressing Sse1-NLS by employing the Ssa1E423BPa crosslinking assay. […] These findings are consistent with the scenario that Sse1-NLS accelerates specifically the release of substrates from Hsp70 in the nucleus, including Hsf1.”</p><p>Additionally, we have included new data from protein aggregation analysis that support the notion that Sse1-NLS does not function in an indirect way by generally impairing protein folding (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1B.) The Results section has been updated to describe the new data:</p><p>“Protein aggregate analysis showed that Sse1-NLS did not trigger protein aggregation suggesting that it does not hamper general protein folding (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The subcellular site of competition for Hsp70 is unclear. The authors favor the nucleus, but no experimental support is offered. Either the model should be directly tested, or this strong interpretation should be removed from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the view that the subcellular site(s) of the Hsp70 titration presently is unclear. Our new data from aggregation preps show that a substantial fraction of the total Hsp70 associates with aggregates (see answer point 4e), suggesting large scale titration Hsp70 in both the cytosol and nucleus. Yet, Hsf1 localizes to the nucleus. Consequently, we have removed statements emphasizing that the subcellular site of Hsp70 titration by misfolded proteins is the nucleus.</p><p>The title has been changed to:</p><p>“Cytoplasmic protein misfolding titrates Hsp70 to activate nuclear Hsf1”</p><p>The sentences in the Abstract that previously mentioned the nuclear pool of Hsp70 have been edited to not include this. The sentences are now reading:</p><p>“Hsp70 binds Hsf1 via its canonical substrate binding domain and Hsp70 regulates Hsf1 DNA binding activity. During heat shock, Hsp70 is out-titrated by misfolded proteins derived from on-going translation in the cytosol.”</p><p>Similarly, the last and summarizing paragraph of the Introduction has been edited and now reads:</p><p>“During heat shock, these activating substrates are derived from the misfolding of cytosolic translation products.”</p><p>References to titration of specifically the nuclear Hsp70 pool have been removed from the Discussion (first paragraph). We have included the following new sentences:</p><p>“Nevertheless, the subcellular site(s) of Hsp70 titration by misfolded proteins remains to be determined. […] Thus, the extent of the effect shows that the soluble pool of Hsp70 is titrated globally in the cell under Hsf1 inducing conditions.”</p><p>And:</p><p>“Another candidate class of Hsp70 titrating proteins is the ribosomal proteins and support for their involvement in Hsf1 activation has recently been obtained by experimentally impairing ribosome biogenesis (Tye et al., 2019).”</p><p>The model in (now in new Figure 7) has graphically been edited not to suggest that misfolded proteins have to enter the nucleus to titrate Hsp70. To accomplish this we have removed the graphical representation of the nuclear membrane and restructured the graphics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Figure 4: the effects of AzC on both the HSR and the Msn2/4-mediated ESR have been well-established and it is not clear where the novelty lies in these experiments.

What is the difference between the DNA binding-competent complexes and the so-called latency complexes? Does the molar excess of Ssa1 lead to supercomplexes with Hsf1 that could be detected by SEC or native PAGE? Does Hsf1 remain trimerized and bound to the same amount of Hsp70 after dissociating from DNA?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed new SEC analysis of the Hsf1-Ssa1 complexes and find that large supercomplexes indeed are forming upon addition of excess Ssa1.

Reviewer support for this line of inquiry was significantly less enthusiastic given the fact that the authors' lab and others have previously demonstrated that cells lacking Fes1 constitutively activate the HSR specifically through Hsf1. Based on the input from reviewers, this aspect of the manuscript should be removed or alternatively extended:</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that it is important to document the global transcriptional effects of unleashing Hsf1 from Hsp70 control. Previously we and others have demonstrated that cells lacking Fes1 activate Hsf1 at normally non-stressful conditions. In contrast, the consequences for Hsf1 activity upon severe loss of soluble Hsp70 has not been investigated before. To extend and strengthen this aspect of the manuscript, we have reworked the presentation of the data (modified Figure 5 and added four new figure supplements) and added new experiments (new Figure 5J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) The physiological relevance of this effect is unclear. Is there evidence that wildtype cells access this gene expression program with different levels and/or types of stress?</p></disp-quote><p>We have extended this section by performing qPCR analysis of <italic>CUP1</italic> mRNA during heat shock. The promoter of <italic>CUP1</italic> contains a minimal low-affinity HSE that is not induced by heat-shock treatment at 37°C. Instead it is downregulated. Yet in <italic>fes1</italic>Δ cells it is strongly induced, making <italic>CUP1</italic> a diagnostic gene for the Hsf1 hyper-stress program. Using the <italic>CUP1</italic> marker and applying more extreme stress (45°C heat shock) we find that also wildtype cells can access the hyper-stress program.</p><p>The new data have been added as Figure 5J.</p><p>The Results section has been updated with the following text describing the finding:</p><p>“We asked if also wildtype cells could access the hyper-stress program by analysing the transcript levels of the diagnostic <italic>CUP1</italic> gene under more extreme heat shock conditions.[…] The <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter contains a minimal low affinity HSE, indicating that activation of the hyper-stress program involves increased levels of active Hsf1 due to severe out-titration of Hsp70 (Sewell et al., 1995).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Why is this hyperactivation happening, and what are the genes that are differentially expressed and what is special about them besides the GO assignments?</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this section by better presentation of the GO analysis (new Figure 5—Figure supplement 4A-C).</p><p>The Results section now reads:</p><p>“GO analysis revealed that <italic>fes1</italic>Δ-specific induction to heat shock included genes related to cellular detoxification, response to toxic substances, oxidant detoxification and carbohydrate metabolism (Figure 5—figure supplement 4A-C). […] Overall, the behavior indicates that <italic>fes1</italic>Δ cells mount a hyper-stress program in response to heat-shock as a result of more induced damage by the treatment or as a result of sensitized regulatory circuits, e.g. severe Hsp70 out-titration.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The presentation of the RNA-seq data should be improved. The number of genes called as upregulated and downregulated seems to be an arbitrary choice of the z-score threshold, and the heat map clusters are unlabeled and therefore uninformative. A less opaque analysis would be two volcano plots showing all genes in the genome, where fold change of fes1∆/WT (in control and heat shock conditions) on the x-axis and a p-value for the significance based on the biological replicates on the y-axis. This will more clearly show across the genome how different the two strains are in the two conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion and have revised the presentation of the RNA-seq data in Figure 5. The requested Vulcano plots are now included as Figure 5H and I. We have edited the Results section that describes the RNA-seq:</p><p>“Inspection of the expression of all genes in WT and <italic>fes1</italic>Δ cells before and after the heat shock, revealed a highly accentuated transcriptional response in <italic>fes1</italic>Δ cells involving amplified induction and inclusion of more Hsf1 and Msn2/4 target genes (Figure 5H-I and Figure 5—figure supplement 3A-B). […] The effect was even more pronounced for repressed genes with 396 identified genes in WT cells and 849 in <italic>fes1</italic>Δ.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) The authors should also examine the full sets of functionally-defined Hsf1 and Msn2/4 target genes (Pincus et al., 2018 for Hsf1, Solis et al., 2016 for Msn2/4) rather than just cherry picking 5 genes. The major result of the RNA-seq seems to be that the same genes are induced in WT and fes1∆, but just to a greater magnitude in the fes1∆ cells. This suggests that Hsf1 is just on to a higher gear – i.e., fully dissociated from Hsp70 – but not doing anything qualitatively different. A prediction here is that RNA seq in heat shocked ssa1/2∆ double mutant would look the same as fes1∆. If the authors want to claim that Hsf1 has an expanded target gene repertoire in this situation, they will have to provide further evidence (e.g., ChIP Hsf1 to these new genes).</p></disp-quote><p>The full set of functionally-defined Hsf1 and Msn2/4 target genes have now been included in the analysis and is presented in the new Vulcano plots in (Figure 5H-I) as well as in new density plots (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A-B). We have clarified that we indeed find that Hsf1 is on a higher gear during the hyper-stress observed in heat-shocked <italic>fes1</italic>Δ cells. The following key summarizing sentence has now been included in the Results section:</p><p>“Overall, the behavior indicates that <italic>fes1</italic>Δ cells mount a hyper-stress program in response to heat-shock as a result of more induced damage by the treatment or as a result of sensitized regulatory circuits, e.g. severe Hsp70 out-titration.”</p><p>In support of the finding that Hsf1 expands its target repertoire upon severe Hsp70 out-titration, we have also included new Figure 5J showing that Hsf1 recognizes the low-affinity HSE in the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter (see answer point 4a). We have also plotted the expression all Hsf1-target genes individually under the four conditions to display how Hsf1 expands its targets when the stress is more severe (Figure 5—figure supplement 4)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Figure 5J: the observation that additional Hsp70 (or at least a protein migrating near 70 kD – no antibody verification of the presumed chaperone band is provided) associates with the pellet in heat-shocked fes1∆ mutants is intriguing but incomplete. Namely, how much of the material observed is due to new synthesis vs. additional aggregating substrate? More importantly, is the soluble pool of Hsp70 visibly reduced? The experiment tracks input and concentrated pellet, which gives the impression that much of the Hsp70 has partitioned to the pellet. However the soluble pool composed of Ssa1/2 and the newly induced Ssa3/4 may not change.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the questions by performing additional aggregation experiments. The new data support to the notion that Hsp70 is titrated from the soluble to the aggregate fraction by heat shock. General aggregation as well as Hsp70 association with the aggregate fraction depend on ongoing translation in WT cells. The <italic>fes1</italic>Δ partially overrides this requirement, likely due to the high levels of misfolded proteins present in these cells already at the start of the heat shock.</p><p>The new data are presented in new Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1. The Results section has been updated to present the new findings in subsection “Heat shock titrates the soluble pool of Hsp70”.</p><p>The Discussion section has been updated with:</p><p>“Upon mild heat shock we observe that half the soluble Hsp70 (Ssa1) population is transferred to the aggregate fraction and under Hsf1 hyper-induction conditions (heat shocked <italic>fes1</italic>Δ cells) only 10% of the population remains soluble. Thus, the extent of the effect shows that the soluble pool of Hsp70 is titrated globally in the cell under Hsf1 inducing conditions.”</p><p>Figure legends and the Materials and methods section have been updated accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
