pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25517.001</object-id><p>Impact of stress on diseases including gastrointestinal failure is well-known, but molecular mechanism is not understood. Here we show underlying molecular mechanism using EAE mice. Under stress conditions, EAE caused severe gastrointestinal failure with high-mortality. Mechanistically, autoreactive-pathogenic CD4+ T cells accumulated at specific vessels of boundary area of third-ventricle, thalamus, and dentate-gyrus to establish brain micro-inflammation via stress-gateway reflex. Importantly, induction of brain micro-inflammation at specific vessels by cytokine injection was sufficient to establish fatal gastrointestinal failure. Resulting micro-inflammation activated new neural pathway including neurons in paraventricular-nucleus, dorsomedial-nucleus-of-hypothalamus, and also vagal neurons to cause fatal gastrointestinal failure. Suppression of the brain micro-inflammation or blockage of these neural pathways inhibited the gastrointestinal failure. These results demonstrate direct link between brain micro-inflammation and fatal gastrointestinal disease via establishment of a new neural pathway under stress. They further suggest that brain micro-inflammation around specific vessels could be switch to activate new neural pathway(s) to regulate organ homeostasis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

autoreactive helper T cell (CD4+ T cell)-mediated autoimmune disease in the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sawcer et al., 2011</xref>). It can be divided into at least four subgroups: (1) relapse-remitting MS (over 80% patients), (2) secondary progressive MS (the late phase of relapse-remitting type), (3) primary progressive MS (about 10% patients), and (4) relapse-progressing MS (about 5% patients), all of which are characterized by chronic inflammation in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Steinman, 2009</xref>). MS inflammatory lesions consist of various immune cells, including CD4+ T cells and MHC class II+CD11b+ monocytes/macrophages, and subsequent loss of neurological function in the CNS due to the disruption of neural circuits that regulate various organ functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Steinman, 2014</xref>). Indeed, several complications including mental illnesses and gastrointestinal failures are associated with MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldman Consensus Group, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kimura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marrie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pokorny et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rang et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadovnick et al., 1989</xref>).

EAE development is dependent on autoreactive helper T cells (pathogenic CD4+ T cells), particularly Th1 and Th17 cells and many immune cells are accumulated at the affected sites such as CD8+ T cells, macrophages, B cells, and neutrophils. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arima et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jäger et al., 2009</xref>). To develop EAE, CNS autoantigens including myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), myelin basic protein (MBP), and proteolipid protein (PLP) are immunized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rangachari and Kuchroo, 2013</xref>). We sorted CD4+ T cells from mice EAE induced with a MOG peptide plus complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (active EAE model) and stimulated the cells with a MOG peptide in the presence of MHC class II+ antigen presenting cells and cytokines in vitro followed by intravenously injecting them into wild type C57BL/6 mice (the transfer EAE model) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arima et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rangachari and Kuchroo, 2013</xref>). Therefore, the transfer EAE model is completely dependent on MOG-specific CD4+ T cells (pathogenic CD4+ T cells) including Th17 and Th1 populations, while it is not dependent on CD8+ T cells because of no CD8+ T cells in the transferred pathogenic T cell population. Importantly, there are many papers that describe the involvement of not only IL-17A but also IFN-γ particularly from pathogenic CD4+ T cells including activated Th1 and Th17 cells for the development of EAE models including the transfer EAE ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duhen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">El-behi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goverman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jäger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ottum et al., 2015</xref>). Using this transfer EAE model, we previously identified several specific sensory-sympathetic connections generate immune cell-gateways at specific vessels in the blood-brain barrier through which immune cells, including pathogenic CD4+ T cells, migrate to the CNS as the gateway reflex in the research field of the neural signal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arima et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chavan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mori et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pavlov and Tracey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sabharwal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tracey, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">2016</xref>).</p><p>Stress conditions can cause gastrointestinal diseases via the brain-gut axis. Animal models have shown that this axis involves interactions between neural components, including the autonomic nervous system, the central nervous system, the stress system such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and the corticotropin-releasing factor system, and intestinal factors such as the intestinal barrier, the luminal microbiota, and the intestinal immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonaz and Bernstein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stengel and Taché, 2009</xref>). However, details about the underlying molecular mechanisms, including the relationship between each of these components, are lacking.</p><p>In the present paper, we report a relationship between brain micro-inflammation and fatal gastrointestinal failure. We demonstrate that brain micro-inflammation at blood vessels specific in the boundary area of the third ventricle region, thalamus, and dentate gyrus is established by pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer under stress conditions and induces fatal gastrointestinal failure via a paraventricular nucleus (PVN)/dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH)-vagal pathway. Mechanistic analysis suggested that the gateway reflex triggered by stress-mediated PVN activation induced the accumulation of immune cells, including pathogenic CD4+ T cells and MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells, at these specific vessels in a manner dependent on CCL5. The resulting brain micro-inflammation enhanced a new neural pathway including neurons in the PVN and DMH, and vagal nerve-mediated gastrointestinal failure via micro-inflammation-dependent ATP. Accordingly, blockade of the regional brain micro-inflammation and establishment of the new neural pathway inhibited the gastrointestinal pathology. These results suggest that brain micro-inflammation at specific vessels is a risk for severe gastrointestinal failure via the PVN/DMH-vagal neural pathway, indicating a direct molecular link between brain micro-inflammation and organ dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stress conditions cause a severe phenotype of EAE</title><p>To examine the impact of stress conditions in a transfer EAE model, we first employed a sleep disorder model, in which continuous stress is imposed on mice on a free rotation wheel for 2 days by the perpetual avoidance of water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miyazaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oishi et al., 2014</xref>).

Donor pathogenic CD4+ T cells and MHC class II+ cells first accumulate at the L5 cord within 5 days after pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer via the gravity-gateway reflex as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sabharwal et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In the present work, chronic stress caused pathogenic CD4+ T cells and MHC class II+ cells to accumulate at specific vessels of the boundary region of the third ventricle region, thalamus, and dentate gyrus, but not in the L5 cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These data suggested that the L5 cord vessels are no longer used as a gateway for immune cells toward the CNS under chronic stress conditions. Furthermore, EAE mice under stress had no paralyzed tail, uneven gait, or paralyzed rear leg, which are all normally observed in EAE mice without stress. These data are consistent with the L5 cord vessels not acting as a gateway for immune cells under chronic stress conditions. We also found that pathogenic CD4+ T cells and MHC class II+ cells accumulated comparably at the brain specific vessels redardless of lansoprazol treatment, which suppressed gastrointestine dysregulation (see Fiugre 2F), in mice with pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer under stress condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B and C</xref>). These data suggested that chronic stress changes the position of the gateway for immune cells from L5 cord vessels to brain specific vessels, while pathogenic CD4+ T cells are activated and acculumated at the specific vessels even after lansoprazol treatment. In addition, we showed that lansoprazol treatment did not affect the accumulation of immune cells in L5 and EAE symptoms in mice without stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), confirming that lansoprazol has no or minimun affect on pathogenic T cells. All these data suggested that lansoprazol treatment does not affect the EAE induction and that the stress-gateway reflex alters the gateway of pathogenic CD4+ T cells. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed an abundance of immune cell accumulation including pathogenic CD4+ T cells and MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells in the hippocampus and interbrain area, where the specific vessels were localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Td-tomato labeling of microglia cells, which we used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arima et al., 2015</xref>), revealed that MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells originated from the peripheral organs rather than resident microglia cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that the MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells that accumulated at the specific vessels were activated monocytes from the peripheral organs. Moreover, we found that various immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, B cells, NK cells, and neutrophils, had also accumulated at the specific vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Importantly, the accumulation of IL-17A- or IFN-γ-deficient pathogenic CD4+ T cells was significantly reduced at the specific blood vessels under stress conditions and resulted in less mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). These data suggested that both IFN-γ and IL-17A from pathogenic CD4+ T cells are necessary for the accumulation at specific vessels and the severe phenotypes. Consistent with these results, prominent inhibitory effects on the disease development were observed with combined neutralization of IL-17A and IFN-γ(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results suggested that stress-mediated CCL5 expression at the specific vessels induces the accumulation of pathogenic CD4+ T cells, particularly Th17 and Th1 cells and MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells to establish brain micro-inflammation, which is critical for the development of fatal gastrointestinal failure.

To answer this question, we directly microinjected pathogenic CD4+ T cells plus MOG-pulsed DC or inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ plus IL-17A or IL-6 plus IL-17A, either of which is known to be expressed by pathogenic CD4+ T cells and enhance chemokine expression at specific vessels in gateway reflexes previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sabharwal et al., 2014</xref>), at specific vessels of the boundary region of the third ventricle region, thalamus, and dentate gyrus under stress condition. We found that brain micro-inflammation induced by these treatments developed severe gastrointestinal failure and affected mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Furthermore, we investigated the mortality of mice with microinjections of cytokines at the specific vessels under stress condition in the presence or absence of anti-CCL5 antibody treatment and found anti-CCL5 antibody treatment had no significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). This result suggested that CCL5 mainly contributes to the accumulation of immune cells including pathogenic CD4+ T cells at the specific vessels, while the effect of cytokine injection is CCL5-independent.

Moreover, the activation of PVN neurons, particularly TH<sup>neg</sup> neurons, was enhanced in mice with pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer under stress condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting the crosstalk between microinflammation at the specifc vessels and PVN. We further examined whether there is a direct neural connection between the specific vessels and the PVN. We found that injection of a retrograde neural tracer, cholera toxin B (CTB), at specific vessels of the boundary area of third ventricle region, thalamus, and dentate gyrus reached the PVN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In addition, TH+ neurons at the PVN co-expressed noradrenaline transporter, but not dopamine transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that they secrete noradrenaline at the specific vessels, which we have shown to be important for chemokine induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arima et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sabharwal et al., 2014</xref>).

Furthermore, the ablation of PVN and DMH sites significantly inhibited brain micro-inflammation, gastrointestinal disease and mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). It is reported that the activation of DMH neurons is suppressed by GABA-A receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rusyniak et al., 2008</xref>). Muscimol, GABA-A receptor agonist, injection at DMH suppressed gastrointestinal disease and mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). All these results suggested that DMH activation following the microinflammation at the specific vessels is critical for the development of fatal gastrointestinal disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>ATP induced at the sites of brain micro-inflammation activates the DMH and severe gastrointestinal failure</title><p>ATP is a neurotransmitter and is expressed in several cells after cytokine stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burnstock, 2006</xref>). We found that the expression of ATP was enhanced after IL-17A plus IL-6 stimulation in endothelial cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Neurons in the DMH were highly activated by the microinjection of ATP at the specific vessels under stress condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Moreover, blockade of the ATP receptor, P2RX7, at the specific vessels by A438079, a selective antagonist, suppressed the neural activation and fatal gastrointestinal failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Thus, these results suggested that ATP is downstream of cytokine stimulation and acts as a neural stimulator. Moreover, we performed immunohistochemical staining results. Neurons (Neurofilament L-positive cells) around the specific vessels expressed P2RX7 and after cytokine or ATP stimulation, neurons in the DMH region also showed NFATc1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is a downstream signaling component of P2RX7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grol et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we suggested that ATP can be sensed by neurons that connect specific vessels to the DMH region in a manner dependent on P2RX7 expression. In combination with other data in this paper, we propose the following pathogenic pathway: CCL5 (from endothelial cells at the specific vessels)→ IFN-γ/IL-17A/IL-6 (from pathogenic CD4+ T cells) → ATP (from endothelial cells at the specific vessels)→ neural activation in the DMH region. These results suggest that ATP at the sites of brain micro-inflammation activates the DMH to cause severe gastrointestinal failure.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25517.022</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>ATP induced at brain micro-inflammation sites causes severe gastrointestinal failure by activating DMH neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ATP expression from BC1 cells after stimulation with IL-6 and IL-17A.

We have reported that pathogenic CD4+ T cells transverse toward the central nervous system (CNS) through a gateway at the dorsal vessels of the fifth lumbar (L5) spinal cord in steady state in response to gravity-mediated chemokine expression via regional sympathetic activation, a phenomenon we call the gravity-gateway reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arima et al., 2012</xref>). During the gravity-gateway reflex, we found that artificial electric stimulations in different muscles, which mimic specific sensory-sympathetic crosstalk, establsihes the immune cell gateways at different regions of the dorsal vessels of spinal cord, a phenomenon we call the electric-gateway reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arima et al., 2012</xref>). We also found that pain induces sympathetic-mediated alterations in ventral vessels of the spinal cord to establish gateways to cause EAE relapse, a phenomenon we call the pain-gateway reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arima et al., 2015</xref>). In the present study, we show that, under stress condition, a gateway forms at the vessels of boundary area of third ventricle region, thalamus, and dentate gyrus, which we describe as the stress-gateway reflex.</p><p>We found immune cell accumulation at the specific vessels of brain but not in L5 cord in mice after pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer under stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), although we previously showed that the L5-gateway is established by specific neural activation via gravity-mediated soleus stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arima et al., 2012</xref>). It is important to know how was the gateway of immune cells at the L5 cord disappeared? Because we found that mice with stress show reduced movement and often lie down, we hypothesize they would have reduced stimulation of the soleus muscles, which are the main anti-gravity muscles. The sensory neurons from soleus muscles connect to L5 dorsal root ganglions (DRG), which are activated by anti-gravity responses of the soleus muscles in wild type mice. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that mice with stress reduce L5 DRG activation and chemokine expression from L5 dorsal vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, it is possible that stress condition reduces anti-gravity-mediated soleus stimulation followed by closing the L5 gateway of immune cells.</p><p>In our previous work, we identified CX3CL1 as a key chemokine for the accumulation of activated monocytes at L5 ventral vessels and EAE relapse after pain induction in EAE-recovered mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arima et al., 2015</xref>). In detail, the transfer EAE shows transient clinical symptoms. We called EAE mice that stopped showing clinical symptoms EAE-recovered mice. There is no relapse in EAE-recovered mice under normal condition. On the other hand, over 90% of MS patients experience relapse, and there are reports showing that the occurrence of pain is associated with neurologic symptoms and disease severity in patients with MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ehde et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O'Connor et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that pain sensation might induce MS relapse via a reflex pathway. Indeed, pain sensation induced EAE relapse in EAE-recovered mice. Mechanistic analysis showed that the CNS conditions between wild type and EAE-recovered mice are completely different even though both groups show no clinical symptoms. In the EAE-recovered mice, many MHC class IIhiCX3CR1+CD11b+ cells are found in the CNS particulalry in L5 level. These cells are not activated microglial cells but activated monocytes coming from the periphery. The identification of the periphery as the source of MHC class IIhiCX3CR1+CD11b+ cells was done by two methods: parabiosis and labeling microglial cells with CX3CR1-Tdtomato. Importantly, these activated monocytes in the CNS of EAE-recovered mice stayed for a long time (over 150 days in some cases) after pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer and are critical for the development of pain-mediated EAE relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arima et al., 2015</xref>), eLife). On the other hand, many papers have recently reported resident T cells stay in non-immune tissues for a very long time (over 150 days in some cases) after the initial immune response in the tissues and affect subsequent immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iijima and Iwasaki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mueller and Mackay, 2016</xref>). The characteristics of these resident T cells and our activated monocytes in the CNS of the EAE-recovered mice are quite similar: (1) infiltrate the initially affected non-immune tissues, (2) infiltrate a long time, and (3) influence subsequent immune responses. Therefore, we describe the activated monocytes in the CNS of EAE-recovered mice as resident monocytes.</p><p>Resident monocytes with CX3CR1 in EAE-recovered mice accumulate from the periphery to stay in the CNS for a long time and contribute to the development of pain-mediated EAE-relapse. Therefore, it is possible that the origin of the resident monocytes could be patrolling monocytes with CX3CR1 in blood stream. We previously showed that resident monocytes with CX3CR1 express CX3CL1 after stimulation with norepinephrine, which is produced around the ventral vessels of the spinal cord following activation of the pain-specific neural pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arima et al., 2015</xref>). These results suggested a CX3CR1-CX3CL1 autocrine loop in the resident monocytes that is regulated by norepinephrine. A major distinction between the previous and the current study is that in the previous study the activated monocytes were already presented in the CNS as CNS-resident activated monocytes with autoantigen presentation abilityand high CX3CR1 expression in EAE-recovered mice. The CNS-resident activated monocytes were infiltrated the CNS during the initial phase of EAE. The pain-specific neural pathway then induced the accumulation of these CNS-resident activated monocytes at the L5 ventral vessels, which is where norepinephrine was produced via the pain-specific sympathetic pathway, followed by EAE relapse and the accumulation of other immune cells including pathogenic CD4+ T cells from the blood stream. However, in the current study, there are no CNS-resident activated monocytes in wild type mice under stress. Therefore, CX3CL1, which is a critical chemokine for CNS-resident monocytes, is not critical for the stress-gateway reflex in this study. On the other hand, during the stress-gateway reflex, we recognized CCL5 is required for the recruitment of pathogenic CD4+ T cells, including Th1 and Th17 cells, to the specific vessels from the periphery to trigger micro-inflammation and stimulate the subsequent recruitment of MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells. (These MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells are possibly similar or the same cell types as the activated monocytes in the pain-gateway reflex, although majority of activated monocytes from the periphery initially express low CX3CR1 in the CNS). We assume that the recruitment of MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells may be at least partially dependent on CX3CL1 from endotheial cells, which is induced by cytokines from pathogenic CD4+ T cells that accumulated at the specific vessels in response to CCL5. The cytokines IFN-γ, IL-17A, and IL-6, which are likely secreted by the pathogenic CD4+ T cells, are also important for the development of this micro-inflammation and the resulting severe gastrointestinal failure. Indeed, both the accumulation of CD4+ T cells and MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells at the specific vessels as well as the severe gastrointestinal failure were suppressed by blockade of CCL5 or IL-17A and IFN-γ. Additionally, IL-17A- or IFN-γ-deficient pathogenic CD4+ T cells did not accumulate at the specific vessels even under stress. We hypothesized the BBB breaching at the specific vessels depends on antigen-presenting events on pathogenic CD4+ T cells. In agreement, we found that MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells had the ability to activate pathogenic CD4+ T cells without exogenous MOG peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>), suggesting that MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells have autoantigen-presentation ability. We theorize that the chemokine/cytokine expression and the accumulation of MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells as well as pathogenic CD4+ T cells at specific vessels could be used to diagnose and/or therapeutically target several types of severe gastrointestinal failure in patients.</p><p>We found that the development of fatal gastrointestinal failure depended on activation of a previously unidentified DMH-vagal nerve pathway, which was triggered by ATP from the brain micro-inflammation sites. We here found that this nerve pathway was hardly activated under steady state or stress conditions without brain micro-inflammation. Thus, ATP at the specific vessels can be viewed as a switch that activates this new neural pathway. At the same time, the brain micro-inflammation is triggered by PVN-mediated TH+ sympathetic activation in the presence of pathogenic CD4+ T cells in the blood. Emotional responses can activate specific nuclei in emotional centers that contain TH+ noradrenergic neurons. We found TH+ noradrenergic neurons connected the PVN with the specific vessels localized at the boundary area of the third ventricle region, thalamus, and dentate gyrus. There exist TH+ noradrenergic neuronal pathways that connect other nuclei to some specific vessels in the brain. For example, it is reported that cerebral microvessels have noradrenergic innervation from the locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harik, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalaria et al., 1989</xref>). Our results therefore may indicate that brain micro-inflammation at some specific vessels could activate unidentified neural pathways to regulate the homeostasis of various organs including brain itself.</p><p>The brain-gut axis involves several neural components, including (1) the autonomic nervous system, (2) the CNS, (3) the stress system such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and (4) the corticotropin-releasing factor system, along with the intestinal response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caso et al., 2008</xref>). Regarding connection between (1) the autonomic nervous system and (2) the CNS, we showed that the stress condition activates PVN noradrenagic/sympathetic neurons connected to vessels localized at the boundary area of the third ventricle region, thalamus, and dentate gyrus. This activation is important for the accumulation of pathogenic CD4+ T cells and MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells. Regarding connection between (2) the CNS and (3) the stress system, the enhanced activation of the neurons in the PVN/DMH regions by the brain micro-inflammation and stress activated DMX/vagal nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). During this process, (4) the corticotropin-releasing factor system was also activated, as indicated by the high corticosteroid levels in the serum of mice even without pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer. Importantly, we found that gastrointestinal diseases after microinjection of cytokines in mice with stress were not suppressed by two antagonists of the corticosteroid receptor such as mifepristone and guggulsterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, regarding the gastrointestinal response, the resulting vagal nerve activation induced severe gastrointestinal failure, although the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis has a minimum role in the development of micro inflammation-mediated gastrointestinal diseases under stress.</p><p>How is the linkage between pathogenic CD4+ T cells and activation of p38 in stomach? It is known that pathogenic CD4+ T cells for the transfer EAE express cytokines including IFN-γ, IL-17A, and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Langrish et al., 2005</xref>), and very strong stress alone induces gastric disease via p38 activation at the affected tissues by the activation of the vagal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Debas and Carvajal, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Uwada et al., 2017</xref>). We showed that the injection of IFN-γ, IL-17A, and IL-6 or ATP at specific vessels in the brain of mice with relatively low stress establishes a neural pathway via DMH and DMX (nucleus of vagal nerves) followed by the development of fatal gastrointestinal diseases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5G</xref>) and the activation of p38 in stomach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, cytokine stimulation in endothelial cells causes the expression of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These results strongly suggested that cytokines from pathogenic CD4+ T cells act on endothelial cells at the specific vessels and induce ATP around the specific vessels. The resulting ATP activates the DMH-vagal axis, which is important for the development of gastrointestinal diseases as well as the activation of p38. Therefore, cytokines from the pathogenic CD4+ T cells are a triggering factor to activate p38 in the affected GI tract tissues via DMH-vagal axis activation in mice with relatively low-stress.</p><p>Several papers have reported concurrence of MS and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kimura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pokorny et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rang et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadovnick et al., 1989</xref>). Interestingly, primary progressive MS is dominant in patients who suffered from bowel dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Preziosi et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that transfer EAE under stress condition could model progressive MS. Complications of celiac disease, epilepsy and cerebral calcifications are also known to be associated with MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gobbi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gobbi et al., 1992</xref>). Therefore, our model may provide a possible explanation for several brain-intestine comorbidities during brain diseases including MS.</p><p>It is reported that micro-inflammations in the brain occur in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, non-Alzheimer type dementia and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Appel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Togo et al., 2002</xref>), psychological disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Najjar et al., 2013</xref>), and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vezzani et al., 2011</xref>). Cerebral microbleeding is an important risk factor for dementia(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Watanabe et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, some of these diseases are known to be associated with specific alliles of MHC class II genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferrari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nalls et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting involvement of autoreactive CD4+ T cells. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that micro-inflammation at some vessels, which is most likely triggerred by autoreactive CD4+ T cells, could activate new neural pathways to cause dysfunction in the brain neural network and/or in certain organs in the periphery. It is reported that the prevalence of dementia is considerably higher in elder people with gastritis and psychological disorders is associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Momtaz et al., 2014</xref>), which supports our hypothesis.</p><p>Sensitivity to chronic stress in humans is diverse owing to genetic factors and/or environmental factors such as stressful events in early life when the brain is particularly sensitive to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lupien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mayer, 2000</xref>). Indeed, it is reported that early life stress such as abuse or poor care plays a role in the susceptibility to develop behavior problems and gastrointestinal diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lupien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mayer, 2000</xref>). The early life period is also important for the establishment of T cell repertoire and central tolerance, and it is known that thymocytes are very sensitive to glucocorticoid that can be induced by stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashwell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hogquist et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that individual variations to respond to stress might also be defined by the presence of autoreactive CD4+ T cells to the CNS autoantigens, and that measurement of the autoreactive CD4+ T cell population in the peripheral blood might predict the susceptibility to develop peripheral organ failure by chronic stress. Genetic associations of certain MHC class II alleles with diseases including dementia and neurodegenerative diseases etc that involve brain micro-inflammation described above support our hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferrari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nalls et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated a molecular mechanism of the brain-gut axis by using a brain autoimmune-inflammation model under stress condition. Our findings provide molecular insight on how brain micro-inflammation at specific vessels develops fatal gastrointestinal failure. Because there are afferent and efferent neural systems in whole body, it could be possible that dysregulations in the peripheral organs including not only gastrointestine and heart but also other organs might also affect the status or region of micro-inflammation in the brain. We propose that local brain micro-inflammation is induced by stress-mediated PVN activation to enhance the activation of a new neural pathway, the DMH-vagal nerve pathway, to aggravate gastrointestinal failure.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Japan SLC (Tokyo, Japan).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors demonstrate that stress conditions increase clinical signs of EAE in a transfer model, including increased migration of CD4 T cells to ventricle areas of the brain. Stressed mice further developed severe GI conditions, specifically within the stomach and duodenum, with the suggestion a dysregulation of secretion or reflux of bile acid (or other acids) within the stomach. Mice also succumbed to myocardial infarction, potentially due to increases in potassium levels within circulation that followed the severe cellular destruction within the stomach and intestine. The authors go on to describe a chemokine/receptor circuit involved in the increased recruitment of immune cells to the brain and the nerve cells that transmit the signals that potentiate the stomach/intestinal damage.</p><p>Overall, this is a very nice study of crosstalk between the immune system and nervous system that leads to major alterations in physiology and health. However, there are several concerns as detailed below that reduce enthusiasm for the manuscript, and addressing them would be essential.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be useful to show that non-CNS-autoantigen-specific CD4 T cells do not mediate these effects.</p><p>2) More supporting evidence would be useful for implicating the HPA axis, which is currently done on the basis of higher blood aldosterone levels in stressed versus unstressed mice.</p><p>3) It is not clear that the combination of chronic stress and autoimmune CD4 T cells causes 'atypical EAE', since no data regarding the EAE itself are provided. In fact, the manuscript does not provide any information on whether the L5-specific point of initial autoimmune inflammation they have identified earlier is ALSO operative in chronically stressed recipients leading to an unaltered clinical course of neurological defects, or whether that entry point is no longer used, leading a far more radical restructuring of the clinical syndrome. Further, the finding that lansoprazol treatment completely eliminates clinical signs may be an indication that EAE itself may not be prominent in this complex situation of stress and autoimmunity.</p><p>4) While the CNS studies are very thorough, there is little information describing their functional linkage to the stomach epithelial destruction, and about how stress 'primes' the stomach for receiving the nerve signals that initiate the epithelial damage.</p><p>5) The manuscript provides no explanation of the relevant molecular pathway distinctions between acute stress versus chronic stress that lead to the latter, but not the former, causing the disease phenotype addressed.</p><p>6) The manuscript provides no insights into the relevant distinctions that make CX3CL1 the primary neuro-immune gateway chemokine at L5 in earlier work from the authors, and CCL5 the gateway chemokine in the present data.</p><p>7) The manuscript does not address whether the IFNgamma and IL-17 cytokines, relevant for the pathway shown, are necessarily made by the pathogenic autoreactive CD4 T cells.</p><p>8) The manuscript does not show whether the role of local CCL5 is merely as a gateway for inflammation, in which case the pathological consequences of local injection either T cells or cytokines would be expected to be CCL5-independent.</p><p>9) The manuscript does not address the cellular provenance of ATP sensing (is the ATP receptor needed on immune lineage cells and/or on neural lineage cells, for example?), and more broadly, it does not provide any positioning of ATP sensing in the pathogenic pathway it identifies (is it upstream or downstream of CCL5, IFNγ/IL17, neuronal activation…).</p><p>10) In fact, it would be very useful to have a cartoon-model of the pathway to provide an overview of the connections being made.</p><p>11) As a textual point, the manuscript perhaps makes too many MS-specific claims; EAE may not be a sufficiently robust MS model for that. The data are remarkable enough independent of what they may say about MS.</p><p>12) It would be very useful to have the 'data not shown' to be shown at least in supplementary figures.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Brain micro-inflammation at specific vessels dysregulates organ-homeostasis via the activation of a new neural circuit&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, at least by appropriate textual modifications, before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The manuscript by Murakami and his group has been substantiated by much additional data, accumulated in an attempt to address many of the key issues raised by the referees.</p><p>Yet, some of the added data provide correlative information, rather than mechanistic insight. In addition, the manuscript contains several inaccuracies.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>The authors speak about pathogenic T cells throughout the manuscript, without even relating to CD8 cells that are very much associated with EAE. Moreover, based on current models, IFN-γ does not have a major role in the pathology.</p><p>The authors also describe resident monocytes in the brain. There are no resident monocytes in the brain, under any circumstances. The only resident myeloid cells in the brain are microglia, even under pathology; in EAE, the infiltrating monocytes should be termed monocyte-derived macrophages, and unlike the resident microglia, they do not express CX3CR1+.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The authors were requested to add a control consisting of autoimmune cells with non-CNS specificity – Ova specific T cells are not an appropriate control; the question is whether autoimmune T cells directed against self-antigens in areas outside the brain will affect the gut.</p><p>2) The authors were asked to add results relating to the HAPaxis; the additional measurements of cortisol do not help. Such experiments provide a correlation but not causal results. Blocking of the corticosteroid receptor or its function could add to our understanding of the mechanism.</p><p>3) No mechanistic explanation is provided for the changes in the autoimmune T cell gateway from L5 to the brain.</p><p>4) No explanation is given for the linkage between the T cells and activation of p38.</p><p>5) The role of Cx3CL1 expression by monocytes is puzzling; the receptor is normally expressed by patrolling monocytes or within the CNS by microglia.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25517.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) It would be useful to show that non-CNS-autoantigen-specific CD4 T cells do not mediate these effects.</italic> </p><p>We have added data of clinical scores and mortality for ovalbumin (OVA)-specific</p><p>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transfer to sleep disorder (SD) mice and water-bedding stress (WB) mice.

We have added more details to support our claim. Chronic stress caused pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and MHC class II-positive cells to accumulate at specific vessels of the boundary region of the third ventricle region, thalamus, and dentate gyrus, but not at the L5 cord vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). Furthermore, EAE mice under stress had no paralyzed tail, uneven gait, or paralyzed rear leg, which are all normally observed in EAE mice without stress. These data are consistent with the L5 cord vessels not acting as a gateway for immune cells under chronic stress conditions. We describe these observations in the first paragraph of the subsection “Brain micro-inflammation at specific vessels is developed in a manner dependent on chemokines and inflammatory cytokines after pathogenic T cell transfer under stress condition”.</p><p><italic>Further, the finding that lansoprazol treatment completely eliminates clinical signs may be an indication that EAE itself may not be prominent in this complex situation of stress and autoimmunity.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. Based on our findings, we hypothesized that EAE induction itself is induced even after lansoprazol treatment under stress. We found that pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and MHC class II-positive cells accumulated comparably at the brain specific vessels independent of lansoprazol treatment in mice with pathogenic T cell transfer under stress condition. These data suggested that chronic stress changes the position of the gateway for immune cells from L5 cord vessels to brain specific vessels, while pathogenic T cells are activated even after lansoprasol treatment. In addition, we showed that lansoprazol treatment did not affect the accumulation of immune cells in L5 and EAE symptoms in mice without stress. All these data suggested that lansoprazol treatment does not affect the EAE induction and that the stress-gateway reflex alters the gateway of pathogenic T cells. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-D</xref> and described in the first paragraph of the subsection “Brain micro-inflammation at specific vessels is developed in a manner dependent on chemokines and inflammatory cytokines after pathogenic T cell transfer under stress condition”.</p><p><italic>4) While the CNS studies are very thorough, there is little information describing their functional linkage to the stomach epithelial destruction, and about how stress 'primes' the stomach for receiving the nerve signals that initiate the epithelial damage.</italic> </p><p>It has been reported that under very strong stress, the activation of p38 and MAPKAPK2 contributes to stomach epithelial destruction under muscarinic M3 receptor signaling via acetylcholine derived from vagus nerve (Debas &amp; Carvajal, 1994; Jia et al., 2007; Uwada et al., 2017). These reports further showed that p38 inhibitors could suppress the stomach epithelial destruction under very strong stress. We investigated the activation status of p38 and MAPKAPK2 in stomach isolated from mice with pathogenic T cell transfer under our stress condition and detected phosphorylated p38 and phosphorylated MAPKAPK2 in the gastric mucosa. These results suggested tissue damage in the stomach and the upper level of the intestine due to p38 and MAPKAPK2 activation in mucosal tissues. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and described in the first paragraph of the subsection “Gastrointestinal failure is induced by pathogenic T cell transfer under stress”.</p><p><italic>5) The manuscript provides no explanation of the relevant molecular pathway distinctions between acute stress versus chronic stress that lead to the latter, but not the former, causing the disease phenotype addressed.</italic> </p><p>We have shown that increased CCL5 expression at the specific vessels is induced by a neural pathway that involves the PVN, the stress nucleus. Therefore, we compared CCL5 expression at the specific vessels between mice with acute or chronic stress, finding much more CCL5 expression in the latter, which is consistent with another report (Ramot et al., 2017). Based on these data, we suggest that acute stress is insufficient to induce the nerve activation in PVN that elicits CCL5 expression at the specific vessels. We show these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and describe them in the second paragraph of the subsection “Brain micro-inflammation at specific vessels is developed in a manner dependent on chemokines and inflammatory cytokines after pathogenic T cell transfer under stress condition” and in the last paragraph of the subsection “The PVN-meditated sympathetic pathway is involved in the development of brain micro-inflammation at specific vessels under stress condition”.</p><p><italic>6) The manuscript provides no insights into the relevant distinctions that make CX3CL1 the primary neuro-immune gateway chemokine at L5 in earlier work from the authors, and CCL5 the gateway chemokine in the present data.</italic> </p><p>As the reviewer suggested, we previously identified CX3CL1 as a key chemokine for the accumulation of activated monocytes at L5 ventral vessels and EAE relapse after pain induction (Arima et al., 2015). In this context, CX3CL1 is produced from the monocytes themselves in response to noradrenaline such that they accumulate at the L5 ventral vessels. A major distinction between the previous and the current study is that in the previous study the activated monocytes were already presented in the CNS as CNS-resident activated monocytes that had high CX3CR1 expression and infiltrated the CNS during the initial phase of EAE. The pain-mediated neural pathway then induced the accumulation of these CNS-resident activated monocytes at the L5 ventral vessels, which is where norepinephrine was produced via the pain-specific sympathetic pathway, followed by EAE relapse and the accumulation of other immune cells including pathogenic T cells from the blood stream. However, in the current study there are no CNS-resident activated monocytes in mice under stress. Therefore, CX3CL1, which is a critical chemokine for CNS-resident monocytes, is not critical for the stress-gateway reflex in this study. On the other hand, during the stress-gateway reflex, we recognized CCL5 is required for the recruitment of pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, including Th1 and Th17 cells, to CNS-specific vessels from the periphery to trigger micro-inflammation and stimulate the subsequent recruitment of MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells. (These MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells are possibly similar or the same cell types as the activated monocytes, although activated monocytes from the periphery initially express low CX3CR1 in the CNS). We assume that the recruitment of MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells may be at least partially dependent on CX3CL1, which itself is induced by cytokines from pathogenic T cells that accumulated at the specific vessels in response to CCL5.</p><p>We describe these findings in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>7) The manuscript does not address whether the IFNgamma and IL-17 cytokines, relevant for the pathway shown, are necessarily made by the pathogenic autoreactive CD4 T cells.</italic> </p><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we performed additional experiments using IL-17A- or IFN-γ -deficient mice. We prepared pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from these mice and transferred them into mice with stress. We showed that the accumulation of IL-17A- or IFN-γ -deficient pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was significantly reduced at the specific blood vessels under stress conditions and resulted in less mortality. These data suggested that both IFNγ and IL-17A are necessary for the accumulation at specific vessels and the severe phenotypes. We show these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> and describe them in the last paragraph of the subsection “Brain micro-inflammation at specific vessels is developed in a manner dependent on chemokines and inflammatory cytokines after pathogenic T cell transfer under stress condition”.</p><p><italic>8) The manuscript does not show whether the role of local CCL5 is merely as a gateway for inflammation, in which case the pathological consequences of local injection either T cells or cytokines would be expected to be CCL5-independent.</italic> </p><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we investigated the mortality of mice with microinjections of cytokines at the specific vessels under stress condition in the presence or absence of anti-CCL5 antibody treatment and found anti-CCL5 antibody treatment had no significant effect. This result suggested that CCL5 mainly contributes to the accumulation of immune cells at the specific vessels, while the effect of cytokine injection is CCL5-independent. We show these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> and describe them in the last paragraph of the subsection “Brain micro-inflammation at specific vessels is sufficient to induce fatal gastrointestinal failure under stress condition”.</p><p><italic>9) The manuscript does not address the cellular provenance of ATP sensing (is the ATP receptor needed on immune lineage cells and/or on neural lineage cells, for example?), and more broadly, it does not provide any positioning of ATP sensing in the pathogenic pathway it identifies (is it upstream or downstream of CCL5, IFNγ/IL17, neuronal activation…).</italic> </p><p>In the previous draft, we showed that directly microinjected ATP at the specific vessels resulted in gastrointestinal disease and subsequent high mortality under stress condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) and the blockade of ATP signaling suppressed severe phenotypes in mice with cytokine microinjection under stress condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and 6C</xref>), suggesting that ATP is downstream of cytokine stimulation and acts as a neural stimulator. In the revised manuscript, we have added immunohistochemical staining results. Neurons (Neurofilament L-positive cells) around the specific vessels expressed an ATP receptor, P2RX7, and after cytokine or ATP stimulation neurons in the DMH region also showed NFATc1 activation, which is a downstream signaling component of P2RX7 (Grol, Pereverzev, Sims, &amp; Dixon, 2013). Thus, we suggested that ATP can be sensed by neurons that connect specific vessels to the DMH region in a manner dependent on P2RX7 expression. In combination with our responses to Comments #7 and #8, we propose the following pathogenic pathway: CCL5, which is expressed from endothelial cells at the specific vessels, followed by the accumulation of pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells → IFNγ/IL17, which is expressed from pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, followed by enhanced activation of endothelial cells at the specific vessels → ATP, which is expressed from the activated endothelial cells at the specific vessels → the activation of neurons in the DMH region, which are distributed around the specific vessels. We show these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and describe them in the subsection “ATP induced at the sites of brain micro-inflammation activates the PVN/DMH and severe gastrointestinal failure”.</p><p><italic>10) In fact, it would be very useful to have a cartoon-model of the pathway to provide an overview of the connections being made.</italic></p><p>We added a cartoon-model of the pathway in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and described them in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>11) As a textual point, the manuscript perhaps makes too many MS-specific claims; EAE may not be a sufficiently robust MS model for that. The data are remarkable enough independent of what they may say about MS.</italic> </p><p>According to the reviewer’s comment, we added the possible involvement of this pathway in other diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, dementia and psychological disorders in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>12) It would be very useful to have the 'data not shown' to be shown at least in supplementary figures.</italic> </p><p>According to the reviewer’s comment, data not shown are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>General comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors speak about pathogenic T cells throughout the manuscript, without even relating to CD8 cells that are very much associated with EAE.</italic> </p><p>We sorted CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from mice EAE induced with a MOG peptide plus CFA (active EAE model) and stimulated the cells with a MOG peptide in the presence of MHC class II+ antigen presenting cells and cytokines in vitro followed by intravenously injecting them into wild type C57BL/6 mice (the transfer EAE model). Therefore, there are no CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the pathogenic T cell population. Accordingly, we have changed the term “pathogenic T cells” to “pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells” for clarity (Introduction, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>Moreover, based on current models, IFN-γ does not have a major role in the pathology.</italic> </p><p>There are many papers that describe the involvement of IFNγ particularly from pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells including Th1 and activated Th17 cells for the development of EAE <sup>1-5</sup>. These papers are cited in the text (Introduction, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>The authors also describe resident monocytes in the brain. There are no resident monocytes in the brain, under any circumstances. The only resident myeloid cells in the brain are microglia, even under pathology; in EAE, the infiltrating monocytes should be termed monocyte-derived macrophages, and unlike the resident microglia, they do not express CX3CR1+.</italic> </p><p>As explained in the answer to General comment #1, we have been using transfer EAE, which shows transient clinical symptoms, as our model. We called EAE mice that stopped showing clinical symptoms EAE-recovered mice. There is no relapse in EAE-recovered mice under normal condition. On the other hand, over 90% of MS patients experience relapse, and there are reports showing that the occurrence of pain is associated with neurologic symptoms and disease severity in patients with MS <sup>6-8</sup>. We therefore hypothesized that pain sensation might induce MS relapse via a reflex pathway. Indeed, pain sensation induced EAE relapse in EAE-recovered mice. Mechanistic analysis showed that the CNS conditions between wild type and EAE-recovered mice are completely different even though both groups show no clinical symptoms. In the EAE-recovered mice, many MHC class IIhiCX3CR1+CD11b+ cells are found in the CNS. These cells are not activated microglial cells but activated monocytes coming from the periphery. The identification of the periphery as the source of MHC class IIhiCX3CR1+CD11b+ cells was done by two methods: parabiosis and labeling microglial cells with CX3CR1-Tdtomato. Importantly, these activated monocytes in the CNS of EAE-recovered mice stayed for a long time (over 150 days) after pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transfer and are critical for the development of pain-mediated EAE relapse. We published these data in <italic>eLife</italic> in 2015. On the other hand, many papers have reported resident T cells stay in non-immune tissues for a very long time (over 150 days in some cases) after the initial immune response in the tissues and affect subsequent immune responses <sup>9,10</sup>. The characteristics of these resident T cells and our activated monocytes in the CNS of the EAE-recovered mice are quite similar: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) infiltrate the initially affected non-immune tissues, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) infiltrate a long time, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) influence subsequent immune responses. Therefore, we describe the activated monocytes in the CNS of EAE-recovered mice as resident monocytes (Discussion, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>Specific comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors were requested to add a control consisting of autoimmune cells with non-CNS specificity – Ova specific T cells are not an appropriate control; the question is whether autoimmune T cells directed against self-antigens in areas outside the brain will affect the gut.</italic> </p><p>We employed another transfer method, experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), which is a model of uveitis. Wild type C57BL/6 mice were immunized with a retina antigen peptide, IRBP (1-20), with CFA followed by the induction of active type of EAU. We purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from mice with EAU symptoms followed by culturing with IRBP (1-20) in the presence of MHC class II+ antigen-presenting cells plus cytokines. The resulting retina-specific activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were intravenously injected into wild type C57BL/6 mice with stress to investigate whether gastrointestinal diseases developed. Although retina-specific activating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells accumulated in the eyes, no gastrointestinal diseases occurred. We show these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and describe them in the subsection “Stress conditions cause a severe phenotype of EAE”.</p><p><italic>2) The authors were asked to add results relating to the HAPaxis; the additional measurements of cortisol do not help. Such experiments provide a correlation but not causal results. Blocking of the corticosteroid receptor or its function could add to our understanding of the mechanism.</italic> </p><p>We performed the experiments the reviewer suggested. We employed two antagonists of the corticosteroid receptor such as mifepristone and guggulsterone and treated them in mice after microinjection of cytokines at the specific vessels under stress. We found that cytokine-mediated gastrointestinal diseases were not suppressed by the antagonist treatments. These results suggested that the HPA axis has a minimum role in the development of micro inflammation-mediated gastrointestinal diseases under stress. We show these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and describe them in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) No mechanistic explanation is provided for the changes in the autoimmune T cell gateway from L5 to the brain.</italic> </p><p>We previously showed that the L5-gateway is established by specific neural activation via gravity-mediated soleus stimulation <sup>11</sup>. Because we found that mice with stress show reduced movement and often lie down, we hypothesize they have reduced stimulation of the soleus muscles, which are the main anti-gravity muscles. The sensory neurons from soleus muscles connect to L5 dorsal root ganglions (DRG), which are activated by anti-gravity responses of the soleus muscles in wild type mice. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that mice with stress reduce L5 DRG activation and chemokine expression from L5 dorsal vessels (L5 gateway). We show these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and describe them in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>4) No explanation is given for the linkage between the T cells and activation of p38.</italic> </p><p>It is known that pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells for the transfer EAE express cytokines including IFN-γ, IL-17A, and IL-6 <sup>12</sup>, and very strong stress alone induces gastric disease via p38 activation at the affected tissues by the activation of the vagal pathway <sup>13-15</sup>. We showed that the injection of IFN-γ, IL-17A, and IL-6 or ATP at specific vessels in the brain of mice with relatively low stress establishes a neural pathway via DMH and DMX (nucleus of vagal nerves) followed by the development of fatal gastrointestinal diseases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5G</xref>) and the activation of p38 in stomach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, cytokine stimulation in endothelial cells causes the expression of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These results strongly suggested that cytokines from pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells act on endothelial cells at the specific vessels and induce ATP around the specific vessels. The resulting ATP activates the DMH-vagal axis, which is important for the development of gastrointestinal diseases as well as the activation of p38. Therefore, cytokines from the pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are a triggering factor to activate p38 in the affected tissue via DMH-vagal axis activation in mice with relatively low stress. We describe these findings in the seventh paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>5) The role of Cx3CL1 expression by monocytes is puzzling; the receptor is normally expressed by patrolling monocytes or within the CNS by microglia.</italic> </p><p>As described in our answer to General comment #3, resident monocytes with CX3CR1 in EAE-recovered mice accumulate from the periphery to stay in the CNS for a long time and contribute to the development of pain-mediated EAE-relapse. Therefore, it is possible that the origin of the resident monocytes could be patrolling monocytes, as suggested by the reviewer. We previously showed that resident monocytes with CX3CR1 express CX3CL1 after stimulation with norepinephrine, which is produced around the ventral vessels of the spinal cord following activation of the pain-specific neural pathway <sup>16</sup>. These results suggested a CX3CR1-CX3CL1 autocrine loop in the resident monocytes that is regulated by norepinephrine. We add these explanations in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Goverman, J. Autoimmune T cell responses in the central nervous system.</p><p>Nature reviews.
