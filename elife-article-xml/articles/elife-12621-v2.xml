homeostasis and the response to ER stress. Reversible inactivating covalent modification of BiP is believed to contribute to the balance between chaperones and unfolded ER proteins, but the nature of this modification has so far been hinted at indirectly. We report that deletion of <italic>FICD</italic>, a gene encoding an ER-localized AMPylating enzyme, abolished detectable modification of endogenous BiP enhancing ER buffering of unfolded protein stress in mammalian cells, whilst deregulated FICD activity had the opposite effect. In vitro, FICD AMPylated BiP to completion on a single residue, Thr<sup>518</sup>. AMPylation increased, in a strictly <italic>FICD</italic>-dependent manner, as the flux of proteins entering the ER was attenuated in vivo. In vitro, Thr<sup>518</sup> AMPylation enhanced peptide dissociation from BiP 6-fold and abolished stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by J-domain cofactor. These findings expose the molecular basis for covalent inactivation of BiP.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12621.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12621.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12621.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Newly made proteins are unstructured chains of amino acids that must fold into particular shapes to work effectively. Proteins that are destined to be exported from the cell undergo folding in a compartment of the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum. This folding is assisted by chaperones (which are themselves also proteins).</p><p>Cells adjust the number of chaperones so that there are enough to cope with the burden of unfolded proteins. However, in the endoplasmic reticulum, the known mechanisms that regulate the production of chaperones are too slow to track the rapid fluctuations in the production of unfolded proteins. This suggests that other means exist to balance active chaperones and unfolded proteins that go beyond merely controlling chaperone or unfolded protein abundance.</p><p>An important chaperone protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, called BiP, is chemically modified when the production of unfolded proteins declines, and loses the modification when more unfolded proteins are produced. This suggests that the modification might adjust BiP’s activity so that it can handle the unfolded proteins that are present. However, previous studies have failed to agree about the nature of the chemical modification and how it affects how BiP works.</p><p>Preissler, Rato et al. compared the activity of BiP in normal mammalian cells and in cells engineered to lack an enzyme called FICD. This enzyme attaches a molecule of adenosine mono-phosphate (AMP) to proteins in a process known as AMPylation. The experiments revealed that AMPylation is the modification of BiP that tracks how many unfolded proteins are in the cell. Further studies showed that AMP attaches to a single amino acid of BiP, number 518, a threonine. Reconstructing the AMPylation of threonine 518 in a test tube caused the modified BiP to lose its ability to engage with unfolded proteins.</p><p>Overall, Preissler, Rato et al.’s results indicate that cells inactivate BiP by AMPylating threonine 518 as the number of unfolded proteins decreases, and remove the modification to re-activate BiP in response to mounting levels of unfolded proteins. Further studies are now needed to determine how AMPylation inactivates BiP and to understand how the FICD enzyme is regulated so that it performs AMPylation at the right time. It also remains to be explored how important the regulation of BiP activity by AMPylation is for living cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12621.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12621.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>BiP/GRP78</kwd><kwd>AMPylation</kwd><kwd>FICD/HYPE</kwd><kwd>Hsp70</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome 084812/Z/08/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EU FP7 Beta-Bat No: 277713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fearnley</surname><given-names>Ian M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Attaching a molecule of adenosine mono-phosphate (AMP) to the BiP protein at threonine 518 regulates its chaperone activity in the endoplasmic reticulum.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein folding homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is defended by signal transduction pathways that match the complement of chaperones and enzymes to the burden of unfolded protein within the compartment. Transcriptional activation of genes that enhance the capacity of the ER to process its clients and regulated translation initiation, which controls the flux of unfolded proteins into the ER, comprise the unfolded protein response (UPR) vital to the well-being of cells, tissues and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Acting alongside this coherent UPR are rapid, activity-dependent post-translational changes in the disposition of the major ER chaperone BiP. Given the dominant role of BiP in protein folding homeostasis in the ER, the latter stands to have considerable biological significance.</p><p>The UPR regulates the abundance of BiP transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kozutsumi et al., 1988</xref>), but this is a latent homeostatic process manifesting over hours and days. On a much shorter time scale BiP’s oligomeric state is observed to change, with fewer oligomers present as levels of unfolded protein increase. The architecture of BiP oligomers is consistent with their role as a rapidly accessible repository of inactive BiP that the cell may draw upon in short notice to cope with rapid fluctuations in unfolded protein load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>). BiP is also subject to activity-dependent post-translational modification(s). This is reflected in transfer of metabolic label from intracellular pools of tritiated adenosine and <sup>32</sup>P phosphate onto BiP, covalently modifying the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlsson and Lazarides, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hendershot et al., 1988</xref>) and imparting upon it a lower isoelectric point (pI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlsson and Lazarides, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laitusis et al., 1999</xref>). These covalent transformation(s) of BiP correlate inversely with the burden of unfolded proteins in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laitusis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leno and Ledford, 1989</xref>) and because the modified form of BiP was under-represented in complex with substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hendershot et al., 1988</xref>), were deemed to reflect inactivating modification(s) of the chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Despite considerable effort, the chemical nature of the modification(s) was never directly ascertained. ADP-ribosylation seemed a good candidate as it fits the labeling profile (comprised of adenosine and phosphate), the acidic nature of the modification and its susceptibility to the effect of the ADP-ribosylation inhibitor novobiocin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laitusis et al., 1999</xref>). Early work even suggested the presence of an enzymatic activity in cell lysates that could transfer a label from <sup>32</sup>P NAD<sup>+</sup> onto BiP in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlsson and Lazarides, 1983</xref>); but molecular characterization of this enzymatic activity proved elusive. A consensus emerged in regards to the region of BiP that bears the modification, as both <sup>32</sup>P orthophosphate and <sup>3</sup>H adenosine labeling mapped consistently to a cyanogen bromide (CnBr) cleavage fragment in the C-terminal substrate binding domain of BiP (Thr<sup>434</sup> to Met<sup>541</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaut, 1997</xref>). Mutations in two arginine residues on that fragment (Arg<sup>470</sup> and Arg<sup>492</sup>) markedly attenuated radiolabeling in vivo of FLAG-tagged BiP expressed in cells, suggesting that they might be the modification sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>), but peptides with a mass consistent with ADP-ribosylated BiP were never uncovered and the assignments thus remained tentative.</p><p>Recently it has been reported that BiP is subject to a different modification, AMPylation, which results in the formation of an phosphodiester bond between the alpha phosphate of ATP and a hydroxyl amino acid side chain (with release of pyrophosphate). This modification of BiP is effected by a broadly conserved, ER-localized enzyme, FICD (also known as HYPE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanyal et al., 2015</xref>). There is lack of unanimity in regards to the circumstances and consequences of BiP AMPylation: the Orth lab provides evidence that AMPylation is an inactivation modification, induced when client protein burden is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ham et al., 2014</xref>), whereas the Mattoo lab suggests that it is an activating modification induced by ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanyal et al., 2015</xref>). AMPylation can explain both the metabolic labeling profile of BiP (from adenosine and phosphate pools) as well as the acidity of the modified form and possibly even the sensitivity to novobiocin (an ATP mimetic). However, the assignment of AMPylation to Ser<sup>365</sup> or Thr<sup>366</sup> in the nucleotide binding domain of BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanyal et al., 2015</xref>) is at odds with the cyanogen bromide cleavage pattern of metabolically labeled BiP, suggesting a complex scenario of multiple modifications with alternative outcomes.</p><p>Here we report on a functional and quantitative analysis of BiP modification by FICD in vitro and in vivo. Our findings fit best a parsimonious model whereby AMPylation of BiP on a single residue, Thr<sup>518</sup>, is the only quantitatively significant modification of the chaperone and provide clues to its functional significance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FICD is necessary and sufficient for conversion of endogenous BiP to an acidic modified form with altered mobility on native-PAGE</title><p>Changes in the disposition of BiP induced by manipulation of conditions in the ER are conveniently tracked by native gel electrophoresis (native-PAGE) and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freiden et al., 1992</xref>) coupled with site-directed proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Inhibition of protein synthesis led to accumulation of a prominent high mobility species tentatively named ‘B’ form, whereas depletion of ER calcium progressively drew on this pool to promote the assembly of BiP oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The ‘B’ form of BiP was also noted for its relative resistance to cleavage in vitro by a bacterial protease, SubA, which cuts BiP within a highly conserved linker sequence connecting the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and substrate binding domain (SBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paton et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>). Resistance to cleavage by SubA is also a feature of the acidic, modified form of BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that the ‘B’ form observed on native-PAGE might be related to the covalently modified form of BiP (previously believed to be the ADP-ribosylated form).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12621.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Native gel electrophoresis tracks activity state-dependent changes in BiP’s quaternary structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of BiP’s domain organization in the ATP- and ADP-bound states. BiP consists of an N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD, pink) and a C-terminal substrate binding domain (SBD, blue) connected by a hydrophobic interdomain linker peptide (green). The SBD is composed of a two-layered β-sandwich subdomain (SBDβ) containing the substrate binding crevice and a helical lid structure (SBDα). In the ATP-bound conformation the NBD and SBD form extensive contacts, which involves the linker region, and the SBD is in the open conformation (SBDα extended) allowing for interactions with substrates (dark blue) at high association and dissociation rates. Upon ATP hydrolysis to ADP the inter-subunit contacts are lost leading to exposure of the linker, packing of SBDα against SBDβ, and strong reduction of substrate interaction kinetics. Cleavage of BiP by the linker-specific protease SubA (scissors) is favored in the ADP-bound state. (<bold>B</bold>) Immunoblot of endogenous BiP resolved by native gel electrophoresis.

The major species visible on the native gel are numbered by order of descending mobility (I-III) and the monomeric ‘B’ form induced by CHX treatment and the ‘A’ form detectable in untreated cells are marked.

The high mobility of the FICD-dependent ‘B’ form and its indifference to the effects of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lower panel) (which promotes dissociation of BiP from its client proteins in vitro) are consistent with a role for the FICD-mediated modification in BiP inactivation.

Like the endogenous ‘B’ form, found in cells, the ‘B’ form constituted in vitro was also partially resistant to cleavage by SubA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Emergence of the ‘B’ form in vitro correlated with the acquisition of a faster migrating acidic form of BiP on IEF-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). FICD converted all the detectable BiP to a single acidic form in a time-dependent manner, which, like the endogenous acidic from of BiP, was also relatively resistant to cleavage by SubA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lane 8).

Qualitatively similar observations were made in two separate clones of FICD<sup>E234G</sup>-expressing cells [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>; the conspicuous basal (Dox-independent) SubA resistance of endogenous BiP, lanes 5 and 7, likely reflecting basal leakiness of the expression system]. These findings are readily explained by the engagement of a feedback mechanism (the UPR) that defends a level of active BiP and compensates for the accumulation of inert, AMPylated BiP (‘B’ form). As suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanyal et al., 2015</xref>), the capacity of the cells to compensate for the consequences of deregulated FICD activity is limited; reflected here by the adverse effect of sustained FICD<sup>E234G</sup> expression on cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>).</p><p>The aforementioned observations support the inactivating nature of FICD-mediated BiP modification and suggest that in some circumstances cells deficient in FICD may have elevated levels of active BiP. Given the strong repressive role of BiP on the UPR, enhanced availability of active chaperone attendant upon the absence of FICD and the consequential enhanced capacity to buffer unfolded protein stress might attenuate UPR signaling. Strong feedback control operative in the UPR specifies that such attenuation, were it to occur, would be transient and so more likely to be detected by monitoring early events in the UPR, such as PERK and IRE1α autophosphorylation, than later events, such as reporter gene activity. Furthermore, “over-chaperoning” attendant upon the absence of FICD would likely be revealed by manipulating the flux of proteins into the ER of a secretory cell. These theoretical considerations led us to AR42j pancreatic acinar cells - a secretory cell type in which PERK and IRE1α autophosphorylation are easy to detect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>As expected, <italic>FICD</italic> inactivation by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing in AR42j cells eliminated both the acidic form of BiP from IEF-PAGE and the ‘B’ form from native-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Wildtype and <italic>FICD</italic>-lacking AR42j cells were exposed to cycloheximide to build up pools of modified BiP (in the wildtype cells) and then to the ER stress-inducing agent DTT, whose ability to activate the UPR does not require ongoing protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>FICD</italic> knockout led to a conspicuous temporal delay in PERK and IRE1α autophosphorylation, observed in two independently derived AR42j <italic>FICD<sup>-/-</sup></italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>).

Attempts to pinpoint these hypothesized modifications directly were unsuccessful. The discovery of FICD-mediated BiP AMPylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanyal et al., 2015</xref>) was thus an important breakthrough whose significance is enhanced further by our finding that elimination of FICD abolishes all evidence for endogenous BiP modification in vivo as detected by IEF- and native-PAGE, and changes in mass of the endogenous protein. These findings unify and clarify the pre-existing observations regarding BiP modification and indicate that FICD-mediated AMPylation on Thr<sup>518</sup> is the major, if not the only covalent change in this chaperone detectable by the existing methods. Furthermore, FICD-mediated AMPylation on Thr<sup>518</sup> is sufficient to account for the previously observed key features of modified BiP, namely its acidity and inertness.</p><p>Our findings are consonant with metabolic labeling experiments that mapped the modification to the C-terminal substrate binding domain of BiP and provide positive evidence for absence of significant FICD-mediated modification of Ser<sup>365</sup> or Thr<sup>366</sup>, neither in vitro nor in vivo. Provided ATP as a co-substrate, FICD modifies BiP in vitro at a single site with a mass expected of AMPylation. AMPylation maps solely to peptides encompassing Thr<sup>518</sup> and these are modified to high stoichiometry in vitro. Furthermore, an unbiased chemical proteomic approach to profiling proteins that are modified by FICD in a cell lysate in vitro led to the identification of BiP Thr<sup>518</sup> as an AMPylation site, whereas no modification at Ser<sup>365</sup> or Thr<sup>366</sup> was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broncel et al., 2015</xref>). It is thus tempting to speculate that AMPylation on Thr<sup>518</sup> is the only quantitatively significant modification of BiP carried out by FICD in vivo too. However, the discovery that an FIC-domain containing bacterial enzyme AMPylates eukaryotic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kinch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yarbrough et al., 2009</xref>) was closely followed by the realization that the domain may also participate in transfer of part of other pyrophosphate-containing metabolites, leading to UMPylation, mono-phosphorylation and conjugation of phosphocholine (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia-Pino et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, one must keep an open mind in regards to the possibility of parallel FICD-mediated modification of BiP (and possibly other ER proteins) by metabolites (other than ATP) found in the ER.</p><p>The phenotype of <italic>FICD</italic> deletion in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is restricted to a defect in light sensing and involves disruption of neurotransmitter (histamine) re-uptake via glial cells. The subcellular loci of <italic>Drosophila</italic> FICD action are unclear: Consistent with an ER-based function, the protein co-fractionates with BiP. However, HRP-tagged endogenous FICD led to prominent staining of capitate projections, a glial cell plasma membrane component of photoreceptor synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rahman et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that FICD may have substrates other than BiP that figure prominently in its action in specific cell types.</p><p>Thr<sup>518</sup> of hamster BiP is highly conserved in other eukaryotes. The crystal structure of the isolated substrate binding domain of human BiP (PDB 5E86) and yeast Kar2/BiP (PDB 3H0X) (locked in the ADP-like state), shows the corresponding residues – human Thr<sup>518</sup> and Kar2 Thr<sup>538</sup> – to be located on a loop connecting beta strands 7 and 8 (L<sub>7,8</sub>), with its side-chain stabilized by a network of polar contacts with the conserved side chain of Asp<sup>515</sup>/Asp<sup>535</sup> and the backbone amine of Asn<sup>520</sup>/Lys<sup>540</sup>. However, both interactions are disrupted in the substrate binding domain of human BiP in the ATP state (PDB 5E84). Exposure of the Thr<sup>518</sup> side chain to the solvent is likely enhanced further by the loss of four other polar interactions that stabilize L<sub>7,8</sub> in the ADP state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, mobilization of the side chain by allosteric signals attendant upon ATP binding is suggested to enhance exposure of Thr<sup>518</sup> to solvent explaining the selective FICD-mediated modification of ATP-bound BiP and the absence of modification of mutant variants of BiP that are defective in domain coupling (BiP<sup>ADDA</sup>, BiP<sup>G226D</sup> and to a lesser extent BiP<sup>T37G</sup>). These recent observations on human BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) also showcase the long range allostery common to all Hsp70 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mayer, 2013</xref>): the identity of the nucleotide bound in the nucleotide binding domain affects stability of L<sub>7,8</sub> on the opposite side of the protein. It seems plausible that a modification affecting the disposition of this loop could reach the nucleotide binding domain through a reciprocal set of allosteric interactions to explain the effects of AMPylation on nucleotide hydrolysis and responsiveness to J proteins.</p><p>An earlier study from our lab revealed that mutations affecting residues R470 and R492 consistently diminished labeling of overexpressed mutant BiP from <sup>32</sup>P orthophosphate or <sup>3</sup>H adenosine pools in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>), leading us to suggest that these residues undergo ADP-ribosylation in vivo. The current findings indicate that our earlier conclusions were in error and suggest that the important structural role of R470 [in all Hsp70s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandez-Saiz et al., 2006</xref>)] and R492 [specifically in BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2015</xref>)] may have given rise to defective allosteric transitions by the R470 and R492 BiP mutants. Such defects appear to have a more conspicuous effect on modification of overexpressed BiP in vivo than on the modification of pure recombinant BiP by FICD in vitro.</p><p>The structures of nucleotide-bound Hsp70s also provide hints to the functional consequences of BiP AMPylation. Residues comprising beta strand 8 in the substrate binding domain of the ADP-bound form of BiP and DnaK are dramatically delocalized in the ATP-bound form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kityk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) enabling the domain movements that underlie the functional allosteric transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mayer, 2013</xref>). By altering the conformation of the preceding loop, AMPylation of Thr<sup>518</sup> could facilitate the melting of beta strand 8, thus favoring a new state of the chaperone. Our observations suggest that this new state would resemble the ATP-bound state in terms of high substrate “off” rates, but would differ from it in terms of (un)responsiveness to J protein-driven ATP hydrolysis. It is notable in this regard that the ATP-like conformation can be uncoupled from responsiveness to J protein, as a mutation of BiP’s substrate binding domain (G461P/G468P) that locks the protein in an ATP-like conformation is also refractory to J protein-mediated stimulation of ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>These structural considerations fit with the established inverse correlation between activity of BiP (imposed by the burden of client proteins) and the extent of modification: Nutrient deprivation and protein synthesis inhibitors, which lower the flux of unfolded proteins into the ER, increase the acidic form of BiP in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laitusis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ledford and Jacobs, 1986</xref>) and animal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>), whereas imposition of ER stress leads to less modified BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hendershot et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laitusis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leno and Ledford, 1989</xref> and our observations here). All this suggests a simple mechanism whereby substrate-free, ATP-associated BiP partitions between two mutually exclusive fates: entering the substrate binding cycle or AMPylation. The former is driven by the concentration of unfolded client proteins and catalyzed by J proteins, whereas the latter imposes on BiP an inactive conformation that disfavors the J protein-mediated ATP hydrolysis required for high affinity client binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Los Rios and Barducci, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Misselwitz et al., 1998</xref>). High client “off” rates ensure that AMPylated BiP would neither interfere with protein folding by interacting excessively with substrates, nor would it unduly repress the UPR transducers. And futile cycles of ATP hydrolysis would be obviated by refractoriness to stimulation by J protein. However, given the reversibility of the modification, this inert BiP would serve as a repository for active chaperone were it needed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, a model).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12621.028</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Schema depicting the hypothesized relationship between AMPylation and the BiP chaperone cycle.</title><p>FICD-mediated AMPylation on Thr<sup>518</sup> allosterically traps BiP in a low substrate-affinity ATP-like state that is refractory to J protein-mediated stimulation of its ATPase activity.

Like other type II or III FIC domain-containing proteins, FICD is intrinsically repressed by the insertion of a conserved glutamate into the ATP binding pocket, delocalizing the co-substrate ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bunney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Engel et al., 2012</xref>). Relief of such repression, imposed experimentally by the E234G mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Engel et al., 2012</xref>) or by a nanobody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Truttmann et al., 2015</xref>), is likely attained physiologically through allosteric mechanisms. Evidence that FICD binds unfolded proteins directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanyal et al., 2015</xref>) hint at the possibility that such allostery might be responsive to the burden of unfolded proteins in the ER or might be regulated by FICD’s oligomeric state or co-factor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bunney et al., 2014</xref>). Coupling of FICD’s intrinsic activity to protein folding homeostasis in the ER could conserve energy by limiting the futile cycles of AMPylation and de-AMPylation prescribed by regulation based solely on kinetic competition with substrates for BiP in the ATP-bound state. Furthermore, regulation of FICD enzymatic activity would explain the dissociation between transcriptional induction of the <italic>FICD</italic> gene during the UPR and the emergence of modified BiP, which, as shown here, is delayed until after resolution of the stress.</p><p>Recent findings suggest the existence of an alternative inactive state of BiP effected by oligomerization. The architecture of the oligomers, whereby one BiP molecule engages the interdomain linker of another as a conventional substrate peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>), implies that BiP protomers are locked in the ADP-bound state and unlikely to serve as a substrate for AMPylation. This conjecture fits the observation that depletion of ER calcium, which promotes BiP oligomerization at the expense of substrate binding, is associated with gradual depletion of the FICD-dependent modified ‘B’ form of BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The benefits of ensuring an adequate reserve of chaperones to cope with the unfolded protein burden are clearly revealed by the consequences of defects in UPR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). But the emergence of active mechanisms to downregulate BiP activity suggest that an excess of functional BiP might have a cost too. This cost is less obvious than that associated with UPR defects, as FICD inactivation results in no conspicuous growth defect in cultured cells. Nonetheless, our findings indicate that in circumstances of limited client protein load, the absence of FICD shifts the equilibrium in the ER in favor of chaperones over their clients (at least as reflected in attenuated UPR signaling). BiP overexpression works in the same direction and is known to impose a measure of inefficiency in the secretion of certain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dorner et al., 1992</xref>), it will thus be interesting to learn if FICD inactivation also promotes inefficiency in secretion and if so, under what circumstances.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> lists the plasmids used, their lab names, description and notes their first appearance in the figures and their corresponding label, and provides a published reference, where available.</p><p>A combination of PCR-based manipulations, restriction digests and site-directed mutagenesis procedures were used to mobilize the coding sequences and produce in-frame fusions with the affinity tags [GST, hexahistidine (His6) and His6-Smt3 epitopes] or mCherry fluorescent marker, and to create the point mutations indicated in the text.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mammalian cell culture</title><p>All cells were grown in tissue culture dishes or multi-well plates (Corning) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and the following cell line-specific media were used:</p><p>CHO-K1 cells (ATCC CCL-61) were phenotypically validated as proline auxotrophs and their <italic>Cricitulus griseus</italic> origin was confirmed by genomic sequencing.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Reid Gilmore, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript from Preissler et al. investigates AMPylation of BiP. BiP was known to undergo a modification in the ER, which was believed to be ADP-ribosylation based upon incorporation of phosphate and adenosine. Previously, the Ron lab indirectly mapped the sites of ADP-ribosylation to two arginines in the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of BiP. Two recent papers established that the modification is AMPylation, not ADP-ribosylation, and identified an ER localized enzyme (FICD/HYPE) that is likely responsible for the modification. However, contradictory conclusions were reached concerning the location of the AMPylated residue (ATPase domain or SBD) and the impact of AMPylation on BiP activity and UPR signaling. In the current manuscript, Preissler et al. use a combination of in vitro AMPylation experiments and cell culture experiments to convincingly demonstrate the following: (a) FICD modifies a single site in the substrate binding domain of BiP both in vitro and in cells, (b) the primary modification site is T518, (c) AMPylation of BiP reduces BiPs ATPase rate and renders it less-responsive to J domain containing proteins, (d) excessive AMPylation of BiP is toxic to cells due to constitutive activation of the UPR and (e) a block in AMPylation of BiP blunts the early response of cells to ER stress. One weakness of the paper is that the effects of constitutive AMPylation or inhibited AMPylation on UPR signaling are relatively small. It thus remains unclear whether the modification has an important physiological role. The subtle change in the kinetics of UPR activation that was observed in the FIDC null cells is probably not sufficient to warrant the title of the manuscript. This is a solid and interesting paper that should be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after modifications to address the major points listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript should include a serious discussion of the previous data reported by the Ron group and other labs to clarify whether a modification at T518 can account for the previous findings. For example, is the weaker effect of point mutations (R470E and R492E) on in vitro AMPylation in the current manuscript explained by differences in assay conditions? The Ham and Orth groups reported AMPylation in the NBD, yet reached conflicting conclusions on the effect of this modification on ATP hydrolysis by BiP. The authors should comment on how a modification of a threonine residue in a loop linking the SBD and how NBD could affect ATP hydrolysis.</p><p>2) The other two groups reported that FicD/HYPE is up-regulated by ER stress. Have the authors of the current manuscript determined whether HYPE is induced by the UPR? If so, are the kinetics of up-regulation slow enough to suggest that UPR induced HYPE expression is a mechanism to inactivate the excess BiP made during a stress response? If not how does this fit their hypothesis?</p><p>3) A central conclusion of the current manuscript is that modification of a single site (T518) can account for all previous evidence that BiP was modified by adenosine and phosphate. The BiP and AMPylated BiP that were used for electrospray mass spectroscopy eluted as broad, tailing peaks on the LC column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Prominent shoulders (71.3 min and 73.7 min) were present in both the BiP and BiP-AMP samples. Were the tailing sections of the BiP and BiP-AMP peak analyzed by ES-MS, and do they contain BiP with different, or additional modifications?</p><p>4) Why is the FL/BiP ratio high (7.18, 7.48) in cells that have the constitutively active FICD plasmid in the absence of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>)? Are low levels of FICD expressed in the absence of DOX? Faint bands in -Dox lanes also seem to be present in control cells, which do not have a high FL/BiP ratio. The authors should comment on this discrepancy.</p><p>5) The kinetics of peptide dissociation from BiP-AMP looks very biphasic even when the time scale is 0-60 min. The data should also be fit assuming a biphasic dissociation rate. If such a fit is superior, this raises the question of whether the BiP-AMP sample is homogeneous. Could it contain some unmodified BiP? Or could it contain BiP AMPylated at a different site (T525 or T527)? The figure could be improved by having a dashed line showing the fluorescence polarization of free peptide expressed relative to the BiP-peptide and BiP-AMP peptide complexes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> is the best evidence that AMPylation of BiP has an effect on the behavior of the chaperone in vitro, so the data need to be convincing. Please provide error bars.</p><p>6) The authors present evidence that the ATPase activity of BiP-AMP is not stimulated by the J-domain of ERdJ6. Failure of a J domain to stimulate hydrolysis of the modified protein is somewhat surprising, particularly since they have concluded that the ATP bound form of BiP is the substrate for AMPylation, which is also the preferred binding form for DnaJ proteins. Does the J domain still bind ATP BiP-AMP? Or do they suppose the AMPylation stimulate ATP hydrolysis rendering BiP resistant to J domain stimulation?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12621.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The manuscript should include a serious discussion of the previous data reported by the Ron group and other labs to clarify whether a modification at T518 can account for the previous findings.

[…] Such defects appear to have a more conspicuous effect on modification of over-expressed BiPin vivo thanon the modification of pure recombinant BiP by FICD in vitro.”</p><p>The second point in the critique above is now addressed in the preceding paragraph in the Discussion:</p><p>“Thr<sup>518</sup> of hamster BiP is highly conserved in other eukaryotes. […] It seems plausible that a modification affecting the disposition of this loop could reach the NBD through a reciprocal set of allosteric interactions to explain the effects of AMPylation on nucleotide hydrolysis and responsiveness to J proteins.”</p><p><italic>2) The other two groups reported that FicD/HYPE is up-regulated by ER stress. Have the authors of the current manuscript determined whether HYPE is induced by the UPR? If so, are the kinetics of up-regulation slow enough to suggest that UPR induced HYPE expression is a mechanism to inactivate the excess BiP made during a stress response? If not how does this fit their hypothesis?</italic> </p><p>New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> addresses this critique. It shows a progressive increase in the fraction of BiP susceptible to SubA cleavage and a correlated disappearance of the ‘B’ form on native-PAGE observed in wildtype cells following exposure to the reversible ER stress-inducing agent 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) and a correlated re-emergence of ‘B’ form and SubA-resistant BiP during the 2-DG washout; neither of which are evident in the <italic>FICD<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells. Declining levels of modified BiP are observed during mounting stress and are dissociated from the previously-reported increase in <italic>FICD</italic> mRNA (which we too observe, panel D). These findings support tight regulation of FICD enzymatic activity and are discussed in detail in the Results section and the Discussion.</p><p>In regards to the specific comment in the second half of the critique we note that our findings are consistent with a role to transcriptional induction of FICD as playing a role in the recovery of modified BiP during the resolution of the stress. However, the dissociation between mounting levels of <italic>FICD</italic> mRNA and declining/low levels of modified BiP in the first 8 hr of a the stress response suggest that the dominant regulatory circuitry is not played out at the level of transcriptional regulation of <italic>FICD</italic>.</p><p><italic>3) A central conclusion of the current manuscript is that modification of a single site (T518) can account for all previous evidence that BiP was modified by adenosine and phosphate.

The mass spectrum is remarkable in its simplicity: <italic>FICD<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells have a single species of 70,532 Da whereas wildtype cells (exposed to cycloheximide to promote BiP AMPylation) have two species, 70,538 and 70,866 Da. These observations point to a single FICD-dependent AMPylation event as the only conspicuous modification of BiP in cultured CHO-K1 cells.</p><p><italic>4) Why is the FL/BiP ratio high (7.18, 7.48) in cells that have the constitutively active FICD plasmid in the absence of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>)?

Please provide error bars.</italic> </p><p>We have re-analyzed the data from all three experiments and found that they fit better to a mono-phasic than bi-phasic plot.</p><p>We now provide the source data on all three experiments, which includes the time-dependent changes in the fluorescent polarization signal arising from the fluorescently-labeled peptide alone.</p><p>In regards to the concern that recombinant BiP is heterogeneously AMPylated on the Arg-C BiP<sup>511-532</sup> peptide, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> of the revised manuscript presents the MS/MS fragmentation data showing that the series of <italic>y</italic>-ions and <italic>b</italic>-ions derived from the fragmentation of unmodified BiP extend to all the residues of the parent peptide. However, ions containing Thr<sup>518</sup> are conspicuously missing from the fragmentation spectra of modified BiP. This finding pin-points the modification to Thr<sup>518</sup> and excludes Thr<sup>525</sup> and Thr<sup>527</sup>.</p><p><italic>6) The authors present evidence that the ATPase activity of BiP-AMP is not stimulated by the J-domain of ERdJ6. Failure of a J domain to stimulate hydrolysis of the modified protein is somewhat surprising, particularly since they have concluded that the ATP bound form of BiP is the substrate for AMPylation, which is also the preferred binding form for DnaJ proteins. Does the J domain still bind ATP BiP-AMP? Or do they suppose the AMPylation stimulate ATP hydrolysis rendering BiP resistant to J domain stimulation?</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer(s) that the basis for the inhibition of responsiveness to J-protein by AMPylated BiP is one of the most interesting issues for future study, but at present we can only speculate that it too is a reflection of the reciprocal allostery from the SBD to the NBD (discussed above in response to critique #1). In defense of the plausibility of this idea we note the precedence provided by the Gly<sup>461</sup>Pro/Gly<sup>468</sup>Pro human BiP double mutant which, though locked in an ATP-like conformation, is nonetheless unresponsive to J-protein (Yang et al., 2015) (cited in the Discussion, fifth paragraph).</p><p>In regards to the very sensible suggestion by the reviewer(s) that we examine the effect of AMPylation on the interaction of BiP with DnaJ, we should like to point out that this issue is not easy to access experimentally: Whilst wildtype BiP (or other Hsp70’s) will avidly associate with immobilised J-proteins, in an ATP and functional J-domain dependent manner, forming a stable complex, this complex is not a good read-out of the BiP-J interaction the reviewers (and ourselves) would like measure. Its dependence on the ability of BiP to engage substrate in its SDB indicates that the interactions reflect the ability of the J protein to stimulate ATP hydrolysis driving BiP hyper affinity for substrates whilst serve as an unfolded substrate at the same time (see Figure Supplement 6 in Petrova et al. 2008; PMID: 18923430). We are actively seeking a more refined assay that gets around this problem, but are unable to offer one at present.</p></body></sub-article></article>
