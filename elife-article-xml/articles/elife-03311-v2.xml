To elucidate such function(s), we generated embryonic fibroblasts from conditional epsin triple KO mice. Triple KO cells displayed a dramatic cell division defect. Additionally, a robust impairment in clathrin-mediated endocytosis was observed, with an accumulation of early and U-shaped pits. This defect correlated with a perturbation of the coupling between the clathrin coat and the actin cytoskeleton, which we confirmed in a cell-free assay of endocytosis. Our results indicate that a key evolutionary conserved function of epsin, in addition to other roles that include, as we show here, a low affinity interaction with SNAREs, is to help generate the force that leads to invagination and then fission of clathrin-coated pits.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03311.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03311.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03311.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Clathrin-dependent endocytosis is one of the mechanisms used by cells to internalize specific proteins (cargo) from their surface. First, the cargo interacts with adaptor proteins that help cluster them in the cell's outer membrane, called the plasma membrane. This causes the protein clathrin to assemble into a lattice at the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane and deform the membrane into a pit. The pit grows deeper over time as more clathrin molecules assemble, eventually resulting in a deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pit that encloses the cargo to be taken up by the cell. The clathrin-coated pit then pinches off inside the cell in a process called fission to form a bubble-like structure called a vesicle, which transports the molecule to its destination.</p><p>The deep invagination of clathrin-coated pits that leads to fission is assisted by actin, a protein that assembles into filaments that are suggested to generate the forces needed for this process. Many other factors are also involved. One of them is epsin, the collective name for a family of three very similar proteins in mammalian cells. Epsin binds to several other proteins implicated in clathrin-dependent endocytosis, including clathrin itself, and to plasma membrane proteins specifically ‘tagged’ for internalization. In addition, a portion of the epsin molecule can insert into the plasma membrane and help it to curve, which is important for forming the invaginated pit. However, due to the number of possible functions epsin could perform, its main role has remained elusive.</p><p>Messa et al. created mouse cells that lack all three epsin proteins. Although these cells can form clathrin-coated pits, they struggle to develop into vesicles. The normal linking of the actin filaments to the clathrin coat does not occur, and another protein called Hip1R that also participates in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and links clathrin to actin, no longer accumulates at the clathrin-coated pits. Messa et al. also find that epsins can bind directly to actin. Overall, these results suggest that a main role of epsin is to help actin interact with the clathrin-coated pits and generate the force required for a pit to develop into a vesicle. However, epsin also performs many other roles, including recruiting a membrane protein (a so-called SNARE) that directs the fate of the vesicle to the clathrin-coated pit.</p><p>Additionally, Messa et al. find that cells lacking all three epsins have problems dividing correctly. More research is required to establish whether this effect is also due to epsin's interaction with the cell's actin cytoskeleton.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis involves a complex set of factors besides clathrin itself and the classical clathrin adaptors. These factors help coordinate nucleation of the clathrin coat with cargo selection, membrane invagination and fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmid, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Slepnev and De Camilli, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Merrifield et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012</xref>). An important player in these processes is epsin, the collective name for a family of evolutionarily conserved clathrin-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wendland, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ford et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and De Camilli, 2005</xref>), which in mammals is represented by three isoforms: epsin 1, 2, and 3 (encoded by the <italic>Epn1</italic>, <italic>Epn2</italic>, and <italic>Epn3</italic> genes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ko et al., 2010</xref>]). Epsin was identified as a major interactor of Eps15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 1998</xref>), another clathrin coat associated protein. It comprises a membrane binding N-terminal ENTH (Epsin N-Terminal Homology) domain, which is followed by ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Polo et al., 2002</xref>]) and a long sequence (tail) predicted to be primarily unfolded and flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wendland, 2002</xref>). The core of the ENTH domain is preceded by a short sequence that is unfolded in solution but folds into an amphipathic α-helix upon binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. The hydrophobic portion of the helix partially penetrates the bilayer, thus conferring membrane curvature generation and sensing properties to the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Itoh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ford et al., 2002</xref>). Epsin's disordered tail binds components of the clathrin coat via multiple short amino acid motifs: ‘clathrin boxes’ bind clathrin, DPW/F motifs bind the appendage domain of AP-2, and NPF motifs bind the EH domains of Eps15 and intersectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenthal et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drake, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shih et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Overstreet et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>As epsin binds ubiquitin and genetically interacts with enzymes of ubiquitin metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cadavid et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Polo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shih et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sigismund et al., 2005</xref>), it was proposed to function as a clathrin adaptor for ubiquitinated cargo. Strong evidence for such a role came from the demonstration of Notch signaling defects in epsin (<italic>liquid facets</italic>) mutant flies, as Notch signaling is critically dependent upon ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis of Notch ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Overstreet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xie et al., 2012</xref>). However, other findings pointed to a general housekeeping role of epsin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Absence of the two epsins (<italic>Ent1</italic> and <italic>Ent2</italic>) in yeast is lethal, while hypomorphic <italic>Ent1</italic> or <italic>Ent2</italic> mutations result in defects in endocytosis and actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wendland, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguilar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skruzny et al., 2012</xref>). Impairments in clathrin and actin function were also observed in epsin null <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9a">Brady et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2010</xref>). In both these unicellular organisms, epsin functions in close cooperation with Sla2/Hip1R, another evolutionarily conserved clathrin accessory factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9a">Brady et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skruzny et al., 2012</xref>). However, a link between epsin and Hip1R in metazoan cells has not been reported.</p><p>Hip1 family members (Hip1 and Hip1R in mammals) comprise an N-terminal ANTH domain followed by unfolded regions that bracket a coiled-coil region and a C-terminal THATCH (talin-HIP1/R/Sla2p actin-tethering C-terminal homology) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engqvist-Goldstein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wilbur et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skruzny et al., 2012</xref>). The coiled-coil region can homo-heterodimerize and also binds clathrin light chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engqvist-Goldstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Metzler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Legendre-Guillemin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gottfried et al., 2010</xref>). The THATCH domain is an actin-binding module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engqvist-Goldstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wilbur et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, Sla2/Hip1R binds actin and is thought to function as a major link between the clathrin coat and actin. Studies in yeast have additionally shown that the ENTH domain of epsin and the ANTH domain of Sla2 interact with each other, and the two proteins function together in providing a link between the endocytic coat and the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skruzny et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In addition to roles of epsin mediated by protein–protein interactions, membrane remodeling properties resulting from the amphipathic helix at the N-terminus of its ENTH domain have been implicated in the clathrin-dependent endocytic reaction. In vitro studies showed that this helix confers, upon the ENTH domain, the property to induce bilayer curvature and even to fragment bilayer tubules into vesicles, thus pointing to a potential role of the epsin in fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Itoh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ford et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boucrot et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, in view of this evidence for an important housekeeping role of epsin in endocytosis, the germline knockout (KO) of the mouse <italic>Epn1</italic> and <italic>Epn2</italic> genes that encode the two major ubiquitously expressed mammalian epsins, epsin 1 and 2, did not block the early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Arrest of embryonic development occurred only at E9.5–E10, with a pattern suggestive of impaired Notch signaling, while no obvious defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis were observed in fibroblasts derived from these embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, studies of epsin 1 and 2 conditional double KO endothelial cells revealed a selective defect in the internalization of ubiquitinated VEGF receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pasula et al., 2012</xref>). However, a recent study based on RNAi-mediated knock-down (KD) in fibroblastic cells reported that the KD of all the three epsins produces a global impairment of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which was attributed to a defect of the fission reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boucrot et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The goal of the present study was to provide conclusive evidence about the function(s) and sites of action of epsin in endocytosis using a gene KO strategy to completely eliminate all epsins. Our results, which capitalize on triple KO (TKO) cells generated from conditional epsin TKO mice, show that epsin provides a link between the clathrin coat and actin and is needed for the transition of pits from a shallow to a deeply invaginated state. As in unicellular organisms, epsin acts in concert with Hip1R but with differences from yeast to mammals. An additional function of epsin is a low affinity interaction of its ENTH domain with synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2 (Syb2) that may help ensure the presence of a vesicular SNARE in the budding vesicle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of conditional epsin triple knockout cells</title><p>As the germline deletion of even only two <italic>Epn</italic> genes results in embryonic lethality, a conditional approach was used to generate <italic>Epn1</italic>, <italic>Epn2</italic>, and <italic>Epn3</italic> triple KO cells.

Treated MEFs derived from the same litters but harboring a wild-type (WT) epsin 1 allele did not exhibit any obvious differences from OHT-treated WT fibroblasts in terms of proliferation, endocytosis and actin organization.

SNARE binding by ENTH/ANTH family proteins helps coordinate bud formation with the incorporation of an appropriate SNARE in the nascent vesicle to direct its fate after fission.

The very low affinity of this interaction (K<sub>D</sub> 470 ± 30 μM) was enhanced by the presence in the incubation medium of IP<sub>6</sub> (K<sub>D</sub> 80 ± 7.9 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which induces the folding of helix zero of the ENTH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Itoh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ford et al., 2002</xref>).

However, studies in different organisms and in cell-free systems had emphasized the different aspects of its function, so that a complete picture of its physiological role(s) has remained elusive. Elucidation of epsin function in mammalian cells had been complicated by the existence of the three <italic>Epn</italic> genes with overlapping functions. To overcome this problem, we have generated cells that lack all the three epsins by a conditional KO approach involving the OHT-dependent disruption of the <italic>Epn1</italic> gene in epsin 2 and 3 double KO mice.</p><p>A main conclusion of our study is the occurrence of a close coupling between the function of epsin and the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. While such coupling had been suggested by studies in unicellular organisms, studies of epsin in cells of metazoan had emphasized its role as a bilayer deforming protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ford et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boucrot et al., 2012</xref>) and as a cargo-specific adaptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Polo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Overstreet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and De Camilli, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meloty-Kapella et al., 2012</xref>). A link of epsin to actin function at endocytic clathrin-coated pits, and in particular a role as a factor that ensures a ‘controlled’ actin growth at sites of endocytosis, is supported by several observations. First, Hip1R, which had so far been considered the major link of endocytic clathrin coats to actin in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engqvist-Goldstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le Clainche et al., 2007</xref>), is not recruited to endocytic clathrin-coated pits in the absence of epsin. This is consistent with the interaction and functional partnership of epsin with Sla2/Hip1R, previously demonstrated in yeast and <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, although in yeast it is Sla2 that recruits epsin to clathrin-coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skruzny et al., 2012</xref>). Second, the lack of epsin results in a disruption of the normal actin cytoskeleton with a major loss of stress fibers and an accumulation of actin foci at the cell surface, typically in proximity of arrested endocytic clathrin-coated pits. Third, epsin binds actin directly via its disordered tail region. Fourth, a cell-free assay of endocytosis involving plasma membrane sheets and brain cytosol revealed that relative to WT, epsin-deficient cytosol results in an exaggerated and abnormal growth of the actin cytoskeleton. These findings suggest a role for epsin in orchestrating a coupling between actin and endocytic clathrin coats that (1) limits excessive actin growth and (2) helps mediate an effect of actin polymerization on bud invagination. A functional partnership between epsin and Hip1R explains why the KD of Hip1R results in a similar enhanced and abnormal actin nucleation at endocytic sites, with the formation of large actin bundles projecting away from these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Engqvist-Goldstein et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The excess of actin nucleation in the absence of epsin is of special interest as in yeast the ENTH domains of Ent1 and 2 bind two Cdc42–GAPs (GTPase activating proteins), Rga1 and Rga2, and this interaction is essential for function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly RLIP76/RalBP1, a protein with Cdc42 GAP activity, interacts with the ENTH domain of epsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rossé et al., 2003</xref>), although there is no clear sequence homology between RLIP76/RalBP1 and Rga proteins. In view of the modulatory role of Cdc42 in the nucleation of N-WASP-Arp 2/3-dependent actin nucleation at endocytic clathrin-coated pits, the recruitment of a Cdc42–GAP by epsin could help explain why actin nucleation is enhanced in epsin null cells.</p><p>A very strong link between epsin and actin is consistent with evidence for a general and evolutionarily conserved role of actin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is more prominent under conditions of high plasma membrane tensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Merrifield et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaksonen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferguson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boulant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>). The force of actin polymerization may help drive the deep invagination of the pits and also assist in dynamin-dependent fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Itoh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roux et al., 2006</xref>) by developing a force that drives the deeply invaginated bud away from the plasma membrane. The occurrence of this force is well demonstrated by the dramatic actin-dependent elongation of the clathrin-coated pit necks in living cells and in cell-free systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferguson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2010</xref>), when the fission reaction is impaired by the lack of dynamin (living cells) or block of its GTPase activity (cell-free system), respectively. Clearly, however, epsin does not simply function as a negative regulator of actin polymerization, but it is required for proper spatial organization of the actin-based cytoskeleton, as exemplified by the abnormal localization of myosin 1E at sites of endocytic invaginations on plasma membrane sheets incubated with epsin TKO cytosol.</p><p>We note that partial deficiency of epsin function has a major impact on intercellular signaling mediated by Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Overstreet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). It was proposed that Notch activation requires a pulling force applied to Notch by the endocytosis of its ligand in the neighboring cell and that epsin may be essential for the generation of such force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meloty-Kapella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Musse et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shergill et al., 2012</xref>). Based on our findings, such a requirement for epsin may be linked to its role in the control of actin dynamics at clathrin-coated pits. Reported roles of epsin in clathrin-independent endocytosis may also be linked to its function in actin regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sigismund et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Another important finding of our study is a weak interaction of epsin's ENTH domain with the SNARE synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2. As intracellular vesicles need SNAREs to fuse with their target membranes, a coupling must exist between vesicle budding and incorporation of the proper SNARE(s) in the bud. Accordingly, other coat adaptors with ANTH or ENTH modules, such as AP180/CALM and epsinR were shown to bind SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirst et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koo et al., 2011</xref>). We hypothesize that the very low affinity of the binding of synaptobrevin 2 to epsin, which explains why such an interaction had not been described so far, may nevertheless be physiologically relevant when compounded by other interaction of epsin with the bilayer, other coat components, and ubiquitinated cargo proteins.</p><p>Recently, it was proposed that a main role of epsin in endocytic clathrin-coated pit dynamics is to help mediate membrane fission via the membrane remodeling properties of the amphipathic helix zero of its ENTH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boucrot et al., 2012</xref>). While this action seems plausible, our study strongly suggests that epsin becomes critically important at the earlier stages of clathrin coat maturation, as we have observed an accumulation of shallow and U-shaped endocytic clathrin-coated pits in epsin TKO cells. The diffuse, rather than punctate distribution of proteins that assemble at the necks of deeply invaginated endocytic clathrin-coated pits, such as dynamin 2, endophilin 2, and myosin 1E further supports a stalling of pits at an early stage in epsin TKO cells. In contrast to the observations made in epsin triple KD cells, we have not observed clearly multiheaded pits, although the dome of some pits was irregular. Multiheaded pits observed in epsin triple KD cells had been interpreted as reflecting a defect in fission. However, they do not have the constricted neck of multiheaded pits observed in dynamin mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferguson et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2009</xref>) and at least some of them could represent a clustering of shallow or U-shaped pits. We note that the multiple endocytic functions of epsin are consistent with its localization throughout the coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28a">Hawryluk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sochacki et al., 2014</xref>), rather than a selective localization at the bud neck to mediate fission.</p><p>Finally, our work also demonstrates a dramatic impact of the lack of epsin on cell division, extending previous observations made in epsin 1 and 2 double KD cells, where abnormal spindles were detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu and Zheng, 2009</xref>). Surprisingly, we did not find a major effect on cell division in cells derived from epsin 1 and 2 double KO embryos possibly because of long-term adaptation to decreased levels of epsin. For example, we have detected an upregulation of epsin 3 in epsin 1 and 2 double KO cells (our unpublished observations). Interestingly, epsin undergoes phosphorylation and mono- or oligo-ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stukenberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Polo et al., 2002</xref>) in mitosis and these covalent modifications impair its binding to clathrin and AP-2, suggesting a switch of its function in the mitotic cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 1999</xref>). A role of epsin in the dynamics of the cytoskeleton may underlie its role in mitosis, for example by affecting its anchoring to the cell cortex. Several other endocytic proteins, including clathrin, are also implicated in mitosis, and, in particular, in cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Royle, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our results reveal new aspects of the collective function of the three epsin genes and point to epsin as an important coordinator of the dynamics of endocytic clathrin coats from early to late stages. Our findings, along with previous studies suggest the models depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Epsin is an early component of endocytic clathrin-coated pits, which interacts directly with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, AP-2, clathrin, and other early clathrin-coated pit components such as intersectin and Eps15. The partial bilayer penetration of its ENTH domain makes it optimally suited to function at a site where membrane buckling occurs (as a generator, sensor or stabilizer of curvature), while its low affinity binding to synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2 may collaborate with AP180/CALM to ensure the coupling of bud nucleation to a membrane patch containing SNAREs. It may additionally participate in the recruitment to the pit of ubiquitinated cargo proteins via its UIMs, a function that does not apply to <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> epsin, which expresses a single epsin family protein lacking UIMs. As the bud expands, epsin along with Hip1R provide a link between actin nucleation and coat maturation, which is required for deep invagination. Finally, the membrane insertion properties of its helix zero may assist dynamin in the fission reaction. As we show here, however, its most critical function is at the transition between shallow/U-shaped and deep invaginated pits.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03311.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Functions of epsin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the role of epsin in the coupling of the endocytic clathrin coat to actin in cooperation with Hip1R (left). This coupling helps invaginate the pit. Only epsin localized at the equator of the bud is shown to emphasize its actin-related function in pit invagination, but epsin is not restricted to the equator. Higher magnification representation of the interactions of epsin (right): the N-terminal ENTH domain binds (1) the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-rich membrane bilayer of the plasma membrane (and partially penetrates it), (2) the ANTH domain of Hip1R, and (3) synaptobrevin2/VAMP2; its tail binds (1) ubiquitinated cargo proteins (via UIMs), (2) AP-2 and clathrin heavy chain (via DPF/DPW motifs and ‘clathrin boxes’, respectively), and (3) the EH domain region of Eps15 (via NPF motifs). Epsin's tail also binds F-actin and co-operates with the THATCH domain of Hip1R in the coupling of the actin cytoskeleton to the clathrin-coated pit. In both fields Hip1R is depicted as a monomer but functions as a dimer, or heterodimer with Hip1. (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic representation of the multiple functions of epsin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Epsin participates in the early stages of the reaction as a coat nucleator, curvature inducer/sensor and also helps coupling bud formation to SNARE incorporation. As the coat matures, ubiquitinated cargo is recruited. Additionally, the link between epsin/Hip1R and actin is required for the deep invagination of the pit, and this is the process at which the action of epsin becomes essential. Subsequently, the force produced by actin and the bilayer destabilizing properties of epsin's ENTH domain may co-operate with dynamin in fission.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03311.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03311.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03311-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Antibodies were obtained from the following commercial sources: mouse anti-tubulin, rabbit anti-FLAG, and mouse anti-Actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA); mouse anti-transferrin receptor and rabbit anti-GFP (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA); goat anti-epsin 1 and mouse anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA); rabbit anti-clathrin light chain, mouse anti-Arp 2/3, rabbit anti-Hip1R, and mouse anti-Hip1 (EMD-Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA); rat HRP-conjugated anti-HA (Roche, Mannheim, Germany); rabbit anti-His tag (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA); mouse anti-Aurora B, rabbit anti-caveolin-1, and mouse anti-adaptin μ2 subunit (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA, USA).

The virus was produced in the Phoenix helper-free retrovirus producer line (293T cell line transformed with adenovirus E1a and carrying a temperature sensitive T antigen co-selected with neomycin). Briefly 10 μg of pBABE puro-Syb2–HA were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) into Phoenix cells. In parallel WT and conditional epsin double KO fibroblasts were plated. 24 hours after transfection, the medium from the Phoenix cell dishes was removed, supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene (cationic polymer used to increase the retroviral infection efficiency in cell culture) and filtered to remove cell debris. The filtrate was added to the mouse fibroblasts and removed after 4–6 hours incubation at 37°C. 48 hours after the initial viral incubation fibroblasts were splitted in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Life Technologies). pBABE puro vector carries a puromycin resistance gene that was used to select the Syb2–HA expressing cells by supplementing the culture medium with 4 μg/ml puromicyn ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferguson et al., 2009</xref>] ,Sigma-Aldrich).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Fluorescent signals were quantified with Fiji ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Fiji">http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Fiji</ext-link>) or the Volocity 3D Image Analysis software (Improvision).

After sending the original decision to you, we received a further peer review from reviewer 3. We realize this is unusual but ask that you try to address these issues in your revision; because the decision was sent, it should not require additional experimental work beyond the original review but if something is easily checked that would be great.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript makes use of epsin triple knockout fibroblasts, to try to clear up some of the confusion surrounding the function(s) of the epsin family of proteins. Although it is widely agreed that epsins are important players in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, there is still a lot of controversy over what they actually do. Part of the problem is that there are three epsin isoforms in mammals, encoded by different genes. Worms and flies both have only a single epsin gene and knockouts have been shown to impair Notch signaling (which requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis). Similarly, in a study by the De Camilli lab published five years ago, knocking out both of the ubiquitously expressed mouse epsin genes, epsin 1 and epsin 2, causes embryonic lethality in a way that can be explained by impairment of multiple Notch pathways. Importantly, clathrin-mediated endocytosis in general is not abolished in any of the epsin knockout animals.</p><p>However, there was a high profile paper from the McMahon lab, published two years ago in Cell, claiming that if all three epsin genes were knocked down by siRNA in HeLa, BSC1, or RPE1 cells, clathrin-mediated endocytosis was effectively abolished: the phenotype was as severe as when clathrin or AP-2 were knocked down. The authors claimed that the reason this phenotype hadn't been observed before was that the three epsin isoforms were functionally redundant. This is in spite of the fact that expression of epsin 3 is highly tissue-specific, and the authors never investigated whether it was actually expressed in these cell lines. The Boucrot et al. paper also reported that in the epsin triple knockdown, the coated pits were arrested at scission, and that epsin could substitute for dynamin in dynamin-depleted cells. Micrographs showed “multiheaded” clathrin-coated structures, appearing like bunches of grapes. It was difficult to know what to make of this paper, but until the present study, no other piece of work has come along to challenge it.</p><p>The present manuscript is timely, and deserves to be published where it will be highly visible. It represents a huge amount of work, and presents very high quality data. The take-home message is that in the epsin triple knockout cells, there is a partial block in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but the phenotype is quite different from that reported by Boucrot et al. Most importantly, the authors present several lines of evidence indicating that epsin plays a key role in linking clathrin to the actin cytoskeleton. This is the first evidence for such a role for epsin, and for a functional association between Hip1R and epsin, in animal cells; however, it fits in nicely with studies that have been carried out in yeast and <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. The authors should be able to address all of the comments by making amendments to the text.</p><p>1) It would be helpful to know why the authors had to use a conditional knockout for epsin 1. Their strategy was to generate knockout mice with no epsin 2 or epsin 3, and then to cross them with a floxed epsin 1 strain, to generate the strain Epn1loxP/loxP; Epn2-/-; Enp3-/-. I assume that the authors initially tried to cross their Epn2-/-; Enp3-/- mice, which are healthy, with their Epn1-/- mice, which are also healthy, but that the triply homozygous embryos died at an early stage; however, it would be good if this could be spelled out. The authors then crossed their mice with an inducible Cre recombinase strain and isolated embryonic fibroblasts. The cells were typically treated for 7 days with a drug to induce Cre expression, thereby excising the epsin 1 gene. It is clear from the Western blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> that even after 7 days, trace amounts of epsin 1 are still detectable. Is this because the gene had not been excised in 100% of the cells, or because “old” protein had not been completely degraded? The immunofluorescence images, in which epsin 1 is undetectable in the drug-treated cells, suggest the former. The authors do not say why they didn't treat the cells even longer with the drug, or try to isolate a clonal population completely lacking all three genes, but I assume it was because the cells were no longer viable? Again, it would be helpful if this could be clarified.</p><p>2) To what extent was clathrin-mediated endocytosis impaired in the triple knockout cells? The Boucrot et al. paper claims that they got a complete block, but the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> suggest something more modest (e.g., 50% or so). Please clarify this.</p><p>3) Based on their immunofluorescence labeling, the authors report a “robust increase in the density of clathrin-coated pits”, which they also found to be more clustered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-D</xref>). However, quantification of their EM data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2U</xref>) does not reflect this difference: if one adds up the data for all of the coated structures, the numbers are remarkably similar: ∼0.095 coated structures per micron cell perimeter in the control, and ∼0.1 in the triple knockout. Is this because individual pits are wider, or because clusters are treated as single structures? It is interesting to note that a similar phenotype was reported for CALM knockdown cells (Meyerholz et al., 2005, Traffic 6: 1225-1234). Could this be due to a similar phenomenon?</p><p>4) There is some confusion in the paper about the relationship between epsin and epsinR, and about the function of epsinR. In opisthokonts (i.e., animals and fungi), there are two families of genes with similar ENTH (epsin N-terminal homology) domains. Epsin genes (e.g., EPN1, EPN2, and EPN3 in humans, and ENT1 and ENT2 in yeast) encode proteins that are associated with AP-2 and clathrin at the plasma membrane, and that contain ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs). EpsinR genes (e.g., CLINT1 in humans, and ENT3 and ENT5 in yeast) encode proteins that are associated with AP-1 and clathrin at intracellular membranes, and that interact with the Q-SNARE vti1b/Vti1p. However, most other eukaryotes have only one such protein, which has been defined as epsinR because it lacks UIMs (e.g., see Gabernet-Castello et al., 2009, Traffic 10: 894-911). Thus, when the authors report that their studies are in line with studies on Dictyostelium, where links between epsin, Hip1R, and actin were also reported, they need to be aware that the Dictyostelium protein is thought to be more like epsinR. Interestingly, however, the Dictyostelium protein localizes to both the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes, suggesting that the ancestral epsin/epsinR was able to contribute to both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and clathrin-mediated intracellular trafficking, but that then after a gene duplication in pre-opisthokonts, the two descendants became specialized for different pathways. Again, it would be good if there could be some clarification about epsin vs. epsinR in non-opisthokonts. In addition, the authors need to correct their statement on page 17 that “epsin 1R” binds V-SNAREs, because the correct name for the protein is epsinR, and the SNARE that it binds is a T-SNARE, not a V-SNARE.</p><p>5) The structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are so tiny that it is impossible to see the epsin, let alone what it does.</p><p>6) Please be sure to discuss clearly why these results differ from those reported previously, as summarized in this review above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic></p><p>1) The previously published data from yeast and the new data in this paper imply that Epsin and Hip1R may stabilize each other at endocytic sites.

Their strategy was to generate knockout mice with no epsin 2 or epsin 3, and then to cross them with a floxed epsin 1 strain, to generate the strain Epn1loxP/loxP; Epn2-/-; Enp3-/-. I assume that the authors initially tried to cross their Epn2-/-; Enp3-/- mice, which are healthy, with their Epn1-/- mice, which are also healthy, but that the triply homozygous embryos died at an early stage; however, it would be good if this could be spelled out</italic>.</p><p>Correct, we did so as the animals die at an early stage; we have now made this clearer in the text. We now state:</p><p>“As the germline deletion of even only two Epn genes results in embryonic lethality, a conditional approach was used to generate Epn1, Epn2 and Epn3 triple KO cells.”</p><p><italic>The authors then crossed their mice with an inducible Cre recombinase strain and isolated embryonic fibroblasts. The cells were typically treated for 7 days with a drug to induce Cre expression, thereby excising the epsin 1 gene. It is clear from the Western blots in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>that even after 7 days, trace amounts of epsin 1 are still detectable. Is this because the gene had not been excised in 100% of the cells, or because “old” protein had not been completely degraded? The immunofluorescence images, in which epsin 1 is undetectable in the drug-treated cells, suggest the former. The authors do not say why they didn't treat the cells even longer with the drug, or try to isolate a clonal population completely lacking all three genes, but I assume it was because the cells were no longer viable? Again, it would be helpful if this could be clarified</italic>.</p><p>We do find after the 7-day treatment a few cells where epsin immunoreactivity has not completely disappeared. Thus, we believe that the residual minimal amount of epsin is explained by a combination of both factors raised by the reviewer. We now state:</p><p>“The extremely small amount of residual epsin 1 was likely explained by delayed gene recombination in a few cells, where residual epsin 1 immunoreactivity, much lower than in controls, was observed by immunofluorescence.”</p><p>We did not treat cells for a longer time with the drug, as a longer treatment resulted in cell lethality.</p><p><italic>2) To what extent was clathrin-mediated endocytosis impaired in the triple knockout cells? The Boucrot et al. paper claims that they got a complete block, but the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>suggest something more modest (e.g., 50% or so). Please clarify this</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers probably refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, as this is the figure (not <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that describes the defect in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The robustness of this defect is clearly demonstrated by the striking difference in the localization of transferrin (after a 15 min incubation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>) and of the transferrin receptor (a classical marker of clathrin-mediated endocytosis) as assessed by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and K</xref>) and surface biotinylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). In WT cells, the bulk of the receptor, as well as of transferrin after 15 min incubation, are inside the cell, while in triple KO cells the overwhelming majority of the receptor, as well as of transferrin, are at the cell surface. This effect is comparable to the one we had observed in dynamin null cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferguson et al. 2009</xref>, PMID:20059951, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H and I</xref>).</p><p>We do appreciate that the analysis of transferrin fluorescence reported in the original figure (original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>, which showed the ratio between surface and internalized fluorescent signal as detected by confocal microscopy) did not quantify with accurate precision the internalization and most likely underestimated the internalization defect. The fluorescence images that we present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>), along with the biochemical biotinylation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>), strongly support a massive internalization defect, consistent with the Boucrot et al. paper, in which the analysis of transferrin internalization was carried out by FACS in epsin triple knockdown cells. For this reason, we did not deem it necessary to repeat the analysis of transferrin internalization using a biochemical assay. However, we could do such an assay, if the reviewer considers this essential towards to acceptance of our manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) Based on their immunofluorescence labeling, the authors report a “robust increase in the density of clathrin-coated pits”, which they also found to be more clustered (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A-D</italic></xref><italic>). However, quantification of their EM data (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2U</italic></xref><italic>) does not reflect this difference: if one adds up the data for all of the coated structures, the numbers are remarkably similar: ∼0.095 coated structures per micron cell perimeter in the control, and ∼0.1 in the triple knockout. Is this because individual pits are wider, or because clusters are treated as single structures?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment; we realize the EM quantification was not reflecting the increase in clathrin-coated pits density observed by IF. In response to this comment we have reassessed the analysis on a higher number of samples for both the control and the epsin TKO. We found the total number of coated structures is significantly different between control and TKO and we show it in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2T</xref>.</p><p><italic>It is interesting to note that a similar phenotype was reported for CALM knockdown cells (Meyerholz et al., 2005, Traffic 6: 1225-1234). Could this be due to a similar phenomenon?</italic></p><p>It is really difficult to say if this is a mechanistically similar phenomenon and we prefer not to speculate on this point.</p><p><italic>4) There is some confusion in the paper about the relationship between epsin and epsinR, and about the function of epsinR. In opisthokonts (i.e., animals and fungi), there are two families of genes with similar ENTH (epsin N-terminal homology) domains. Epsin genes (e.g., EPN1, EPN2, and EPN3 in humans, and ENT1 and ENT2 in yeast) encode proteins that are associated with AP-2 and clathrin at the plasma membrane, and that contain ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs). EpsinR genes (e.g., CLINT1 in humans, and ENT3 and ENT5 in yeast) encode proteins that are associated with AP-1 and clathrin at intracellular membranes, and that interact with the Q-SNARE vti1b/Vti1p. However, most other eukaryotes have only one such protein, which has been defined as epsinR because it lacks UIMs (e.g., see Gabernet-Castello et al., 2009, Traffic 10: 894-911). Thus, when the authors report that their studies are in line with studies on Dictyostelium, where links between epsin, Hip1R, and actin were also reported, they need to be aware that the Dictyostelium protein is thought to be more like epsinR. Interestingly, however, the Dictyostelium protein localizes to both the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes, suggesting that the ancestral epsin/epsinR was able to contribute to both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and clathrin-mediated intracellular trafficking, but that then after a gene duplication in pre-opisthokonts, the two descendants became specialized for different pathways. Again, it would be good if there could be some clarification about epsin vs. epsinR in non-opisthokonts</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this point. We have now addressed it with the following text:</p><p>“It may additionally participate in the recruitment to the pit of ubiquitinated cargo via its UIMs, a function that does not apply to Dictyostelium epsin, which expresses a single epsin family protein lacking UIMs.”</p><p>We prefer, however, not to dwell into the discussion of opisthokonts versus amoebas, as it is really peripheral to the main topic of the paper.</p><p><italic>In addition, the authors need to correct their statement on page 17 that “epsin 1R” binds V-SNAREs, because the correct name for the protein is epsinR, and the SNARE that it binds is a T-SNARE, not a V-SNARE</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are correct. This comment made us reconsider the terminology used and we decided to simply speak of SNAREs.</p><p><italic>5) The structures in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>are so tiny that it is impossible to see the epsin, let alone what it does</italic>.</p><p>The point of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> was not to show mechanistic details about epsin function but to show its sites of action. However, in response to this comment we have added two fields demonstrating mechanistic details.</p><p><italic>6) Please be sure to discuss clearly why these results differ from those reported previously, as summarized in this review above</italic>.</p><p>We have introduced the following sentence at the beginning of the second paragraph of the Discussion:</p><p>“A main conclusion of our study is the occurrence of a close coupling between the function of epsin and the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. While such coupling had been suggested by studies in unicellular organisms, studies of epsin in cells of metazoan had emphasized its role as a bilayer deforming protein and as a cargo-specific adaptor.”</p><p>Concerning the discrepancy from the Boucrot et al. paper, we believe to have addressed it with the following statement already present in the original manuscript:</p><p>“Recently it was proposed that a main role of epsin in endocytic clathrin-coated pit dynamics is to help mediate membrane fission via the membrane remodeling properties of the amphipathic helix zero of its ENTH domain. While this action seems plausible, our study strongly suggests that epsin becomes critically important at earlier stages of clathrin coat maturation, as we have observed an accumulation of shallow and U-shaped endocytic clathrin-coated pits in epsin TKO cells. The diffuse, rather than punctate distribution of proteins that assemble at the necks of deeply invaginated endocytic clathrin-coated pits, such as dynamin 2, endophilin 2 and myosin 1E further supports a stalling of pits at an early stage in epsin TKO cells. In contrast to observations made in epsin triple KD cells we have not observed clearly multiheaded pits, although the dome of some pits was irregular. Multiheaded pits observed in epsin triple KD cells had been interpreted as reflecting a defect in fission. However, they do not have the constricted neck of multiheaded pits observed in dynamin mutant cells and at least some of them could represent a clustering of shallow or U-shaped pits. We note that the multiple endocytic functions of epsin are consistent with its localization throughout the coat, rather than a selective localization at the bud neck to mediate fission.”</p><p>In our opinion, this paragraph accurately addresses the discrepancy with the paper by Boucrot et al. (McMahon’s lab).</p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p><italic>1) The previously published data from yeast and the new data in this paper imply that Epsin and Hip1R may stabilize each other at endocytic sites. If the authors could address the mechanism of this stabilization, it would greatly improve the significance and impact of the work; at minimum, please discuss</italic>.</p><p>Based on our data we conclude that in mammalian cells epsin plays a major role in the recruitment of Hip1R to endocytic pits, but not vice versa. We note that a role of epsin in the recruitment of Hip1R was also observed in Dictyostelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brady et al., 2010</xref>, PMID: 20923836; quoted in the manuscript), while in yeast, it is Hip1R (Sla2) that recruits epsin (Ent1 and 2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skruzny et al., 2012</xref>, PMID:22927393; quoted in the manuscript). Thus, while the partnership between epsin and Hip1R is evolutionary conserved, the relative importance of epsin and Hip1R in the recruitment of the other protein to coated pits varies in different species.</p><p><italic>2) The focus of the paper (reflected in the title) is on Epsin functions in endocytosis.

In any case, as it is now clear that many endocytic proteins, including clathrin, also play an important role in mitosis, the cell division defect of epsin triple KO cells is not totally unrelated to the endocytic function of epsin.</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2V</italic></xref><italic>, Clathrin localization should be probed by two-color imaging together with dynamin, or endophilin, or Myosin IE in the TKO cells.

In view of these previous studies, and of the dramatic endocytic defect produced by the absence of all three epsins, we conclude that the phenotype observed in epsin triple KO cells is not simply due to the loss of HIP1/HIP1R function.</p><p><italic>5) The cell free system could be useful in many cases, however, it did not provide more in the way of novel insights to this study.
