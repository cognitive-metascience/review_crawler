but a growing body of evidence suggests otherwise. We used site-directed mutagenesis coupled with direct measures of competitive fitness to estimate the distribution of fitness effects among synonymous mutations for a gene under directional selection and capable of adapting via synonymous nucleotide changes. Synonymous mutations had highly variable fitness effects, both deleterious and beneficial, resembling those of nonsynonymous mutations in the same gene. This variation in fitness was underlain by changes in transcription linked to the creation of internal promoter sites. A positive correlation between fitness and the presence of synonymous substitutions across a phylogeny of related Pseudomonads suggests these mutations may be common in nature. Taken together, our results provide the most compelling evidence to date that synonymous mutations with non-neutral fitness effects may in fact be commonplace.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic></kwd><kwd>synonymous mutation</kwd><kwd>fitness</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kassen</surname><given-names>Rees</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Canada Graduate Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lebeuf-Taylor</surname><given-names>Eleonore</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000192</institution-id><institution>Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ontario Graduate Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCloskey</surname><given-names>Nick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Synonymous mutations can have highly variable fitness effects stemming from changes in transcription, some of which contribute to adaptation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our ability to use DNA sequence data to make inferences about the evolutionary process from genes or genomes often relies on the assumption that synonymous mutations, those that do not result in an amino acid change, are neutral with respect to fitness. Yet there is compelling evidence that this assumption is sometimes wrong: comparative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lawrie et al., 2013</xref>) and experimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lind et al., 2010</xref>) data show that synonymous mutations can have a range of fitness effects from negative to positive, and can even contribute to adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agashe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kristofich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">She and Jarosz, 2018</xref>). A range of mechanisms including codon usage bias, altered mRNA structure, and the creation of promoter sequences could lead to changes in the rate or efficiency of transcription, translation, and/or protein folding and/or expression that, in turn, impact fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</xref>). The specific mechanism notwithstanding, it is clear that synonymous mutations are not always neutral; however, the degree of variability in their fitness effects, and how often they contribute to adaptation, remains unknown.</p><p>Our work focuses on testing fitness effects of synonymous mutations in a gene known to be under selection. Previous work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al. (2014)</xref> reported the discovery of two spontaneous, highly beneficial synonymous mutations arising independently over the course of a selection experiment in <italic>gtsB</italic>, a gene that codes for a membrane-bound permease subunit of an ABC glucose-transporter in the Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> SBW25. The <italic>gts</italic> operon is crucial to glucose uptake, as it encodes a four-protein system that binds glucose in the periplasm and actively transports it across the inner membrane. Knockouts of <italic>gtsB</italic> show that this particular gene, the second in the operon, is targeted by selection in an environment where low glucose limits growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>As a first step towards understanding the evolutionary effects of synonymous mutations, we estimated the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) for 39 synonymous, 65 nonsynonymous, and six nonsense substitutions at 34 sites along <italic>gtsB</italic>. Single nucleotide mutants were generated through site-directed mutagenesis and competed against the ancestor strain in glucose-limited medium. We previously reported on two beneficial synonymous mutations in this gene recovered from a population that had evolved for ~1000 generations in glucose-limited medium and confirmed that <italic>gtsB</italic> is a target of selection under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2014</xref>). Visual inspection of the DFEs for nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) reveals they are similar, with both having modes close to neutrality (<italic>w</italic> ~ 1) and substantial variation that includes mutants with both positive and deleterious effects. However, the distributions differ significantly (p=0.0002 based on a bootstrapped estimate of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov D-statistic from 10,000 permutations) due to the presence of a handful of strongly deleterious nonsense mutations in the non-synonymous set that presumably produce a truncated, non-functional protein.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45952.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distributions of relative fitness effects of <italic>gtsB</italic> point mutations in low glucose media.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Counts of nonsynonymous (blue; n = 71) and synonymous (red; n = 39) mutations display a wide range of fitness effects, with ticks under the bars indicating the relative fitness values of nonsense mutations.

The combined DFE for both kinds of beneficial mutations is approximately L-shaped, with many mutations of small effect and a few of large effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as expected from theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gillespie, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Orr, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martin and Lenormand, 2008</xref>). More formally, the DFE among beneficial mutations is significantly different from an exponential distribution (likelihood ratio test, p=0.0077) and falls within the Weibull domain of the Generalised Pareto Distribution (K = −0.37), suggesting the existence of a local fitness optimum similar to what has been seen previously for nonsynonymous mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rokyta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schoustra et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>What cellular processes underlie the wide range of fitness effects observed here? Our fitness data allow us to test some of the leading hypotheses through in silico analyses. Fitness could be higher if synonymous mutations result in codon usage that is more closely aligned with that of highly expressed genes. Alternatively, it has been suggested that suboptimal codon usage within the first ~50 codons -- the translational ramp -- is required to ensure efficient translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tuller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Navon and Pilpel, 2011</xref>), suggesting that higher fitness should be associated with the introduction of rarer codons close to the start of a gene. We could find no evidence for either explanation in our sample: a regression of fitness on distance from the start codon of <italic>gtsB</italic> was not statistically significant (permutation of residuals, p=0.20), nor was there a significant relationship between change in fitness and change in codon adaptation index (CAI; p=0. 40) or tRNA adaptation index (tAI; p=0.53), both measures of the degree of codon usage bias. This is perhaps unsurprising given that CAI is a gene-level codon usage metric, and a change in a single codon is unlikely to have a large effect on the overall CAI value for either the whole gene or a portion thereof. Notably, there is little evidence for a translational ramp in WT <italic>gtsB</italic>: the first 50 codons are not significantly enriched for rare codons (adj. R<sup>2</sup> = 0.0058, p=0.21); further, the interaction of codon position with CAI or tAI does not yield significant results (p=0.45 and 0.90, respectively).</p><p>It has also been suggested that synonymous mutations could impact fitness through their effects on mRNA transcript secondary structure and hence the rate and fidelity of translation. Higher fitness could result from faster translation due to transcripts that are less thermodynamically stable and, so, more accessible to the ribosome during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kudla et al., 2009</xref>) or from more efficient translation due to more stable mRNAs that persist longer due to slower degradation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deutscher, 2006</xref>). A linear model linking change in mRNA stability and fitness is significant for the nonsynonymous subset of mutations (permutation of residuals, p=0.0039), although the effect is weak (adj. R<sup>2</sup> = 0.11) and driven by less stable, highly deleterious mutations. We could not detect a relationship between change in mRNA stability and fitness for synonymous mutations, even when we account for the possibility of strong 5’ end secondary structures by adding a position term reflecting distance from the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frumkin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The absence of any relationship between synonymous mutation fitness and codon usage bias or mRNA stability, both measures affecting translation, suggests that fitness effects stem from changes in transcription. Testing this hypothesis requires comparing estimates of transcript and protein abundance, the difference being a measure of the effect of translation. We evaluated mRNA and GtsB protein levels by proxy via the insertion of a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) bioreporter into the WT or mutant <italic>gtsB</italic> background just before or just after the stop codon. The former construct (a translational fusion) produces a single reading frame where <italic>gtsB</italic> and YFP are translated together; the latter, with YFP inserted after the <italic>gtsB</italic> stop codon (a transcriptional fusion), results in <italic>gtsB</italic> and YFP being translated separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A mutation upstream of these fusions that leads to increased translation, but not transcription, is expected to generate a higher YFP expression level in the translational fusion compared to the transcriptional fusion. The expression levels of these different constructs relative to the WT are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> for the two synonymous mutations (A15A, G38G) and a third, independently evolved non-synonymous mutation (A10T) recovered from the original experiment by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al. (2014)</xref>. Transcription is elevated in all three mutants relative to the WT but we could not detect any additional effect of translation in the two synonymous mutations, although there is a modest increase in expression associated with translation for the nonsynonymous mutation. These results suggest that these synonymous mutations primarily affect levels of transcription rather than translation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45952.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of transcriptional and translational effects of the evolved mutants and correlation with relative fitness.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The schematic shows the sites of YFP insertion for transcriptional and translational fusions.

First, there is a strong positive relationship between transcript abundance and relative fitness for 27 synonymous mutations (including the A15A and G38G mutations examined above) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.691, p=1.46×10<sup>−8</sup>). Notably, the range of the regression includes mutants with both negative and positive fitness effects, suggesting that the link between transcript abundance and fitness is not limited to beneficial synonymous mutations alone. Second, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows that the increased transcription caused by A15A, G38G, and A10T extends downstream to <italic>gtsC</italic> (p&lt;5.0×10<sup>−5</sup>) but not upstream to <italic>gtsA</italic>, which remains largely unaffected (p&gt;0.60). These synonymous mutations thus have polar effects on transcription that extend beyond the gene in which they occur. Taken together with our previous observation that overexpression of WT <italic>gtsB</italic> increases fitness only when the rest of the <italic>gts</italic> operon is also overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2014</xref>), these results suggest that co-expression of downstream genes is necessary for increased fitness in this system.</p><p>What mechanism accounts for the observed changes in transcription and fitness among the synonymous mutations? Previous work has shown that synonymous mutations can generate beneficial effects by creating novel promoters in regions upstream of a gene under selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ando et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kershner et al., 2016</xref>). At face value, this mechanism cannot explain our results since we observe a range of fitness effects for synonymous mutations along the entire length of <italic>gtsB</italic>. However, the existence of polar effects on transcription suggests that some synonymous mutations in <italic>gtsB</italic> might be playing a similar role by creating internal promoters causing changes in expression of the downstream genes <italic>gtsC</italic> or <italic>gtsD</italic>. To evaluate this idea, we used Softberry BPROM online software to search the entire <italic>gts</italic> operon for internal sigma 70 bacterial promoter sequences in the ancestral sequence and mutant sequences. We find relatively few hits in our collection, perhaps because BPROM searches for promoters using <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> rather than <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> consensus sequences; however, among the top five hits is a predicted promoter sequence spanning codons 30–42 that includes G38G and 39–3T, the latter being the synonymous mutation with highest fitness in our collection. Both mutations, and an additional beneficial synonymous mutation at 232–3T, result in predicted −10 promoter sequences that are more closely aligned to the −10 consensus sequence for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (TATAAT) than the WT. Notably, there is a tendency for promoter strength to vary positively with both transcription and fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), although this effect is based on just six mutations and is not significant (permutation of residuals, p=0.17 and 0.11, respectively). These results suggest that fitness changes associated with these synonymous mutations could be caused by the ability of transcription factors to bind to promoter-like sequences in <italic>gtsB</italic> and alter transcription of downstream genes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45952.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Potential mechanism for fitness differences at different loci in <italic>gtsB.</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bars represent the mean of each variable in units relative to the WT.

(2014)</xref>. The results are summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. As expected, we found a transcriptional start site mapping 30 base pairs upstream of the <italic>gtsA</italic> start codon, 25 base pairs downstream of the predicted −10 box. Importantly, and consistent with the hypothesis that mutations in the coding region of <italic>gtsB</italic> can improve promoter binding for the RNA polymerase complex, we mapped transcription start sites 7 and 15 base pairs downstream of the predicted −10 box of the G38G internal promoter, four base pairs downstream of the A15A mutation, and 21 base pairs downstream of the A10T mutation. These results, taken together with an additional transcriptional start site 70 nucleotides upstream of 232–3T, suggest that synonymous mutations in <italic>gtsB</italic> may be strengthening weak internal promoters that were not detected by the available online prediction software. Note that the observation of transcriptional start sites at nucleotide positions near the start of <italic>gtsB</italic> in the WT likely reflects varying degrees of promoter binding strength for the sequences in this region and so is not incompatible with our hypothesis. We also identified transcriptional start sites mapping 19 and 57 base pairs upstream of the <italic>gtsB</italic> start codon within the intergenic space following <italic>gtsA</italic>, implying that <italic>gtsB</italic> may be under independent transcriptional control from <italic>gtsA</italic>.</p><p>How often do these synonymous mutations contribute to adaptation in more natural settings beyond the highly contrived conditions we have studied here? We can get part way towards an answer by asking whether fitness in vitro predicts prevalence of a mutation across a phylogeny of pseudomonads. We generated a phylogeny of 77 strains closely related to SBW25 and converted the probability of observing a given mutation to a binary variable based on its presence or absence in the phylogeny while accounting for evolutionary relatedness. For our entire synonymous and nonsynonymous sample, we find a positive relationship between the presence of a particular mutation in the phylogeny and its fitness in glucose-limited medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, p=0.0210). Notably, our highest fitness mutation, 39–3T, which is synonymous, arises independently multiple times across the phylogeny, even when common ancestry is taken into consideration. These results lend support to the idea that the variation in fitness effects observed here are not an idiosyncratic result of life in a laboratory environment. Rather, the synonymous mutations conferring the highest fitness effects may often contribute to adaptation in more complex, and more natural, environments as well.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45952.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Beneficial synonymous mutations (red) are often observed in the phylogeny of related Pseudomonads, while nonsynonymous mutations are less so (blue).</title><p>There was a significant logarithmic relationship between the probability of observing a given mutation as a binary variable (present/absent) and relative fitness (p=0.0121).</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig4scode1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45952.018</object-id><label>Figure 4—source code 1.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic analysis.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="octet-stream" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-45952-fig4-code1-v2.r"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45952-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, the assumption that synonymous mutations are neutral remains deeply embedded in genetics. One need only look as far as the growing number of fitness landscape studies focusing on amino acid replacements which, by definition, involve only nonsynonymous substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bank et al., 2016</xref>), the exception being a recent study in yeast showing that most synonymous mutations have small or negligible effects on fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fragata et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, our work shows that the DFE among synonymous mutations in <italic>gtsB</italic>, at least, can be highly variable and include both deleterious and beneficial mutations. In fact, aside from the absence of strongly deleterious mutations associated with premature stop codons, the DFE of synonymous mutations in this gene is strikingly similar to that of nonsynonymous mutations and is formally indistinguishable from it if we consider only beneficial mutations. Taken together with the observation of a positive correlation between in vitro estimates of fitness of a given mutation, its prevalence among sequenced isolates, and previous evidence of adaptation via beneficial synonymous mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2014</xref>), these results suggest that synonymous mutations in this gene can, and sometimes do, contribute to adaptation.</p><p>The cause of the fitness variation among synonymous mutations observed here stems from changes to transcription that impact downstream genes in the same operon. Whether these transcriptional effects occur by changing an internal promoter sequence, as our data suggests, or through some other, still undiscovered mechanisms, remains to be elucidated. It is notable that promoter-associated effects on transcription have been shown to underlie the fitness effects of synonymous mutations in two other microbial systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ando et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kershner et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting this mechanism may be quite general, at least for organisms with operon-like genetic architectures. Nevertheless, others have pointed to changes in translational efficiency associated with the accessibility of mRNA near a start codon as the primary mediator of fitness in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kristofich et al., 2018</xref>) and synonymous mutations are known to impact fitness in a wide range of organisms beyond prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lawrie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuevas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kashiwagi et al., 2014</xref>).

A 2.6 kb PCR product was amplified from genomic template DNA containing the target locus, and included the 346 bp promoter region of <italic>gtsA</italic>, the open reading frame of <italic>gtsA</italic> and the open reading frame of <italic>gtsB</italic>. This PCR product and the downstream YFP fusion PCR product were seamlessly ligated together into a derivative of the Tn7 vector pUC18T-mini-Tn7T-Gm through GGA.</p><p>The YFP transcriptional fusion after <italic>gtsB</italic> required additional modifications due to the eight nucleotide overlap between the stop codon of <italic>gtsB</italic> and start codon of <italic>gtsC</italic>. To preserve the <italic>gtsB</italic> sequence and predicted <italic>gtsC</italic> ribosomal binding site, the start codon of the YFP transcriptional fusion was inserted in-frame after the first four codons <italic>gtsC</italic>. Translational YFP fusions had a 6-glycine ((GGC)6) linker sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) between the second-last codon (302) of <italic>gtsB</italic> and the second codon of YFP, which removed both the stop codon of <italic>gtsB</italic> and start codon of YFP to create a single peptide. The 3’ UTR of both the transcriptional and translational YFP fusions includes an intrinsic transcriptional terminator. Tn7 vectors were transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α λpir following the Inoue method, then incorporated into SBW25 and verified as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al. (2014)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>YFP transcriptional fusions at the native <italic>gts</italic> operon</title><p>YFP transcriptional fusions across the <italic>gts</italic> operon were constructed using an allelic replacement strategy similar to the site-directed mutagenesis method described above. YFP sequences were PCR amplified from a YFP storage vector, and sequences upstream and downstream of the desired YFP insertion locus were amplified from SBW25 template DNA as two PCR products ranging from 400 to 900 base pairs in length. Upstream PCR products included predicted native ribosomal binding sites to enable YFP translation. Forward and reverse primers for all PCR products were engineered with BsaI recognition sites to allow for 4-part seamless ligation by GGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Engler et al., 2008</xref>) of the YFP PCR product and upstream and downstream flanking PCR products to an GGA allelic replacement vector derived from pAH79 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2014</xref>). YFP fusions were transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α λpir and recombined into <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 by two-step allelic replacement as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2014</xref>). Fusion junctions and <italic>gtsB</italic> mutations were confirmed through diagnostic PCR and Sanger sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Glucose induction assays</title><p>Cultures were inoculated from individual colonies (biological replicate) and grown shaking at 28°C in 200 μL minimal (M9) media supplemented with 25.6 mM of succinate as the sole carbon source. After 24 hr of growth, 20 µL of culture was transferred to 180 µL of minimal (M9) media supplemented with 212 μM glucose in a transparent 96 well plate. The 96 well plate was incubated for 10 hr static at 28°C in a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro fluorescent plate reader where optical density (OD) and fluorescence measurements were taken every 10 min. OD was measure by absorbance at 595 nm wavelength and fluorescence was measured with 500 nm excitation and 535 nm emission wavelengths. The maximum fluorescence was calculated as the maximum YFP signal (~7 hr), subtracted by the background fluorescence of unmarked SBW25 and then standardised by dividing by the blank corrected OD. Maximum fluorescence values were then divided by the ancestral SBW25 values to determine relative effect sizes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RNA isolation and identification of transcriptional start sites</title><p>Isolated colonies were cultured in 1.7 mL of M9 media supplemented with 25.6 mM succinate and incubated overnight at 28°C shaking. Vials with 7.2 mL of M9 media supplemented with 212 μM glucose were inoculated with 800 μL of culture and incubated at 28°C shaking. OD<sub>600</sub> was measured every 15 min and cells were harvested at mid-log phase (2 hr) by centrifugation at 6770 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. Pellets were resuspended in 500 μL M9 media and treated with RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen). RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) with additional DNase treatment with RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen). RNA concentration was quantified using NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). cDNA synthesis, cDNA purification and poly(A) tailing were completed using 5’/3’ Random Amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) kit, 2nd generation (Roche) and Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). First strand <italic>gts</italic> operon cDNA was generated using primer SP1 and cDNA was amplified using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). First and second rounds of amplification of dA-tailed cDNA used primers B-SP2 and B-SP3 for <italic>gtsB</italic> an A-SP2 and A-SP3 for <italic>gtsA</italic> respectively (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for primer sequences). 2nd round amplification products were run on 2% agarose gel and expected bands (150–400 base pairs) were excised and purified using Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). DNA fragments were digested with SalI-HF and XbaI and cloned into a pUC19 vector using T4 DNA Ligase (NEB). Inserted DNA fragments were sequenced using Sanger sequencing to identify possible transcriptional start sites in <italic>gtsA</italic> and <italic>gtsB</italic>. Sequences were aligned to the <italic>gts</italic> operon using CodonCode Aligner.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Phylogeny construction</title><p>A phylogeny was constructed using full DNA sequences of <italic>rpoB</italic>, <italic>rpoD</italic>, and <italic>gyrB</italic> for 77 closely related Pseudomonas strains obtained from NCBI, as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gomila et al.

MEGA7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>) was used to build the tree based on the aligned concatenated sequences using maximum likelihood to generate a bootstrapped consensus tree (<italic>n</italic> = 500). For each site in the <italic>gtsB</italic> alignment, maximum parsimony was used to estimate the ancestral state at all internal nodes in the phylogeny with the function ‘ancestral.pars’ from the phangorn package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schliep, 2011</xref>). As our phylogeny had polytomies, the ancestral states were estimated for 100 randomly resolved bifurcating phylogenies and the frequency of the inferred ancestral state at each internal node was calculated. For each site in <italic>gtsB</italic>, the number of evolutionary events was calculated by comparing the inferred state at the beginning and end of each branch and counting the number of transitions. A binary model was fit expressing whether mutations of interest were observed in the phylogeny.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thanks to N Rodrigue, A Schick, and A Wong for feedback and discussion.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sandeep Venkataram (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a very interesting paper and a potentially important contribution to the field of evolution. The study provides a significant contribution to our knowledge of the fitness effects of synonymous variants and uncovers possible mechanisms of action of adaptive synonymous mutations. The reviewer's comments are summarized here.</p><p>1) As the authors state, the fitness changes associated with synonymous mutations could be caused by TF binding capacity. The sign of the changes on Figure 3 are correlated but not so much the magnitude. It would have been useful to also have additional experiments or analyses strengthening the results, for instance the introduction of other mutations that would be predicted from promoter sequences to increase and decrease binding and see how it affects fitness. An examination of the data suggests that most of the correlation between TATA box strength and YFP expression seems to be driven by 39-3T and 38-3G, which have the largest mismatches between expression and TATA box strength. Also, it is not clear if all the mutations considered are synonymous since 39-2T maybe a non-synonymous one (Tyr -&gt; Phe, correct?).

CAI is that it is a metric that looks for gene-level codon usage differences by comparing the distribution of codons used within the gene to a reference set.

The lack of association is therefore not surprising. As an alternative method for testing for codon usage adaptation, the authors could quantify the difference in ancestral and mutant codon usage for the specific mutated codon and compare that difference to the fitness benefit shown by that isolate. If adaptation is driven by codon usage, one would expect a significant positive correlation between the gain in codon preference at the mutated site and fitness. The use of this or any similar metric that specifically focuses on the mutated codons would substantially improve the work.

The study provides a significant contribution to our knowledge of the fitness effects of synonymous variants and uncovers possible mechanisms of action of adaptive synonymous mutations. The reviewer's comments are summarized here.</p><p>1) As the authors state, the fitness changes associated with synonymous mutations could be caused by TF binding capacity. The sign of the changes on Figure 3 are correlated but not so much the magnitude. It would have been useful to also have additional experiments or analyses strengthening the results, for instance the introduction of other mutations that would be predicted from promoter sequences to increase and decrease binding and see how it affects fitness. An examination of the data suggests that most of the correlation between TATA box strength and YFP expression seems to be driven by 39-3T and 38-3G, which have the largest mismatches between expression and TATA box strength. Also, it is not clear if all the mutations considered are synonymous since 39-2T maybe a non-synonymous one (Tyr -&gt; Phe, correct?). Therefore, the causal link between synonymous mutations, expression levels and fitness remains to be completely shown and most importantly the link with the creation of a novel promoter element. This is critical for the study as the mechanism linking synonymous mutations to fitness is one of the most striking findings of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the results of the in silico analysis are consistent with the novel promoter mechanism but perhaps not as compelling as we would like. We therefore considered a range of options to obtain a more direct test of this hypothesis (which, by the way, is not restricted to synonymous mutations because nonsynonymous mutations can also change promoter binding sequences) including 5’RACE, RNA seq and genetic approaches. We settled on 5’RACE because it is a well-established tool for identifying transcription start sites and so would allow us to assess directly the link between <italic>gtsB</italic> mutations and transcription initiation. An RNA seq experiment was not feasible within the timeframe and resources available to us, not only because of the additional effort involved in carrying out the experiment and obtaining sequencing but also because we would need to spend substantial time on optimization, as the low glucose concentrations in our experiment demand we pool replicate cultures to obtain sufficient RNA for sequencing (this was also the reason that we reverted to the YFP-fusion approach to estimate transcriptional and translational effects of our mutations), and introducing an additional source of error.</p><p>The 5’RACE work focuses on the WT and four mutant genotypes, three with synonymous and one with a nonsynonymous mutation. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find transcriptional start sites just downstream of A10T, A15A, and G38G and just upstream of 232-3T. The WT shows transcriptional start sites towards the start of the gene as well (though not at the same nt positions as any of the mutants), a result that likely reflects the fact that the sequences in this region have varying degrees of promoter binding strength. 5’RACE is good at identifying transcription initiation sites but does not provide any measure of promoter binding strength. The observation of transcript initiation in both the WT and the mutants is therefore not evidence against our hypothesis. Interestingly, this analysis revealed additional transcriptional start sites in the intergenic region between <italic>gtsA</italic> and <italic>gtsB</italic>, suggesting <italic>gtsB</italic> may be under separate transcriptional control from <italic>gtsA</italic>. Moreover, the spectrum of transcriptional start sites along the entire length of <italic>gtsB</italic> associated with the 232-3T mutation underscores the limitations of the <italic>in silico</italic> analysis; there is clearly much that is being missed with this approach (see response to point 2 below).</p><p>Taken together, the results of the 5’RACE experiments provide additional, experimental support for our hypothesis. We acknowledge that a more comprehensive test will require further work, including both RNA seq and genetic approaches, to unpack in more detail the architecture of the operon. This extra work is beyond the scope of the present manuscript, however, given that our work provides insights extending across a wide range of biological organization, from the molecular causes of fitness variation among synonymous mutations though to the prevalence of these mutations among natural isolates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another important aspect could be to try to see how frequent such synonymous mutations with strong impact could be across the genome, i.e. how easy it would be in general to create transcription factor binding sites in coding sequences. This could help generalize the results.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting suggestion but, we feel, beyond the scope of this paper for two reasons. The first is that, as our 5’RACE results underscore, the promoter sequences identified by current in silico approaches are not necessarily those that <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> uses. Without a better understanding of what the consensus sequence is for this strain, we would have little confidence in our results. The second, and related to the first, is that identifying these sequences and doing the analysis is a project unto itself. An alternative approach, which we are pursuing, is to extend the phylogenetic analysis reported in our paper to entire genomes. This requires very large sample sizes (hundreds of strains at least) and significant computational resources. Please stay tuned for the results in the next year or so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Abstract states: &quot;We used site-directed mutagenesis coupled with direct measures of competitive fitness to estimate the distribution of fitness effects among synonymous mutations for a gene under selection.&quot; However, the authors have prior information that the gene they have chosen to characterize can adapt via synonymous mutations from their prior work, making it unclear if the measured distribution is truly representative of &quot;the&quot; synonymous DFE.

At minimum, the wording should be changed throughout the paper and this aspect discussed in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for flagging this for us. We certainly did not intend to give the impression that our work represents ‘the’ DFE for all synonymous mutations. Rather, as the reviewers point out, we focus on the DFE among synonymous mutations in this one gene in particular, where we have prior evidence that adaptation can occur through synonymous mutations. We have revised the manuscript to make it clearer that the DFE we are estimating is for this gene only. Specifically, we have made the following changes:</p><p>The sentence in the Abstract now reads, “We used site-directed mutagenesis coupled with direct measures of competitive fitness to estimate the distribution of fitness effects among synonymous mutations in a gene under directional selection and capable of adapting via synonymous nucleotide changes.”</p><p>We have modified our main concluding sentence to read, “We have shown that, contrary to what has often been assumed, the DFE among synonymous mutations, in <italic>gtsB</italic> at least, can be highly variable and include both deleterious and beneficial mutations.”</p><p>The concluding sentence of the same paragraph now reads, “Taken together with the observation of a positive correlation between in vitro estimates of fitness of a given mutation, its prevalence among sequenced isolates, and previous evidence of adaptation via beneficial synonymous mutations, these results suggest that synonymous mutations in this gene can, and sometimes do, contribute to adaptation.”</p><p>Finally, there is little more we can say about the generality of this result beyond what we have already said in the closing paragraph. We therefore do not feel we can add anything further to this discussion at this time. Broader statements will require more studies examining the DFE among synonymous mutations in a range of genes, genetic architectures, and organisms. We hope our paper will spur others to take on these kinds of studies and confront our long-standing assumptions about the genetic code with more data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Another concern related to 3) about the manuscript is that some statements are too strong, for instance in the first paragraph of the Discussion it says that DFE among synonymous mutations can be highly variable contrary to what has often been assumed. Is it still the case in the community? It would be important to substantiate this with references showing that it is still the case.</p></disp-quote><p>The assumption that synonymous mutations are neutral does persist in the community. One needs only to look to the growing number of fitness landscape studies that focus on amino acid replacements, rather than nucleotide substitutions, as evidence. We have cited two recent examples from this literature to support this statement and, additionally, make reference to a third that took a fitness landscape approach at the nucleotide level. Our penultimate paragraph now begins with, “Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, the assumption that synonymous mutations are neutral remains deeply embedded in genetics. One need only look as far as the growing number of fitness landscape studies that focus on amino acid replacements which, by definition, involve nonsynonymous substitutions, the exception being a recent study in yeast showing that most synonymous mutations have small or negligible effects on fitness.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Regarding the use of the codon adaptation index (CAI) as a metric of adaptation for codon usage. CAI is that it is a metric that looks for gene-level codon usage differences by comparing the distribution of codons used within the gene to a reference set. As the gene used in the study consists of ~300 codons, changing a single codon through a point mutation is highly unlikely to ever result in a significant change in CAI as it has little impact on the total codon distribution of the gene. The lack of association is therefore not surprising. As an alternative method for testing for codon usage adaptation, the authors could quantify the difference in ancestral and mutant codon usage for the specific mutated codon and compare that difference to the fitness benefit shown by that isolate. If adaptation is driven by codon usage, one would expect a significant positive correlation between the gain in codon preference at the mutated site and fitness. The use of this or any similar metric that specifically focuses on the mutated codons would substantially improve the work. Note that these additional experiments would strengthen the paper but are not required. Nevertheless, the limitation of the CAI metric used should be taken into account.</p></disp-quote><p>It is not entirely clear to us what test the reviewers are suggesting we do here because, as they point out, the change in CAI for any given nucleotide mutation is extremely modest. Perhaps we were unclear in what we wrote. We have revised our wording to reflect that the test of the codon adaptation hypothesis examines the change in CAI as a result of the mutation introduced at that codon, relative to the CAI of the WT, against the fitness difference between the mutant and WT estimated experimentally. We find no relationship, perhaps not surprisingly. We also added a statement that underscores the modest changes in CAI expected, in line with the reviewers’ comments. The new text now reads: “We could find no evidence for either explanation in our sample: a regression of fitness on distance from the start codon of <italic>gtsB</italic> was not statistically significant (permutation of residuals, P = 0.20), nor was there a significant relationship between change in fitness and change in codon adaptation index (CAI; P = 0. 40) or tRNA adaptation index (tAI; P = 0.53), both measures of the degree of codon usage bias. This is perhaps unsurprising given that CAI is a gene-level codon usage metric, and a change in a single codon is unlikely to have a large effect on the overall CAI value for either the whole gene or a portion thereof.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) One piece of information that may not have been taken full advantage of is the difference between the number of sites targeted for mutagenesis (112) and the number recovered (34). Assuming that the authors sampled a large number of clones from the transformed library (say 1000+), the loss of sites from the sampled mutants means that mutation at these sites is lethal. This could add significant new information into the deleterious region of the DFE. If a saturating number of clones was not sampled, it should be made clear in the Materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Respectfully, we think the reviewers are confusing the number of sites with the number of mutations. We recovered 110 point mutants from the 112 sites targeted for mutagenesis. The loss of strains is normal with regards to the protocol's inherent failure rate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The phylogenetic analyses showing that the 38-3T has arisen independently should be detailed because the correlation shown relies on the fact that these mutations are independent. If the points shown on Figure 4 are not independent, i.e. some strains share the mutations because of common ancestry and not because it was acquired, the correlation could derive from other factors also correlated with this ancestry.</p></disp-quote><p>This is, in fact, precisely what we did, as explained in the following text: “For each site in <italic>gtsB</italic>, the number of evolutionary events was calculated by comparing the inferred state at the beginning and end of each branch and counting the number of transitions.” To improve clarity, we have added, &quot;… our highest fitness mutation, 39-3T, which is synonymous, arises independently multiple times across the phylogeny, even when common ancestry is taken into consideration.&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
