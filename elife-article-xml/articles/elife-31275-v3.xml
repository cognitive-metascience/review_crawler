However, less is known about the upstream regulators of the RPs. Here, we identify SPIN1 (Spindlin 1) as a novel binding partner of human RPL5/uL18 that is important for this pathway. SPIN1 ablation activates p53, suppresses cell growth, reduces clonogenic ability, and induces apoptosis of human cancer cells. Mechanistically, SPIN1 sequesters uL18 in the nucleolus, preventing it from interacting with MDM2, and thereby alleviating uL18-mediated inhibition of MDM2 ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53. SPIN1 deficiency increases ribosome-free uL18 and uL5 (human RPL11), which are required for SPIN1 depletion-induced p53 activation. Analysis of cancer genomic databases suggests that SPIN1 is highly expressed in several human cancers, and its overexpression is positively correlated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. Altogether, our findings reveal that the oncogenic property of SPIN1 may be attributed to its negative regulation of uL18, leading to p53 inactivation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SPIN1</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>MDM2</kwd><kwd>RPL5/uL18</kwd><kwd>tumorigenesis</kwd><kwd>cancer cell survival</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2G12MD007595</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Kun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA095441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zeng</surname><given-names>Shelya X</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA172468</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name><name><surname>Zeng</surname><given-names>Shelya X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA127724</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name><name><surname>Zeng</surname><given-names>Shelya X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21CA190775</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name><name><surname>Zeng</surname><given-names>Shelya X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 CA201889</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name><name><surname>Zeng</surname><given-names>Shelya X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SPIN1, a nucleolar protein, plays an oncogenic role by suppressing the tumor suppressor p53's function via regulation of the uL18-MDM2-p53 pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The well-documented tumor suppressor p53, referred as ‘the guardian of the genome’, is activated upon exposure to a myriad of cellular stresses. While loss of wild-type p53 causes fatal damages to the genome, it is not surprising that the <italic>TP53</italic> gene is mutated in more than 50% human cancers, and the functions of p53 are often impeded through various mechanisms in the remainder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levine and Oren, 2009</xref>). One predominant negative regulator of p53 is the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, an oncoprotein that conceals the N-terminal transcriptional activation (TA) domain of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oliner et al., 1993</xref>) and deactivates this protein by either abrogating its transcriptional activity, or inducing its nuclear export and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oliner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haupt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubbutat et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fuchs et al., 1998</xref>). A plethora of cellular stress could stabilize p53 by blocking the MDM2-p53 feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). For example, p19<sup>ARF</sup> inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and proteolysis by associating with MDM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Another pathway is the so-called ribosomal proteins (RPs)-MDM2-p53 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang and Lu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Warner and McIntosh, 2009</xref>). Accumulating evidence has continuingly verified this pathway as an emerging mechanism for boosting p53 activation in response to ribosomal stress or nucleolar stress over the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2014</xref>). Ribosomal stress is often triggered by aberrant ribosome biogenesis caused by nutrient deprivation, inhibition of rRNA synthesis, or malfunction of ribosomal proteins and/or nucleolar proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang and Lu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Warner and McIntosh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fumagalli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhat et al., 2004</xref>). Earlier studies showed that disruption of ribosomal biogenesis induces translocation of a series of ribosomal proteins, including uL18 (human RPL5), uL5 (human RPL11), uL14 (human RPL23), eS7 (human S7) and uS11 (human S14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ban et al., 2014</xref>), from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm and bind to MDM2, blocking its ability to ubiquitinate p53 and consequently stabilizing p53 to maintain cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lohrum et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai and Lu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin et al., 2004</xref>). Although there are a few proteins that have been identified to regulate this RPs-MDM2-p53 pathway, such as PICT-1 inhibition of uL5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Uchi et al., 2013</xref>) and SRSF1 activation of uL18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fregoso et al., 2013</xref>), it still remains to be determined if there are more proteins that can regulate the RPs-MDM2-p53 pathway. In this present study, we identified SPIN1 as a new uL18 inhibitory regulator.</p><p>SPIN1, a new member of the SPIN/SSTY family, was originally identified as a highly expressed protein in ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yue et al., 2004</xref>). The oncogenic potential of SPIN1 was later supported by the observation that overexpression of SPIN1 increases transformation and tumor growth ability of NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2005</xref>). Signaling pathways responsible for SPIN1 functions include PI3K/Akt, Wnt and RET that are highly relevant to tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franz et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, SPIN1 acts as a reader of histone H3K4me3 and stimulates the transcription of ribosomal RNA-encoding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bae et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Su et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting its role in rRNA synthesis.</p><p>In screening uL18-associated protein complexes using co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, we identified SPIN1 as one of the potential uL18 binding proteins. We confirmed the specific interaction of SPIN1 with uL18, but not with uL5 or uL14, and found out that by binding to uL18, SPIN1 prevents the inhibition of MDM2 by uL18 and promotes MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Also, SPIN1 knockdown induced ribosomal stress by facilitating the release of ribosome-free uL18 or uL5, accompanying p53 activation. Furthermore, SPIN1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a predominantly p53-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo, consequently suppressing tumor growth in a xenograft model. Therefore, these results for the first time demonstrate that SPIN1 can regulate the RP-MDM2-p53 pathway by directly interacting with uL18, and suggest SPIN1 as a potential molecule target in this pathway for developing anticancer therapy in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SPIN1 interacts with uL18</title><p>Our and others’ studies previously demonstrated that uL18 can stabilize p53 by binding to MDM2 and inhibiting its E3 ligase activity toward p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai and Lu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bursać et al., 2012</xref>).

In line with the tumor growth curve, the reduction of tumor mass and weight by SPIN1 knockdown was more profound in HCT116<sup>p53+/+</sup> groups (~60% reduction in weight) than that in HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup> groups (~30% reduction in weight) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).

Therefore, we further searched some available genomic and gene expression database for SPIN1 expression in cancers. Interestingly, our analysis of TCGA genome database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cerami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2013</xref>) indicated that the SPIN1 gene is markedly amplified in a panel of cancers, including prostate, sarcoma, lung, stomach, breast, head and neck, pancreas and colorectal cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Consistent with this observation, the analysis of Oncomine database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rhodes et al., 2007</xref>) also showed that SPIN1 mRNA expression is extensively upregulated in melanoma tissues when compared with normal skin tissues (~2.367 folds upregulation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Moreover, using databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cerami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mizuno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">SzaszSzász et al., 2016</xref>) that contain gene expression profiles of clinical cancer samples combined with patient outcomes, we found that overexpression of SPIN1 is correlated with poorer prognosis in patients with breast cancer, colorectal cancer and gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C–F</xref>). Elevated protein expression was also observed in a panel of human colon tumor samples compared with normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). These data further support that SPIN1 may play an oncogenic role in human cancer progression.</p><p>Based on these data and the aforementioned results, we proposed a model for the role of SPIN1 in regulation of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Under the condition of low SPIN1 level, nucleolar uL18 escapes from the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm, and works together with uL5 to bind MDM2 and to inhibit its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53, consequently leading to p53 activation and p53-dependent cell growth arrest and apoptosis, suppressing cancer cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). But when SPIN1 levels are high or abnormally elevated in cancer cells, SPIN1 retains uL18 in the nucleolus, thereby preventing uL18 from suppression of MDM2 activity and resulting in p53 degradation, favoring tumor cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This conjecture is further supported by the aforementioned xenograft experiment.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31275.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model for SPIN1 regulation of the uL18-MDM2-p53 pathway in cancer.(see text in the Discussion for details).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31275-fig7-v3"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The tumor suppressor p53 provides a critical brake on cancer development in response to ribosomal stress, as impairing this ribosomal stress-uL18/uL5-p53 pathway could accelerate tumorigenesis in c-Myc transgenic lymphoma mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Macias et al., 2010</xref>). However, it remains largely elusive whether this pathway is subjected to the regulation by other yet unknown proteins. In our attempt to understand molecular insights into this possible regulation, we identified SPIN1, the nucleolar protein important for rRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), as a novel regulator of the uL18-MDM2-p53 pathway through interplay with uL18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our studies as presented here provide the first line of evidence for that SPIN1 acts as an upstream regulator of uL18’s accessibility to MDM2 for p53 activation.</p><p>Using IP-MS analysis, we identified SPIN1 as a new uL18-associated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our biochemical and cellular experiments using co-IP and GST pull down assays further validated the direct association of SPIN1 with uL18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Moreover, we found that SPIN1 and uL18 co-localized in the nucleolus by immunofluorescence assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Remarkably, SPIN1 specifically binds to uL18, but not uL5 and uL14, as no binding was detected between ectopic SPIN1 and uL5 or uL14 by co-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, SPIN1 does not appear to bind to MDM2, as it was not co-immunoprecipitated with MDM2 either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Although our previous reports described a complex of uL18/uL5/uL14-MDM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dai et al., 2004</xref>), our present findings indicate that SPIN1 may work with uL18 in a separate complex that is different from reported RPs-MDM2 complexes. Also our results suggest that SPIN1 may retain uL18 in the nucleolus so that the latter is unable to shuttle to the nucleoplasm and to inhibit MDM2 activity toward p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>SPIN1 expression in cells is tightly controlled, as several studies have shown that SPIN1 expression could be negatively monitored by some tumor suppressive non-coding RNAs, such as miR-489 and miR-219–5p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drago-Ferrante et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, elevated expression of SPIN1 was strongly correlated with advanced histological stage, chemoresistance and metastasis in patients with breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with the aforementioned oncogenic role of SPIN1, our study as presented here showed that SPIN1 depletion by its specific shRNA leads to the augment of the p53-dependent cancer cell growth arrest and apoptosis. This is at least partly because SPIN1 can promote MDM2-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which is highly likely attributable to its capability to prevent uL18 from binding to MDM2 through retaining uL18 in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Also, knockdown of SPIN1 led to the increase of ribosome-free uL18 and uL5 levels, of the uL18/uL5-MDM2 complex, and of p53 level and activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). The activation of p53 by knocking down SPIN1 is due to the ribosomal stress caused by the depletion of this nucleolar protein, as SPIN1 is required for rRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Also, consistent with these observations, overexpression of SPIN1 reduced the activation of p53 by Actinomycin D treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), whereas knockdown of uL18 or of uL5 impaired the activation of p53 by SPIN1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Several genes have been implicated to modulate the RPs-MDM2-p53 pathway through interplay with ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Uchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kayama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Havel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, SRSF1 was identified as a component of the RP-MDM2-p53 complex, and could stabilize p53 via uL18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fregoso et al., 2013</xref>). Different from their studies, SPIN1 specifically forms an independent complex with uL18, but not MDM2 or other ribosomal proteins, such as uL5 or uL14, and acts as a negative regulator of p53. Therefore, our present findings unveil a novel mechanism for suppression of the uL18-MDM2-p53 pathway by SPIN1, whose depletion consequently leads to p53-dependent cell growth inhibition and apoptosis.</p><p>Consistent with its oncogenic activity, SPIN1 is often amplified in a panel of cancer types with less or no p53 mutation based on our analysis of human samples available in TCGA database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). In addition, elevated SPIN1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in breast, colorectal and gastric cancer patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C–F</xref>). Western blot analysis of a panel of human colon cancer samples revealed that SPIN1 is expressed at significantly higher levels in tumors than in normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). These findings further indicate that SPIN1 acts as a potential oncogene. In line with these observations, we found that overexpression of SPIN1 promotes cancer cell survival, while knockdown of SPIN1 leads to cancer cell death as well as the suppression of cancer cell growth and colony formation predominantly in wild-type p53-containing cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Remarkably, knockdown of SPIN1 inhibited xenograft tumorigenesis derived from human colon cancer cells, which was much more significantly in HCT116<sup>p53+/+</sup> cells than in HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Consistently, bio-informatic analysis on gene expression data of 644 colorectal tumors downloaded from Genomic Data Commons (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/</ext-link>) showed that SPIN1 gene expression was correlated with genes (22 genes) enriched in p53 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results demonstrate that SPIN1 can promote tumor growth and survival by inactivating p53 and its pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, we also found that SPIN1 ablation had a moderate inhibitory effect on cell growth in p53-null HCT116 cells in vitro and in vivo as mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). These findings suggest that SPIN1 must also possess p53-independent oncogenic effects, which might be explained by two possible mechanisms. First, SPIN1 has been reported to execute its oncogenic potentials by activating Wnt and PI3K/Akt pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), both of which are closely correlated with cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Polakis, 2012</xref>). Second, since our previous study has demonstrated that uL18 and uL5 could activate TAp73 through association with MDM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that the SPIN1-uL18 interaction might impose suppression on TAp73 activity as well, ultimately leading to cell growth arrest and apoptosis.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the role of SPIN1 in rRNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bae et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Su et al., 2014</xref>), which provides a clue that dysregulation of SPIN1 may perturb ribosome biogenesis. In fact, in our current study, we observed that SPIN1 depletion per se increases the levels of ribosome-free uL18 and uL5, accompanying elevated p53 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which recapitulates the effects of ribosomal stress. Our observation that p53 induction caused by SPIN1 depletion could be abrogated by knockdown of either uL18 or uL5 further supports this hypothesis. Therefore, while it is conceivable that SPIN1 counteracts p53 by blocking the interaction between uL18 and MDM2 as discussed above, the mechanism by which disruption of SPIN1 causes ribosomal stress may be also responsible for p53 activation.</p><p>In summary, our findings unveil SPIN1 as another novel and important regulator of the MDM2-p53 pathway by predominantly inhibiting the association of uL18 with MDM2 to modulate p53 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and provide more molecular insights into the fine regulation of this pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (human)</td><td>SPIN1</td><td>National Center for Biotechnology Information (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10927">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10927</ext-link>)</td><td>Gene ID: 10927;

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Previous studies from multiple laboratories including the authors' have implicated specific ribosomal proteins in the regulation of the tumor suppressor p53 via effects on its negative regulator MDM2. In particular, RPL5/uL18 has been shown to inhibit the ability of MDM2 to target p53 for degradation. In this manuscript, the authors present data to argue that SPIN1 interacts with uL18 thereby preventing its effects on MDM2. Since SPIN1 can be shown to be upregulated in a subset of human cancers, the authors conclude that SPIN1 promotes tumorigenesis via these effects. The manuscript is clearly written, the data are rigorously presented, and the conclusions are reasonable and justified. Elucidation of how the tumor suppressor p53 is regulated in response to different cellular signaling pathways is a significant area. The authors show:</p><p>1) SPIN1 knockdown stabilizes and activates p53 signaling. They also show that overexpression of SPIN1 increases MDM2-mediated degradation of p53, and thus dampens down the p53 response.</p><p>2) Mechanistically the authors find that SPIN1 regulates p53-MDM2 by sequestering uL18 in the nucleolus, so that uL18 cannot bind and inhibit MDM2; thus silencing SPIN1 leads to p53 stabilization.</p><p>3) The authors show that SPIN1 overexpression may enhance tumor growth, as in the Hct p53 WT and -/- pair, shRNA for SPIN1 impedes the growth of tumor xenografts in a partially p53-dependent manner.</p><p>Overall, the work is technically adept and done in multiple cell lines. The data presented are of high quality and support the conclusions of the manuscript. Finally, the manuscript is well written and will be of interest to the p53 and ribosome stress fields, provided the following issues are adequately addressed.</p><p>Essential issues to address:</p><p>1) In this reviewer’s opinion, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> add significantly to the interesting nature of the manuscript, and this figure should be in the main figures of the paper. In the end, however, we must be cautious about RNA overexpression data, such as from TCGA and other databases. The manuscript would be improved if the authors were to validate the overexertion of SPIN1 in tumors by tumor micro-array of one of the selected tumor types, to show that SPIN1 is indeed overexpressed at the protein level in one of these tumor types. The authors could then use this opportunity, if they chose, to see whether SPIN1 level correlated with tumor grade.</p><p>2) In the end, although the authors show that overexpressed SPIN1 can dampen down the p53 pathway, the authors themselves show that silencing SPIN1 also reduces tumor growth in a p53-independent manner. The authors mention that SPIN1 can also impact the Wnt and AKT pathways. So the reader is left wondering about the relevance of the p53, versus these other pathways, with regard to the selection for SPIN1 overexpression that occurs in human cancer. To address this issue of relevance, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> support the following, testable hypothesis: the overexpression of SPIN1 should correlate with decreased expression of p53 pathway genes (if this is indeed the reason tumors overexpress this protein). A bio-informatic analysis of p53 pathway genes, versus Wnt-pathway associated genes, in colorectal or gastric tumors (or whatever tumor type the authors prefer) with high versus low SPIN1 would add significantly to the take home message of this manuscript, and might even shed light as to which pathway tumors are selecting for, when they amplify or overexpress SPIN1. This would also alleviate one of the weaknesses of the manuscript, as it would highlight the consequences of SPIN1 overexpression in cancer. A good bio-informaticist could do these studies in a relatively short amount of time, and these findings would markedly strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>3) The authors present extensive data to support the notion of an interaction between SPIN1 and uL18. Additionally, they show evidence that suggests that SPIN1 can regulate ribosome integrity, and thus SPIN1 could thereby influence p53 activity via this distinct mechanism. This latter notion is underdeveloped in the manuscript. Along these lines, it is unclear what is the relative contributions of each of these mechanisms to the regulation of the p53-MDM2 interplay. This premise should be clarified with additional experimental evidence. For example, the authors could determine whether SPIN1 mutants that lose binding to uL18 still have effects on rRNA levels. This would confirm that the effect of SPIN1 on p53 and the ribosomal checkpoint are distinct. Or the authors could use the binding mutants identified in biological assays toward this question.</p><p>4) With regard to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>: To support the authors' hypothesis, it would be important to show here that ectopic SPIN1-mediated p53 ubiquitination is blocked by knocking down uL18. (This experiment was done in the absence of proteasome inhibitor MG132. Can the authors comment as to why p53 levels are not increasingly diminished?)</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>: ectopic SPIN1 only modestly – not 'markedly' – reduces the ectopic uL18-mediated p53 protein and MDM2 gene induction.

We performed bio-informatic analysis (details in revised manuscript) on the gene expression data of 644 colorectal cancer tumors downloaded from Genomic Data Commons (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and found that SPIN1 gene expression was correlated with genes enriched in p53 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, no significant correlation between SPIN1 and WNT signaling pathway was observed (data not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors present extensive data to support the notion of an interaction between SPIN1 and uL18.

We generated Tudor 2 domain deletion mutation construct of SPIN1 (dT2), which loses binding to uL18 as shown in our manuscript. This mutant failed to suppress p53. However, this mutant also failed to regulate rRNA expression as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, as Y170, F141 and Y177, the most critical amino acids for interaction with trimethylated K4 are all located in the Tudor 2 domain (AA132-193) (Su et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2011). Therefore, alternatively, we tested the effect of SPIN1-Y170A mutant on p53. Interestingly, this mutant was still able to inhibit p53, suggesting that SPIN1 regulation of p53 is independent of the activity of SPIN1 in regulating rRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31275.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>SPIN1-dT2 fails to inhibit p53.</title><p>U2OS cells were transfected with wild type and Tudor 2 domain deletion mutant (FLAG-dT2) SPIN1 and cells were harvested 48 hrs after transfection for Western Blot (Left panel) and qRT-PCR (Right panel) analyses.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31275-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) With regard to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>: To support the authors' hypothesis, it would be important to show here that ectopic SPIN1-mediated p53 ubiquitination is blocked by knocking down uL18.

It is therefore less likely to observe blocked SPIN1-mediated p53 ubiquitination by knocking down uL18 according to our proposed mechanism, in which, SPIN1 binds to and sequesters uL18 in the nucleolus to prevent uL18 from binding to MDM2, resulting in similar effect on MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination to what knocking down uL18 would do.</p><p>The experiment was done in the presence of MG132 as described in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>: ectopic SPIN1 only modestly – not 'markedly' – reduces the ectopic uL18-mediated p53 protein and MDM2 gene induction.

To our anticipation, it is less likely that SRSF1 could participate in SPIN1 regulation of uL18. From the literature, SRSF1 forms a complex with uL18 and MDM2, which primarily occurs in the nucleoplasm, in response to ribosomal stress, resulting in p53 activation (Fregoso et al., 2013). By contrast, as shown in our current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), SPIN1 is a nucleolar protein that does not bind to MDM2 directly, but can sequester uL18 in the nucleolus, keeping uL18 from suppressing MDM2 and leading to p53 inhibition. It is possible that SPIN1 might reduce the interaction between of SRSF1 and uL18 since uL18 can be retained in the nucleolus by SPIN1, similar to the way SPIN1 reduces the uL18-MDM2 complex. However, addressing this issue as well as other more related issues that will be certainly brought up when we work on the functional interplay between SRSF1 and SPIN1 in the uL18-p53 pathway should be an independent research topic and would generate more substantial amounts of new data for another possible manuscript. We hope that this reviewer would agree with us and allow us to address this question in our future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>: With the exception of NEPC (what is it – Neuroendocrine prostate cancer?) tumors, the alteration frequency of SPIN1 in this large cancer panel is very low (and includes deletions) – and is likely not above the general mutational noise seen in cancers.

We agree with the reviewer that except NEPC, the overall frequency of SPIN1 copy number alteration is not high among other cancer types. However, as the reviewer mentioned in his or her point 1, the mRNA overexpression database is usually suggestive, but not conclusive. This is also evidenced by our Western blot analysis of human colon tissues (response to comment 1) that showed significantly higher levels of the SPIN1 protein in tumor samples than that in normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Further validation of SPIN1 protein expression in other cancer types would be our future study.</p><p>0In the currently available NEPC data, since the SPIN1-amplified sample size with detected mutant and wild type p53 is too small, it is difficult to make any significant conclusion. However, we will investigate this issue in the future by collaborating with Drs. David Margolin and Li Li at Oschner (as we just started to collaborate with them on this as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) and by continuing our monitoring the updated cancer genomic database.</p></body></sub-article></article>
