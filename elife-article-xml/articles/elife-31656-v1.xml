not well understood. We show here that chemical activation of NRF2 modifies circadian gene expression and rhythmicity, with phenotypes similar to genetic NRF2 activation. Loss of <italic>Nrf2</italic> function in mouse fibroblasts, hepatocytes and liver also altered circadian rhythms, suggesting that NRF2 stoichiometry and/or timing of expression are important to timekeeping in some cells. Consistent with this concept, activation of NRF2 at a circadian time corresponding to the peak generation of endogenous oxidative signals resulted in NRF2-dependent reinforcement of circadian amplitude. In hepatocytes, activated NRF2 bound specific enhancer regions of the core clock repressor gene <italic>Cry2</italic>, increased <italic>Cry2</italic> expression and repressed CLOCK/BMAL1-regulated E-box transcription. Together these data indicate that NRF2 and clock comprise an interlocking loop that integrates cellular redox signals into tissue-specific circadian timekeeping.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31656.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Like many other animals, our behavior often follows a familiar pattern each day. We tend to wake up with the morning sunlight and start by eating breakfast to satisfy our hunger. Then, at night, most of us sleep, and our bodies use chemical building blocks from the day's meals to replenish and repair our tissues. As such, its not just our behavior that shows a daily cycle. The countless chemical reactions that keep us alive, collectively referred to as our metabolism, also change over the course of each day.</p><p>Daily patterns of activity, known as circadian rhythms, can be seen even at the level of individual cells. Each cell in the body has its own molecular clock that works by rhythmically cycling the levels of different molecules. Proteins called CLOCK and BMAL1 trigger the production of proteins PER and CRY. As levels of PER and CRY rise, they interfere with CLOCK and BMAL1, essentially switching off their own production. Then, levels of PER and CRY fall and the cycle starts again. Thus, these molecules rise and fall throughout the day to drive circadian rhythms, similar to how a pendulum swings back and forth to keep a clock ticking.</p><p>Metabolism and circadian rhythms are clearly linked, but it is not well understood how this works. Now, Wible, Ramanathan et al. identify a protein called NRF2 as an important bridge between the molecular clock and metabolism. NRF2 is a activated by hydrogen peroxide, a byproduct of cell metabolism, and when activated this protein grabs hold of DNA to increase the activity of specific genes.</p><p>A combination of experiments revealed that mouse liver cells need NRF2 to maintain a normal circadian rhythm, and a closer inspection of the liver cells revealed that NRF2 specifically attaches to part of the gene for a clock protein called CRY2. This enhances the production of this protein, which in turn, switches CLOCK and BMAL1 off. In this way, NRF2 links metabolism signals to the ticking of the circadian clock.</p><p>Previous research has shown a link between shift work, which disrupt these rhythms, and metabolic diseases like obesity and diabetes. Understanding more about the underlying molecular biology that links metabolism to circadian rhythms could help scientists to find new ways to improve public health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>Nrf2</kwd><kwd>Redox</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 ES017014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sutter</surname><given-names>Thomas R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Memphis W.

Most tissues possess autonomous cellular oscillators that control rhythmic tissue-specific physiology. At the molecular level, the circadian clock is composed of a core transcription-translation feedback loop, in which transcriptional activators aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (ARNTL/BMAL1) and circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) regulate the transcription of their own repressors, period 1/2/3 (<italic>Per1/2/3</italic>) and cryptochrome 1/2 (<italic>Cry1/2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ko and Takahashi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reppert and Weaver, 2002</xref>).

In addition to the regulation of known clock genes, the CLOCK/BMAL1-complex also regulates the expression of thousands of other genes, which drive rhythmic changes in various tissue-specific physiological and cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perelis et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Many clock controlled output genes encode metabolic enzymes leading to diurnal oscillations in carbohydrate flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asher and Schibler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bass, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang and Kay, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bass and Takahashi, 2010</xref>).

The activity of NRF2 is antagonized by the cytoplasmic repressor kelch like ECH associated protein 1 (KEAP1). KEAP1 destabilizes NRF2 by facilitating its ubiquitinylation and eventual proteasomal degradation. Activators of NRF2 signaling relieve NRF2 from KEAP1-mediated repression through the oxidation or covalent modification of KEAP1 cysteine residues. Well-studied chemical NRF2 activators include the clinically relevant electrophiles 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) and 1-[2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9 (11)-dien-28-oyl]imidazole (CDDO-Im), and the oxidants <italic>tert</italic>-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Imhoff and Hansen, 2010</xref>) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Modification of KEAP1 cysteine residues by these agents results in an increased NRF2 half-life that facilitates nuclear translocation and accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wible and Sutter, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Suzuki and Yamamoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kwak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saito et al., 2016</xref>).

Chemical activation of NRF2 occurs through either electrophilic or oxidative modification of KEAP1, antagonizing its repression of NRF2. To assess the effect of each type of KEAP1 modification and subsequent NRF2 activation on the circadian rhythm, we treated Wt and <italic>Nrf2</italic>-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines harboring a Per2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter (Per2:Luc) with a single dose of 100 µM D3T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or 50 µM tBHQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Both treatments resulted in significantly reduced rhythm amplitude, an effect that was not observed in the <italic>Nrf2-/-</italic> cells. As a primary regulator of the antioxidant response pathway, it is likely that an endogenous NRF2 activating signal is H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, generated as a byproduct of metabolic flux. To evaluate the potential effect on circadian rhythmicity as a result of the activation of NRF2 by an endogenous oxidative signal, we treated MEFs at the beginning of the cycle with a low concentration (100 µM) of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similar to both D3T and tBHQ treatment, we observed significant NRF2-dependent reductions in rhythm amplitude in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>As a well-characterized, clinically relevant, NRF2-activating compound, we also evaluated the effect of CDDO-Im on circadian rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Treatment with CDDO-Im caused significant reductions in both amplitude and period length (Treatment), that were noticeably absent in <italic>Nrf2</italic>-/- MEFs. Because poor circadian oscillations in the presence of CDDO-Im may be a product of chemical toxicity, we replaced the treatment medium in cell lines of both genotypes and continued monitoring rhythmic bioluminescence patterns (Recovery). The restoration of normal circadian rhythmicity in the treated Wt cells served as a confirmation of good cell health and a dependency on CDDO-Im for the alterations in the circadian parameters observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Nrf2 is required for normal circadian timekeeping</title><p>In our earlier experiments, we observed inherently low bioluminescence rhythm amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>) in <italic>Nrf2</italic>-/- MEFs, indicating that NRF2 may be a required component of the circadian clockwork.

Expression of E- and D-box-regulated circadian genes, including <italic>Per3</italic>, <italic>Nr1d1</italic>, <italic>Nr1d2</italic>, <italic>Dbp</italic>, and <italic>Tef</italic>, were elevated via a NRF2-dependent mechanism in the liver of mice treated with D3T, indicating possible NRF2 input into multiple circadian loops. These changes in the levels of RNA paralleled significant reduction of circadian rhythm amplitude in MEFs in the presence of D3T. This effect was absent in treated <italic>Nrf2</italic>-/- cells. Oxidative activators of KEAP1/NRF2 signaling, tBHQ and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, had similar NRF2-dependent effects on rhythm amplitude. We further validated the effects on circadian rhythmicity in response to NRF2-activating chemicals using genetic activation of NRF2. Overexpression of NRF2 or deletion of its negative regulator, <italic>Keap1</italic>, phenocopied the effects of NRF2-activating chemicals on circadian function, in part through NRF2-mediated <italic>Nr1d1</italic> regulation. Together, these data support the idea that NRF2 is a critical node linking metabolism to the clock as well as a conduit for the response to changes in intracellular redox status.</p><p>As alterations in rhythm amplitude and period length are considered to be reliable indicators of clock fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Takahashi et al., 2008</xref>), an important and heretofore unreported observation of our study is the significant alteration in circadian rhythmicity in mouse fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and liver explants lacking <italic>Nrf2</italic>. Along with the effects of NRF2 gain-of-function on rhythmicity, these observations indicate that the stoichiometry and/or the timing of <italic>Nrf2</italic> expression are important for maintaining clock function. Marked circadian disruption in the absence of NRF2 supports an endogenous role for NRF2 in timekeeping in certain tissues, as these effects were observed in liver, but not in lung or SCN explants. This lack of effect in SCN explants is consistent with a previous report demonstrating that <italic>Nrf2</italic>-/- mice display Wt locomotor activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pekovic-Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>By characterizing the circadian timing of redox and NRF2 cycling, we showed that intracellular oxidation precedes NRF2 accumulation. Activation of NRF2 at a circadian time when the intracellular redox potential is decreasing leads to a NRF2-dependent enhancement of circadian amplitude, a response termed reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies have reported that both <italic>Keap1</italic> expression and GSH levels are lowered prior to the production of endogenous oxidants and the induction of <italic>Nrf2</italic> in mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). These results indicate that NRF2 expression is rapidly increasing at a time when intracellular reducing capacity is at its lowest. Decreasing intracellular redox potential promotes the accumulation of oxidants and a reduction in intracellular pH. It is therefore plausible that the simultaneous decreases in redox potential and intracellular pH lead to the oxidative modification of KEAP1 cysteine residues and the activation of NRF2. In light of these previous findings, our results showing that oxidative activation of NRF2 at this time reinforces the circadian clock to increase oscillator amplitude is consistent with tight coupling of cellular redox status, NRF2 activation, and clock function.</p><p>The NRF2-dependent reinforcement of circadian amplitude is nearly identical to that attributed to the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> NPR1 (non-expressor of pathogenesis-related gene 1), a redox-sensitive modulator of clock gene expression. When salicylic acid is produced and activates NPR1 at an appropriate time, NPR1 transcriptionally regulates gene expression in the morning and evening plant circadian loops to reinforce the circadian amplitude. In addition to reinforcing circadian amplitude, NPR1 also segregates the initiation of cellular defense and immunity pathways to the morning phase of the cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). This provides a mechanism to maximize energy expenditure during the night phase to support plant growth and overall fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nozue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dodd et al., 2005</xref>). As an analog of NPR1, NRF2 may contribute to a similar temporal segregation of energy utilization pathways in animals.</p><p>In addition to amplitude reinforcement, our data indicate that physiological levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> may cause phase-dependent circadian phase-resetting. Similar findings have been reported recently in multiple mammalian cell lines demonstrating that redox signals and the intracellular redox environment can elicit shifts in circadian phase and regulate rhythm amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Putker et al., 2018</xref>). These findings, in combination with our observations that both <italic>Cry2</italic> and <italic>Nr1d1</italic> are transcriptionally regulated by NRF2, suggest a plausible mechanism through which endogenous oxidative signals directly input into the circadian clockwork to link metabolism and timekeeping. Thus, while acute changes in redox balance may act as nonessential auxiliary timekeepers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Putker et al., 2018</xref>), proper alignment of the intracellular redox and circadian phases appears to enhance circadian function, implying the existence of a direct and reciprocal coupling between the redox state and the circadian mechanism. We believe that NRF2 is the mechanistic conduit interconnecting these two processes.</p><p>Activation of NRF2 is emerging as a key regulator of metabolism through the regulation of the PPP and by directing glutamine breakdown into glutathione biosynthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitsuishi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayes and Dinkova-Kostova, 2014</xref>). NRF2-dependent regulation of the PPP suggests that NRF2 may be a contributor in the daily transition between catabolic and anabolic metabolism. NRF2 feedback into the circadian clockwork could be an effective mechanism to facilitate this transition by integrating metabolic output and intracellular redox homeostasis into rhythmicity and carbohydrate flux. Similarities between NPR1 and NRF2 in their regulation of antioxidant response and metabolic pathways, and their common integration into the circadian function of their respective organisms, indicate that the interconnectedness of these pathways is likely a product of convergent evolution. We propose that the coordinated integration of metabolism, redox homeostasis, and the circadian clock in mammals through NRF2 is a mechanism to align energy production and utilization to the environmental light-dark cycle, as has been observed in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dodd et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Proper integration of redox signals into the clock requires the activation of NRF2 by levels of oxidants low enough to affect signaling without inducing damage. A recent study seeking to link metabolic redox oscillations to the clock through NRF2 relied on PPP inhibition to reduce NADPH production, increasing the NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rey et al., 2016</xref>). However, data from this study shows that these conditions created a persistently elevated oxidizing environment, as evidenced by the hyperoxidation of PRDX, leading to the activation of a NRF2-mediated stress response and a disruption in circadian function. Similar disruptions in clock function in response to oxidative stress were observed in the lungs of newborn mice exposed to 95% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). This hyperoxic exposure altered the timing and magnitude of E-box containing gene expression in vivo and NRF2 regulation of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> in cells. Interestingly, we observed unaltered circadian rhythmicity in lung explants from two independent strains of <italic>Nrf2</italic>-null mice, suggesting that NRF2 signaling is not required for normal circadian function in the lung. Nonetheless, the reports showing that NRF2 alters circadian <italic>Nr1d1</italic> expression and the disruption of cellular clock function by persistent oxidative activation of NRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2014</xref>) indicates that ROS-activated NRF2 signals into the clock mechanism. Thus, it appears that NRF2 and the stress-response it regulates are at the top of a molecular hierarchy whereby the resolution of oxidative stress likely takes precedence over the preservation of timekeeping. However, because the circadian clock is reset daily by environmental and systemic zetigebers, stress-induced disruption of circadian function is likely to be transient and unlikely to manifest in deleterious effects on cellular or tissue health.</p><p>In hepatocytes, where NRF2 and the clock appear to be tightly coupled, we found that activated NRF2-bound specific enhancer regions of the core clock repressor gene <italic>Cry2</italic>, increased <italic>Cry2</italic> expression, and repressed CLOCK/BMAL1-regulated E-box transcription. Moreover, activation of NRF2 in these cells also resulted in dose-dependent decreases in rhythm amplitude and period length, with associated dose-dependent increases in <italic>Cry2</italic>. Circadian amplitude and period length are largely dependent on CRY repression of CLOCK/BMAL1-mediated E-box gene transcription, placing the regulation of <italic>Cry</italic> at the heart of the clock mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kume et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reppert and Weaver, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Griffin et al., 1999</xref>). Despite its role in the clockwork, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of <italic>Cry2</italic>. Our characterization of a NRF2-binding site in the <italic>Cry2</italic> promoter, in addition to its induction, supports the idea that NRF2-dependent regulation of <italic>Cry2</italic> is a mechanism to relay timing information from the redox oscillator into the molecular clock. Interestingly, circadian regulation of metabolism also occurs via this same mechanism. Beyond being NRF2-dependent E-box repressors, both CRY2 and NR1D1 are also important regulators of nuclear hormone receptors, governing lipid, glucose, and xenobiotic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kriebs et al., 2017</xref>). Additional NRF2-dependent regulation of the production of reducing equivalents through the PPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitsuishi et al., 2012</xref>) and heme levels through heme oxygenase one expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishii et al., 2000</xref>), which serve as cofactors for CRY2 and NR1D1, respectively, further integrate metabolism and the clock mechanism and highlight the interconnectedness of these oscillators.</p><p>While the principle that metabolism regulates the clock through oscillations in the redox balance is generally accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asher and Schibler, 2011</xref>), the molecular mechanisms through which the redox state is integrated into the clockwork is just emerging. As an E-box-regulated circadian output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pekovic-Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>), the data presented here suggest that NRF2 likely represses its own transcription through the regulation of <italic>Cry2</italic> and subsequent CRY2-mediated repression of CLOCK/BMAL1, thus forming a redox-responsive transcription-translation feedback loop interlocked with the core molecular circadian mechanism. From these observations, NRF2 appears to be a key mechanistic link between circadian oscillations in redox balance and clock gene expression rhythmns. Reciprocal integration of redox potential and the clock through NRF2-dependent regulation reinforces the efficiency of both the circadian and metabolic oscillators, contributing to enhanced organismal fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Nfe2l2</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">MGI:108420</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">YWK</td><td valign="top">PMID: 8943040</td><td valign="top">Nrf2-/-; YWK Strain</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MYM</td><td valign="top">PMID: 9240432</td><td valign="top">Nrf2-/-; MYM Strain</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">PER2::LUC</td><td valign="top">PMID: 14963227</td><td valign="top">PER2::LUC</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Per2:Luc</td><td valign="top">PMID: 23052244; 24699442; 18454201; 17482552</td><td valign="top">Per2:Luc</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Wt MEF Per2:Luc</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top">Wt MEF Per2:Luc</td><td valign="top">Immortalized Wt MEF cell line stably expressing a Per2:Luc reporter.

The <italic>Nrf2</italic> PCR product was then cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO following the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, K2400). The resulting pENTR-Nrf2 vector and a pENTR-CMV promoter vector were moved into a pLV7-Puro destination vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2008</xref>) through a multisite Gateway recombination reaction to generate the pLV7-CMV-Nrf2 lentiviral expression vector. Viral particles were generated following standard protocols in 293 T cells, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tiscornia et al., 2006</xref>) with the exception that the transfection of 293T was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in place of the calcium phosphate method described. Viral titers were determined by p24 ELISA assay using the Lenti-X p24 Rapid Titer Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, 632200). Viral titers of &gt;10<sup>7</sup> were normally achieved. Cells were infected at an MOI = 3–5 and selected with 2 µg/ml puromycin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA isolation and qPCR</title><p>To isolate RNA from mouse liver approximately 500 mg of tissue was homogenized in 1 mL RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). RNA was isolated from cells by adding RNA STAT-60 directly to the cell culture plate. In both instances, RNA was extracted from the STAT-60 solution by the addition of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Extracted RNA was dissolved in water, reprecipitated using sodium acetate and isopropanol, washed with 75% ethanol, and quantified using a Nanodrop. For qPCR measurement of RNA transcripts, 1 µg of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA. 6 ng of cDNA was mixed with forward and reverse primers for the intended gene target (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) and ABsolute Blue SYBR Green qPCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Gene expression measurements were normalized to the expression of the endogenous reference gene, <italic>Gapdh</italic>, which not affected by any of the treatments or genetic manipulations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Cells grown to 100% confluence were washed with ice cold PBS and harvested by scraping in cold PBS. Cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer [25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and freshly added Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>]. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 g, 10 min, 4°C. Total protein was quantified by Micro BCA Assay (Thermo Fisher). 50 µg of total protein was resolved on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels. For all western assays, protein was transferred to PVDF membranes. Antibodies used are as follows: rabbit anti-NRF2 (Santa Cruz, SC-722; Proteintech, 16396); rabbit anti-NQO1 (Abcam, AB80588); rabbit anti-NR1D1 (Cell Signaling, 13418). Following incubation with primary antibody, blots were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room-temperature. Clarity (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) substrate was used for chemiluminescent detection using a ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Protein timecourse assays</title><p>Wt and <italic>Nrf2</italic>-/- Per2:Luc MEFs were cultured to confluence in complete growth medium. Cells were washed once with PBS and changed into serum-free growth medium containing 200 nM dexamethasone and incubated for 2 hr in a standard cell culture incubator for synchronization. Following synchronization, cells were washed once with PBS and complete growth medium was added (t = 0). Cells were harvested at the indicated times post-synchronization as described above. MMH-D3 hepatocytes were cultured, differentiated, and synchronized following the protocol described for the bioluminescence assays. Following synchronization, Recording Medium was added to begin the timecourse. Samples were harvested every 4 hr for 52 hr. For all timecourse assays, 50 μg of total protein extract was resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-PRDX-SO2/3 (Thermo LF-PA0004); rabbit anti-PER2 (Proteintech, 20359); rabbit anti-NRF2 (Santa Cruz, SC-722); and rabbit anti-NR1D1 (Cell Signaling, 13418).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR assays</title><p>ChIP-PCR was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sutter et al., 2009</xref>).

The problem with detrending using any polynomial function is that, without careful examination of each interpolated baseline fit, there exists the potential to introduce non-linear trends into the detrended data, which were not present in the original recording.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Philip Cole (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>This revised manuscript is an enormous improvement on the original submission and should be accepted for publication pending addressing two remaining issues. There are two places where the description of experimental findings might be seen as slightly misleading:</p><p>1) Taken in isolation, the abstract suggests that the authors have identified a general NRF2-dependent mechanism by which redox balance is communicated to modulate clock gene expression rhythms. This is not quite true, since there was no effect of NRF2 deletion on lung or SCN explants. It would be less misleading to add &quot;in some cell types&quot; to the end of the third sentence of the abstract. This in no way diminishes these important findings and is a more accurate summation of their findings.</p><p>2) The penultimate sentence of the discussion is heavily metaphor laden and could readily be misconstrued by readers outside the circadian field. Both of the terms &quot;transcriptional clock&quot; and &quot;metabolic redox oscillator&quot; suggest self-sufficiency – which is unsubstantiated. Again, it would be more accurate and lucid to amend to something like: &quot;…NRF2 appears to be a key mechanistic link between circadian oscillations in redox balance and clock gene expression rhythms.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31656.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a well-written manuscript.

Of interest, our lack of emphasis on the phase resetting results described above and our issues with data analysis are not simply coincidental. Because of poor baseline correction and the lower signal of MEFs, we were less confident in the reproducibility of these results. Once we became proficient in data analysis, our confidence in many of our unpublished replication experiments increased dramatically.

These comments were helpful as they directed us to specific topics rather than simply stating that the data analysis needed improvement.

As an example, we present analysis of the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.

Because of difference in bioluminescence scale over long periods of time such as year to year, we chose to perform replicated experiments over a period of weeks to months. As can be seen in the data presented, the experimental replication is quite strong. Further, we repeated each experiment as a biological replicate of the effect. In addition, we performed experiments that were reinforcing so that we could build a strong case for consistency of biological effect. For example, the difference between wild-type and Nrf2-null MEFs is replicated in six different experiments included in the manuscript. In addition, this result is further supported in 4 shRNA experiments in two different cell lines. Similarly, the gains of function phenotypes are demonstrated using multiple chemical activators of Nrf2, overexpression of Nrf2 by recombinant means, and genetically in Keap1-null cells. Finally, the animal experiments were replicated in two independent strains of mice produced by separate labs. Further, nearly every experiment measures both levels of Nrf2 protein and also the level of Nqo1, a gene transcriptionally regulated by Nrf2. Thus, we believe that all presented results are strongly supported by independent analyses of many kinds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also noticed that large differences in amplitude are also observed between experiments for Wt controls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> for example). Given that the wild type controls in 2A vs. 2B are effectively experimental repeats of each other, I do not understand why the amplitude differs by an order of magnitude. Could the authors please comment?</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A and 2B</xref> were performed over a year apart. As our cells were not cloned, drift is a possibility. Other more simple types of issues could arise from how well the cells were frozen or grown, or simply instrumental variability between the two LumiCycle instruments in the lab.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;NRF2 regulates core and stabilizing circadian clock loops, coupling redox and timekeeping in Mus musculus&quot; for further consideration at eLife. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Philip Cole (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>This revised manuscript is an enormous improvement on the original submission and should be accepted for publication pending addressing two remaining issues. There are two places where the description of experimental findings might be seen as slightly misleading:</p><p>1) Taken in isolation, the Abstract suggests that the authors have identified a general NRF2-dependent mechanism by which redox balance is communicated to modulate clock gene expression rhythms. This is not quite true, since there was no effect of NRF2 deletion on lung or SCN explants. It would be less misleading to add &quot;in some cell types&quot; to the end of the third sentence of the Abstract. This in no way diminishes these important findings and is a more accurate summation of their findings.</p><p>2) The penultimate sentence of the discussion is heavily metaphor laden and could readily be misconstrued by readers outside the circadian field. Both of the terms &quot;transcriptional clock&quot; and &quot;metabolic redox oscillator&quot; suggest self-sufficiency – which is unsubstantiated. Again, it would be more accurate and lucid to amend to something like: &quot;…NRF2 appears to be a key mechanistic link between circadian oscillations in redox balance and clock gene expression rhythms.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the favorable review. We have made the changes suggested by the reviewers. We believe that in doing so we have enhanced the clarity of the manuscript. We never strive to mislead a reader.</p></body></sub-article></article>
