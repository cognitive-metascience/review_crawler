Here, we show that the bearded dragon, one of the rare vertebrate species with both polyphyodont and monophyodont teeth, constitutes a key model for filling this gap, allowing direct comparison of extreme dentition types. Our developmental and high-throughput transcriptomic data of microdissected dental cells unveils the critical importance of successional dental lamina patterning, in addition to maintenance, for vertebrate tooth renewal. This patterning process happens at various levels, including directional growth but also gene expression levels, dynamics, and regionalization, and involves a large number of yet uncharacterized dental genes. Furthermore, the alternative renewal mechanism of bearded dragon dentition, with dual location of slow-cycling cells, demonstrates the importance of cell migration and functional specialization of putative epithelial stem/progenitor niches in tissue regeneration, while expanding the diversity of dental replacement strategies in vertebrates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47702.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All multicellular organisms, from lizards to humans, must be able to repair and regrow damaged tissue. This includes not only healing after an injury, but also replacing parts of the body that suffer wear and tear. For example, many animals shed and replace worn out teeth throughout their life, but the number of times this occurs varies greatly between species.</p><p>Much of the understanding about how teeth grow and develop has come from researching mice. However, mice only develop one set of teeth, making them a poor ‘model’ for studying how species such as fish and reptiles can re-grow and replace their teeth. Recent studies of these species has shown that regenerating teeth relies on a specialised structure known as the dental lamina. In mice, the dental lamina forms but then quickly disappears, preventing new sets of teeth from developing. In most animals that regrow their teeth, however, the dental lamina keeps growing beyond the most recently produced tooth to create an area where its replacement will emerge. Now, Salomies et al. have identified other strategies involved in tooth replacement from studying the bearded dragon lizard, a rare example of an animal that continuously regenerates some, but not all, of its teeth.</p><p>Analysing the cells in different parts of the re-growing teeth from bearded dragon lizards revealed new features of the dental lamina. Specifically, Salomies et al. found that a previously uncharacterized set of genes within the dental lamina could determine whether or not a tooth will be replaced. Further experiments using microscope imaging revealed that bearded dragon lizards use two distinct groups of stem cells – specialised cells that have the potential to develop into various cell types in the body – to re-grow their teeth. These experiments demonstrate how the bearded dragon lizard uses a previously unknown mechanism to regenerate its teeth, combining elements used by gecko lizards and sharks.</p><p>These findings are an important step towards understanding the different strategies animals can use to maintain and regenerate their teeth. The knowledge gained could one day help design better therapies for patients suffering from inherited dental disorders or tooth loss.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>squamate</kwd><kwd>tooth</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002341</institution-id><institution>Suomen Akatemia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khan</surname><given-names>Imran</given-names></name><name><surname>Di-Poi</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007797</institution-id><institution>Helsingin Yliopisto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Integrative Life Science Doctoral Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salomies</surname><given-names>Lotta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007797</institution-id><institution>Helsingin Yliopisto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Di-Poï</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biocentrum Helsinki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Di-Poï</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007797</institution-id><institution>Helsingin Yliopisto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Institute of Biotechnology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Di-Poï</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of bearded dragon model reveals a novel tooth replacement strategy that demonstrates the critical importance of epithelial patterning, cell migration, and putative stem cell functional specialization in tissue regeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Exposed to the oral cavity of most jawed vertebrates, teeth are continually worn down through food acquisition, a process that must be compensated to maintain the oral apparatus functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berkovitz and Shellis, 2016</xref>). The most common, and likely ancestral, solution to this problem is polyphyodonty, or continuous replacement of the dentition, through shedding of functional teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jernvall and Thesleff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tucker and Fraser, 2014</xref>). Whereas polyphyodonty prevails in the majority of vertebrate taxa, mammals show a substantial reduction in the number of tooth generations, a phenomenon often associated with increased dental complexity in this group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 2004</xref>). Particularly, the vast majority of mammals display a diphyodont dentition, producing only two sets of teeth—deciduous or ‘milk’ teeth and permanent replacement teeth. Rodents such as <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, one of the most commonly used vertebrate animal models, are even more extreme and develop only one generation of teeth, a condition known as monophyodonty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jernvall and Thesleff, 2012</xref>). As a result, although mouse developmental studies of the past decades have revealed many of the signaling pathways controlling primary tooth development, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying lifelong tooth regeneration in vertebrates.</p><p>Recent studies in polyphyodont and diphyodont species from all major vertebrate groups have shown that, with the exception of some teleost fish such as salmonids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fraser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jernvall and Thesleff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vandenplas et al., 2016</xref>), tooth replacement is generally dependent on a specialized epithelial structure, the dental lamina (DL). This structure first emerges as a sheet of epithelial cells that invaginates from the oral epithelium (OE), and plays a crucial role in the developmental events contributing to primary tooth formation. The DL is maintained throughout the lifetime of polyphyodont species, and continues to grow beyond the previously generated tooth to create a free margin, the successional dental lamina (SDL), which constitutes the initiation site of replacement teeth. In monophyodont or diphyodont species such as mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dosedělová et al., 2015</xref>), minipig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchtová et al., 2012</xref>), ferret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jussila et al., 2014</xref>), and chameleon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchtová et al., 2013</xref>), both the DL and associated SDL degenerate relatively rapidly following formation of either one or two sets of teeth, thus highlighting the importance of maintaining these epithelial structures for tooth replacement. Coherent with this, the DL is considered to be the main source of putative odontogenic stem cells required for long-term tooth renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huysseune and Thesleff, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jernvall and Thesleff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Juuri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thiery et al., 2017</xref>), and label-retaining cells (LRCs) have been initially mapped to this region in the polyphyodont leopard gecko (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Handrigan et al., 2010</xref>). More recently, putative stem/progenitor populations have been identified in the distal DL bulge of the American alligator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), in the SDL and OE of sharks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2016</xref>), as well as in the superficial DL of pufferfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thiery et al., 2017</xref>), thus indicating variations in dental regenerative strategies among polyphyodont species. Molecularly, compelling evidence from a number of reptilian species, teleost fish, shark, and ferret has revealed a conserved set of transcription factors and signaling molecules exhibiting similar expression patterns in the dental apparatus. In particular, the canonical Wnt pathway has emerged as a strong candidate signaling pathway associated with tooth replacement, because of its local activation (as revealed by the expression of Wnt/β-catenin target genes) in most studied polyphyodont and diphyodont species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Handrigan and Richman, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fraser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaete and Tucker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jussila et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rasch et al., 2016</xref>), but also because of its capacity to produce a large number of supernumerary teeth when activated in snakes and transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Järvinen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaete and Tucker, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, stabilizing Wnt/β-catenin signaling was recently shown to induce formation of replacement tooth germs in the normally degenerating mouse SDL, thus providing further support for the important role of this pathway in controlling tooth induction and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Popa et al., 2019</xref>). However, only low-scale, single- or cross-species candidate gene approaches based on mouse expression patterns have been used so far to characterize polyphyodont dentitions, and the complete molecular signature of vertebrate tooth regeneration is still unknown.</p><p>In this study, we examined one agamid lizard model, the bearded dragon (<italic>Pogona vitticeps</italic>), which offers an excellent model system to study the events that define tooth development and regeneration because of its uncommon dentition with distinct modes of implantation and regenerative capacities along the same jaw—acrodont, monophyodont teeth posteriorly and pleurodont, polyphyodont teeth anteriorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cooper et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di-Poï and Milinkovitch, 2016</xref>). This lizard is one of the rare extant vertebrate species with such marked heterodonty, which allows direct comparisons of extreme types of vertebrate dentition in a single model. Unlike the dentition of other polyphyodont reptiles investigated so far, our data further indicate that bearded dragons possess a relatively slow replacement process (based on a ‘one-for-one’ strategy) as well as a permanent, proliferating SDL that only initiates replacement at anterior polyphyodont locations, making this model extremely attractive for elucidating the key importance of DL and SDL epithelial structures in vertebrate tooth initiation and regeneration. Indeed, we show here that the early degradation of the SDL is not the only mechanism restricting vertebrate tooth replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchtová et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dosedělová et al., 2015</xref>). Instead, our developmental data and large-scale transcriptomic analysis of microdissected dental tissues unveil the critical importance of SDL patterning at various levels, including directional growth but also gene expression levels, dynamics, and regionalization, for tooth regeneration. Particularly, we identify a large number of yet uncharacterized developmental genes associated with dental patterning in regenerating and non-regenerating teeth, so our lizard model is also uniquely suited for revealing new signaling pathways critical for tooth replacement in vertebrates. Additionally, our bearded dragon findings reveal a novel mechanism of continuous tooth replacement in vertebrates, which shares with the leopard gecko a source of putative odontogenic progenitor/stem cells in the DL but closely parallels the shark by the presence of a separate second source of cells originating from the OE. This novel dental replacement strategy definitely demonstrates that the bearded dragon provides a rare opportunity to expand our understanding of tooth developmental dynamics and diversity, while providing a unique model system to study the function and specialization of epithelial structures and dental progenitor/stem cell niches present in distinct groups of vertebrates. Altogether, and given the well-established history in captivity and key advantages of the bearded dragon lizard for research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ollonen et al., 2018</xref>) this emerging model organism offers a powerful system to elucidate the developmental and genetic basis of both evolutionary novelty and tooth regeneration, thus allowing to answer both developmental and evolutionary questions critical for the design of more appropriate therapies targeted at congenital dental disorders and tooth loss in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dental morphology and odontogenesis in bearded dragon</title><p>Agamid lizards possess an atypical heterodont dentition with both acrodont, monophyodont and pleurodont, polyphyodont tooth types, which vary widely in terms of number and shape among species and over ontogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cooper et al., 1970</xref>) and personal observations). We first examined the gross anatomy of the dentition and associated DL in the bearded dragon, using micro-computed tomography (CT) imaging. Hatchling animals possess seven posterior triangular acrodont teeth attached to the jaw bones on each jaw quadrant, whereas the most anterior tooth positions on the premaxilla (three teeth, upper jaw) and dentary (two teeth, lower jaw) are occupied by pleurodont teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). At this early stage, the central-most tooth projecting forwards in the midline of the premaxilla consists of the large egg-tooth, which is later replaced by a regular pleurodont successor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To visualize oral soft tissue, including the DL structure, we stained the jaws of juvenile bearded dragons with the contrast agent phosphotungstic acid (PTA) before CT-scanning. As expected, the DL forms a continuous sheet of epithelium spanning the whole jaws, without clear separation between the pleurodont and acrodont dentitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). However, when compared to regions occupied by pleurodont teeth, the DL is shorter both at the level of acrodont teeth and in interdental regions, a morphology that is in line with the absence of tooth replacement at these particular positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47702.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Different types of bearded dragon teeth develop through morphologically equivalent stages.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Micro-CT scan images of bearded dragon skull at hatchling stage in frontal (<bold>A</bold>) and lateral (<bold>B</bold>) views.

As already shown in a previous study focusing on primary tooth morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Handrigan and Richman, 2010b</xref>), odontogenesis at acrodont positions starts around 15 days post-oviposition (dpo) with the emergence of non-functional vestigial teeth developing directly from the OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These superficial teeth abort morphogenesis prematurely following early mineralization, and functional acrodont teeth subsequently develop through classical stages of odontogenesis from a primary DL invaginating from the OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–J</xref>), as already described in a number of reptilian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Handrigan and Richman, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchtová et al., 2013</xref>). Around the time of tooth eruption, a small SDL emerges on the lingual side of acrodont teeth, but in contrast to previous reptile observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richman and Handrigan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchtová et al., 2013</xref>), our data indicate that the SDL is not rudimentary but rather continues growing in size until hatching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J</xref>) and even afterwards at postnatal stages (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Importantly, whereas the developmental stages are morphologically equivalent for the whole dentition, our direct comparisons of acrodont and pleurodont teeth clearly indicate a developmental delay in the initiation of pleurodont teeth, which only occurs around 40 dpo. Furthermore, despite the overall morphological similarities between the two types of teeth, pleurodont teeth show an elongated primary DL and thus develop deeper inside the mesenchyme than acrodont teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Finally, a different directional growth of the SDL is also evident, with pleurodont SDL growing lingually to accommodate the replacement tooth into the jaw, and acrodont SDL projecting downwards towards the jaw bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47702.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Expression of conserved dental genes is maintained from embryonic development to replacement.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In situ hybridization (ISH) showing the expression of <italic>SHH</italic>, <italic>PITX2</italic>, <italic>NOTCH1</italic>, and <italic>LEF1</italic> at various indicated developmental stages (24, 28, and 48 dpo) in developing mandibular acrodont teeth.

The bearded dragon expression pattern of <italic>SHH</italic> and <italic>PITX2</italic> is comparable to previous reports in polyphyodont species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fraser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Handrigan and Richman, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jussila and Thesleff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rasch et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>PITX2</italic> marks the primary DL at early stages, then becomes strongly expressed throughout the enamel organ and DL in both vestigial and bell stage teeth, and finally remains in the cervical loops, odontoblasts, DL, and SDL at mineralization stage. In contrast, <italic>SHH</italic> localizes specifically to the inner enamel epithelium of vestigial teeth and functional teeth, moving downwards towards the cervical loops at later stages, but no expression is detected in the SDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Notch signaling regulates stem/progenitor activity in several tissues and is particularly required for both tooth morphogenesis and maintenance of murine incisor stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitsiadis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Felszeghy et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly to the mouse dentition, <italic>NOTCH1</italic> is predominantly expressed in the epithelial compartment of functional teeth, including in the DL tip at 24 dpo and OE at both 24 and 28 dpo, but its expression is also noticeable in the condensed mesenchyme of vestigial teeth at early developmental stages. Finally, our analysis of the Wnt readout gene <italic>LEF1</italic> indicates a condensed expression in the primary DL and at the tip of the SDL, a pattern previously observed in other squamate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richman and Handrigan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaete and Tucker, 2013</xref>) but contrasting with previous reports in bearded dragon acrodont SDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richman and Handrigan, 2011</xref>). Indeed, consistent with the equivalent morphology and persistence of SDL in both acrodont and pleurodont dentitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,N</xref>), all tested genes were expressed in a similar pattern in both types of embryonic teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and data not shown). Even further, our investigation of postnatal animals indicates the persistence of a highly proliferative SDL in both acrodont and pleurodont teeth at juvenile and adult stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), as assessed by detection of proliferating nuclear cell antigen (PCNA) proliferation markers and BrdU incorporation. Additionally, in contrast to juvenile chameleon lizards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchtová et al., 2013</xref>), no signs of SDL deterioration or increased apoptosis were observed in the acrodont SDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, whereas PCNA, <italic>LEF1</italic>, and <italic>PITX2</italic> remain expressed in both acrodont and pleurodont teeth, careful examination of these markers indicates both oral-aboral and labial-lingual asymmetry in the pleurodont SDL, in contrast to the scattered pattern in acrodont SDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A complementary pattern was observed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for SOX2, which is excluded from the very tip of pleurodont DL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), as already observed in some other regenerating species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Juuri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Popa et al., 2019</xref>). Altogether, our data indicate that despite the lack of initiation of replacement teeth at acrodont positions in bearded dragon, the SDL does not degenerate and continues growing in size into adulthood. To our knowledge, this is the first example of long-term SDL maintenance in non-polyphyodont dentition, suggesting that this process is independent of and not causally related to tooth replacement. Furthermore, the observed differences in spatial organization of cell proliferation and developmental gene expression between postnatal acrodont and pleurodont dentitions likely reflect the need of directional growth and focal gene expression foreshadowing initiation of pleurodont tooth replacement.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Putative stem/progenitor cells in bearded dragon dentition</title><p>To assess the existence and location of putative slow-cycling stem/progenitor cells in bearded dragon teeth, we performed BrdU pulse-chase assays in juvenile animals. BrdU was administered for seven days (pulse), and samples were obtained after 0, 28, and 58 days of chase time. To facilitate identification of putative stem/progenitor cells in both acrodont and pleurodont teeth, we distinguished cells that have stopped proliferating (post-mitotic or terminally differentiated cells) from cells that are still cycling by the use of BrdU immunostaining combined with PCNA detection at each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition, the relatively long half-life of PCNA increases the likelihood of correctly identifying slow-cycling BrdU/PCNA-double positive (BrdU+PCNA+) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kurki et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bravo and Macdonald-Bravo, 1987</xref>). At day 0, the majority of PCNA+ cells are also positive for BrdU, demonstrating the efficiency of our one-week pulse labeling in detecting most cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The overall amount of BrdU+PCNA+ cells then drops dramatically by day 28, and only clusters of cells remain throughout the dental epithelium in both types of teeth. Additionally, post-mitotic, single BrdU+ cells are present in some dental parts, including along the DL and in the more superficial regions of the OE. The latter cells likely represent the quick turnover of the epithelium itself. At day 58, the few remaining BrdU+PCNA+ cells representing putative slow-cycling stem/progenitor cells are exclusively concentrated in two distinct regions of pleurodont teeth, the OE and the deep part of the DL (DDL). Interestingly, however, double positive cells are more scarce in the DL of acrodont teeth while remaining in the OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Our quantification of BrdU+PCNA+ cells in the pleurodont and acrodont epithelial regions confirms these findings, although the total number of BrdU+PCNA+ cells is relatively similar between the two dentitions (d58; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Particularly, inspection of the distribution of BrdU+PCNA+ cells in four different epithelial subdivisions, from the OE to the SDL, highlights a high proliferative DDL in pleurodont teeth at day 0 (region III; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>). Since the DDL represents the SDL budding site, we presume that this proliferation pattern may trigger, at least in part, the observed directional growth of the pleurodont SDL towards the lingual portion of the jaw. Consistent with this hypothesis, acrodont teeth show a relatively reduced proportion of BrdU+PCNA+ cells in the DDL region, likely reflecting the lack of directional growth of non-regenerating SDL. At day 58, comparisons of the proportion of BrdU+PCNA+ cells confirm our previously observed variation in the location of LRCs in acrodont and pleurodont teeth. In particular, the DDL and OE regions represent together about three quarters of all LRCs in pleurodont teeth, thus supporting the existence of two distinct sites of putative stem/progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, LRCs are more equally distributed between the DDL, OE, and SDL in acrodont teeth, indicating that altered distribution of LRCs is associated with lack of cyclic tooth replacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). To further assess the potential stemness of identified LRCs in bearded dragon dentition, we analyzed the expression of conserved putative stem/progenitor cell markers previously shown to be associated with dental tissues in vertebrates. Of note, tooth replacement is yet poorly studied in polyphyodont species, and only one dental progenitor marker, SOX2, has been validated in several vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Juuri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Juuri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2016</xref>). However, hair follicle stem cell markers such as <italic>LGR5</italic> and <italic>IGFBP5</italic> have also been shown to co-localize with LRCs at least in the leopard gecko DL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Handrigan et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we compared the expression pattern of these three markers in pleurodont versus acrodont teeth of our bearded dragon model, using SOX2 IHC or <italic>LGR5</italic>/<italic>IGFBP5</italic> ISH together with BrdU detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Consistent with the BrdU-retaining pattern in pleurodont teeth, we first confirmed the co-expression of SOX2/<italic>LGR5</italic>/<italic>IGFBP5</italic> or only SOX2 within the DDL and OE LRC sites, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, whereas acrodont teeth show similar co-expression of SOX2 in the OE LRCs, no <italic>LGR5</italic>, <italic>IGFBP5</italic>, or SOX2 expression could be co-detected in the scattered BrdU+ cells of acrodont DL. Altogether, these data clearly indicate the presence of separate putative dental epithelial stem/progenitor populations in bearded dragon, including one pleurodont-specific DDL population relatively similar to the leopard gecko DL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Handrigan et al., 2010</xref>), and one shared pleurodont/acrodont OE population directly adjacent to the tooth and resembling the superficial taste/tooth junction recently identified in the spotted catshark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47702.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Slow-cycling label-retaining cells (LRCs) accumulate in two different regions of bearded dragon teeth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Double IHC for PCNA (red staining) and BrdU (green) in pleurodont (left and middle panels) or acrodont (right) tooth sections collected from bearded dragons at 0 (<bold>d0</bold>), 28 (<bold>d28</bold>), and 58 (<bold>d58</bold>) days of chase after the first week of BrdU pulse.

To test this hypothesis, we performed cell tracking experiments in bearded dragons both in vivo and ex vivo, using the lipophilic dye DiI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Labeling was carried out in the OE directly adjacent to pleurodont or acrodont teeth, and samples were collected at regular time intervals after DiI administration. Strikingly, in vivo tracking in pleurodont dentition revealed that within two weeks, cells labeled in the OE (d0) shifted to the DL (d7) and then SDL (d14), but also contributed to replacement teeth (d14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A similar ending-point was observed after four weeks of tracing (data not shown), and a corresponding pattern was observed in acrodont teeth, indicating that migration from the OE still occurs despite the lack of replacement. Importantly, imaging of single ex vivo dental cultures confirmed the observed migratory pathway of DiI labeled cells along the DL, from OE to SDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), further demonstrating the contribution of OE progenitor/stem cells to tooth replacement. Particularly, the similar migration pattern observed in both dentition types suggests that, while not sufficient to induce replacement, the maintained growth of the DL/SDL might rely on this OE population. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the functional role of the putative OE stem/progenitor zone by manually removing the entire proximal OE in dental tissue cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

We particularly focused on the SDL, which shows divergent expression patterns in our candidate-based approach (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and the dental mesenchyme surrounding it, using staining-guided laser microdissection (see microdissected areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and Illumina RNA sequencing. At a cut-off of False Discovery Rate (FDR)-adjusted p-values&lt;0.05, we obtained 206 and 368 differentially expressed genes in the SDL and dental mesenchyme, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary File 1</xref>). Importantly, candidate genes already identified in the bearded dragon SDL, including <italic>PITX2</italic>, <italic>LEF1</italic>, and <italic>SOX2</italic> were all retrieved in our transcriptome data, thus supporting our ISH experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

A more thorough analysis of gene ontology (GO) category distribution among all differentially regulated genes indicates that more than 45% belong to the category ‘developmental process’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Surprisingly, however, our list of developmental genes revealed only a partial overlap (18%) with genes already known to be expressed in vertebrate dental tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that regulation of the SDL in polyphyodont dentitions involves many genes and signaling pathways still uncharacterized and/or non-expressed in the monophyodont mouse dentition.

Furthermore, studies investigating polyphyodont species have so far largely focused on single- or cross-species comparisons of selected candidate genes based on mouse expression patterns, and the exact molecular basis of tooth renewal is still unclear. Here, we show that the bearded dragon, one of the rare vertebrate species with both polyphyodont and monophyodont teeth, constitutes a key model for filling this gap, allowing direct comparison of different dentition types. As already shown in non-teleost polyphyodont species, our findings first confirm the critical importance of both DL and SDL structures in tooth renewal. However, in contrast to a previous hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchtová et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dosedělová et al., 2015</xref>), the early degradation of the SDL is not the only mechanism restricting vertebrate tooth replacement. Indeed, bearded dragons maintain a proliferative epithelial SDL structure even in non-replacing teeth, indicating that the SDL maintenance is independent of and not strictly associated with tooth renewal. These data also contrast with previous observations made in acrodont teeth from chameleons, the second family of acrodont lizards, where the SDL was shown to diminish in size at postnatal stages independently of increased apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchtová et al., 2012</xref>). The bearded dragon posterior dentition might thus represent an intermediary stage between polyphyodonty and complete monophyodonty, at least at the cellular level. In favor of that, and in contrast to chameleons, the implantation mode in most agamids is similar to intermediate pleurodont-acrodont dentition patterns observed in extinct acrodont iguanian lizards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Averianov et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simões et al., 2015</xref>). Haridy even recently proposed that the posterior tooth phenotype in bearded dragons might result from pleurodont to acrodont remodeling changes through ontogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haridy, 2018</xref>). The latter hypothesis is coherent with our developmental data, as no clear morphological variations were observed in the two types of developing teeth, except for the length of the embryonic primary DL. The origin of such difference in the developing DL is unclear but might be linked to the delayed initiation of pleurodont teeth, when compared to acrodont teeth, which would extend the timing of DL proliferation. Importantly, differences were also noticed in the directional growth of SDL at hatchling and postnatal stages, with the pleurodont and acrodont SDL growing lingually or projecting more downwards towards the jaw bone, respectively. This differential directional SDL growth likely constitutes a key process to accommodate the replacement tooth, and was accompanied by an asymmetric expression pattern of conserved dental genes such as <italic>LEF1</italic> and <italic>PITX2</italic>, but also of proliferation, towards the pleurodont SDL tip. Interestingly, focal localization of <italic>LEF1</italic> expression and/or Wnt signaling activity was already noticed in the squamate SDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Handrigan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaete and Tucker, 2013</xref>), alligator DL bulge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), shark SDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rasch et al., 2016</xref>), and ferret SDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jussila et al., 2014</xref>). However, our large-scale transcriptomic analysis now indicates that a large number of yet uncharacterized developmental genes and signaling pathways are, in fact, likely associated with SDL outgrowth and/or induction. Furthermore, besides differences in gene expression dynamics and regionalization between pleurodont and acrodont dentitions, our data show drastic changes in gene expression levels in both SDL and surrounding mesenchymal tissues, indicating the importance of multi-level dental organization for initiation of tooth replacement. Along this line, the overall conserved expression levels of Wnt signaling members in our comparative pleurodont-acrodont transcriptome analysis suggest that this conserved pathway might primarily regulate SDL growth, a process maintained in bearded dragon acrodont dentition, rather than directly induce tooth replacement. This hypothesis is consistent with our observations that separate processes regulate SDL growth and initiation of replacement teeth, further indicating that SDL maintenance is not causatively associated with tooth replacement. Among newly identified developmental factors differentially regulated between monophyodont and polyphyodont dentitions, several genes encoding homeobox transcription factors were highly upregulated in regenerating teeth. For example, <italic>ALX1</italic>, a regulator of cartilage and craniofacial development in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dee et al., 2013</xref>), was one of the most highly upregulated genes in both pleurodont SDL and mesenchymal tissues, and it is likely that the severe and relatively early craniofacial phenotypes of <italic>ALX1</italic> mutations (frontonasal dysplasia) before initiation of odontogenesis have hampered identification of this gene as a regulator of tooth development and/or replacement in mammals. Similarly, <italic>SIX3</italic> plays crucial roles in the development of the vertebrate sensory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oliver et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Loosli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Del Bene et al., 2004</xref>), but this gene has not yet been detected in the developing mouse dentition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nonomura et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, <italic>ISL1</italic> has been reported to be selectively expressed in the dental epithelium of mouse incisor, while being absent from molar epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mitsiadis et al., 2003</xref>), but this tooth-specific patterning has never been linked with continuous tooth growth or replacement in previous vertebrate studies. Based on the dynamic expression pattern observed in the developing epithelial and/or mesenchymal tissues, further investigation of these genes should provide key information on the signaling pathways controlling odontogenesis, including SDL outgrowth and/or initiation of replacement teeth.</p><p>As already suggested by several studies in polyphyodont species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Handrigan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thiery et al., 2017</xref>), our identification of bearded dragon slow-cycling LRCs co-expressing stem/progenitor markers provides further evidence of the importance of epithelial stem/progenitor cell populations in regulating tooth renewal in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, the mechanism of continuous tooth replacement identified in our model differs from the leopard gecko, the first inspected lizard species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Handrigan et al., 2010</xref>), by the presence of two separate sources of putative stem/progenitor cells in the DL and OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), thus indicating alternative regenerative strategies and some specialization of stem/progenitor niches in squamates. Particularly, we show that migration from SOX2+ LRCs at the DL/OE junction contributes to the proliferative growth of DL and SDL structures, a process shared by both acrodont and pleurodont teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These findings support our hypothesis about the intermediate phenotype of bearded dragon acrodont dentition and closely parallel the regenerative dental strategy of sharks, which exhibit a similar LRC population at the taste/tooth junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It is then tempting to speculate that SOX2+ OE cells of bearded dragons could also be bipotent, contributing to both taste and dental lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2016</xref>). In support of this, SOX2 has been recently identified as a conserved marker of dental progenitors but also of taste bud and non-gustatory epithelial fate in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ohmoto et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, similarly to sharks, the OE of bearded dragons contains a heterogeneous population of cells, consisting of self-renewing epithelial progenitors and taste buds in close proximity to the DL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and data not shown). However, anatomical studies have revealed strong heterogeneity in the presence and location of taste buds in lizards and snakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uchida, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwenk, 1985</xref>), indicating that this potential bipotency may not be a general mechanism conserved across squamates. It is also still unclear if the newly identified OE LRC population exists and contributes to tooth replacement in other reptiles, as the OE has not been analyzed in previous lizard and snake studies despite the strong SOX2 expression observed in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Juuri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaete and Tucker, 2013</xref>). The presence of one OE LRC population might also be directly linked to a specific tooth replacement rate and/or strategy in squamates, in a similar way as the heterogeneity in DL reported in teleosts with different replacement states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fraser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jernvall and Thesleff, 2012</xref>). Indeed, replacement of pleurodont teeth in agamid lizards is relatively slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cooper et al., 1970</xref>) and this study) and based on a ‘one-for-one’ strategy (a single replacement tooth is formed at any one time for a single tooth position), whereas many squamates exhibit a ‘many-for-one’ replacement state with several replacement teeth formed ahead of function at a single tooth position. In this context, the conservation of only one putative stem/progenitor cell population in the DL might constitute a more efficient positioning strategy for generating multiple tooth generations, as exemplified by the leopard gecko (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Handrigan et al., 2010</xref>). Our characterization of the second source of LRCs in the bearded dragon pleurodont DL indicates striking similarities with the leopard gecko in terms of location, directly beside the lingually protruding SDL in the DDL, but also in terms of stem/progenitor marker expression profile, suggesting evolutionary conservation of this cell population at least among lizards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, the exact function of putative stem/progenitor niches has remained unclear since their discovery in the leopard gecko. Our pleurodont-acrodont comparisons in bearded dragons now provide the first evidence of functional specialization of putative dental stem/progenitor populations in vertebrates. Specifically, we show that the DL population is likely strictly necessary for tooth replacement, as it is not detected in monophyodont bearded dragon teeth. The altered proliferation pattern, including lack of asymmetry and increased presence of BrdU-retaining cells, as well as differences in gene expression levels and location in the acrodont SDL suggest a key role for the DL population in the complex SDL organization required for initiation of tooth replacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, the maintained OE population in the whole bearded dragon dentition contributes to SDL maintenance and growth, a process that is not causatively associated with initiation of tooth replacement.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47702.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Comparative models of cellular and molecular processes controlling oral tooth replacement in polyphyodont species.</title><p>Schematic drawings of oral tooth replacement strategies in polyphyodont species with molecularly-characterized LRC populations: spotted catshark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2016</xref>), pufferfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thiery et al., 2017</xref>), Atlantic salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vandenplas et al., 2016</xref>), African bichir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vandenplas et al., 2016</xref>), bearded dragon pleurodont and acrodont teeth (this study), leopard gecko (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Handrigan et al., 2010</xref>), and American alligator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). The putative stem cell niche of monophyodont mouse incisor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harada et al., 1999</xref>) is also shown for comparison. In spotted catshark, SOX2-positive putative dental progenitors migrate from the superficial taste/tooth junction (T/TJ) towards the successional dental lamina (SDL). In pufferfish but also cichlid fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fraser et al., 2013</xref>), a SOX2-positive putative dental progenitor niche resides in the most superficial dental lamina (DL). In Atlantic salmon and African bichir, no epithelial LRCs have been identified despite positive SOX2 expression in the OE and outer dental epithelium transition zone. In the leopard gecko, LRCs expressing adult stem cell markers such as <italic>IGFBP5</italic> and <italic>LGR5</italic> reside on the lingual side of the DL. In the American alligator, putative stem cells localize to the distal enlarged bulge of the DL. In both leopard gecko and American alligator, SOX2 expression has been shown to overlap with the epithelial region containing putative stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Juuri et al., 2013</xref>), but no co-localization studies are available. In mouse incisors, SOX2-positive putative stem cells responsible for continual growth are located in the labial cervical loop (LaCL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Juuri et al., 2012</xref>). In bearded dragon pleurodont teeth, LRCs are located both in the SOX2-positive oral epithelium (OE; region similar to the T/TJ) and <italic>IGFBP5</italic>/<italic>LGR5/</italic>SOX2-positive DDL (region similar to the gecko DL). During regeneration, cells migrate from the superficial OE towards the SDL, the SDL shows focal expression of SDL marker genes (<italic>PITX2</italic>/<italic>LEF1</italic>), and both the SDL and surrounding mesenchyme exhibit relatively high expression of newly identified dental genes (<italic>ALX1</italic>/<italic>SIX3</italic>/<italic>ISL1</italic>), thus leading to the initiation of replacement tooth. In acrodont teeth, LRCs are also evident in the SOX2-positive OE and cell migration occurs from the superficial OE towards the SDL, thus contributing to SDL growth. However, the acrodont SDL shows scattered expression of SDL markers and low expression of newly identified dental genes, most likely as a result of absence of DL stem/progenitor cells and SDL organization, and no replacement teeth are formed.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47702-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the various key dental features of the emerging bearded dragon model offer a powerful system to elucidate the developmental and genetic basis of evolutionary novelty and tooth regeneration in vertebrates. Particularly, the direct comparative analysis of pleurodont and acrodont dentitions indicates the importance of SDL patterning, in addition to maintenance, for vertebrate tooth replacement. This patterning process happens at various levels, including directional growth but also gene expression levels, dynamics, and regionalization, and involves a large number of yet uncharacterized developmental genes and signaling pathways. Finally, the two separate putative stem/progenitor populations identified in bearded dragon pleurodont teeth reveal a new vertebrate dental regenerative strategy associated with cell migration and functional specialization of putative stem/progenitor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>PCNA (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>BioLegend</td><td>cat# 307901, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_314691">AB_314691</ext-link></td><td>1:300</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>BrdU (rat monoclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>cat# ab6326, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_314691">AB_314691</ext-link></td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>SOX2 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>cat# ab97959, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2341193">AB_2341193</ext-link></td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>DIG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (sheep polyclonal)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>cat# 11093274910, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2734716">AB_2734716</ext-link></td><td>1:2000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa Fluor-488 (goat anti-rat IgG)</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>cat# A-11006, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2354074">AB_2534074</ext-link></td><td>1:400</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa Fluor-568 (goat anti-rabbit IgG)</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>cat# A-11011, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_143157">AB_143157</ext-link></td><td>1:400 (with SOX2), 1:600 (with PCNA)</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td><italic>PITX2</italic></td><td>This paper</td><td>PCR primers</td><td>Forward primer (fp) ATGAACTGCCTGAAAGACGC;

Juvenile animals were anesthetized by injection of propofol (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) into the ventral coccygeal vein, and small amounts of DiI:sucrose solution were injected into the oral epithelium (OE) using a Hamilton syringe (702 RN, 25 µl volume) and custom needles (small RN, 26 s gauge). Animals were euthanized 1, 7, or 14 days after DiI administration (<italic>n</italic> = 6), and dental tissue sections were directly mounted with Fluoroshield mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich). For ex vivo DiI labeling, the skin of dissected jaws from euthanized <italic>Pogona vitticeps</italic> was removed, and about 1–2 mm thick slices were cut through the jaws with a scalpel. DiI:sucrose was administered into the OE using the tip of standard 30G needle syringe. Slices were placed on Corning Transwell-clear 3 μm nucleopore membrane inserts (Sigma-Aldrich) in 6-well plates filled with DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco), 0.1 mg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 1:100 nystatin (Gibco), and 1:100 amphotericin B (Gibco).

Following decalcification, EDTA was washed out in PBS, and jaws were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek). Thick sections of 25 µm were prepared using a Leitz 1720 cryostat and mounted on Superfrost Ultra Plus slides (Thermo Scientific) at −25°C. Completed slides were dipped into ice-cold 70% ethanol and stored at −25°C while sectioning. For dental tissue visualization, slides were washed in ice-cold MilliQ water for 1–2 min, stained in cold 1% (w/v) cresyl violet solution in 50% ethanol for 10 s, and then washed in cold 70% and 100% ethanol for 1–2 min. After air-drying, the stained sections were stored at −80°C before use. Staining-guided laser microdissection was used to separate both the SDL and surrounding mesenchymal tissue from sections of both acrodont and pleurodont teeth, using a Zeiss PALM Microbeam device equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam IC camera and PALM Robo software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014435">SCR_014435</ext-link>).

The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Vincent Laudet (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Salomies et al., describes odontogenesis in bearded dragon with focus on differences in replacement ability of rostral and caudal teeth. All reviewers and the Reviewing Editor strongly agree that the bearded dragon represents a valuable model for comparative research as distinct replacement strategy can be observed in different areas of the jaw in one animal. Based on our communication, the reviewers and Reviewing Editor agree on the following essential revisions before this manuscript will be suitable for publishing in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper lacks a strong narrative story that would highlight the major results (such as the OE population, the difference between teeth types etc.) and better link the different manuscript components. We suggest that the authors add a paragraph to the Introduction or otherwise rework the Introduction to explain clearly what this model brings to the field and why it really stands out from what have been previously done to clearly highlighting the model's potential impact on the field.</p><p>2) We also suggest that authors better highlight and if possible, expand on the results of their transcriptomic analyses, which we feel are the most novel parts of the study. As it is, we are left to a small panel and our imagination to go beyond these data. After the basic characterization of the system depicted in Figure 1, we suggest the authors consider using these markers to better characterize the acrodont and pleurodont teeth in subsequent experiments rather than only using classical markers that are informative of course but obviously only partial. Specifically, we recommend the authors expand the ISH experiments shown in Figure 6 to include the expression of these markers in the mesenchymes of acrodont and pleurodont teeth.</p><p>- Materials and methods Section: Pictures or drawings of laser microdissected areas used for RNA extraction are not included. Could the authors please clarify which stage/age was used for this analysis?</p><p>- Figure 1: Rearrangement of acrodont teeth (E-J) into one row and corresponding number of pleurodont pictures into the second row of the plate would be helpful. Also labeling on the side would make figure more clear.</p><p>- We suggest that the authors present Figure 6 differently with a phylogenetic tree which also includes the situation in mouse and the fish situation. We realize the data are difficult to compare and that there will be many question marks, but it is the only informative way of presenting a model on such a question.</p><p>- On the transcriptomic studies we have come concerns on how to interpret the differential expression seen in the mesenchyme tissue. Could this be linked to a differential &quot;contamination&quot; level of the preparation by mesenchyme? It would be important to surely avoid any bias here, and we suggest that the authors address this concern in the manuscript.</p><p>- One reviewer strongly disagrees with the first sentence of the Abstract. According to this reviewer, &quot;Zebrafish is, I think now a conventional model and as most teleost fishes is a polyphyodont species.&quot; We therefore suggest you edit this sentence.</p><p>- We suggest that the authors do not unite data coming from different animals, such as alligators and lizards, even though they might fall within a broader taxonomic group. We suggest the authors discuss all taxa separately.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47702.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper lacks a strong narrative story that would highlight the major results (such as the OE population, the difference between teeth types etc.) and better link the different manuscript components.

Particularly, this model organism offers a powerful system to elucidate the developmental and genetic basis of both evolutionary novelty and tooth regeneration in vertebrates. We also revised the last paragraph of the Discussion section to further emphasize our conclusions as well as the importance of this lizard model in answering both developmental and evolutionary questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) We also suggest that authors better highlight and if possible, expand on the results of their transcriptomic analyses, which we feel are the most novel parts of the study.

As suggested by the reviewers, we now expanded the ISH experiments by investigating and comparing the expression pattern of newly identified dental genes such as <italic>ALX1, SIX3</italic>, and <italic>ISL1</italic> in both acrodont and pleurodont teeth at various embryonic and postnatal developmental stages described in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Due to the amount of new results, all expression patterns (including data originally present in small panel E of Figure 5 mentioned by the reviewers) are now shown in a new Figure 6, and Figure 5 has been revised accordingly to only show the transcriptomic and quantitative PCR data. New magnified views of acrodont and pleurodont teeth at early postnatal stage (corresponding to the transcriptomic analysis) were also added to better characterize the expression patterns of these genes in both the successional dental lamina and mesenchyme regions. We also modified the Results section and Discussion section of the text accordingly to include these new important data in the revised manuscript. Particularly, our data strongly support our transcriptomic and PCR analyses, but also reveal dynamic expression pattern in epithelial and/or mesenchymal tissues starting from early tooth development. We really thank the reviewers for this suggestion, which further highlight the importance of the newly identified genes in odontogenesis and SDL patterning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Materials and methods Section: Pictures or drawings of laser microdissected areas used for RNA extraction are not included. Could the authors please clarify which stage/age was used for this analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an understandable request. Drawings of laser microdissected areas used for RNA extraction and transcriptomic analysis are now included in the revised Figure 5A for both successional dental lamina (left panel) and dental mesenchyme (right panel), and the laser microdissection procedure is explained in more details in the Results section and Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript (see also comment below). An early postnatal stage (4 days post-hatching) was selected for this analysis in order to get a well-developed SDL in both pleurodont and acrodont teeth. We now clarified this issue in the Materials and methods section and in the Figure legends of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 1: Rearrangement of acrodont teeth (E-J) into one row and corresponding number of pleurodont pictures into the second row of the plate would be helpful. Also labeling on the side would make figure more clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree with this comment and have now modified the Figure 1 accordingly by first rearranging acrodont pictures in one row (panels E-J), and then adding new Hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)-stained sections of pleurodont teeth in a second row to get all corresponding stages (panels K-P). Labeling of tooth types is also now visible on the left side of the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- We suggest that the authors present Figure 6 differently with a phylogenetic tree which also includes the situation in mouse and the fish situation. We realize the data are difficult to compare and that there will be many question marks, but it is the only informative way of presenting a model on such a question.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned by the reviewers, molecular findings from different species are rather difficult to compare, and data on stem cell characterization and particular gene expression pattern (including <italic>SOX2</italic>) are sometimes included in separate publications for a given species. However, we agree that this suggestion would help in the direct comparison of different vertebrate models, and we now revised the corresponding Figure (new Figure 7 of revised manuscript) by adding both a phylogenetic tree and new species from different vertebrate groups. We particularly focused on species (American alligator, mouse, pufferfish, cichlid fish, Atlantic salmon, African bichir) with comparable, integrative molecular data available for oral teeth, including mapping of slow-cycling putative stem cells and <italic>SOX2</italic> expression pattern. For some reptile species, the co-localization of <italic>SOX2</italic> expression with putative stem cells has not been directly assessed, as clearly mentioned in the revised Figure legend. New references on fish and mouse teeth have been also added at different locations in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- On the transcriptomic studies we have come concerns on how to interpret the differential expression seen in the mesenchyme tissue. Could this be linked to a differential &quot;contamination&quot; level of the preparation by mesenchyme? It would be important to surely avoid any bias here, and we suggest that the authors address this concern in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this could be a concern. However, to minimize any risk of “contamination”, all microdissections were guided by cresyl violet staining of dental tissue sections under high magnification, and the microdissection/camera device used enabled excellent visualization. As cresyl violet staining allows epithelium to be well-distinguished, the successional dental lamina (SDL) structure, defined as the free end of the dental lamina epithelium that projects away from the tooth (see revised Figure 5A and comment above), was collected first; mesenchymal tissue surrounding the now-removed SDL was then collected (see revised Figure 5A and comment above), thus ensuring precise tissue separation during collection. We are convinced that such method is more efficient than manual tissue dissection previously done in the field. As suggested by the reviewers (see also other comment above), we now further detailed the laser microdissection procedure in the Results section and Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript (with drawings of laser microdissected areas, see above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- One reviewer strongly disagrees with the first sentence of the Abstract. According to this reviewer, &quot;Zebrafish is, I think now a conventional model and as most teleost fishes is a polyphyodont species.&quot; We therefore suggest you edit this sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that the <italic>zebrafish is a well-established model organism with polyphyodonty restricted to the pharyngeal</italic> dentition, but our sentence was in fact referring to both “polyphyodonty” and “oral dentition”. However, as suggested by the reviewers, we now clarified the first sentence of the Abstract as <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> also shows in fact a polyphyodont dentition on the upper jaws. Particularly, we now better emphasize the lack of lifelong replacement for oral dentition in most conventional models. We have also edited a similar sentence in the Discussion section (see first sentence).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- We suggest that the authors do not unite data coming from different animals, such as alligators and lizards, even though they might fall within a broader taxonomic group. We suggest the authors discuss all taxa separately.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment and have now edited the Introduction, Results section and Discussion section of the revised manuscript in order not to unite dental structures and/or specific data from different polyphyodont taxa like alligators and lizards.</p></body></sub-article></article>
