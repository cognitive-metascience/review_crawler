Populations isolated from around the world, migrated at angles to the magnetic vector that would optimize vertical translation in their native soil, with northern- and southern-hemisphere worms displaying opposite migratory preferences. Magnetic orientation and vertical migrations required the TAX-4 cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel in the AFD sensory neuron pair.

The orientation of the magnetic field relative to the Earth's surface varies around the globe, and is like the pattern adopted by iron filings around a bar magnet.</p><p>Many organisms, from bacteria to birds such as the Arctic Tern and mammals such as wolves, are able to exploit this variation in the Earth's magnetic field to help them navigate. In bacteria, this ability has been linked to the possession of tiny magnetic particles that align with the Earth's magnetic field lines. However, it is not clear how animals are able use the magnetic field to navigate.</p><p>Vidal-Gadea et al. have now obtained clues to this process from a surprising source, namely a soil-dwelling nematode worm called <italic>Caenorhabiditis elegans</italic>. Worms that were placed inside a gelatin-filled cylinder preferred to burrow downward, but exposure to an artificial magnetic field that in effect reversed the Earth's magnetic field caused them to burrow upward. By contrast, worms that had been well-fed burrowed in the opposite direction.</p><p>When worms were instead allowed to crawl across a flat surface with a parallel magnetic field, a map of the Earth's magnetic field revealed that the worms, which were originally from England but which were tested in the US, moved at an angle that would correspond—in England—to burrowing downwards when they were hungry and upwards when were not. Consistent with this, worms from Australia crawled in the opposite direction to English worms, setting off at an angle that would also be equivalent—in Australia—to downwards when hungry and upwards when full. Identical results were found for Hawaiian worms.</p><p>Worms from countries on the Equator were less sensitive to magnetic fields than their northern and southern counterparts; which suggests that the response is genetically encoded. And indeed, a survey of mutant worms with defects in different neurons uncovered a pair of sensory neurons called ‘AFD neurons’ that serve the purpose of a compass, and allow the animals to navigate using geomagnetism.</p><p>It remains unclear exactly how AFD neurons detect the Earth's magnetic field, and it is also not clear why hungry worms should burrow downwards while satisfied worms burrow upwards. One possibility is that hungry worms move downwards to feed on abundant but nutrient-poor bacteria growing on plant roots, whereas sated worms can afford to risk moving to the surface in search of more desirable, but less reliable, food sources. Future work could set out to test these explanations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07493.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07493.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>magnetosensation</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>nematode</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS075541</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pierce-Shimomura</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Undergraduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Kristi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>With the aid of a pair of sensory neurons, the nematode worm <italic>C. elegans</italic> is able to detect the Earth's magnetic field and use it to navigate towards food sources.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many organisms such as birds, butterflies and turtles use the magnetic field of the earth (geomagnetic field) to navigate across the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnsen and Lohmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guerra et al., 2014</xref>). Many animals migrate horizontally by preferentially using either the horizontal (e.g., salmon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quinn et al., 1981</xref>), or the vertical component of the earth's field (e.g., turtles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Light et al., 1993</xref>). By contrast, magnetotactic bacteria use the geomagnetic field to migrate roughly vertically by following the magnetic dip line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blakemore, 1975</xref>). Across hemispheres, magnetotactic bacteria reverse their polarity-seeking preference, thus conserving the adaptiveness of the response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blakemore et al., 1980</xref>).</p><p>Although much is known about magnetosensation in bacteria, the cellular and molecular basis for magnetosensation in animals is gaining in understanding. Recent progress has been made identifying central neurons that respond to magnetic fields (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu and Dickman, 2012</xref>). Moreover, advancements have also been made identifying candidate magnetosensory transduction mechanisms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gegear et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lauwers et al., 2013</xref>). Despite this progress, no magnetosensory neurons have been identified in any animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Edelman et al., 2015</xref>). Understanding how animals detect and use magnetic fields will allow us to better predict the behavior of magnetosensitive organisms, and will aid the study of how natural and artificial magnetic fields affect living systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engels et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We show for the first time that the soil nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> orients to earth-strength magnetic fields. This ability is required for vertical burrowing migrations directionally influenced by their satiation state. The direction and strength of the behavioral response to magnetic fields of wild-type strains isolated around the world correlated with their native magnetic field's inclination, and with the amplitude of the field's vertical (but not its horizontal) component. The AFD sensory neurons respond to earth-strength magnetic fields as observed by calcium imaging, and are necessary for magnetic orientation, and for vertical migrations. Expression of the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel, TAX-4, in AFD neurons is necessary for worms to engage in vertical migrations, to orient to artificial magnetic fields, and for the AFD neurons to activate in response to an earth-strength magnetic stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> engages in vertical burrowing migrations</title><p>While much is known about <italic>C. elegans</italic> crawling on agar surfaces, in the wild worms likely spend most of their time burrowing through their substrate.

Because worms are known to orient to a variety of sensory stimuli that vary with depth in their native soil niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braakhekke et al., 2013</xref>), we hypothesized that burrowing worms engage in vertical migrations like magnetotactic bacteria. To test this, we placed worms in the center of 20-cm long, agar-filled cylinders. Three layers of aluminum foil and a Faraday cage blocked light and electric fields respectively from penetrating the cylinders. Pipettes were then aligned horizontally in the ‘north-south’ or the ‘east-west’ directions, or vertically in the ‘up-down’ direction in the absence of artificial magnetic fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Directional preference during burrowing was quantified with a burrowing index computed as the difference between the number of worms reaching either side divided by the total number of worms reaching both sides. We found that when starved, the wild-type lab strain, N2, originally from Bristol, England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dougherty and Calhoun, 1948</xref>) preferentially migrated down in vertically oriented cylinders, but did not show a burrowing preference when cylinders were arranged horizontally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07493.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> engages in vertical migrations whose direction depends on satiation state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) To determine if <italic>C. elegans</italic> engaged in burrowing migrations we injected worms into agar-filled pipettes aligned horizontally (east-west and north-south), or vertically (up-down).

Dedicated DC power supplies for each coil (v) allowed us to control the orientation and the magnitude of the net magnetic field within the coil system. Assay plates (vi) were then placed inside the coil system for testing. We empirically calibrated the field within the coil system with the aid of a milligausmeter (vii) from AlphaLab Inc. (Utah, USA). (<bold>B</bold>) In each magnetic coil system experiment, the north direction of the imposed magnetic field is signified by the 0° on the top of the circular plot. Directly beneath this, and inside the circular plot, the strain's genetic background or geographic origin is indicated. The solid circular histograms represent the heading of the tested populations in a circle where the radius equals 10% of the entire population. Well-fed animals are represented by the black contour, while starved worms are represented by the grey contour. Circular plots had 18 bins (20° each). Similarly, the black and grey arrows represent the mean heading vector for the well-fed and starved populations respectively. The length of the vector is 0 if the population of animals migrated at random, and it is 1 if all animals migrate to a single point.

Alternatively, magnetotactic bacteria have been shown to use the earth's magnetic field to migrate up or down within the water column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blakemore, 1975</xref>). To help distinguish magnetotactic <italic>vs</italic> gravitactic mechanisms we built a magnetic coil system capable of producing homogeneous magnetic fields of any desired 3D orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our magnetic coil system is comprised of three independently-powered, orthogonal Merritt coil systems that allow the generation of magnetic fields of up to 3× earth strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Merritt et al., 1983</xref>). Within the 1-m<sup>3</sup> coil system, a smaller 20-cm<sup>2</sup> Faraday cage, made with copper fabric, protects the test volume from the electric field that is concomitantly created alongside the magnetic field. Though often ignored in studies on animal magnetic orientation, this precaution was necessary because <italic>C. elegans</italic> and other animals exhibit strong behavioral responses to electric fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25a">Gabel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manière et al., 2011</xref>).

Under these conditions, we expected that worms responding to gravitational cues would continue to migrate down, while worms responding to magnetic cues would reverse their direction and now migrate up.

We accomplished this within the test volume of the magnetic coil system using a magnetic field of equal strength and orientation to the field of the earth, but with opposite direction. Worms in this regiment experienced a net magnetic field of 0.000 Gauss in three dimensions. Under this condition animals migrated randomly, distributing evenly around the circumference of the assay plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We next produced a homogeneous magnetic field of 0.325 Gauss (corresponding to half of earth's maximum field intensity) directed across the assay plate. Worms assayed this way showed a biased distribution directed ∼120° to the imposed magnetic vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Increasing the field strength to match the earth's maximum field strength (0.650 Gauss) resulted in worms migrating approximately the same direction (132°) to the imposed vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Surprisingly, if worms were allowed to starve for just 30 min, they reversed their migratory distribution by ∼180°, now migrating at 305° relative to the field vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These results demonstrate that <italic>C. elegans</italic> does not migrate simply toward magnetic north like magnetotactic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frankel et al., 2006</xref>); rather, they display a preference to migrate at particular angles relative to magnetic north that depend on feeding state. Similar plasticity for opposite migration preferences in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has been documented for other sensory modalities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bretscher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Russell et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Do these seemingly arbitrary migratory angles serve a relevant purpose in the worm's soil niche? As mentioned earlier, the standard wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> lab strain (N2) was originally isolated in Bristol, England and cryogenically preserved there for distribution and study around the world. We turned to available geomagnetic data from NOAA to determine whether these migratory angles related to the earth's magnetic field in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maus et al., 2009</xref>). In Bristol, the earth's magnetic vector enters the ground (north pointing down) at approximately 66° of inclination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Thus, in Bristol, to optimally orient upward, a worm would need to migrate 156° to the magnetic field penetrating the earth (green arc in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,G</xref>); to optimally orient downward, a worm would need to migrate 336° to the magnetic field (brown arc in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). To determine whether the preferred migratory angles of starved and well-fed worms in our magnetic coil system assay matched these directions we performed a V test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batschelet, 1981</xref>). We found that the mean heading of fed worms (132°, N = 1268 animals) did not differ significantly from the upward direction for England (156.3°). Likewise, the mean heading of starved worms (304.6°, N = 1079 animals) did not differ significantly from the downward direction for England (336.3°). Please refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref> through 1e for descriptive and analytical statistics for all the data presented in this study.</p><p>These results predicted that worms use the earth's magnetic field to migrate at angles to the vector that would translate them up if they are fed, or down if they are starved. To test this hypothesis, we placed well-fed or starved worms in vertically arranged agar-filled pipettes away from artificial magnetic and electric fields as before. We found that, consistent with this idea, starved worms preferentially migrated down while well-fed worms migrated up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These results are parsimonious with <italic>C. elegans</italic> directing its vertical burrowing behavior by using the earth's geomagnetic field. Soil nematodes feed on bacteria associated with rotting fruit on the soil surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Félix and Braendle, 2010</xref>) and on root rhizobacteria deep in the soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horiuchi et al., 2005</xref>). Vertical migrations could be associated with travel between these distinct food sources.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Natural variation in magnetic orientation relates to geomagnetic inclination</title><p>Like magnetotactic bacteria, <italic>C. elegans</italic> has been isolated across the world. Magnetotactic bacteria from different hemispheres migrate in opposite directions to the field vector. Bacteria that inhabit the northern hemisphere (where magnetic north points down) are termed north-seeking magnetotactic bacteria, while those inhabiting the southern hemisphere (where magnetic south points down) are termed south-seeking magnetotactic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frankel et al., 2006</xref>). The distribution of different wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> isolates from around the world with distinct magnetic environments affords us a valuable opportunity to investigate how animals in magnetically distinct environments respond to magnetic fields. We therefore repeated our magnetic coil system and burrowing assays with wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> worms isolated from Adelaide (Australia) where the magnetic field of the earth is similar in strength and angle to that in England but differs in the key respect of having the opposite polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Unlike British worms, we found that Australian worms placed in a plate within our magnetic coil system migrated to an earth-strength field at 302.5° if fed, and 117.4° if starved. While oriented oppositely in preference from the angles displayed by the British N2 strain, these angles were similar in that they would also result in upward translation in Australia for fed animals and downward translation for starved ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref> respectively). To test if this response to an imposed artificial magnetic field reflected the migratory burrowing preference of worm in a natural magnetic field, we compared the burrowing behavior of Australian worms to that of the British strain. Paralleling our magnetic coil system results, we found that in our lab (located in Texas, USA) Australian worms migrated down when well-fed, and they migrated up when starved in the burrowing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Identical results were found for Hawaiian worms which migrated at angles that would optimally orient them up and down when satiated and starved in Hawaiian (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that unlike magnetotactic bacteria, which follow magnetic field lines during their migrations, worms migrate at angles to the imposed field that would result in optimal vertical translation in their native locations.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07493.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Magnetic orientation varies with satiation state and local field properties.</title><p>To investigate if worms from distinct locations around the world displayed different magnetic orientations we tested <italic>C. elegans</italic> isolated from Adelaide (Australia) where the magnetic field is similar to that of the lab strain (Bristol, England) in strength and inclination but opposite in polarity (<bold>A</bold>).

Unfortunately these experiments are limited to a few assays at the time, preventing their use in larger-scale behavioral screens. To mitigate this shortcoming, we developed a new assay using strong rare-earth magnets to quickly assess the ability of different strains to respond to imposed magnetic fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This assay allowed us to run many assays at the same time. Briefly, worms were placed at the center of an assay plate and allowed to migrate freely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, and ‘Materials and methods’). A magnet was then placed above one of two equidistant ‘goal’ areas. Magnetotactic performance was quantified with a magnetotaxis index computed as the difference between the number of worms reaching either goal divided by the number of worms reaching both goals. We found that when no magnet was present, worms distributed evenly between these two goals. However, if the magnet was present, worms preferentially migrated toward it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). To ensure the presence of the magnet did not introduce an unwanted thermal gradient, we recorded the temperature difference between goals in the presence and absence of a magnet and found that the two treatments did not significantly differ from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).

If <italic>C. elegans</italic> uses the magnetic field for vertical migrations, what happens near the equator where the vertical component of the earth's field is weakest? The global heterogeneity in field characteristics made us wonder if selection pressure for magnetosensation ability may drop off nearest the equator where the vertical component of the magnetic field is at its weakest. To test this, we used our magnet assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) on wild-type populations isolated from ten locations across the planet where the local magnetic field varies in inclination and vertical strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maus et al., 2009</xref>).

The horizontal component of the field, however, was a poor predictor of this magnetotactic ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The strong correlation between magnetotaxis performance, local field inclination, and vertical strength allowed us to successfully predict the magnetotaxis index of an additional wild-type isolate from California, USA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> red circle in panels B-E, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>).

These results are consistent with local adaptations to global magnetic field variations, and could perhaps be used to model how other species may respond to temporal field variations (such as magnetic polar drift or field reversals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cox et al., 1964</xref>).

One advantage of this technique is that only a fraction of individual worms will inherit the artificial chromosome carrying the transgene. This allowed us to compare the performance of sister worms grown and tested together under identical conditions and only differing in having or not said transgene. After each assay, individual worms with genetically ablated neurons were distinguished from their unaffected sisters by the co-expression of a fluorescent transgene reporter. We found that worms lacking the AFD sensory neurons failed to orient to an artificial magnetic field, while their unaffected sisters oriented normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). This could not be explained by non-specific defects, because these worms could move and orient normally to olfactory stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly ablating nearby sensory neuron pairs ASE and AWC had no effect on magnetotaxis.

In the absence of chemical synaptic or neuromodulatory inputs, the AFD neurons continued to respond to magnetic fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>). Qualitatively similar results (but higher in amplitude) were observed for worms that were partially restrained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

To quantitatively compare the magnetosensory response of AFD for different conditions and mutant backgrounds, we plotted the average GCamp3.0 intensity during the final 4 s of the magnetic stimulus relative to a 4-s baseline before presentation of the stimulus (for the no-stimulus control we used the same time window as for the other recordings). We found that the change in brightness was significantly greater than control for all test conditions except in the case of <italic>tax-4</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>).

Nematodes unexpectedly appear to use the AFD neurons to orient to earth-strength magnetic fields. <italic>C. elegans</italic> guides its vertical migrations using the geomagnetic field and adjusts preference for up or down depending on their satiation state. Population variability in magnetotactic ability correlates with global field properties: with worms from locations where the field is strong and vertical outperforming those where the field is weak and more horizontal. The AFD sensory neuron pair is necessary for magnetic orientation and for vertical migrations. Similarly, a cGMP-gated ion channel in the AFD neurons, TAX-4, is also necessary and sufficient for these behaviors. The role of the AFD sensory neurons in magneto-transduction is supported by their ability to respond to magnetic fields even in the absence of synaptic inputs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cellular and molecular substrates of magnetotransduction</title><p>There are many possible ways in which the AFD neurons may play a role in magnetic orientation. The magnetosensory AFD neurons also respond to temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mori, 1999</xref>), CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bretscher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2011</xref>), and moisture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Russell et al., 2014</xref>) gradients in a satiation-dependent manner. All of these parameters vary with depth in the soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jassal et al., 2005</xref>) supporting the role of the AFD neurons in vertical burrowing migrations. Because <italic>C. elegans</italic> performs magnetotaxis in darkness (assays were wrapped in 3-layers of foil), it is possible that it detects fields with nano-scale compasses made of biological magnetic material previously described in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cranfield et al., 2004</xref>), rather than by a light-dependent mechanism, although this study did not investigate this possibility. However, based on our behavioral, mutant, transgenic, and physiological analyses we hypothesize magnetic particles, perhaps such as those found in magnetotactic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frankel et al., 2006</xref>) and previously reported in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, may (either directly or indirectly) be associated with the anterior and posterior-directed microvilli of the AFD neurons. Magnetic stimulation of these structures could lead to activation of unspecified guanylyl cyclases (such as GCY-8, GCY-18, or GCY-23), in turn activating the TAX-4 channel and resulting in Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and cell depolarization. These findings could represent an intriguing lead into the putative magnetotransduction mechanism of the AFD neurons. It will be intriguing to investigate whether the diverse range of other magnetotactic animals employ magnetosensitive neurons with analogous morphology and transduction mechanisms as the AFD neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Use of the earth's magnetic field in vertical migrations</title><p>The magnetic field of the earth provides reliable directional and positional information to organisms capable of its detection. Aside from magnetotactic bacteria, magnetic orientation has been largely observed in animals that migrate horizontally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnsen and Lohmann, 2005</xref>). Our finding that vertical migrations by an animal may also be guided by this sensory modality opens a new niche for the study of magnetic navigation. Magnetotactic bacteria passively migrate along field lines: with south-seeking bacteria swimming down, and north-seeking bacteria swimming up in the southern and northern hemispheres respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frankel et al., 2006</xref>). Unlike bacteria, <italic>C. elegans</italic> does not follow the field vector but rather migrates at an angle that appears to maximize its vertical translation. The difference in migration angles and in response amplitude between wild-type isolates from around the world suggests that this sensory modality is under considerable selective pressure and will be the subject of future studies.</p><p>Our findings that the direction of vertical migrations could be reversed by an imposed magnetic field and that wild-type populations of worms from opposite hemispheres displayed opposite vertical migration preference strongly suggests that <italic>C. elegans</italic> relies on the geomagnetic field rather than gravity. Many organisms deduce their vertical orientation by using the earth's gravitational field (gravitaxis). Studies on paramecia suggest that the relative density of the organism against its media is instrumental in gravitaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuroda and Kamiya, 1989</xref>). For terrestrial and marine animals, the relative density of their media (air and water respectively) is largely constant. However, for nearly buoyant worms imbedded in a soil matrix, the relative density of their surrounding media is highly variable and may preclude reliance on gravitaxis.</p><p>Many magnetotactic bacteria use a mechanism known as ‘polar magneto-aerotaxis’ where these cells preferentially migrate up or down in chemically stratified water or sediment columns using an single sensory pathway to integrate magnetotaxis and aerotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blakemore et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frankel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Popp et al., 2014</xref>). Like <italic>C. elegans</italic>, polar magneto-aerotactic bacteria from different hemispheres have adapted their polarity preference to match their native environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blakemore, 1975</xref>). It appears that the role of magnetotaxis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as in bacteria, may be to increase the efficiency of taxis to other sensory cues by reducing a search problem from three dimensions to one. Unlike bacteria which migrate along the dip line at an angle relative to the vertical direction, however, <italic>C. elegans</italic> appears to align motion at an angle to the magnetic field that would enable a more vertical trajectory in its native environment. Our finding that the strains from England, Australia and Hawaii each displayed a preferred magnetic orientation preference that matched the geomagnetic field orientation at their source of isolation rather than the one at the experimental site (Texas, USA) suggests a genetic encoding of magnetic orientation preference.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Magnetic orientation preference correlates with the physiological state attained by the animals</title><p>From previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bretscher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Russell et al., 2014</xref>), it is clear that satiation affects the sign of the response to sensory stimuli that the AFD neurons respond to. However, our experiments did not provide evidence to answer why fed worms migrate up and starved worms migrate down. One possibility concerns the vertical stratification of food sources. <italic>C. elegans</italic> eats bacteria growing on rotting fruit on the soil's surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Félix and Braendle, 2010</xref>), and also root rhizobacteria deep in the soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horiuchi et al., 2005</xref>). Vertical migrations may direct travel between these segregated food sources following the marginal value theorem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carnov, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Milward et al., 2011</xref>). Rotting fruit on the surface represents an extremely rich, but transient, food supply. By contrast, rhizobacteria represent a low-quality but stable source of food. Surface populations likely grow exponentially until they exhaust their resources. For a starved worm on the surface, burrowing down would be adaptive because it leads to rhizobacteria in the plant roots. Rhizobacteria, however, represent a lower quality food source. From here, fed worms may venture to emerge in search of better and more plentiful food. Worms on poor diets have been shown to be more likely to abandon the relative safety of their food patch in an attempt to find a higher quality source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</xref>). For these worms, an adaptive locomotor strategy would be to burrow up in search of higher quality food sources, as burrowing down would not be likely to result in finding a higher quality food patch. Future experimental studies will distinguish between these and other possibilities by mimicking specific soil conditions.</p><p>Many animal species (including other nematodes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prot, 1980</xref>) engage in vertical soil migrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Price and Benham, 1977</xref>). Therefore magnetic orientation may be more widespread than previously believed. While the scale and nature of magnetosensation make it challenging to study in large animals with extensive ranges, the small size, genetic tractability, and research amenability of <italic>C. elegans</italic> make it an optimal model to begin to unlock potentially conserved cellular-molecular mechanisms by which animals detect and orient to the magnetic field of the earth.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Test location</title><p>All worms were raised and tested at The University of Texas at Austin, Texas, USA (30° 20′ N 97° 45′ W) between 2011 and 2014.

We used the latter to clean the worms off bacteria, and to transfer worms to the center of a 1-day old, 10-cm diameter, chemotaxis-agar assay plate. Equidistant from the worms, we drew 3.5-cm circles on either side and placed 1-μl drops of 1-M NaN<sub>3</sub> at the center of these circles to immobilize and count any worm that reached the area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A N42 Neodymium 3.5-cm diameter magnet (K&amp;J Magnetics Inc., Pennsylvania, USA) was placed above one of the circles so that the assay plate was now traversed by a vertical magnetic field gradient that became stronger toward the magnet and weaker away from it. (Note that more commonly found weaker strength magnets produced qualitatively the same behavioral results.) Worms were released from the liquid NGM droplet by wicking excess liquid with filter paper. The total manipulation time (from bacterial lawn to the beginning of the assay) was kept under 10 min to avoid inadvertently starving the worms. Worms released from the liquid NGM became able to freely migrate around the plate. After 30 min we counted the number of worms NaN<sub>3</sub>-paralyzed in each circle and calculated the magnetic orientation index (MI) as: MI = (M − C)/(M + C). Where M is the number of worms paralyzed within the magnet's circle, C is the number of worms paralyzed within the control circle. We repeated the test a minimum of 10 times for each population (please refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A,C–E</xref> for the number of assays and worms used in each experiment). The absence of artificial magnetic fields and temperature gradients were empirically determined before each assay with DC Milligauss Meter Model MGM magnetometer (AlphaLab, Utah, USA) and two high accuracy Fisher thermometers accurate to 1/100 of a degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). Assays were run over multiple days and across a range of temperatures (19–21° Celsius). To ensure that unaccounted gradients in the room did not affect the assays, we ran multiple assays in parallel. We arranged assay plates so that their magnetic gradients were not aligned with one another or with the magnetic field of the earth. In this configuration, the magnetic field on the plate surface ranged between 40 and 2900 Gauss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>To test if worms could perform magnetotaxis in the dark, we wrapped assay plates in heavy-duty aluminum foil at least three layers thick.

A 22 cm<sup>3</sup>, copper fabric, Faraday cage around the test volume prevented electric fields from interfering with our assays. Each of the three coil systems was orthogonal to the other two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and was independently powered by Maxtra Adjustable 30V 5A DC power supplies. We used a DC Milligauss Meter Model MGM from Alphalab Inc. (Utah, USA) to measure the magnetic field inside the coil system before and after each experiment. Before the start of each experiment, the system was used to neutralize the magnetic field of the earth within the coil system by creating a field of equal strength and opposite orientation. A single 10-cm diameter, agar-filled plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ward, 1973</xref>), with ∼50 worms in its center, was placed in the center of the coil system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To immobilize and count the worms that reached the plate's edge, we placed a 10-μl ring of 0.1-M NaN<sub>3</sub> anesthetic in the agar around circumference of the plate. We next closed the Faraday cage and allowed the worms to migrate freely within the plate with a homogeneous earth-strength (0.325 and 0.650 Gauss) magnetic field aligned with the plane of the assay plate. Alternatively, we allowed worms to migrate in plates when the effective magnetic field inside the coil system was 0.000 Gauss (earth-neutralized). After an hour, the angle at which each worm had migrated with respect to the imposed field vector was recorded. To ensure that the worms were responding to the generated magnetic field, and not to some unknown gradient in the room, all assays were run in darkness with the direction of the imposed magnetic field, and also the orientation of the magnetic coil system was varied between trials with respect to the room and the earth's magnetic north. All experiments were conducted blind with experimenter unaware of strain genotype.</p><p>In addition to magnetic and electric fields, the wires of coil system also produce a small degree of heat.

We next calculated the magnetic orientation (or burrowing) index for each subpopulation of worms. This ensured that the comparisons were made between genetically identical populations that had grown under identical conditions, their only difference being whether or not they carried the extrachromosomal array. Expression of GCaMP3.0 did not interfere with ability to perform magnetotaxis to an artificial magnet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Calcium imaging in restrained animals</title><p>Day-1 adult wild-type (and mutant) worms expressing the calcium-activity reporter GCaMP3 in neurons of interest were loaded with liquid NGM into a microfluidic chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Worms were immobilized and imaged in an Olympus BX51 scope at ×60 magnification. Images were sampled at 3.5–8 Hz using a CoolSNAP ES camera run by Windwiew 32. Each run lasted 50 s and begun with a 12.5 s of baseline followed by the presentation of a 6-s sinusoidal magnetic stimulus, and a 31.5-s recovery period. Consecutive recordings were made 3–5 min apart. A N42 Neodymium 3.5-cm diameter magnet (K&amp;J Magnetics Inc., Pennsylvania, USA) was used to deliver the magnetic stimulus. The intensity of the stimulus was calibrated with a DC Milligauss Meter Model MGM magnetometer (AlphaLab, Utah, USA). The putative role of the magnetic sensor in the worm is to detect the direction of the magnetic field. It therefore follows that the cell must have an optimal stimulation angle between its sensor and the surrounding field. Because we could not infer what this optimal alignment angle may be, we decided to rotate the stimulus vector throughout 360° to ensure that each worm was stimulated with its presumably optimal angle. We did this by rotating the magnet along the xy plane followed by the xz plane at a rate of 2 Hz. A series of TIFF files was exported into ImageJ where the brightness of the cell body was measured across each photo series. The average soma brightness accounting for bleaching was calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kerr and Schafer, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Calcium imaging in partially restrained animals</title><p>Worms expressing GCaMP3 were incubated as described above and placed along with 3-μl liquid NGM on a 10% agar pad on a microscope slide with the coverslip pressed down to inhibit swimming, but permit slow crawling. Neurons were only imaged when the cells remained in the focal plane for the duration of the experiment. We placed the slide in an upright Olympus BX53 microscope equipped with and Retiga 2000R Fast 1394 camera (Q-Imaging, BC, Canada). Worms were illuminated with a Series 1200 UV light source (X-cite, Cincinnati, Ohio). We took a series of four pictures before, during, and after exposing the setup, for 10 s, to a 60 Gauss magnetic field generated by a Neodymium magnet. The Tiff files of the images were exported as 8-bit files. We used ImagePro 6.0 (MediaCybernetics, Rockville, MD) to measure the brightness of the soma in each picture series. We averaged the eight images before and after magnet exposure and compared this value to the average soma brightness of the four images taken during magnet exposure. We reported the percent change in brightness of the test condition to the average of before and after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Image manipulations</title><p>All plots were graphed using SigmaPlot 12 (Aspire Software) and Matlab R2013b (Mathworks).

Comparisons appear in the order that they were introduced in the text. Two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed between normally distributed groups that had equal variance to test the difference between the populations' means. The Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient was used to determine the correlation between variables. To test difference between means belonging to non-normally distributed samples we used the non-parametric Mann–Whitney ranked sum test. All statistic measures are from comparisons with the group shaded in grey immediately above. Index refers to the mean (magnetic or burrowing) index for each population (see ‘Materials and methods’).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the field of magnetoreception in animals mechanisms suggested have been either magnetite or the radical pair mechanism of magnetoreception. However, neither the precise location of the magnetosensor nor its mechanism of action has been clearly elucidated in any animal to date. The data presented here convincingly show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> can use the Earth's magnetic field for its vertical “migrations” and that those migrations are influenced by satiation state; the movements are random when the field is cancelled and are clearly responsive to changes in inclination angle and intensity. These data provide rigorous, compelling data suggesting <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a new genetic system for studying magnetoreception.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree enthusiastically that this is an elegant demonstration of magnetoreception in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that has evolved to produce a clear magnetic sense. Their data show that the magnetosensor is housed in the AFD sensory neurons although the actual magnetosensing element is not yet identified. The persistence of magnetic orientation related to the origin of the species tested (e.g., Bristol) should be mentioned as suggesting genetic encoding of the magnetosensation.</p><p>Two negative controls would add to the paper:</p><p>For role of AFD: were there any experiments rescuing <italic>tax-2/tax-4</italic> in other neurons it is normally expressed in (other than AFD) or in neurons not normally expressing the channel and showing that they could not respond to magnetic fields? This relates to the necessity and sufficiency of AFD and/or <italic>tax-2/tax-4</italic>. If not, mention the possibility of other neurons playing a role.</p><p>For calcium imaging: in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref> the authors have recorded from AWC and found it was not activated by magnetic fields. This is an important negative control and should be presented in a main figure as it shows that not all neurons respond to magnetic fields—an important point in the authors' arguments that AFD is the critical neuron for this behavior.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07493.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers agree enthusiastically that this is an elegant demonstration of magnetoreception in</italic> C. elegans <italic>that has evolved to produce a clear magnetic sense.

We have added the sentence “Our finding that the strains from England, Australia and Hawaii each displayed a preferred magnetic orientation preference that matched the geomagnetic field orientation at their source of isolation rather than the one at the experimental site (Texas, USA) suggests a genetic encoding of magnetic orientation preference” to the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Two negative controls would add to the paper</italic>:</p><p><italic>For role of AFD: were there any experiments rescuing</italic> tax-2/tax-4 <italic>in other neurons it is normally expressed in (other than AFD) or in neurons not normally expressing the channel and showing that they could not respond to magnetic fields?

To test this idea, we tested whether rescue of the <italic>tax-4</italic> gene in sensory neuron classes other than AFD rescued magnetic orientation behaviors. This strain was kindly provided by Dr. Ralf Baumeister. We found that although other <italic>tax-4</italic> dependent phenotypes were rescued (diacetyl chemotaxis), magnetic orientation behaviors were not rescued in this strain. Please find these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. This provides additional evidence for the AFD neurons playing a major role in magnetosensation.</p><p><italic>For calcium imaging: in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1"><italic>Figure 7–figure supplement 1</italic></xref> <italic>the authors have recorded from AWC and found it was not activated by magnetic fields.

We performed additional calcium imaging of the AWC neurons and added this data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J and K</xref>. AWC did not show a significant change when presented with magnetic stimuli consistent with the idea that the AFD neurons represent the primary magnetosensory neurons.</p></body></sub-article></article>
