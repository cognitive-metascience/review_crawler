which forms temporary pores in the membrane and allows delivery of virtually any fluorescent probes, ranging from labeled IgG’s to small ligands, with high efficiency (&gt;85% of cells). The whole process, including recovery, takes 30 min, and the cell is ready to be imaged immediately. A variety of cell viability tests were performed after treatment with SLO to ensure that the cells have intact membranes, are able to divide, respond normally to signaling molecules, and maintains healthy organelle morphology. When combined with Oxyrase, a cell-friendly photostabilizer, a ~20x improvement in fluorescence photostability is achieved. By adding in glutathione, fluorophores are made to blink, enabling super-resolution fluorescence with 20–30 nm resolution over a long time (~30 min) under continuous illumination. Example applications in conventional and super-resolution imaging of native and transfected cells include p65 signal transduction activation, single molecule tracking of kinesin, and specific labeling of a series of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein complexes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20378.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20378.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Fluorescence</kwd><kwd>super-resolution imaging</kwd><kwd>single molecule</kwd><kwd>live-cell imaging</kwd><kwd>HaloTag</kwd><kwd>nanobody</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF PHY-1430124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teng</surname><given-names>Kai Wen</given-names></name><name><surname>Ishitsuka</surname><given-names>Yuji</given-names></name><name><surname>Ren</surname><given-names>Pin</given-names></name><name><surname>Youn</surname><given-names>Yeoan</given-names></name><name><surname>Ge</surname><given-names>Pinghua</given-names></name><name><surname>Selvin</surname><given-names>Paul R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH GM108578</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teng</surname><given-names>Kai Wen</given-names></name><name><surname>Ishitsuka</surname><given-names>Yuji</given-names></name><name><surname>Ren</surname><given-names>Pin</given-names></name><name><surname>Youn</surname><given-names>Yeoan</given-names></name><name><surname>Ge</surname><given-names>Pinghua</given-names></name><name><surname>Selvin</surname><given-names>Paul R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH GM58460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deng</surname><given-names>Xiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Belmont</surname><given-names>Andrew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A toxin is used to introduce an otherwise cell-impermeant fluorophore-antibody (or some thing which is equally specific) to bind to an intracellular protein which allows for super resolution imaging and single particle tracking inside the living cell.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fluorescence microscopy of the living cells is often achieved through specific labeling of proteins by antibody, nanobody, or bio-specific ligand conjugated to a fluorophore. However, most of these bio-molecules and fluorophores are not able to cross the cell membrane of a living cell, making it challenging to image intracellular proteins. There are a few exceptions to this barrier, namely, by using few selected cell-permeant fluorophores that have been attached to membrane-permeant entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lukinavičius et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wombacher et al., 2010</xref>). These have obvious trade-offs of limited choice in emission wavelengths and available class of ligands that they can be covalently attached to and maintain their selectivity for the particular intracellular protein. There has also been mixed success in delivering fluorescent probes by appending a membrane-permeant small peptide such as the TAT-TAR HIV peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Silhol et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Richard et al., 2002</xref>). Another method to overcome the permeability issue is by transfecting the cells with plasmid DNA encoding the intracellular protein of interest appended to a fluorescent protein (FP). Nonetheless, there are many cases where such transfection is not possible or not desirable. In addition, the detection of FPs is less than optimal because of their limited photostability.</p><p>Other methods that attempt to overcome this limitation include microinjection, electroporation and osmotic pinosomelysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Okada and Rechsteiner, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Crawford et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhang et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). However, these techniques have significant drawbacks such as low throughput and the requirement of additional apparatus. Finally, two recently developed methods, such as ‘biophotonic laser-assisted surgery tool (BLAST)’ and ‘cell squeezing’ are promising techniques, although they require the cells to be cultured in specific platforms like fabricated surface or microfluidic channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kollmannsperger et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we make use of the well-known pore-forming bacterial toxin streptolysin O (SLO) to label intracellular proteins in mammalian cells for fluorescence microscopy applications. In the past, SLO has been used for delivering fluorescently labeled proteins—but not targeted to specific proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Walev et al., 2001</xref>). SLO has also been used with transfected cells to deliver a small lanthanide probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rajapakse et al., 2010</xref>). It has also been used for labeling RNA with ‘molecular beacons’ or a streptavidin-RNA probe, and also to introduce (non-fluorescent) ligands through the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nitin and Bao, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Santangelo et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we present a general method for labeling intracellular proteins in transfected or non-transfected cells, in the nucleus or the cytoplasm, with probes ranging in size from small (~2 kDa) molecules to large proteins (up to 150 kDa), for either general or super-resolved fluorescence microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reversible permeabilization using pore-forming toxin for delivering fluorescent probes</title><p>We applied SLO to permeabilized the cells, creating pores of ~30 nm in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Stewart et al., 2015</xref>) in order to deliver fluorescent probes for labeling intracellular proteins in a site-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). First, we permeabilized the cells with SLO at 37°C for 7–10 min depending on the cell confluency, followed by incubation with the fluorescent probes (i.e., fluorophores by themselves, or covalently attached to a ligand or a protein) for 5 min on ice. Excess probes were then removed by a washing step; then a ‘complete medium’, supplemented with ATP, GTP, and glucose, was added to reseal the membrane (see Materials and methods for specific details). The cells were then allowed to recover in the incubator at 37°C for 15–20 min. For super-resolution microscopy, namely direct-STORM (dSTORM), 4 mM glutathione and 0.5 U/mL of Oxyrase were added to create blinking fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Heilemann et al., 2008</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20378.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fluorescent labeling of proteins inside the living cell with high efficiency.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of permeabilization, delivery, for reversible permeabilization using streptolysin O (SLO) on live CHO-K1 cells. Cells are exposed to SLO for 7–10 min before incubating with the three different fluorescent probes (DAPI, phalloidin-Alexa647, and anti-PMP70-ATTO488) on ice for 5 min.

The CHO-K1 cells were recovered in different buffers after permeabilization. Only recovery media and 10% FBS DMEM successfully excluded the cells from PI staining. Only recovery media and 10% FBS DMEM successfully resealed the cells to prevent PI staining. The recovery media is not significantly better than 10% DMEM in terms of repairing the cell membrane. We observed that there is an initial loss of some metabolites from inside the permeabilized cells. This is evident from the fact that a larger proportion of molecular motors were immobile along the microtubules in severely permeabilized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3b</xref>). The effect from the lost metabolites can be rescued by using our recovery media which is supplemented with essential metabolites (ATP, GTP and glucose), but not with 10% FBS DMEM.

Cells that are permeabilized by SLO and labeled by the fluorescent probes should show nucleus stained by DAPI, actin filament stained by phalloidin-Alexa647, and peroxisomes stained by anti-PMP70-ATTO488. Fluorescence images of SLO treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) revealed 94% (15 out of 16 cells) of the cells in the field of view contains nuclear staining by DAPI, 88% of the cells contains clear and punctate structure of labeled peroxisomes, and 88% of the cells showed filamentous structure of the actin – a stark contrast to SLO untreated negative control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In addition, field of views other than the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> were counted, and the result shows similar degree of permeabilization with a standard deviation of 8% (<italic>N = 49 cells</italic>). To confirm the membrane integrity after recovery, SLO-treated cells were incubated for 5 min with Texas Red dextran, (~20 kDa), a normally membrane-impermeant fluorescent molecule. The membrane of recovered cells efficiently excluded Texas Red dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In contrast, the negative control cells that were not treated with SLO, showed no fluorescence signal until cells were permeabilized by SLO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The health of the cells after permeabilization is a universal problem in any methods attempting to compromise the cell membrane. In this study, we performed several cell viability assays to demonstrate that the cells remain viable after recovering from SLO permeabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We showed that close to 95% of cells had intact membrane after recovery when recovered in proper buffers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>); that the cells were able to divide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>); and the cellular organelle displayed comparable morphology before and after SLO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>).</p><p>Aside from the cell viability tests performed above, we performed a translocation assay on the transcription factor p65 fused with GFP on the N-terminus, in human cancer cell line (HeLa). This would demonstrate that signal transduction events still occurred at a normal level after SLO treatment and fluorophore labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Los et al., 2008</xref>). The cells were permeabilized and intracellular p65 was labeled with an anti-GFP single-domain antibody (known as GBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ries et al., 2012</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). When the protein TNF-α is added to the media, p65 migrates into the nucleus; if the nuclear export inhibitor-Leptomycin B (LMB) is also added, the effect is enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Los et al., 2008</xref>). This is exactly what was quantitatively observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This p65-translocation result shows that the level of response to TNF-α in SLO-treated cells is comparable to untreated cells. Hence, the technique may be applied to perform similar assay on primary culture or cell lines for high-throughput drug screening.</p><p>To test the possibility of using SLO for delivering fluorescent probes ranging from &lt;1 kDa to ~150 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), we transfected the cells with plasmid encoding Halotag-GFP-ActA, a protein that binds to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Consequently, Halotag and GFP are present facing outside of the mitochondrial membrane and are accessible to our fluorescent probes. Fluorescence image of the GFP on the mitochondrial membrane (mitochondrial-GFP) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>. The Halotag was labeled with a cell-impermeant dye conjugated to chloroalkane, or with a biotinylated chloroalkane bound to fluorescently labeled streptavidin. Alternatively, the GFP was labeled with a GBP (a 14 kDa single domain nanobody specific to GFP), or dye-labeled-antibody (IgG). With SLO permeabilization, all of the cell-impermeant probes tested—chloroalkane-Alexa660 (&lt;1 kDa), GBP-ATTO647N (~14 kDa), chloroalkane-biotin-streptavidin-ATTO647N (~56 kDa), and Anti-GFP IgG-labels (~150 kDa)—which varied in size from &lt;1 KDa to ~150 kDa—were able to specifically label the mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20378.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Labeling cellular proteins with a variety of probes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Delivery of different sized fluorescent probes for specific labeling of intracellular proteins.

Here, we used the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), bound to GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We found that GBP-ATTO647N (~14 kDa) was able to passively diffuse across the nuclear membrane, or diffuse through the nucleus pore complex, in order to label the nuclear proteins PCNA-GFP. In a separate test we found that 40 kDa FITC-dextran was able to access nucleus as well. (The fluorescence of FITC-dextran is homogenously distributed across the nucleus and cytoplasm.) In contrast, probes larger than GBP, such as streptavidin (labeled SA, 53 kDa) or 70 kDa FITC-dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>), were not able to passively diffuse across the nuclear membrane. This cut-off for passive diffusion between 40–56 kDa is consistent with the known size-limit for diffusion into nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Grünwald et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, we discovered that using small probes, &lt;2 kDa, resulted in background-free labeling—that is, the unbound probe diffused out during the recovery phase. On the other hand, ‘large’ molecules, &gt;20 kDa dextran or other similar-sized proteins, remained in the cytoplasm, creating evenly distributed fluorescence across the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Apparently, the pore formed by SLO allows the fluorescently labeled proteins free access to entering the cell, while allowing free access for exit only for relatively small (&lt;2 kDa) proteins. To explain this observation, we hypothesize that some of the larger probes do get washed out, but not fast enough before the membrane starts to heal, and only smaller probes are given enough time to be diffuse out completely. This background-free staining makes permeabilization by SLO advantageous over other methods like microinjection or microporation, where free probes cannot be washed away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hennig et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the required concentration of fluorescent chloroalkane with SLO-treated cells was a factor of ten lower than that recommended by the manufacturer. This might be because the manufacturer’s means of getting the ligand into the cell depends on setting up a concentration gradient across the cell membrane, whereas none is necessary with SLO.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Application of pore-forming toxin delivery in Super-Resolution imaging</title><p>We also demonstrate the ability to observe live cell dynamics with dSTORM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Heilemann et al., 2008</xref>) by looking at live U2OS human cancer cells with cell-impermeant Alexa647-Phalloidin. To cause photo-blinking necessary for dSTORM, the oxygen concentration must be kept low and a thiol-containing reducing agent must be present. 4 mM glutathione and the commercially available Oxyrase (an oxygen scavenger compatible with live cell imaging) were therefore added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). We measured actin dynamics for 20,000 frames at 100 ms time resolution, for a total time of 33 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Such tremendous photostability was the result of Oxyrase and glutathione; without them, fewer activations of Alexa647 were observed in response to a 405 nm laser.

FPs works very well for visualizing ensemble of proteins in cell, and constructs of FPs attached to numerous intracellular protein of interest have already been made. However, it remains difficult to study these proteins down to a single molecule level from the fluorescence signal of individual FPs due to low brightness and photostability. The goal here is to label FPs with nanobodies conjugated to dyes with photostability superior to the FPs. For instance, we show that the signal can be improved ~6-fold by detecting the signal of GBP-ATTO647N than the GFP itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a–b</xref>). Using this method, we can perform single molecule studies on a vast library of existing protein constructs with FP attached by using just FP binding nanobodies conjugated to a fluorophore with better photostability and brightness. Note that attaching multiple dyes per probe can potentially enhance the signal further; here, most of the nanobodies had one organic dye. Using this method, we tracked single kinesin molecules in the cytoplasm of U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). We transfected the cells with 2x-mCherry-kinesin (K560), a truncated version of dimeric kinesin-1 with two mCherry’s per kinesin monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Norris et al., 2015</xref>). Based on the fluorescence of mCherry alone, it is difficult to track a single kinesin protein in vivo, due to both the poor SNR of mCherry and the high background fluorescence created by out-of-focus FPs at different z-positions in the cytoplasm. Here, we enhance the kinesin signal by delivering RFP binding nanobody (RBP-ATTO647N), which binds specifically to mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3c</xref>). Labeled individual kinesins can now easily be detected; an example trace is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, and an example cell showing moving kinesins labeled with ATTO647N-RBP is shown <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>.

Both the run length and velocity agrees with the in vitro data on single kinesin at 30°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kawaguchi and Ishiwata, 2000</xref>). In addition, we have performed the experiment at room temperature, and indeed we observed a decrease in kinesin velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3d–e</xref>). Thus, using this technique we were able to track otherwise difficult to observe single molecules in vivo, and allowed us to study the biophysical properties of molecular motors in the cytoplasm of living cells.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-20378-media2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20378.011</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Single molecule detection of individual mCherry kinesin using ATTO647N labeled anti-RFP nanobody.</title><p>Real time is displayed at the bottom right hand corner of the movie in min:sec, the movie is played back in 3x the speed compared to real time.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20378.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20378.011</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We report the application of SLO permeabilization for high-throughput labeling of intracellular proteins, and the visualization of their dynamics in various biological systems. Importantly, we have applied SLO to label cells without transfection. This is achieved by labeling intracellular proteins with antibodies, nanobodies, and bio-specific ligands. This technique has tremendous application for avoiding artifacts caused by over-expression due to transfection. Furthermore, we create an environment for generating photoswitchable and photostable fluorophores in vivo for dSTORM, and enhance the signal of FPs for single particle tracking. Our SLO delivery technique can easily be combined with other signal enhancement techniques, such as ‘spaghetti monster’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Viswanathan et al., 2015</xref>), for delivering otherwise membrane impermeant probes into living cells for labeling a single protein with numerous probes at once. Lastly, this technique is not limited to delivering of fluorescent probes; the technique can potentially be extended to other types of microscopy that relies on probe delivery, such as cryo-electron microscopy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>CHO-K1 cells were grown in F12K (Fisher-Mediatech) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI FBS; Life Technologies) and 100 U/mL of penicillin plus 10 µg/mL streptomycin (PS; Corning).

For PCNA-GFP used in the study, pcDNA3_NLS_eGFP_hPCNA was derived from pENeGFPPCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Leonhardt et al., 2000</xref>); eGFP-PCNA was cut from pENeGFPPCNA with BamHI and XbaI and cloned into pcDNA3 cut with HindIII and XbaI using an adapter (AGCTTATGGCTTCGTGGGGATC) to reconstruct the correct start codon for eGFP-PCNA. Unless specified otherwise, the permeabilization procedure was done on cells after overnight transfection. 2xmCherry-K560 plasmid was a gift from Verhey Lab (U. Michigan).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Fluorescence microscopy</title><p>Fluorescence and super-resolution microscopy are performed on a Nikon Ti Eclipse microscope with 100X objective (CFI Apo TIRF 100x Oil, N.A. 1.49, Nikon). Excitation lasers (MLC400B, Agilent Technologies, 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm and 640 nm) were used for exciting different fluorescent probes. The images were recorded in an EMCCD (iXon DU-897E, Andor). A quad-band dichroic (ZT405-488-561-640RPC, Chroma) was used for reflectance of the excitation laser and transmission of fluorescence. The emission filter choices were 525/50 (DAPI, GFP, ATTO488), 600/50 (mCherry, Texas Red, PI), or 700/75 (Alexa647, ATTO647N). The live cell samples were imaged inside a 30°C temperature controlled chamber (InVivo Scientific) unless otherwise noted. The static conventional fluorescence images shown were averages of 10 frames taken at 50–100 ms, except for the kinesin experiment, where the spots were rapidly moving so a single frame image was shown. The cells were imaged in 10% FBS DMEM P/R free medium on a glass-bottom dish.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>p65 translocation assay</title><p>For p65 translocation assay, HeLa cell was transiently transfected with p65-GFP. 48 hr post-transfection, the cell was permeabilized with SLO, and the cells were labeled with and GBP-ATTO647N. After the cell recovered from SLO permeabilization, the cells were serum—starved in DMEM for 4 hr prior to TNF-α (10 ng/mL) and Leptomycin B (LMB, 2 µM) treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>dSTORM with cell impermeant probe</title><p>U2OS cells were permeabilized using the protocol mentioned above. 330 nM of phalloidin-Alexa647 were loaded after permeabilization. The cells were recovered in recovery media plus 4 mM final concentration of glutathione. After the recovery from SLO permeabilization, 7.5 mL of complete media without phenol red was filled to the top of the glass bottom dish to reduce the contact of media with air. ~100 µL of Oxyrase stock solution (Oxyrase, Inc.) and 20 mM final concentration of sodium DL-lactate were added to the cell media. A series of images were recorded after the addition of Oxyrase up to a total of 2 hr. The activation laser was 405 nm (0.5 to 7.5 μW power post-objective), and Alexa647 was de-activated by shining 640 nm laser (600 μW power post-objective). For dynamic dSTORM movie, 20,000 frames were recorded per cell at 100 ms exposure time per frame. The single molecule detection analysis was done using Matlab-based algorithm, alivePALM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Kinesin labeling and tracking in live cell</title><p>U2OS cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA encoding 2xmCherry K560 for 2.5–4 hr. Post-transfection the cells were permeabilized with SLO as described above. The cells were then labeled with 150x dilution of stock red fluorescent protein binding nanobody (RBP-ATTO647N, Chromotek). For each cell, a 300 frames movie was recorded using 200 ms exposure time. Spots that move processively for ≥3 frames without running into another molecule were cropped from the movie. For localization, the point spread function was fit to a 2D Gaussian distribution, and the position is given by the center. Localization accuracy is typically ~20 nm. The kinesin positions are rotated to linearize the displacement in one dimension. The velocity and run length is determined from the position and time of the first to last frame. In majority of our traces, the kinesin travels for &lt;10 frames without pauses.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was in part supported by NSF

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Reviewing Editor and the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper Teng at al. develop a simple reversible mammalian cell permeabilization assay to deliver various fluorescent reagents to living cells. By forming small pores with the toxin Streptolysin O the authors are able to introduce probes from the extracellular solution. The authors go to great lengths to show that the labeling is efficient and does not perturb the basic biology of the cells (cell division and organelle health). In general this method will be very useful for the microscopy and biophysics community. It could become a standard labeling method. There are many applications where an easy delivery method would be useful. These include microscopy of living cells, structural mapping of proteins with FRET, drug delivery, etc.</p><p>This paper is quite straightforward and well done and we really only have several relatively small criticisms and suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Do some of the data (e.g., viability results) depend on the batch or source of the SLO? Or does this need to be determined anew each time SLO was ordered? I was particularly interested in this since I noticed this afternoon some suppliers sell SLO by weight rather than by units (and don't provide the activity of their SLO).</p><p>2) Can the authors comment about whether or not this method allows uptake of small quantum dots? The authors previously synthesized small quantum dots attached to nano bodies (see Wang et al., 2014) so it seems like this would be easy to test. A lot of people would be interested in ways to get Q-Dots inside live cells.</p><p>3) We really don't like the last two sentences of the Conclusion since they refer to possible applications that aren't discussed in the present manuscript so the data can't be evaluated. Those sentences should be removed and replaced with something much less specific.</p><p>4) The figure legends for the supplemental data need to be improved. Splitting each figure into individual, lettered panels would help.</p><p>5) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>. We are not sure that we agree that the authors enhanced the signal of a fluorescent protein using their method. The fluorescence of GFP was not improved, rather a protein harboring a completely different fluorophore was targeted to GFP, and it is expected that Atto647N would be much brighter than GFP. This is no different than targeting a fluorescently labeled antibody to any other protein.</p><p>6) The authors state that one of the concerns about existing methods such as microinjection or electroporation is &quot;concern over the cell health&quot;. Surely this is also a concern with any application of SLO as well? While the authors show data that their cells are healthy after every SLO treatment, I would think that this needs to be double-checked with every new cell type tested using this method.</p><p>7) The images are quite small and hard to see. Because the main point of the paper is the quality and efficiency of labeling we would suggest showing larger images and larger fields of view. This is particularly important as the level of background labeling is a key issue in evaluating this work.</p><p>8) Reference of Kollmannsperger et al. Nat. Comm 2015 seems relevant and missing. This new work should be compared to this &quot;cell squeezing&quot; labeling methods.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20378.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Do some of the data (e.g., viability results) depend on the batch or source of the SLO? Or does this need to be determined anew each time SLO was ordered? I was particularly interested in this since I noticed this afternoon some suppliers sell SLO by weight rather than by units (and don't provide the activity of their SLO).</italic> </p><p>The activity of SLO will need to be determined each time a new SLO is ordered from the manufacturer. However, we have found that if the SLO comes from the same lot number, the activity of the SLO is consistent. We have tried using SLO that’s supplied by weight, and converted from weight to activity unit using manufacturer’s conversion factor, but we have found that the activity converted from weight is different (in our case by factor of 2) compared to SLO supplied by activity. Therefore, we suggest in the Methods section that the labs who wish to use this technique should test the activity of SLO by titrating the concentration of SLO needed to induce &gt;75% of permeabilization to a marker molecule (e.g. 10 kD dextran), while keeping &gt;90% of the cells alive (as tested by PI staining) after the recovery step. We do agree with the reviewers that we should caution readers about the batch to batch variation. We added a statement of caution in our method, and the new sentences now read:</p><p>“Different batches of SLO may have different activity, and therefore the optimal SLO concentration should first be determined. The optimized working SLO concentration was determined by testing a range of SLO concentrations for each cell line to achieve &gt;75% permeability to 10 kDa FITC-dextran, while keeping dead cells at a minimum (&lt;10%).”</p><p><italic>2) Can the authors comment about whether or not this method allows uptake of small quantum dots? The authors previously synthesized small quantum dots attached to nano bodies (see Wang et al., 2014) so it seems like this would be easy to test. A lot of people would be interested in ways to get Q-Dots inside live cells.</italic> </p><p>We are pleased that the reviewers recognize the expertise of our lab. The possibility of using small quantum dot to efficiently label intracellular proteins was in fact one of the driving motivation behind this project. At this point, we had some preliminary luck getting small quantum dots inside, but it turned out that it requires a different type of coating to bring them in efficiently. The standard coating used in reference 25 requires blocking agents such as casein or BSA to prevent it from sticking to the cell membrane non-specifically, and by doing so, we suspect that it increases the size of the quantum dots. We now have a new type of quantum dot with a different polymer coating that does not require the use of blocking proteins. With these, we could deliver small quantum dots inside cells in an amount that is clearly not caused by endocytosis. However, we are still working on functionalizing chemistry of these small quantum dots for specific protein targeting. Since the emphasis of the paper is to label intracellular proteins and because we have not proven that intracellular proteins were labeled with the small quantum dots, we decided not to include it in this manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) We really don't like the last two sentences of the Conclusion since they refer to possible applications that aren't discussed in the present manuscript so the data can't be evaluated. Those sentences should be removed and replaced with something much less specific.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the last sentence in the conclusion was not well phrased. We have rewritten the sentence with a more reserved tone for suggesting a potential new application. The newly revised sentence now reads as below:</p><p>“Lastly, this technique is not limited to delivering of fluorescent probes; the technique can potentially be extended to other types of microscopy that relies on probe delivery, such as cryo-electron microscopy.”</p><p><italic>4) The figure legends for the supplemental data need to be improved. Splitting each figure into individual, lettered panels would help.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out and suggesting an improvement to the readability of our paper. We have slightly enlarged supplemental figure 1. We have divided our supplemental figures into lettered panels, particularly for supplemental figure 2 and 3. Figure legends have been modified to address each figure panels.</p><p><italic>5) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>. We are not sure that we agree that the authors enhanced the signal of a fluorescent protein using their method. The fluorescence of GFP was not improved, rather a protein harboring a completely different fluorophore was targeted to GFP, and it is expected that Atto647N would be much brighter than GFP. This is no different than targeting a fluorescently labeled antibody to any other protein.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the signal of the GFP is not enhanced. A more accurate description is that we went from observing GFP to observing a more photostable dye that is bound to the GFP. We added a short excerpt of narrative in our main text clarifying the motivation of this application, and it reads:</p><p>“FPs works very well for visualizing ensemble of proteins in cell, and constructs of FPs attached to numerous intracellular protein of interest have already been made. However, it remains difficult to study these proteins down to a single molecule level from the fluorescence signal of individual FPs due to low brightness and photostability. The goal here is to label FPs with nanobodies conjugated to dyes with photostability superior to the FPs. For instance, we show that the signal can be improved ~6-fold by detecting the signal of GBP-ATTO647N than the GFP itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a</xref>). Using this method, we can perform single molecule studies on a vast library of existing protein constructs with FP attached by using just FP binding nanobodies conjugated to a fluorophore with better photostability and brightness.”</p><p>We’ve also made small modification to the figure legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, and it now reads:</p><p>“Improving the detection of proteins attached to fluorescent protein by using nanobody labeling”.</p><p><italic>6) The authors state that one of the concerns about existing methods such as microinjection or electroporation is &quot;concern over the cell health&quot;. Surely this is also a concern with any application of SLO as well? While the authors show data that their cells are healthy after every SLO treatment, I would think that this needs to be double-checked with every new cell type tested using this method.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the integrity of the membrane and cell health is not an exclusive problem to microinjection and electroporation. We’ve added a new sentence in our Results section, and it reads:</p><p>“The health of the cells after permeabilization is a universal problem in any methods attempting to temporarily compromise the cell membrane. To test the cell health, we performed several cell viability assays to demonstrate that the cells remain viable after recovering from SLO permeabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).” We’ve also removed the statement that “concern over the cell health” as an exclusive problem of microinjection and electroporation.</p><p><italic>7) The images are quite small and hard to see. Because the main point of the paper is the quality and efficiency of labeling we would suggest showing larger images and larger fields of view. This is particularly important as the level of background labeling is a key issue in evaluating this work.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the fluorescence images in the paper can be further improved by increasing the size of the images. We have made size modifications throughout the text. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the fluorescence image of the cell has been increased by roughly 1.4x the original size. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the size of the fluorescence images has been increased by 1.6x. To make the images fit in one figure, we have changed the arrangement of the figure from horizontal to vertical arrangement. The size of the images has been increased for several figures in the supplemental figures as well. As for larger field of view, most of the images in the paper, besides <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, have images that are already shown in the full field of view taken by 100x or 150x magnification. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is shown in region of interest to show the features of and quality of mitochondria labeling. In addition, we also have addressed the issue noted below, which stated that green/magenta display may be more friendly to the viewers who are red/green color blind. We have replaced all the figures with green/red to green/magenta color scheme.</p><p><italic>8) Reference of Kollmannsperger et al. Nat. Comm 2015 seems relevant and missing. This new work should be compared to this &quot;cell squeezing&quot; labeling methods.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out a recently developed technique that we have overlooked. We have added the reference to the technique alongside another recently developed technique “BLAST”. The new paragraph now reads:</p><p>“Finally, two recently developed methods, biophotonic laser-assisted surgery tool (BLAST) and cell squeezing, are promising techniques, although they require the cells to be cultured in specific platforms like fabricated surface or microfluidic channels.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
