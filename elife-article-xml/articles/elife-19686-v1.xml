yet, their mechanism of action is poorly understood. Here, we focus on the endocrine control ecdysis behavior, which is used by arthropods to shed their cuticle at the end of every molt. Ecdysis is triggered by ETH (Ecdysis triggering hormone), and we show that the response of peptidergic neurons that produce CCAP (crustacean cardioactive peptide), which are key targets of ETH and control the onset of ecdysis behavior, depends fundamentally on the actions of neuropeptides produced by other direct targets of ETH and released in a broad paracrine manner within the CNS; by autocrine influences from the CCAP neurons themselves; and by inhibitory actions mediated by GABA. Our findings provide insights into how this critical insect behavior is controlled and general principles for understanding how neuropeptides organize neuronal activity and behaviors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19686.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19686.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19686.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most behaviors occur only under specific circumstances: we eat when we are hungry, for example. But how does the nervous system decide when to start or stop a particular behavior? Molecules called neuropeptides are thought to play a key role in these decisions. Neuropeptides are produced by organs throughout the body and also by the nervous system itself. When neuropeptides act on neurons responsible for a particular behavior – such as feeding – they can inform those neurons about conditions elsewhere in the body and the brain. This enables the nervous system to decide whether to start or stop the behavior. Yet, how the signals from the different neuropeptides are integrated is poorly understood.</p><p>As immature insects grow, they regularly molt then shed their outer skeleton – or cuticle – in a process called ecdysis. This requires a series of behaviors to occur in a particular order. The old cuticle is first loosened and shed, and then the new cuticle expands and hardens. A number of neuropeptides control ecdysis: for example, a key neuropeptide called ecdysis-triggering hormone (ETH) triggers the process. However, it was not clear how each of the other neuropeptides that are released at this time contributes to the behaviors involved in ecdysis.</p><p>By studying ecdysis in developing fruit flies, Mena et al. now show that the various ecdysial neuropeptides work together to produce the precise behaviors that are observed. For instance, the effect that ETH has on the nervous system depends on whether another neuropeptide called eclosion hormone is also present. ETH can therefore cause different behavioral outcomes depending on the actions of the other neuropeptides.</p><p>Further work is needed in order to work out exactly how the nervous system integrates information from different neuropeptides. Do certain neurons respond to specific neuropeptide combinations? It also remains to be seen how different insects are able to use the same neuropeptides to control ecdysis despite their different body shapes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19686.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19686.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neuropeptides</kwd><kwd>neurohormone</kwd><kwd>ecdysis</kwd><kwd>molt</kwd><kwd>eclosion hormone</kwd><kwd>ecdysis triggering hormone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002850</institution-id><institution>Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1141278</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mena</surname><given-names>Wilson</given-names></name><name><surname>Ewer</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Millenium Institute Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P09-022F</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mena</surname><given-names>Wilson</given-names></name><name><surname>Ewer</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The response of the peptidergic neurons that control a stereotyped behavior depends on the actions of a triggering neuropeptide, downstream neuropeptides and GABA inhibitory influences.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding how ensembles of neurons produce behaviors is an important aim of neuroscience. The mapping of the neural circuits that underlie a behavior is considered a necessary first step toward this goal, and efforts to determine the ‘connectome’ of different parts of the nervous system have been present since the beginnings of modern neuroscience. They start with the classical inferred synaptic relationships in Cajal’s anatomical analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ramón y Cajal, 1899</xref>), through the detailed information on the wiring of some invertebrate circuits (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carew et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Comer and Robertson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">King, 1976a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">1976b</xref>), culminating with the complete map of the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">White et al., 1986</xref>), and the wiring diagrams of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>) and the mammalian retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</xref>). Yet, research into the functioning of neuronal networks has revealed that a wiring diagram is usually not enough to understand what a neuronal network can do, although it does inform on its possible outcomes. One of the elements that adds tremendous multiplicity to the universe of possible outputs of a neural circuit is the action of neuromodulators, including biogenic amines and neuropeptides. In conjunction with classical transmitters, they can gate the input to a circuit or reconfigure its pattern of activity, thereby causing the same circuit to produce qualitatively different outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bargmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargmann and Marder, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brezina, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leinwand and Chalasani, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marder, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nusbaum and Blitz, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The influence of neuropeptides can be profound and underlies the expression of entire behavioral states, such as hunger and satiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atasoy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chambers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao and Horvath, 2007</xref>), pair bonding and stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lieberwirth and Wang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neumann and Landgraf, 2012</xref>), and arousal and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2016</xref>), and can involve many brain regions in addition to sensory and physiological inputs. How these actions are effected is poorly understood because neuropeptides can be broadly released within the CNS and exert combinatorial and non-linear effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brezina, 2010</xref>). In addition, we know little about how these gatekeepers are themselves regulated, yet such knowledge is also critical for understanding how the expression of a behavioral state is controlled. Here, we report on the genetic dissection, using <italic>Drosophila</italic>, of the response of a network of peptidergic neurons that controls the stereotyped and sequential insect behavior of ecdysis, and which represents a tractable system in which these questions can be addressed.</p><p>Ecdysis is the vital behavior that is used by arthropods to shed the remains of the old cuticle at the end of every molt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Reynolds, 1980</xref>). It includes several behavioral subroutines and physiological events that are expressed sequentially to loosen and then shed the old cuticle, then expand and harden the new one. In insects, it is triggered by the sudden release of the neuropeptide, Ecdysis-Triggering Hormone (ETH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ewer and Reynolds, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Zitnan and Adams, 2012</xref>), which activates sequentially a number of peptidergic neurons, each expressing the A isoform of the ETH receptor (ETHR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2015</xref>). A current model proposes that each class of peptidergic ETH targets then activates or modulates specific phases of ecdysis behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). However, the mechanism responsible for producing the sequential activation of these targets in response to a common ETH stimulus is currently unknown.</p><p>Here, we combined the use of genetically encoded calcium- and voltage-sensitive probes, targeted RNAi expression, mutants null for particular neuropeptides downstream of ETH, and pharmacology, to understand how this response is produced. For this we focused on the subset of neurons that produce CCAP (Crustacean cardioactive peptide), which play a key role in the control of ecdysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lahr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2003</xref>). We show that the response of CCAP neurons to ETH and the ensuing ecdysis behaviors depend on direct actions mediated by the ETH trigger as well as on the actions of neuropeptides downstream of ETH together with inhibition mediated by GABA. Importantly, we found that removal of a downstream neuropeptide can eliminate the rhythmic pattern of neuronal activity induced by ETH, revealing that such neuropeptides are critical for the expression of the fundamental features of this neural response. Our findings have implications for understanding how this vital insect behavior is controlled. The principles that emerge are also relevant for understanding how peptidergic networks control behavioral states.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Organization of pupal ecdysial behaviors</title><p>At the end of larval life, <italic>Drosophila</italic> enters the prepupal stage, then ecdyses to a pupa to initiate the transformation to the adult that occurs during metamorphosis. Pupal ecdysis consists of a sequence of behavioral subroutines, which starts with the preparatory behavior of pre-ecdysis, during which the hardened larval cuticle of the puparium is loosened from the underlying pupal cuticle through slow anteriorly directed movements of the body. This phase is followed by ecdysis proper, during which alternating left-right contractions lead into a phase of anteriorly directed peristalses that eventually cause head eversion, during which the brain is pushed anterior to the mouth. During the final phase of the behavioral sequence (post ecdysis), alternating left-right contractions and then posteriorly directed movements produce a body with the external shape of an adult fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lahr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2003</xref>). Each of these phases has a stereotyped duration and pattern of activity, which can be recorded in intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lahr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2003</xref>) and puparium-free preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; cf., Figure 2, below). In addition, fictive ecdysis can be visualized in ex vivo CNS preparations challenged with ETH that express the calcium sensor, GCaMP, in motoneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Consistent with the behaviors observed at ecdysis, the pattern of motor activity expressed in vitro in response to ETH consists of an initial phase that primarily recruits activity in the posterior region of the ventral nervous system (VNS) ('P' region, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ab,Ba</xref>; corresponding to pre-ecdysis) followed by a barrage of activity throughout the left and right sides of the VNS neuropils ('L', <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ac; Bb</xref>; and 'R' regions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ad; Bd</xref>). Importantly, expansion of this latter section of the record reveals that the 'L' and 'R' regions are active in an alternating pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Be</xref>), consistent with the prominent left-right repetitive contractions seen at ecdysis in the intact animal.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19686.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fictive ecdysial behavior in normal and ETHR knockdown animals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Snapshots of the pattern of GCaMP signal recorded from motoneurons of control animals at 0 min (<bold>a</bold>), 10 min (<bold>b</bold>), and at around 20 min (<bold>c,d</bold>) after in vitro challenge with 600 nM ETH.

Note that this genotype also knocks down ETHR expression in motoneurons (MNs).

By correlating these times with the expression of the different behavioral phases of ecdysis, each set was assigned a role in the control of particular ecdysial subroutine, which was also broadly consistent with functional and genetic evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krüger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lahr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which the direct targets of ETH would be activated at different times after an ETH challenge remained unanswered. Here, we show that the pattern of activity of ETH targets depends on direct ETH actions, as well on actions effected by targets downstream of ETH.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Role of ETH signaling in the activation of downstream peptidergic targets</title><p>In order to understand how the temporal pattern of activity of peptidergic ETH targets is produced, we first identified relevant neuronal sets by determining the effects on ecdysis behavior of expressing ETHR RNAi in each set of peptidergic ETH targets. Expression of ETHR RNAi in FMRFa and EH neurons caused no measurable effect on ecdysis behavior in intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or puparium-free preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) ('FMRF&gt;ETHR RNAi' and 'EH&gt;ETHR RNAi', respectively), other than an increase in the frequency of pre-ecdysial contractions. The corresponding pattern of neural activity induced by ETH was not visibly altered by expression of ETHR RNAi in these neurons (not shown). In the case of EH neurons, this lack of effect could be due to their high sensitivity to ETH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2006</xref>), which could make them insensitive to the levels of reduction in ETHR expression that can be achieved by RNAi (see below). Recent work has shown that the role of kinin neurons in the control of ecdysis behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2015</xref>) may be mostly indirect and a consequence of its role in diuresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diao et al., 2016</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19686.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Impact on ecdysial behaviors of manipulating ETH effectiveness on downstream targets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ecdysial behaviors in intact puparium.

In particular, animals monitored free of the puparium expressed a significantly longer and weaker pre-ecdysis than did controls, and none (0/14) ecdysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Fictive ecdysis behaviors, monitored by expressing GCaMP in motor neurons, showed that the underlying motor program was also severely disrupted in these animals, consistent with the expressed behavior. Indeed, unlike the sequences of calcium responses observed in the motoneurons of control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), those of animals expressing ETHR RNAi in CCAP neurons responded to ETH with a smaller and sustained pattern of activity in the posterior region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), consistent with the longer and weaker pre-ecdysis behavior observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and a severe reduction and disorganization in the activity of L and R regions of the CNS, consistent with the observed lack of ecdysis behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These results confirm previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lahr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2003</xref>) and reveal that CCAP neurons play a critical role in the control of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ecdysis behavior.</p><p>Knockdown of ETHR in CCAP neurons also caused significant changes in the calcium response induced by ETH in vitro. In control animals, the two pairs of serial CCAP homologs showed a characteristic response to 600 nM ETH: whereas one set of neurons (called here α neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>) responded ca. 20 min after ETH challenge with a barrage of GCaMP spikes, the other (called here β neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>) responded after a similar delay with a sustained increase in fluorescence. Based on the electrophysiological activity recorded in <italic>Manduca</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gammie and Truman, 1997</xref>), we assume that the α neurons correspond to the projection ‘Cell 27’ neurons, whereas the β neurons correspond to interneurons ‘IN704’. Expression of ETHR RNAi in CCAP neurons caused a significant delay in the onset of the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), and the period of activity was shorter and included a smaller number of peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,I,J</xref>) (In these records, the responses of α and β neurons have been combined as they could not be unambiguously distinguished). This weakening of the response was seen in CCAP neurons in thoracic segment 3 (TN3) as well as in serial homologs in abdominal segments 1–4 (AN1-4) but was not detected in AN8-9, which may not express ETHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). Further reduction of ETHR function, accomplished using <italic>ETHR</italic> hemizygosity, did not simply reduce the response further, revealing that indirect as well as direct ETH actions may be involved in determining the response of CCAP neurons to ETH. Indeed, in such animals, the latency to respond was generally more similar to that of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>), whereas its duration and number of spikes was more similar to those observed when ETHR RNAi was expressed in a wild-type background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,J</xref>). Significantly, however, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref> and quantitated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, both manipulations severely reduced the amplitude of the response. Thus, for animals expressing ETHR RNAi it was reduced four-fold for CCAP neurons AN1-4 and AN8-9, and eight-fold in CCAP neurons TN3, AN1-4, and AN8-9 for animals expressing ETHR RNAi in a ETHR hemizygous background. This reduced response may be the basis for the much weaker behavior expressed by these genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). We do not know the cause of the differential effects on CCAP neurons TN3 vs. AN1-4 for these and other manipulations carried out in this study; we assume that they are due to differential ETHR expression and/or synaptic inputs.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19686.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Impact on CCAP neuron activation of ETHR knockdown in CCAP neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system indicating the location of EH, FMRFa, and CCAP neurons.

These results suggest that EH neurons are an ETH target that is upstream of CCAP neurons. In order to explore the role of EH in determining the features of the response of CCAP neurons to ETH at pupal ecdysis, we examined the GCaMP signal of CCAP neurons to ETH in animals hemizygous mutant for <italic>Eh</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, the temporal organization of the response was dramatically disorganized in these animals, with a significant loss in the regular pattern of GCaMP spikes that is typical of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This effect was partially reflected in the quantitation of the response, where the lack of EH caused significant increases in the latency to respond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and a two-fold decrease in the amplitude of the response in CCAP neurons AN1-4 and AN8,9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), although the severely disrupted response (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) precludes a quantitative comparison.

However, genetic analyses have shown that <italic>pburs</italic>, which encodes one of the subunits of the heterodimeric bursicon hormone, also plays a role in the control of ecdysial behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lahr et al., 2012</xref>). Bursicon is of particular interest in the context of this work because it is expressed by a subset of the CCAP neurons themselves and could therefore play a (direct or indirect) autocrine role in determining the response of these neurons to ETH. Consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lahr et al. (2012)</xref>, the lack of PBURS (and thus of the heteromeric bursicon) in intact puparia caused a lengthening of ecdysis, with only 5/8 animals executing the behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Puparium-free preparations lacking PBURS, by contrast, expressed a significantly shorter ecdysis motor program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>); a similar defect was obtained expressing <italic>pburs</italic> RNAi in CCAP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Importantly, the defects expressed by hemizygous mutant animals in both types of preparations were rescued by a transgene containing the <italic>pburs</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>) indicating that they are due to the lack of <italic>pburs</italic> function. The apparently opposite phenotypes expressed by these two types of preparations are likely due to the different criteria that are used to define the ecdysial phases in intact vs. puparium-free animals. At the level of the response of CCAP neurons, the lack of PBURS caused, on average, a two-fold decrease in the amplitude of the response to ETH of CCAP neurons AN1-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

It also accelerated the time of onset and shortened the response for some of the CCAP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). No effects on the timing or amplitude of the response were detected in CCAP neurons AN8-9, suggesting that they may not express the bursicon receptor. In summary, the absence of <italic>pburs</italic> function caused quantitative changes to the response of CCAP neurons to ETH, revealing that a neurohormone made by the CCAP neurons themselves participates in determining their response to the ETH trigger.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19686.009</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Ecdysial behaviors of <italic>pburs</italic> mutant animals.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Duration of pre-ecdysis (left; open bars) and ecdysis (right; filled bars) behavior of animals hemizygous for <italic>pburs</italic> in intact (<bold>A</bold>) and in puparium-free preparations (<bold>B</bold>), shown as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

Thus, although EH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2006</xref>) and Kinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2015</xref>) neurons respond within ca. 10 min of an ETH challenge, CCAP neurons do not respond until around ca. 20 min after ETH stimulation, with different subsets showing different and characteristic latencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). The delay in the execution of the ecdysial phase of ecdysis behavior, which correlates with the time of activation of CCAP neurons, has been hypothesized to occur through inhibitory influences originating from the brain and/or subesophageal ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ewer and Reynolds, 2002</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ewer and Truman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuse and Truman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Zitnan and Adams, 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, the exact origin and nature of this inhibition is currently unknown. In order to investigate the role of inhibition in the response of CCAP neurons to ETH, we first examined their time course of activation in the presence of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA-RA) blocker, picrotoxin (100 µM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rohrbough and Broadie, 2002</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,F</xref>, pharmacological inhibition of GABA-RA caused a significant reduction in the latency to respond; this effect was most dramatic in neurons from segments AN1-4, where the time to onset was reduced by almost 50% (from around 20 to 10 min). Other changes were also apparent in these preparations. Most noteworthy was the more sustained nature of the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), which suggests that the pronounced spikes that are normally seen (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) are partly accomplished through inhibitory processes mediated by GABA.

We assume that the neuron expressing the spikes corresponds to the α neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), whereas the other corresponds to the β member of the pair.

At the neural level, the sequential nature of ecdysis is based on the sequential activation of different ETH targets. Here, we have identified some of the elements involved in determining the time course of activation of CCAP neurons. The CCAP neurons express ETHR, and by targeting ETHR RNAi to these neurons we showed that the timecourse and intensity of their response to ETH is sensitive to the dosage of ETHR. The associated lengthening of pre-ecdysis and failures in ecdysis underscore the well-established role for these neurons as key regulators of ecdysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lahr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to ETH, however, we show that several elements downstream of this triggering hormone including EH, PBURS, and GABA play a key role in determining the response of CCAP neurons (whether GABA neurons mediating this inhibition are direct or indirect targets of ETH is currently unknown). Thus, we found that the response of CCAP neurons is qualitatively changed in the absence of EH, causing a decrease in the amplitude and dramatically altering the temporal features of the response, with a concomitant failure to ecdyse. Interestingly, we show that PBURS, which is produced by a subset of CCAP neurons, is also involved in patterning the response of these neurons to ETH, revealing a (direct or indirect) autocrine regulation of CCAP activation. Finally, we show that GABA inhibition mediates at least part of the delay between exposure to ETH and CCAP neuron activation and may also sculpt the shape of the resulting pattern of activation. Our findings are summarized in the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; the model details the contributions to the activation of CCAP neurons from ETH, peptides produced by targets of ETH including the CCAP neurons themselves, as well as inhibitory effects mediated by GABA, and define the times when these influences participate during the expression of the different phases of ecdysis. In addition to these actions, there are several features of the response to ETH whose origins await elucidation. For instance, decreasing ETH effectiveness using RNAi or different concentrations of ETH revealed the existence of non-linear processes whose basis is currently unknown. They could simply reflect the non-linear activation of GPCRs and/or may occur because the various targets that are activated or inhibited by ETH may respond differentially and non-linearly to different concentrations of this neuropeptide, as occurs in other cases of neuromodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brezina, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marder et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, there remains a 10-min delay in the onset of the response of CCAP neurons that is not mediated by GABA inhibition. Dissecting the contributions of different modulators and their targets to the response of this neuronal ensemble will undoubtedly be aided by the availability of recently developed genetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luan et al., 2006</xref>) that can be used for the precise manipulation of receptor spatial expression. Finally, we still do not know how the activation of the various peptidergic targets of ETH causes the production of the ecdysial motor programs (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Preliminary evidence indicates that CCAP may play an important role in directly activating these motor programs because the timing of GCaMP activity in motoneurons follows closely the pattern of GCaMP activity of CCAP neurons (Mena and Ewer, unpublished).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19686.013</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model for endocrine control of ecdysial behaviors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ETH released from peripheral endocrine cells acts directly on EH and CCAP neurons, and directly or indirectly on GABA neurons.

In the case of the ecdysis motor program, intrinsic modulatory actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katz, 1995</xref>) appear to play a defining role in the expression of the neural response elicited by ETH and of its accompanying motor output. Thus, for example, the lack of EH destroys the repetitive pattern of firing of CCAP neurons induced by ETH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) as well as that of the resulting motor output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B and F</xref>). What might the advantage be of not hardwiring the neural bases of such a vital behavior as ecdysis? One clue may lie in the fact that, despite the diversity in ecdysial behaviors expressed by different arthropods during different molts, the neuropeptides that drive ecdysis as well as their receptors are extremely well conserved, and clear homologs can be identified even in chelicerates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grbić et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Veenstra et al., 2012</xref>), which diverged from the insects ca. 600 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Regier et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2010</xref>). One way for such a conserved signaling pathway to produce different behavioral outputs would be to change the pattern of receptor expression. Consistent with this hypothesis, the exact function of particular ecdysial neuropeptides can differ in different insect groups and stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">White and Ewer, 2014</xref>). For instance, whereas <italic>Drosophila</italic> lacking CCAP express normal ecdysis behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lahr et al., 2012</xref>), RNAi inhibition of CCAP causes ecdysial failures in <italic>Tribolium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arakane et al., 2008</xref>). Likewise, bursicon is involved in postecdysial maturation following the emergence of the adult fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Honegger et al., 2008</xref>), yet is involved in the control of the earlier ecdysial phase at pupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lahr et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, it is especially interesting to identify an inhibitory input to CCAP neurons mediated by GABA, as it could provide a route through which sensory input could modulate the time of onset of the ecdysial phase. Such an input appears to be absent in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval and pupal ecdysis but plays an important role in orthopteran ecdysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlson and Bentley, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ewer and Reynolds, 2002</xref>) as well as in dipteran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 1999</xref>) and lepidopteran adult emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ewer and Truman, 1997</xref>). It will be very interesting to determine the extent to which differences in neuropeptide receptor expression underlie the diversity of ecdysial behaviors expressed by insects with different body plans. In other systems, the different responses elicited by well-conserved neuropeptides may also be accomplished through changes in receptor expression. Such appears to be the case for oxytocin in voles, where differences in pair bonding in monogamous vs. gregarious species are at least in part due to differences in receptor distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Young et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Neuropeptides can be released at synapses, along axons, and even from dendrites, from where they can influence distant targets with a timecourse that can span from seconds to hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leng and Ludwig, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van den Pol, 2012</xref>). Despite this mode of delivery, with low spatial and temporal specificity, their actions are typically very specific and can lead to the expression of tightly regulated responses. In the case of ecdysis behavior, for example, EH and CCAP are both broadly released into the ventral CNS, yet the timing of pre-ecdysis and ecdysis is normally extremely precise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Similarly, in the case of the mammalian circadian system, robust and precise circadian rhythmicity of pacemaker activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and of the behavioral output depends on Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP), which is released in a broad paracrine manner in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hastings et al., 2014</xref>). A similar situation may occur in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian system, where the neuropeptide, Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF), is critical for the coupling of the different circadian oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shafer and Yao, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoshii et al., 2009</xref>). Overall, these examples show that neuropeptides play a critical role in determining the precise output of a neural network and of the behavior it controls. In the case of ETH, the precision of the timing and phasing of the different ecdysial phases depends on its combinatorial actions with other neuropeptides including EH and CCAP, and which are likely to be highly non-linear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brezina, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marder et al., 2014</xref>). A similar situation applies for other neuropeptide controlled behaviors such as hunger, where neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus that express Agouti-related protein (Agrp) regulate feeding by integrating inputs mediated by circulating hormones (ghrelin and letpin), transmitters (glutamate, and GABA) and other peptidergic neurons (POMC neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atasoy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao and Horvath, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sohn et al., 2013</xref>). These inputs provide a readout of the animal’s physiological state and are then translated into a non-linear switch-like behavior, consistent with the switch-like features of hunger states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). For most systems, however, we lack information on the detailed actions exerted by each neuropeptide within a network. The inner working of the peptidergic network that controls ecdysis provides a tractable system for understanding how neuropeptides trigger and modulate complex patterns of neuronal activity and behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains and genetics</title><p>Flies stocks were maintained at room temperature (22–25°C) on standard agar/cornmeal/yeast media.

The animals were filmed at room temperature (20–22°C) under dim transmitted light using a Leica DMLB microscope (20 X magnification).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage dynamics</title><p>Imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics was carried out essentially as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al. (2006)</xref>. Briefly, animals containing a bubble in the mid-region of the puparium (late stage p4(i); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bainbridge and Bownes, 1981</xref>) were selected. They were then further staged to be within 4 hr before onset of pupal ecdysis. The animals were then dissected under cold PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> and 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7,3), placed on the surface of 200 µl, 1.5% low melting temperature agarose solution (Sigma type VII-A; Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., MO), which was then left to harden for 30 min in a humidified chamber kept at 10–15°C. Preparations were then covered with Schneider´s Insect Medium (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., MO) and imaged under an Olympus DSU Spinning Disc microscope (Olympus Corporation, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan) using a 20 X W NA 0.50 or 40 X W NA 0.80 immersion lens. Fluorescent images were acquired using an ORCA IR2 Hamamatsu camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu City, Japan) using the Cell<sup>^</sup>R Olympus Imaging Software (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions, Munich, Germany). Preparations were first imaged for 5 min (exposures taken every 5 s) and those showing spontaneous activity (ca. 5% of the preparations) were discarded. They were then stimulated with synthetic ETH1 (Bachem Co., USA; referred to here simply as ETH) and GFP fluorescence captured every 5 s for 30, 60, or 90 min for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, GCaMP, and every 2 s for 60 min for the voltage sensor, ArcLight. When used, antagonists for GABA receptor A, Picrotoxin (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., MO) or Gabazine (SR95531; Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK), were added 10 min prior to ETH1 challenge.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analysis of GCaMP and voltage intensity timecourses</title><p>Recordings were analyzed using Cell<sup>^</sup>R Olympus Imaging Software (Version 2.6) and fluorescence intensity calculated as ∆F/F. The data were further processed with Excel (Microsoft, WA); statistical analyses were carried out using Prism 6.0 (Graphpad Software Inc, CA). In general, only 50–75% of CCAP neurons were in focus in a given preparation and could therefore be quantitated. However, since for most genotypes and manipulations 90–100% of neurons showed a measurable response, each preparation yielded at least one independent measurement per segment. Exceptions to this were neurons in segment T3, where only one pair of neurons showed a measurable signal; and for some genotypes and manipulations, where many neurons failed to respond (e.g. preparations challenged with 60 nM ETH1; cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In cases where &lt;8 measurements were obtained, individual data points have been superimposed on the relevant summary histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Julie Simpson (Janelia Farm, USA), Paul Taghert (Washington University, St Louis, USA) for flies, and Benjamin White (National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA) for clone containing regulatory region of <italic>Ccap</italic> gene.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Orie T Shafer (Reviewer #2) and Hans-Willi Honegger (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study combines the use of genetically encoded calcium- and voltage-sensitive probes, targeted RNAi expression, mutants null for particular neuropeptides downstream of ETH, and pharmacology, to understand how pupal ecdysis is orchestrated in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Focusing on a subset of neurons that produce CCAP (Crustacean cardioactive peptide), which known play a key role in the control of ecdysis, they show that the response of CCAP neurons to ETH and the ensuing ecdysis behaviors depend on direct actions mediated by ETH as well as on the actions of neuropeptides downstream of ETH together with inhibition mediated by GABA. Removal of a downstream neuropeptide, EH, can eliminate the rhythmic pattern of neuronal activity induced by ETH. These results indicate that neuropeptides are critical for the expression of the fundamental features, including timing of the underlying neuronal program for pupal ecdysis. The work has broad implication for how neuropeptides can orchestrate complex behaviors and imply that they build flexibility into neuronal networks that can be exploited developmentally and evolutionarily.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are a few concerns about controls (detailed in reviewer #2 comments) and also some concerns about the complexity of the figures, particularly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The manuscript focuses on two major questions: 1) Which mechanisms are responsible for producing the sequential activation of neuronal targets in response to a common ETH stimulus (latency responses), and 2) How does the amplitude of the CCAP response (Ca+ fluorescence) relate to the ecdysis motor pattern. These questions may help in the reorganization of the Figures. The authors may break up the results of their experimental approach in the figures more clearly with respect to answering these questions. The major concerns of reviewers #2 and #3 are listed below to guide in your revision.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>See minor revisions suggested by each reviewer (below).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Explain the statistical differences more fully in the text. Give exact p values.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>There are two concerns that, if addressed, would improve this important study.</p><p>First, some critical experimental details are not adequately described in the manuscript. For example, the genotypes of the flies used in imaging experiments on RNAi manipulated brains should be clearly indicated either in the Results section or figure legend for every experiment. For example, it isn't clear from the description of the imaging experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> how GCaMP and the ETH-R RNAi constructs were independently driven in motor neurons and CCAP expressing neurons, respectively. Was the CCAP-LexA used to drive UAS-RNAi? If so, there does not seem to be a LexAop-ETH-RNAi element described. Or was a LexA used for motor neurons (in which case the driver and the LexAop-GCaMP should be described)? With the genotypes unclear, it is difficult to access how well controlled these experiments are. For example, how well have the authors controlled for the possibility of leaky RNAi expression in the imaging experiments? Some evidence that the genetic driver is required for the RNAi effects would strengthen these experiments. The authors should ensure that every fly line used in the study is described in the Methods section.</p><p>Second, a reorganization of the figures would make this excellent manuscript more easily read. As organized, there are several highly related experiments that are spread over two or even three figures in the manuscript. The need to move between multiple figures to compare behavioral and physiological data for similar experimental manipulations makes the manuscript difficult to follow at times. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> does a nice job summarizing a great deal of data, but as presented it is a bit challenging to navigate. I would consider breaking these data up among the other figures. The reader would be better served if the ETH-R knockdown data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were included in the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and if the ETH dose response data were combined with the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Likewise, the authors might break up the comprehensive behavioral data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, placing the various genetic manipulations alongside the imaging done on the same manipulations. This would allow the reader to move more easily from one figure to the next while reading the Results section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>There are a few concerns that should be addressed:</p><p>1) The figures indicate that the response of CCAP neurons in T3 to the diverse experimental manipulations differ from those in the abdominal neuromers 1-4 (AN1-4), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, # of spikes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, amplitude of GCaMP response; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, # of spikes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, duration. These differences deserve an explanation.</p><p>2) Also, AN 8 and 9 responses are different from those in AN 1-4, especially as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. The authors mention that AN8-9 may not express ETHR but may also lack the PBURS (BURS) receptors.</p><p>3) I have problems with the notion that it is PBURS that plays a role in the control of ecdysis behaviors. It has been shown that the two subunits of bursicon (BURS and PBURS) heterodimerize spontaneously to the bioactive BURSICON if expressed together. Thus, the knock down of PBURS expression would prevent the production of a bioactive bursicon. In my opinion, it is simpler to assume that BURSICON has a feedback effect on the CCAP/BURSICON expressing AN neurons. Otherwise, the authors must show that in the early phases of ecdysis only PBURS is expressed, not BURS, and need to hypothesize a specific receptor for PBURS in these cells.</p><p>4) The results indicate that not the entire GABA inhibition acts directly on the CCAP neurons but some input must be indirect. The authors also cite publications indicating that inhibitory influences may originate from the brain and/or sub-esophageal ganglion. I would like to emphasize that the Benjamin White lab has shown convincingly that two bursicon-expressing neurons in the SEG project into all abdominal neuromers and thus may have a direct effect on the release of bursicon from the ANs. It might be worthwhile to discuss whether the indirect GABA inhibition on these cells originates from the inhibition of the SEG neurons.</p><p>5) The results provide convincing support that the peptidergic modulation of the CCAP neurons plays a critical role in the control of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ecdysis behavior. However, the ecdysis motor program is controlled by motor neurons and the authors show that the motor program as well as the alternating motor neuron activity was also severely disrupted in ETH RNAi puparium-free preparations. The authors should discuss the possible connections translating the activity of the AN-CCAP cells into the motor neuron pattern controlling the ecdysis.</p><p>6) I would suggest using * throughout to indicate statistically significant differences in the figures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19686.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>There are a few concerns about controls (detailed in reviewer #2 comments) and also some concerns about the complexity of the figures, particularly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.

A description of the exact genotypes has now been added to the legends of the data figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Specifically with respect to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (= ex-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), motoneurons (MN) were imaged while knocking down ETH-R RNAi in CCAP neurons by driving ETH-R RNAi (and GCaMP) using a combined CCAP-GAL4+MN-GAL4 driver. The response of CCAP neurons is clearly distinguishable from MN activity. In addition, expressing ETH-R RNAi only in MN’s had only a minor effect on ecdysis, affecting only the frequency of pre-ecdysial contractions, measured in intact puparium preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, the GCaMP signal recorded using the CCAP-GAL4+MN-GAL4 driver reflects primarily (if not exclusively) the effects of knocking down ETH-R in CCAP neurons. This issue has been clarified in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (= ex-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>With respect to possible leakage from UAS-RNAi constructs, we always tested (and reported) the relevant controls and did not detect any signs of leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, for UAS-ETHR RNAi; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, UAS-GABA-RA, for GABA-RA). We have double-checked the Methods section to make sure it includes a description of all the fly line used in this study.</p><p><italic>Second, a reorganization of the figures would make this excellent manuscript more easily read. As organized, there are several highly related experiments that are spread over two or even three figures in the manuscript. The need to move between multiple figures to compare behavioral and physiological data for similar experimental manipulations makes the manuscript difficult to follow at times. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> does a nice job summarizing a great deal of data, but as presented it is a bit challenging to navigate. I would consider breaking these data up among the other figures. The reader would be better served if the ETH-R knockdown data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were included in the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and if the ETH dose response data were combined with the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We agree with this suggestion and have attempted to improve the readability of the manuscript. For this we have:</p><p>- Inverted the order of the first two figures.</p><p>- Included in a single figure the behavioral results obtained from intact puparium and puparium free preparations following a given manipulation; and, whenever space allowed it, these results have been presented together with the corresponding GCaMP results. Thus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (ex-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) now includes both types of behavioral results obtained following ETH-R knockdown; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> now includes both types of behavioral results obtained in the absence of EH function as well as the corresponding GCaMP activity of CCAP neurons in response to ETH; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> includes both types of behavioral results obtained in <italic>pburs</italic> mutants, followed by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, which shows the responses of CCAP neurons in a <italic>pburs</italic> mutant background. Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> shows both types of behavioral results obtained when GABA-RA was knocked down in CCAP neurons as well as the corresponding GCaMP activity of the CCAP neurons in response to ETH.</p><p>- We have also eliminated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> as a main figure and added the relevant information in the text. We chose this option rather than breaking up <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and adding parts of it to the relevant figures because for each genotype/manipulation we only report 2 pieces of information: the amplitude of the GCaMP response in CCAP neurons from segments TN3 and AN1-4 relative to control. This information has now been added to the relevant section of the Results (subsection “Role of ETH signaling in the activation of downstream peptidergic targets”, third and fourth paragraphs; subsection “Influence of downstream peptides on the pattern of activation of CCAP neurons by ETH: role of Eclosion hormone”, second paragraph and subsection “Influence of downstream peptides on the pattern of activation of ETH targets: role of PBURS”), and is therefore provided to the reader at the appropriate time. A similar approach was used to report the% responsiveness of CCAP neurons to ETH following different manipulations (e.g., subsection “Role of ETH signaling in the activation of downstream peptidergic targets”, fourth paragraph). The contents of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> has nevertheless been preserved but moved to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>Likewise, the authors might break up the comprehensive behavioral data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, placing the various genetic manipulations alongside the imaging done on the same manipulations. This would allow the reader to move more easily from one figure to the next while reading the Results section.</italic> </p><p>We have combined the behavioral results from intact puparium and puparium free preparations, as described above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>There are a few concerns that should be addressed:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The figures indicate that the response of CCAP neurons in T3 to the diverse experimental manipulations differ from those in the abdominal neuromers 1-4 (AN1-4), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, # of spikes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, amplitude of GCaMP response; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, # of spikes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, duration. These differences deserve an explanation.</italic> </p><p>We agree with this reviewer that for several manipulations the response of TN3 neurons differs from that of abdominal neuromeres AN1-4. We don’t understand the basis for such differences, which could be due to different levels of expression of ETHR, different wiring, etc. We have added text highlighting these segmental differences (subsection “Role of ETH signaling in the activation of downstream peptidergic targets”, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Also, AN 8 and 9 responses are different from those in AN 1-4, especially as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. The authors mention that AN8-9 may not express ETHR but may also lack the PBURS (BURS) receptors.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the responses of CCAP neurons in AN8 and AN9 differ from those seen in AN1-4. We do not know the basis for these differences but one factor that likely contributes is that the AN8 and AN9 CCAP neurons do nor express ETHR (Kim et al., 2006; Diao et al., 2016) and are thus insensitive to the direct actions of ETH. Yet, we appreciate the reviewer’s comment that they likely also do not express the bursicon receptor since eliminating PBURS did not affect the (indirect) response of these neurons to these downstream hormones. We have added text mentioning this possibility (subsection “Influence of downstream peptides on the pattern of activation of ETH targets: role of PBURS”).</p><p><italic>3) I have problems with the notion that it is PBURS that plays a role in the control of ecdysis behaviors. It has been shown that the two subunits of bursicon (BURS and PBURS) heterodimerize spontaneously to the bioactive BURSICON if expressed together. Thus, the knock down of PBURS expression would prevent the production of a bioactive bursicon. In my opinion, it is simpler to assume that BURSICON has a feedback effect on the CCAP/BURSICON expressing AN neurons. Otherwise, the authors must show that in the early phases of ecdysis only PBURS is expressed, not BURS, and need to hypothesize a specific receptor for PBURS in these cells.</italic> </p><p>We agree with this reviewer that the bioassays used to measure the activity of BURS-BURS and PBURS-PBURS homodimers, and of BURS-PBURS heterodimers show that only the heterodimer (= bursicon) can activate the bursicon receptor in a heterologous assay and cause tanning in intact flies bioassay (Luo et al., 2005; Mendive et al., 2005). Nevertheless, there is the nagging fact that PBURS and BURS are not strictly co-expressed. Most notably, BURS is expressed in 1 pair of CCAP neurons in 8 abdominal segments whereas PBURS is only expressed in 4 of these. Thus, there are 4 segments in which CCAP neurons express only the BURS subunit of bursicon. Even though there is currently no activity associated with BURS-BURS homodimers it is difficult to escape the possibility that homodimers may be active in some context. Since we don’t know which this activity may be, we chose to use the more conservative description of our results because, in our manipulations, all that we are really sure of is that we eliminated PBURS. Nevertheless, we do acknowledge in the text that the lack of PBURS causes a lack of bursicon (=BURS-PBURS heterodimer) (“Consistent with the findings of (Lahr et al., 2012), the lack of PBURS (and <bold>thus of the heteromeric bursicon</bold>; our emphasis here) in intact puparia caused a significant lengthening of ecdysis, with only 5/8 animals executing the behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).”</p><p><italic>4) The results indicate that not the entire GABA inhibition acts directly on the CCAP neurons but some input must be indirect. The authors also cite publications indicating that inhibitory influences may originate from the brain and/or sub-esophageal ganglion. I would like to emphasize that the Benjamin White lab has shown convincingly that two bursicon-expressing neurons in the SEG project into all abdominal neuromers and thus may have a direct effect on the release of bursicon from the ANs. It might be worthwhile to discuss whether the indirect GABA inhibition on these cells originates from the inhibition of the SEG neurons.</italic> </p><p>We are well aware of these studies (Luan et al., 2006; and Peabody et al., 2009), yet they apply to the control of bursicon release and wing expansion, both of which take place <italic>after</italic> adult emergence (which corresponds to adult ecdysis); they are thus not relevant to pupal ecdysis, where genetic evidence indicates that bursicon plays a role in the <italic>execution</italic> of ecdysis itself (Lahr et al., 2012). Although the inhibitory SEG neurons described in these reports and mentioned by this reviewer could contribute the delay in expression of the ecdysial phase of ecdysis, there is no direct evidence that this is the case. We did not cite this work because the control of ecdysis differs between pupal and adult ecdysis (e.g., the role of bursicon changes dramatically). Thus we do not feel comfortable extrapolating to pupal ecdysis neuronal elements that control adult ecdysis, especially if they regulate events that are expressed <italic>after</italic> adult ecdysis.</p><p>Prior to our finding the only available information was that decapitation of the animal after ETH release significantly reduced the latency to ecdysis. However, given the radical nature of this manipulation it would be difficult to argue convincingly that this inhibition was mediated by an inhibition specifically originating from the brain or subesophageal ganglion. Here we have advanced our understanding of the nature of this inhibition by showing that at least part of the delay in activation of CCAP neurons is due to a direct inhibition of CCAP neurons by GABA. Future studies will attempt to identify the relevant GABA-ergic neurons, and determine whether they respond directly or indirectly to ETH.</p><p><italic>5) The results provide convincing support that the peptidergic modulation of the CCAP neurons plays a critical role in the control of Drosophila ecdysis behavior. However, the ecdysis motor program is controlled by motor neurons and the authors show that the motor program as well as the alternating motor neuron activity was also severely disrupted in ETH RNAi puparium-free preparations. The authors should discuss the possible connections translating the activity of the AN-CCAP cells into the motor neuron pattern controlling the ecdysis.</italic> </p><p>Some of the players that transduce ETH actions within the CNS have been identified. They are neurons that express the “A” isoform of the ETH receptor (ETH-RA) and consist of peptidergic neurons that express kinin, FMRFamide, EH, CCAP (in combination with MIP and bursicon). In addition there are several dozen neurons that express ETH-RB, whose identity is currently unknown. Yet it is unlikely that motoneurons are relevant ETH targets. Indeed, expressing ETHR RNAi in motoneurons had, at most, a modest effect on ecdysis behavior: no effect was detected on ecdysis behavior monitored in intact preparations, and only an effect on ecdysis frequency could be detected in puparium free preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus it is unlikely that motoneurons are direct targets of ETH. Rather it is possible that peptide downstream of ETH are involved in directly controlling or modulating the ecdysis motor programs. Preliminary evidence indicates that CCAP may play an important role, because the timing of GCaMP activity in motoneurons follows closely the pattern of GCaMP activity of CCAP neurons. A sentence to this effect has been added to the Discussion (first paragraph).</p><p><italic>6) I would suggest using * throughout to indicate statistically significant differences in the figures.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this suggestion and have used “*” for comparisons that are between experimental vs. control (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8A-B,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9C</xref>). However, for cases where we made multiple comparisons test we think it is more appropriate to use letters (a different letter for statistically different groups). The results of such comparisons can be complex and using “*” and brackets would unnecessarily clutter the figures.</p></body></sub-article></article>
