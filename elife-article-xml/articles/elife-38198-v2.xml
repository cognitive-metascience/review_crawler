the plane of cell cleavage, and thereby daughter cell location, size, and content. Spindle positioning is driven by dynein-mediated pulling forces exerted on astral microtubules, which requires an evolutionarily conserved complex of Gα∙GDP, GPR-1/2<sup>Pins/LGN</sup>, and LIN-5<sup>Mud/NuMA</sup> proteins. To examine individual functions of the complex components, we developed a genetic strategy for light-controlled localization of endogenous proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos. By replacing Gα and GPR-1/2 with a light-inducible membrane anchor, we demonstrate that Gα∙GDP, Gα∙GTP, and GPR-1/2 are not required for pulling-force generation. In the absence of Gα and GPR-1/2, cortical recruitment of LIN-5, but not dynein itself, induced high pulling forces. The light-controlled localization of LIN-5 overruled normal cell-cycle and polarity regulation and provided experimental control over the spindle and cell-cleavage plane. Our results define Gα∙GDP–GPR-1/2<sup>Pins/LGN</sup> as a regulatable membrane anchor, and LIN-5<sup>Mud/NuMA</sup> as a potent activator of dynein-dependent spindle-positioning forces.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38198.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A cell about to divide must decide where exactly to cut itself in two. Split right down the middle, and the two daughter cells will be identical; offset the cleavage plane to one side, and the resulting siblings will have different sizes, places and fates.</p><p>In animals, the splitting of cells is dictated by the location of the spindle, a structure that forms when cable-like microtubules stretch from the cell membrane to attach to the chromosomes. At the membrane, a group of proteins tugs on the microtubules to bring the spindle into the correct position. One of these proteins, dynein, is a motor that uses microtubules as its track to pull the spindle into place. What the other parts of the complex do is still unclear, but a general assumption is that they may be serving as an anchor for dynein.</p><p>To test this model, Fielmich, Schmidt et al. removed one or more proteins from the complex in the developing embryos of the nematode worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. A light-activated system then linked the remaining proteins to the membrane by tying them to an artificial anchor. Two of the proteins in the complex could be replaced with the artificial anchor, but pulling forces were absent when dynein was artificially tied to the membrane. This indicates that the motor being anchored at the edge of the cell is not enough for it to pull on microtubules. Instead, the experiments showed that dynein needs to be activated by another component of the complex, a protein called LIN-5. This suggests that individual proteins in the complex have specialized roles that go beyond simply tethering dynein. In fact, steering where LIN-5 was attached on the membrane helped to control the location of the spindle, and therefore of the cleavage plane.</p><p>As mammals have a protein similar to LIN-5, dissecting the roles of the components involved in positioning the spindle in <italic>C. elegans</italic> could help to understand normal and abnormal human development. In addition, these results demonstrate that creating artificial interactions between proteins using light is a powerful technique to study biological processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>mitotic spindle positioning</kwd><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>germline silencing</kwd><kwd>LIN-5 (NuMA)</kwd><kwd>cell division</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO TOP/ECHO grant 711.015.001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fielmich</surname><given-names>Lars-Eric</given-names></name><name><surname>Van den Heuvel</surname><given-names>Sander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01 GM083071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>Bob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dickinson</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Synergy grant 609822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Ruben</given-names></name><name><surname>Akhmanova</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH K99 GM115964</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dickinson</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>New germline gene expression, knockout, and optogenetic tools reveal essential roles for Gα-GPR-1,2/Pins as a regulatable membrane anchor and LIN-5/NuMA as an activator of cortical dynein in mitotic spindle positioning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animal cells control the position of the spindle to determine the plane of cell cleavage.

Such an adaptor is necessary for the processive movement of mammalian cytoplasmic dynein during cargo transport along microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>). This process differs substantially from microtubule-dependent cortical pulling, in which force is generated by dynein in association with shrinking microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Laan et al., 2012</xref>). Without adaptor, surface-anchored yeast dynein in contact with depolymerizing microtubules generates pulling forces in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Laan et al., 2012</xref>). However, yeast dynein moves processively on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, it remains unknown whether cortical pulling force generation in animal cells depends just on anchoring of dynein, or whether this requires an additional dynein activator.</p><p>The role of Gα<sub>i/o</sub> subunits in pulling force generation has also remained ambiguous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Membrane-attached Gα∙GDP associates with GoLoco motifs present in the homologous GPR-1/2, Pins, and LGN proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimple et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaefer et al., 2001</xref>). This preference for the GDP-bound ‘inactive’ Gα state explains why RGS-7, a putative GTPase activating protein (GAP), promotes spindle positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hess et al., 2004</xref>). However, the role of another conserved regulator of Gα signaling, RIC-8, remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller and Rand, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tall et al., 2003</xref>). RIC-8 was shown to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) in vitro, while it may function in vivo as a Gα chaperone or as both a GEF and chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afshar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gabay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hampoelz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tall et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2005</xref>).

We used an RNAseq dataset from one-cell embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerstein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hillier et al., 2009</xref>) as a proxy for germline-expressed mRNAs, because one-cell embryos are not transcriptionally active and thus their entire mRNA content should be derived from the maternal germline. We made a list of all 12-nucleotide coding words and assigned each word a score that is the sum of the RPKM expression values of the germline mRNAs in which that word appears. Thus, words that appear frequently, or in highly-expressed germline genes, will have high scores. Although the germline silencing machinery is presumably blind to reading frame, we only considered in-frame 12mers so that our design algorithm would implicitly account for codon usage. Finally, we developed an algorithm to assemble any desired coding sequence from our list of coding 12mers. The algorithm is as follows: (1) Based on the desired amino acid sequence, assemble a list of all 12mers that could appear in the coding sequence, and sort these words by score; (2) Assemble a draft coding sequence by plugging in one word at a time, beginning with the highest-scoring possible word and continuing until the sequence is complete; (3) Compute a score for the entire draft sequence by averaging the scores of each word it contains; (4) Refine the sequence by randomly choosing one word at a time, changing it to a different word, and checking whether the overall sequence score improves. Repeat step (4) until no further improvements are found after a certain number of iterations, which is chosen based on the sequence length such that each residue has a 99% chance of being tested at least once. The random optimization in step (4) is necessary because step (2) favors the highest-scoring words without considering context. Choosing a high-scoring word at one position constrains the subsequent choice of words that overlap the high-scoring word. In some cases, a higher overall score results from choosing two moderately-scoring words, rather than a high- and a low-scoring word, when the two words overlap. Random optimization ensures that these cases are found and maximizes the overall score of the designed sequence.

Codon adaptation index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Redemann et al., 2011</xref>) and our germline optimization score are shown for coding sequences designed to maximize optimal codon usage (CAI = 1 indicates that sequence was designed to have a codon adaptation index as close as possible to 1.00) or to maximize the germline optimization score (GLO, GermLine Optimized). Germline optimization significantly increases the germline optimization score as expected, at the cost of a moderate reduction in codon adaptation index. Despite the lower codon adaptation index, germline-optimized transgenes were most often expressed at higher levels than their codon-optimized counterparts (see above and our unpublished observations).

This could provide insight into the in vivo relevance of the Gα∙GDP/GTP cycle and indicate whether RIC-8 is more likely to contribute as a chaperone or as a GEF. Regulation of the Gα∙GDP/GTP cycle normally takes place at the cell membrane, while chaperoning of Gα folding and trafficking is expected to occur in the cytosol and at endomembranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gabay et al., 2011</xref>). We created strains expressing endogenous RIC-8 and RGS-7 as ePDZ::mCherry protein fusions. When combined with PH::LOV, this resulted in light-inducible membrane recruitment of RIC-8 and RGS-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). Global cortical enrichment of RGS-7 enhanced spindle pole movements (anterior +25% and posterior +20%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) and spindle oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The RGS-7::ePDZ signal was too subtle to reliably control its local recruitment. As an alternative strategy, we fused eGFP::LOV to endogenous PAR-6, which localizes to the anterior cortex of the zygote (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Following global light exposure, recruitment of RGS-7::ePDZ to PAR-6::LOV enhanced the peak velocities of both spindle poles, but most significantly the movement of the anterior pole (anterior +25% and posterior +14%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,c</xref>). Thus, cortical recruitment of RGS-7 acutely increases pulling forces, in agreement with its proposed function as a GAP that promotes Gα∙GDP–GPR-1/2 interaction. In contrast, cortical enrichment of RIC-8 did not significantly enhance pulling forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Thus, in agreement with the <italic>ric-8<sup>lox</sup>; rgs-7<sup>lox</sup></italic> synergistic phenotype, our optogenetic localization experiments support a model in which RIC-8 and RGS-7 promote Gα function at different levels.

Control PH::GFP embryos showed on average 138 membrane invaginations during anaphase in an area covering approximately <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). When plotted along the anterior-posterior axis, the distribution of these invaginations reflected the three described cortical domains: anterior, posterior, and a posterior lateral region at ±60% embryo length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rose and Gonczy, 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>-left). The posterior lateral band region localizes the LET-99 DEP-domain protein, which antagonizes the localization of GPR-1/2 and thereby pulling force generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krueger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsou et al., 2003</xref>). This explains the absence of invaginations around 60% embryo length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>-left).</p><p>Cortical GPR-1 recruitment resulted in a total number of 174 (+25% compared to <italic>ph::lov</italic> control) invaginations in the presence, and 122 invaginations (+249% compared to <italic>Gα(RNAi)</italic> embryos) in the absence of Gα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, in agreement with our observations in spindle severing assays, GPR-1 recruitment to the membrane induces cortical pulling forces, even in the apparent absence of Gα proteins. The lack of invaginations around 60% embryo length was no longer detected when ePDZ::GPR-1 was recruited to PH::LOV. In agreement, the characteristic dip in cortical GPR-1 localization (e.g.: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) was no longer detected after ectopic GPR-1 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Thus, as expected, LET-99 does not antagonize the cortical recruitment of ePDZ::GPR-1 by PH::LOV, in contrast to the Gα∙GDP-mediated localization of endogenous GPR-1/2. The pattern of invaginations still showed two peaks and a mild dip at 50% embryo length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>). The remaining peak numbers of invaginations likely represent the cortical regions closest to the spindle poles, as these sites contact the highest numbers of astral microtubules. Taken together, Gα is not essential for force generation, but the characteristic distribution of force generating events is likely regulated in part at the Gα protein or Gα–GPR-1/2 protein interaction level.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Direct cortical anchoring of dynein is insufficient for cortical pulling force generation</title><p>The Gα–GPR-1/2–LIN-5 complex has been suggested to function as a dynein anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kotak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">di Pietro et al., 2016</xref>). Our optogenetic approach allows replacing the entire complex by PH::LOV, and examining whether the complex strictly acts as an anchor, or whether individual components have additional functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). To directly recruit dynein to the cortex, we generated an <italic>epdz::mcherry</italic> knock-in allele of <italic>dhc-1</italic> (dynein heavy chain). While homozygous <italic>epdz::mcherry::dhc-1</italic> (ePDZ::DHC-1) was viable, its combination with <italic>ph::egfp::lov</italic> was lethal. This effect was also observed for an ePDZ::GFP fusion of DHC-1 in the presence of PH::LOV, but not in the absence of PH::LOV or for mCherry::DHC-1 without the ePDZ domain. Therefore, we attributed the lethality to ePDZ–LOV dark state interactions that disturb essential dynein functions.

Thus, neither Gα nor GPR-1/2 are required for force generation, and this particular context did not reveal a positive contribution of Gα∙GTP either. In immunofluorescence staining experiments, we observed that cortical recruitment of LIN-5 localized dynein to the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, the reverse was also seen: we detected LIN-5 at the cortex following the direct recruitment of ePDZ::DHC-1 to PH::LOV, even after knockdown of <italic>gpr-1/2</italic> by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, top). The p150(Glued) dynactin subunit DNC-1 was also present at the cell cortex of such embryos, which indicates that at least some PH::LOV-localized dynein complexes contain the dynactin cofactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, lower panels). DNC-1<sup>p150</sup> colocalized with PH::LOV membrane-recruited dynein even in <italic>lin-5(RNAi)</italic> embryos. Thus, the cortical localization of dynein through a direct PH::LOV interaction leads to co-recruitment of LIN-5 and dynactin, but not to significant force generation. It is possible that these complexes adapt an inactive conformation or lack specific subunits of the dynein-dynactin motor complex. In contrast, dynein anchored at the cell cortex through the LIN-5 intermediate generated strong pulling forces. Together, these data indicate that association with membrane-attached LIN-5 is essential for dynein to generate cortical pulling forces.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Local LIN-5<sup>Mud/NuMA</sup> recruitment provides experimental control over spindle and cell cleavage plane positioning</title><p>Next, we examined whether we could deploy cortical LIN-5 to manipulate spindle positioning and the outcome of cell division by local illumination with blue light. In the normal P0 cell, the spindle is displaced towards the posterior and cell cleavage creates a larger anterior blastomere (AB) and a smaller posterior blastomere (P1). Local recruitment of LIN-5 to the anterior cortex from metaphase onwards caused the P0 spindle to position anteriorly, which inverted the AB:P1 size asymmetry after cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video18">Video 18</xref>). In addition, recruiting LIN-5 laterally induced a completely perpendicular spindle position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video19">Video 19</xref>). While this triggered some furrowing at the anterior and posterior cell poles, the spindle switched back to an anterior-posterior orientation during cytokinesis, possibly resulting from geometric constraints. We therefore switched to two-cell embryos with the relatively round AB and P1 blastomeres. In two-cell <italic>gpr-1/2(RNAi)</italic> embryos, the spindle fails to rotate in P1, resulting in a transverse spindle orientation in both blastomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Srinivasan et al., 2003</xref>).

We combined these strategies to systematically control the localization of endogenous proteins in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> early embryo by light-induced ePDZ–LOV heterodimerization, to determine their individual contributions in spindle positioning. This demonstrated that LIN-5, but not Gα, RIC-8 and GPR-1/2, is intrinsically required for dynein-dependent pulling force generation. Based on our quantitative analyses, we propose that Gα–GPR-1/2 provides a regulatable membrane anchor, while membrane-bound LIN-5 acts as an obligate adapter and activator of cytoplasmic dynein at the cell cortex.</p><p>Our observations fit with and expand on those from studies in which the LIN-5-related Mud and NuMA proteins where tethered to the cortex. In two earlier studies, this resulted in the conclusion that the NuMA complex acts as a dynein anchor, but substitution of components or Gα protein removal was not tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kotak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ségalen et al., 2010</xref>). However, a very recent study using human carcinoma cells followed an optogenetic strategy similar to ours, and also observed that a membrane anchor cannot replace the entire Gα–LGN–NuMA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Okumura et al., 2018</xref>). As in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, a CAAX membrane anchor could substitute for Gα–LGN in human carcinoma cells, while dynein needed to be anchored through NuMA in order to generate spindle positioning forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Okumura et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, observations in two different systems indicate that dynein activation at microtubule plus ends requires the LIN-5/NuMA adaptor protein, similar to the requirement for an activating dynein adaptor in cargo transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>It is tempting to speculate that activation by LIN-5<sup>NuMA</sup> specifically promotes dynein function in generating membrane associated pulling forces. In the cytoplasm, dynein adopts an inactive conformation and does not show processive movement in the absence of an activating adaptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>). Adaptor proteins such as BicD2 and Hook3 interact with specific cargo as well as with the dynein tail regions and the universal activating complex dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Thereby, these adaptors promote the formation of stable and active dynein–dynactin-adaptor complexes. Recent stuctural analyses revealed that the coiled-coil regions of the adaptors extend in between dynein and dynactin, with multiple adaptor-specific interaction sites, and with several adaptors promoting the recruitment of two dynein complexes in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grotjahn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sladewski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although structural studies have focused on factors promoting minus-end directed transport, it is likely that dynein-dependent cortical pulling forces also involve an activating adaptor. As such, LIN-5<sup>NuMA</sup> could promote the assembly of stable dynein–dynactin complexes and release dynein autoinhibition. It is remarkable, however, that direct recruitment of dynein to the cortex did not result in cortical pulling forces, despite the co-recruitment of LIN-5 and the dynactin subunit DNC-1<sup>p150</sup>. At present, we do not know whether this reflects individual dynein–LIN-5 and dynein–dynactin interactions, or the formation of stable dynein–dynactin–LIN-5 complexes. The lack of pulling forces, despite co-recruitment of LIN-5<sup>NuMA</sup> and DNC-1<sup>p150</sup> together with dynein, may indicate that the complex needs to be anchored through LIN-5 in order to achieve a specific conformation and facilitate microtubule end-on pulling forces. Such a requirement could prevent inappropriate activation of dynein–dynactin–LIN-5<sup>NuMA</sup> complexes in the cytoplasm. In the optogenetic experiments in human carcinoma cells, dynein also localized p150 at the membrane, however in contrast to our findings, NuMA was not observed to be co-recruited in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Okumura et al., 2018</xref>). While the reason for this discrepancy is currently unknown, it might be related to the remarkably different kinetics of the two systems. Using the TULIP system, we observed membrane localization of ePDZ-tagged endogenous proteins within seconds, whereas in the iLID experiments in human carcinoma cells accumulation took place over multiple minutes. It is possible that in the longer time frame, cytoplasmic dynein complexes are recruited to the cortex with adaptors other than NuMA.</p><p>Since only LIN-5 is strictly required for cortical pulling force generation, the question arises why a tripartite dynein anchor is conserved from worm to man. In yeast, dynein is localized by the single-component cortical anchor Num1, a coiled-coil domain protein with a PH-domain for membrane localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ananthanarayanan, 2016</xref>). Our ectopic ePDZ–LOV heterodimerization experiments show that membrane-tethered LIN-5 could suffice as a dynein anchor and activator, and that local regulation is needed to rotate and displace the spindle. Conceivably, the trimeric dynein anchor/adaptor evolved in metazoans to augment context-specific regulation and reduce stochastic activation of spindle pulling forces.</p><p>Which factors may normally control the Gα–GPR-1/2 membrane anchor? The LET-99 protein was previously reported to restrict the localization of GPR-1/2 in a posterior-lateral band region of the one-cell embryo, thereby contributing to higher net pulling forces in the posterior direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsou et al., 2003</xref>). Our observation that direct membrane recruitment of GPR-1 overcomes this regulation is in agreement with LET-99 normally antagonizing Gα∙GDP–GPR-1/2 interaction. Another level of Gα–GPR-1/2 regulation that remains incompletely understood is the contribution of RIC-8 in spindle positioning. The <italic>ric-8</italic> gene was discovered through ‘resistant to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8’ mutants in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> which are defective in Gα<sub>q</sub>-stimulated neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miller et al., 2000</xref>). The discovery that <italic>ric-8</italic> acts also with GOA-1 in spindle positioning indicated a general role for RIC-8 in Gα regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller and Rand, 2000</xref>). Indeed, two different general functions have been reported. Based on in vitro experiments, mammalian RIC-8A acts as a non-receptor GEF, which surprisingly does not activate Gαβγ trimers, but shows higher affinity for free Gα∙GDP and the Gα∙GDP–LGN–NuMA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tall and Gilman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tall et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrated a chaperone function required for the cortical localization of Gα subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gabay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hampoelz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Only the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gα<sub>i</sub> protein forms a complex with Pins–Mud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaefer et al., 2001</xref>), and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gα<sub>i</sub>, but not Gα<sub>o</sub>, depends on RIC-8 for its cortical localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2005</xref>). Seemingly unifying these independently described RIC-8 functions, <italic>C. elegans</italic> RIC-8 was shown to exhibit both GEF and chaperone activity, depending on the Gα subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afshar et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> GOA-1 and GPA-16 Gα proteins act in a substantially redundant manner in spindle positioning, but diverge in other ways. GPA-16 is closest to the Gα<sub>i</sub> class, has been implicated only in spindle positioning, and depends on RIC-8 for its cortical localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afshar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gotta and Ahringer, 2001</xref>). Thus, both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> RIC-8 appears to act as a chaperone for Gα<sub>i</sub> to promote spindle positioning. Also similar to <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the Gα<sub>o</sub> GOA-1 subunit does not require RIC-8 for its membrane localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afshar et al., 2005</xref>). Instead, RIC-8 was reported to act as a GEF for GOA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshar et al., 2004</xref>), and is usually considered to act as a GEF for Gα<sub>q</sub> and Gα<sub>o</sub> in neurotransmitter release. However, the contribution of a Gα<sub>o</sub> GEF in spindle positioning would mean that either Gα∙GTP or Gα∙GDP/GTP cycling promotes spindle pulling forces. Both of these possibilities seem unlikely in light of the results described here. The fact that Gα can be replaced with a PH–membrane anchor dismisses a general requirement for Gα∙GTP in pulling force generation. Moreover, RIC-8 functioning in a Gα∙GDP/GTP cycle is not supported by our knockout and membrane localization studies. Therefore, there is reason to question whether RIC-8 really functions as a GEF. The strongest support for such a function has come from in vitro experiments, in which RIC-8 showed rather inefficient GEF activity towards Gα∙GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>). It appears conceivable that incubation of Gα with a chaperone that affects its folding causes nucleotide dissociation. If correct, the membrane localized GOA-1 in <italic>ric-8</italic> mutants would reflect an incompletely functional form.</p><p>Despite the observed replaceability of Gα with a general membrane anchor, Gα∙GTP has been reported to affect the spindle orientation in specific tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Katanaev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaefer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoshiura et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts and sensory organ precursor cells, canonical G-protein signaling is used to align cellular polarity with tissue polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Katanaev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoshiura et al., 2012</xref>). As such, Gα∙GTP may indirectly contribute to spindle positioning. In addition, one of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pins GoLoco domains was found to preferentially interact with Gα<sub>o</sub>∙GTP, thereby linking the spindle positioning machinery with canonical G-protein signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kopein and Katanaev, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoshiura et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, while not needed for the generation of dynein-dependent cortical pulling forces, further studies will need to reveal to what extent Gα∙GTP contributes to spindle positioning in a tissue or developmental context specific manner.</p><p>For our in vivo dissection of spindle positioning, we developed and applied methods for germline-specific gene knockout, tagging of endogenous proteins, reliable expression of foreign sequences in the germline, and light-inducible protein heterodimerization. These methods further expand the molecular biology toolbox for in vivo studies and can be broadly applied to other biological processes. Of particular interest is the acquired possibility to experimentally control the position of the spindle, for instance for future studies aimed at deciphering how the spindle determines the plane of cell cleavage, and whether specific cell-cell contacts affect cell fate.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>All strains derived <break/>from N2</td><td>CGC</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Antibody</td><td valign="bottom">mouse polyclonal <break/>anti-LIN-5</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lorson et al., 2000</xref></td><td valign="bottom"/><td/></tr><tr><td> Antibody</td><td valign="bottom">mouse monoclonal <break/>anti-FLAG M2</td><td valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat.

Your article has been reviewed by Andrea Musacchio as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Fielmich et al., present an elegant optogenetic analysis that demonstrates the sufficiency of light-induced cortical localization of LIN-5/NuMa to activate dynein-dependent cortical pulling forces that orient mitotic spindles in the early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo. Importantly, they show that light-induced cortical localization is sufficient to induce increased pulling forces in the absence of GPR-1,2/LGN that normally acts to tether LIN-5 to the membrane via an interaction with Gα∙GDP, and that light-induced cortical localization of dynein alone is not sufficient to generate increased pulling forces. This is an impressive use of optogenetics to establish the sufficiency of cortical LIN-5 to activate dynein in the absence of upstream regulation. The authors provide thorough and appropriate statistical analyses indicating the significance of their findings and present a thorough and compelling genetic analysis of this issue. The authors also introduce a novel approach to avoiding germline silencing of transgenes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that will be of substantial interest to other researchers studying processes controlled by germline expressed gene products. Similarly, their use of germline Cre-Lox gene deletion to bypass earlier essential requirements and achieve a more substantial reduction in gene function compared to RNAi is rigorous and impressive.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Direct targeting of dynein heavy chain to the cortex also recruits LIN-5 to the cortex (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). Given that LIN-5 is proposed to act as a dynein activator, it is surprising that no cortical pulling forces are generated in this condition. One possibility is that dynactin is missing from the cortical dynein/LIN-5 assembly when dynein is directly targeted to the cortex. The authors should perform IF against a dynactin component to address this.</p><p>2) An interesting analysis of the manuscript is the dissection of the Gα∙GTP-cycle and its regulation by RGS-7 and RIC-8. The authors generically refer to Gα to indicate both GOA-1 and GPA-16. It is known that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts two Gα subunits synergies to drive spindle orientation (Yoshiura, 2012). To understand whether also in <italic>C. elegans</italic> the two Gα subunits play distinct roles, it would be interesting to explore the phenotypic effect of ablating of the Gα subunits individually when targeting RGS-7 or RIC-8 to the cortex. Alternatively, the possibility of the two Gα subunits playing distinct roles should be discussed.</p><p>3) The authors report that membrane invaginations appear upon GPR-1 ectopic targeting, which is an intriguing observation. Do the authors think that these invaginations are physiological or that they are generated by increased cortical levels of GPR-1? What are the levels of GPR-1 ectopically accumulated at the membrane by the TUPLIP photo-inducible system compared to the levels recruited by Gα? It would be important to discuss whether these invaginations might be a common feature occurring in cellular systems other than <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo as a general mechanism of force generators' activation.</p><p>4) The authors find that Gα knockdown results in a shift in the band of decreased pulling forces that in wild-type zygotes depends on LET-99 for its slightly posteriorized location. While this is a minor issue, it is somewhat puzzling. Have the authors, or others in previous studies, examined LET-99 localization in Gα mutants? If this has been done, it would be worth mentioning in the Discussion section; if not perhaps the authors could look at LET-99 localization and see if it is shifted similarly?</p><p>5) The authors nicely count spots associated with membrane invaginations as an alternative to pulling forces to quantify the effects of light-induced cortical localization of these regulators. In the images of the spots (Figure 5G), there seem to be spots at the very posterior and anterior poles, and yet the bar graphs show an absence of such foci at the termini. Why are the numbers reduced at the extreme ends, and if they are, why do there seem to be quite a few of them, particularly at the anterior pole, in the lower image of Figure 5G? I can imagine where it is largely a surface area issue, but some clarification on this point might be worthwhile.</p><p>6) The authors never present any data in which LIN-5 is knocked down using RNAi. In particular, it would seem like a worthwhile thing to do when documenting the light-induced cortical localization of Dynein (presumably it would be independent of not only GPR-1/2, as shown, but also of LIN-5). Perhaps more importantly, as something of a control, it might be worth showing that the effect of light induced cortical localization of LIN-5 is in fact LIN-5 dependent (loss of pulling forces after blue light exposure in lin-5(RNAi) zygotes). This is a minor concern, given the other controls. But I am curious as to why the authors have not used any lin-5(RNAi) in their analysis at some point, just for the sake of completeness if nothing else.</p><p>7) While the authors point out how their analysis goes beyond two previous studies that also addressed the role of LIN-5/NuMa in activating cortical dynein pulling forces (Kota et al., 2012; Ségelin et al., 2010), the authors need to address in similar fashion results just published in <italic>eLife</italic> from Okumura et al., 2018) concerning vertebrate NuMa. The authors should cite this paper and discuss their results in the context of the ones reported by the Kiyomitsu paper.</p><p>8) Unless I missed it, the authors do not describe in the text, figure legend, or methods exactly how they did the localized light-induced increases in cortical LIN-5. Some mention of the control of blue light illumination used for restricted localization should be provided in the Materials and methods section at least.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38198.054</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>Fielmich et al., present an elegant optogenetic analysis that demonstrates the sufficiency of light-induced cortical localization of LIN-5/NuMa to activate dynein-dependent cortical pulling forces that orient mitotic spindles in the early C. elegans embryo.

Notably, the reverse was also seen: we detected LIN-5 at the cortex following the direct recruitment of ePDZ::DHC-1 to PH::LOV, even after knockdown of <italic>gpr-1/2</italic> by RNAi (Figure 6—figure supplement 2, top). The p150(Glued) dynactin subunit DNC-1 was also present at the cell cortex of such embryos, which indicates that at least some PH::LOV-localized dynein complexes contain the dynactin cofactor (Figure 6—figure supplement 2, lower panels). DNC-1<sup>p150</sup> colocalized with PH::LOV membrane-recruited dynein even in <italic>lin-5(RNAi)</italic> embryos. Thus, the cortical localization of dynein through a direct PH::LOV interaction leads to co-recruitment of LIN-5 and dynactin, but not to significant force generation. It is possible that these complexes adapt an inactive conformation or lack specific subunits of the dynein-dynactin motor complex. In contrast, dynein anchored at the cell cortex through the LIN-5 intermediate generated strong pulling forces. Together, these data indicate that association with membrane-attached LIN-5 is essential for dynein to generate cortical pulling forces.”</p><p>In the manuscript, we included only the anti-FLAG staining of DNC-1::mNG::3xFLAG, because the anti-DNC-1 antibody occasionally showed some background staining of the cortex in negative control experiments. Using this reagent in additional experiments, we observed that DNC-1 is also co-recruited with ePDZ::DHC-1 to the cortex in the apparent absence of GPR-1/2 and LIN-5 (New Figure 5—figure supplement 2, lower panels). Although surprising, these results support our conclusion that membrane anchoring of the dynein-dynactin complex through LIN-5 is required for pulling force generation on MT plus ends.</p><p>The Kiyomitsu group (Okumura et al., 2018) also observed that dynein needs to be anchored through NuMA for spindle positioning. Moreover, they also observed that, despite the lack of cortical pulling, the p150 subunit is co-recruited when dynein is directly targeted to the cell membrane. A difference from their results is that we observe co-recruitment of LIN-5<sup>NuMA</sup> as well. The two systems show remarkably different kinetics: using the TULIP system, we observe membrane localization of ePDZ-tagged endogenous proteins within seconds, while in the iLID experiments in HeLa cells accumulation takes place over minutes. It is possible that in this time frame, dynein complexes are recruited to the cortex with adaptors other than NuMA. We have included this point in the Discussion section (see also point 8 below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) An interesting analysis of the manuscript is the dissection of the Gα∙GTP-cycle and its regulation by RGS-7 and RIC-8. The authors generically refer to Gα to indicate both GOA-1 and GPA-16. It is known that in Drosophila neuroblasts two Gα subunits synergies to drive spindle orientation (Yoshiura, 2012). To understand whether also in C. elegans the two Gα subunits play distinct roles, it would be interesting to explore the phenotypic effect of ablating of the Gα subunits individually when targeting RGS-7 or RIC-8 to the cortex. Alternatively, the possibility of the two Gα subunits playing distinct roles should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the GOA-1 and GPA-16 Gα proteins act in a substantially redundant manner, but each protein contributes by itself to cortical pulling forces (Afshar et al., 2004; our unpublished results), which does not necessarily involve identical mechanisms. Several studies have described differences in the contribution of GOA-1 compared to GPA-16 in spindle positioning, including studies by the Gönczy lab (e.g. Afshar et al., 2005) and our group (e.g. Berends et al., 2013). Nevertheless, these distinct roles remain incompletely understood, and cortical RGS-7 and RIC-8 targeting experiments in combination with individual Gα knockdown could indeed reveal specificity of RGS-7 for one of the Gα proteins. It is also possible, but not likely, that an effect from RIC-8 recruitment would be observed in the context of a single Gα, in contrast to the wild-type situation that we have examined.</p><p>Although interesting, we feel that including such experiments would take away from the flow of the manuscript and the main focus of this part of the study. We mainly try to address the question whether Gα∙GTP (GOA-1 and/or GPA-16) may contribute to spindle positioning. Therefore, we took the reviewer’s suggestion to expand on possible distinct roles of Gα proteins in the Discussion section.We have now included discussion of <italic>C. elegans</italic> GOA-1 and GPA-16 in a newly added paragraph, and of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gα<sub>i</sub> and Gα<sub>o</sub> in the text preceding and following this paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors report that membrane invaginations appear upon GPR-1 ectopic targeting, which is an intriguing observation. Do the authors think that these invaginations are physiological or that they are generated by increased cortical levels of GPR-1? What are the levels of GPR-1 ectopically accumulated at the membrane by the TUPLIP photo-inducible system compared to the levels recruited by Gα? It would be important to discuss whether these invaginations might be a common feature occurring in cellular systems other than C. elegans embryo as a general mechanism of force generators' activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret that the description of membrane invaginations has not been sufficiently clear. These invaginations can be detected in wild-type embryos and were used by us as a read out to quantify the extent and distribution of spindle pulling forces; thereby providing a method that is independent of the spindle severing assays and complements these assays.</p><p>These membrane invaginations were first described by the Hyman and Howard labs (Redemann et al., 2010; cited in the manuscript). These authors make a strong case that the invaginations are physiologic and reflect that the cell membrane is pulled inward at the sites of cortical force generation. The invaginations become much more prominent when the actin-myosin cortex is weakened, and they fully depend on the components of the force generating complex. Therefore, they have been proposed by Redemann et al., to “serve as a tool to localize the sites of force generation at the cortex”. In previous studies, we have followed these invaginations extensively by spinning disk confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (e.g. Berends et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2017).</p><p>To get this point across more clearly, we have included a more extensive reference to the earlier studies (subsection “Membrane anchoring of GPR-1<sup>Pins/LGN</sup> in the absence of Gα reconstructs a cortical pulling force generator”):</p><p>“Therefore, we used an additional read-out of cortical pulling forces. Cortical pulling events cause inward movements of the plasma membrane, which are visible by spinning disk-confocal fluorescence microscopy as extended invaginations of the plasma membrane (Redemann et al., 2010) (Figure 5G and Video 10, Video 11). These membrane invaginations occur in wild type embryos, depend on microtubules and cortical force generator components, and correlate with the distribution of pulling force generators (Redemann et al., 2010). Therefore, these membrane invaginations most likely reveal the presence and distribution of active individual force generators.“</p><p>Moreover, we extended the description and explanation of the change in invaginations (subsection “Membrane anchoring of GPR-1<sup>Pins/LGN</sup> in the absence of Gα reconstructs a cortical pulling force generator”), which addresses question (4) (see below).</p><p>Even though invaginations are detected in wild-type embryos, the reviewer’s question about cortical GPR-1 levels is clearly relevant. Based on immunofluorescence microscopy as well as immunofluorescence staining experiments, the induced levels are well above the normal endogenous level of GPR-1, and also LIN-5 and DHC-1 (see images Figure 5B, Figure 6B, Figure 7B) This also follows from previous quantifications: for eGFP::LIN-5, we recorded peak levels of up to ~1.2-fold enrichment at the cortex-over-cytoplasm in anaphase of the P0 blastomere (Schmidt et al., 2017). Using the same quantification method and immunofluorescent staining of wild type embryos, Park and Rose reported a ~1.2-fold cortex-over-cytoplasm ratio for LIN-5, and ~1.5-fold enrichment for GPR-1/2 (Development 2008). Thus, the induced GPR-1 and LIN-5 cortical levels are much higher than normal (see quantifications in Figure 5C, Figure 7C), but dynein at the cortex does not increase to the same extent (Figure 6—figure supplement 2, Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Because of these differences in cortical protein levels, we only comment on the distribution of pulling forces, not on the absolute amount.</p><p>Notably, the cortex-over-cytoplasm of endogenously tagged dynein is closer to 1 in the one-cell embryo (Schmidt et al., 2017). This is well below the ~2 to 3-fold cortex-over-cytoplasm ratio observed for ePDZ::mCherry::DHC-1 in the fully-induced state (See quantification in Figure 6C). Despite this high amount of directly membrane-tethered dynein, pulling forces were not detected.</p><p>In the manuscript, we show a quantification of the cortex-over-cytoplasm levels over time following exposure to blue light, for the ePDZ fusions of GPR-1 as well as DHC-1 and LIN-5 (Figure 5C, Figure 6C, Figure 7C). While not representing the normal distribution of endogenous proteins, this illustrates how our phenotypic observations correlate with the induced cortical protein levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors find that Gα knockdown results in a shift in the band of decreased pulling forces that in wild-type zygotes depends on LET-99 for its slightly posteriorized location. While this is a minor issue, it is somewhat puzzling. Have the authors, or others in previous studies, examined LET-99 localization in Gα mutants? If this has been done, it would be worth mentioning in the Discussion section; if not perhaps the authors could look at LET-99 localization and see if it is shifted similarly?</p></disp-quote><p>The localization of LET-99 has been previously studied in <italic>goa-1; gpa-16</italic> RNAi embryos by both Bringmann et al., (2007) and Price and Rose (2017).</p><p>However, the point we try to make is not that LET-99 becomes displaced, but that the distribution of spindle pulling forces becomes independent of LET-99. In agreement, both cited studies reported a displacement of LET-99 to the posterior, while the dip in invaginations we observe shifts anteriorly (to the middle of the embryo). More importantly, direct recruitment of GPR-1/2 to the cortex overcomes the normal drop in cortical GPR-1/2, which is now stated in the text.</p><p>We tried to clarify this issue by re-wording the text in subsection “Membrane anchoring of GPR-1<sup>Pins/LGN</sup> in the absence of Gα reconstructs a cortical pulling force generator”:</p><p>“When plotted along the anterior-posterior axis, the distribution of these invaginations reflected the three described cortical domains: anterior, posterior, and a posterior lateral region at ± 60% embryo length (Rose and Gönczy, 2014) (Figure 5H-left). The posterior lateral band region localizes the LET-99 DEP-domain protein, which antagonizes the localization of GPR-1/2 and thereby pulling force generation (Krueger et al., 2010; Tsou et al., 2003). This explains the absence of invaginations around 60% embryo length (Figure 5H-left).</p><p>Cortical GPR-1 recruitment resulted in a total number of 174 (+25% compared to <italic>ph::lov</italic> control) invaginations in the presence, and 122 invaginations (+249% compared to <italic>Gα(RNAi)</italic> embryos) in the absence of Gα (Figure 5—figure supplement 3). Thus, in agreement with our observations in spindle severing assays, GPR-1 recruitment to the membrane induces cortical pulling forces, even in the apparent absence of Gα proteins. The lack of invaginations around 60% embryo length was no longer detected when ePDZ::GPR-1 was recruited to PH::LOV. In agreement, the characteristic dip in cortical GPR-1 localization (e.g.: Figure 1B) was no longer detected after ectopic GPR-1 recruitment (Figure 5B). Thus, as expected, LET-99 does not antagonize the cortical recruitment of ePDZ::GPR-1 by PH::LOV, in contrast to the Gα∙GDP-mediated localization of endogenous GPR-1/2. The pattern of invaginations still showed two peaks and a mild dip at 50% embryo length (Figure 5H). The remaining peak numbers of invaginations likely represent the cortical regions closest to the spindle poles, as these sites contact the highest numbers of astral microtubules. Taken together, Gα is not essential for force generation, but the characteristic distribution of force generating events is likely regulated in part at the Gα protein or Gα–GPR-1/2 protein interaction level.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors nicely count spots associated with membrane invaginations as an alternative to pulling forces to quantify the effects of light-induced cortical localization of these regulators. In the images of the spots (Figure 5G), there seem to be spots at the very posterior and anterior poles, and yet the bar graphs show an absence of such foci at the termini. Why are the numbers reduced at the extreme ends, and if they are, why do there seem to be quite a few of them, particularly at the anterior pole, in the lower image of Figure 5G? I can imagine where it is largely a surface area issue, but some clarification on this point might be worthwhile.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand this is confusing. Apart from the size, the most important criterion for assigning dots to membrane invaginations is their transient nature. Thereby, we distinguish between membrane invaginations and the extensive “ruffling” of the cortex, which is most noticeable in the anterior during polarity establishment.</p><p>To clarify this point, we included in the Materials and methods section and Legend of Figure 5G:</p><p>“Plasma membrane invaginations resulting from cortical pulling forces are visible as lines in the DNA plane and dots in the subcortical plane (red arrows). Larger structures are membrane ruffles, which are distinct from the more dynamic invaginations, as can be seen in Video 11. Scale bar: 5 µm.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors never present any data in which LIN-5 is knocked down using RNAi. In particular, it would seem like a worthwhile thing to do when documenting the light-induced cortical localization of Dynein (presumably it would be independent of not only GPR-1/2, as shown, but also of LIN-5). Perhaps more importantly, as something of a control, it might be worth showing that the effect of light induced cortical localization of LIN-5 is in fact LIN-5 dependent (loss of pulling forces after blue light exposure in lin-5(RNAi) zygotes). This is a minor concern, given the other controls. But I am curious as to why the authors have not used any lin-5(RNAi) in their analysis at some point, just for the sake of completeness if nothing else.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we focused on Gα and <italic>gpr-1/2</italic> knockdown embryos, because these embryos do not deviate from wild-type until the time of mitotic spindle positioning. By contrast, <italic>lin-5</italic> is also required for meiosis and RNAi of <italic>lin-5</italic> causes a failure to expel polar bodies, resulting in the formation of multiple maternal pronuclei (Srinivasan et al., 2003; van der Voet et al., 2009). While the extra chromosomes congress at a single metaphase plate in <italic>lin-5(RNAi)</italic> embryos, it seems cleaner to avoid these additional defects. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that examination of <italic>lin-5(RNAi)</italic> embryos should be included in the manuscript, and we have performed such experiments for the dynein recruitment studies (Figure 6—figure supplement 1, Figure 6—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) While the authors point out how their analysis goes beyond two previous studies that also addressed the role of LIN-5/NuMa in activating cortical dynein pulling forces (Kota et al., 2012; Ségelin et al., 2010), the authors need to address in similar fashion results just published in eLife from Okumura et al., 2018) concerning vertebrate NuMa. The authors should cite this paper and discuss their results in the context of the ones reported by the Kiyomitsu paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and now extensively refer to the Kiyomitsu paper in the Discussion section:</p><p>“In two earlier studies, this resulted in the conclusion that the NuMA complex acts as a dynein anchor, but substitution of components or Gα protein removal was not tested (Kotak et al., 2012; Ségalen et al., 2010). However, a very recent study of HeLa cells followed an optogenetic strategy similar to ours, and also observed that a membrane anchor cannot replace the entire Gα–LGN–NuMA complex (Okumura et al., 2018). As in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, a CAAX membrane anchor could substitute for Gα–LGN in Hela cells, while dynein needed to be anchored through NuMA in order to generate spindle positioning forces (Okumura et al., 2018). Thus, observations in two different systems indicate that dynein activation at microtubule plus ends requires the LIN-5/NuMA adaptor protein, similar to the requirement for an activating dynein adaptor in cargo transport (McKenney et al., 2014; Schlager et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2017).<bold>”</bold></p><p>“……In the optogenetic experiments in Hela cells, dynein also localized p150 at the membrane, however in contrast to our findings, NuMA was not observed to be co-recruited in this study (Okumura et al., 2018). While the reason for this discrepancy is currently unknown, it might be related to the remarkably different kinetics of the two systems. Using the TULIP system, we observed membrane localization of ePDZ-tagged endogenous proteins within seconds, whereas in the iLID experiments in HeLa cells accumulation took place over multiple minutes. It is possible that in the longer time frame, cytoplasmic dynein complexes are recruited to the cortex with adaptors other than NuMA.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Unless I missed it, the authors do not describe in the text, figure legend, or methods exactly how they did the localized light-induced increases in cortical LIN-5. Some mention of the control of blue light illumination used for restricted localization should be provided in the Materials and methods section at least.</p></disp-quote><p>This was indeed included, and most likely missed because it was described Materials and methods section titled ‘Dark state spinning disc microscopy’. We renamed this section ‘Dark state experiments and local recruitment of ePDZ-tagged proteins to membrane LOV’ for clarity. The hardware and software used for these experiments are mentioned in subsection ‘Spinning disc microscopy’.</p><p>The sensitivity of the ePDZ-LOV interaction and scattering of light varies from system to system, depending on protein concentrations and physical properties of the cell under investigation. The area of activation and laser power appropriate for local control of ePDZ-LOV activation will therefore have to be determined by experience of the experimentalist. For this purpose, we used a control strain expressing diffuse ePDZ::mCherry and PH::eGFP::LOV to calibrate the laser power and area of activation that enable local control of the ePDZ-LOV interaction. The laser powers we used ranged from 1-10%, depending on the strength of the laser (we have an in-house built microscopy set-up for which the lasers have to be re-aligned manually from time to time, after which laser power is stronger).</p></body></sub-article></article>
