post-transcriptional levels. However, how regulation at multiple levels achieves precise control remains elusive. Using published and new datasets, we profile a time course of mature and pri-miRNAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and reveal the dynamics of miRNA production and degradation as well as dynamic changes in pri-miRNA isoform selection. We found that 5’ nucleotides influence stability of mature miRNAs. Furthermore, distinct half-lives of miRNAs from the <italic>mir-309</italic> cluster shape their temporal expression patterns, and the importance of rapid degradation of the miRNAs in gene regulation is detected as distinct evolutionary signatures at the target sites in the transcriptome. Finally, we show that rapid degradation of miR-3/–309 may be important for regulation of the planar cell polarity pathway component Vang. Altogether, the results suggest that complex mechanisms regulate miRNA expression to support normal development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38389.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells produce proteins by feeding molecules that contain temporary copies of the gene for that protein through a complex structure called a ribosome. The ribosome follows the coded instructions in these molecules to build the protein. These temporary copies of the code are reusable. Even if the cell stops copying a gene it will continue to produce the protein for a short time.</p><p>MicroRNAs (often shortened to just miRNAs) can switch protein production off. These are short molecules that stick to the code of the protein-producing molecules. This renders the molecules unreadable to ribosomes, and also makes it a target for destruction by enzymes. Different miRNAs have different targets, helping to fine-tune the timing and amount of protein production.</p><p>There are two stages to the production of miRNAs. First, the cell copies the gene into primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs). Then, it turns these molecules into mature miRNAs. The cell can vary the number of pri-miRNAs made, control how and when they mature, and change the lifespan of the mature miRNAs. But, it is unclear how these processes all work together to achieve fine control of protein production.</p><p>Recent studies have revealed when, where and how much miRNA is present in developing organisms. So, scientists are now at the point where they can start to understand how cells control miRNA levels. Here, Zhou, Lim et al. created small RNA libraries at eight time windows during the development of fruit fly embryos. The libraries contained the mature miRNAs present at each developmental stage. Fruit fly embryos develop quickly, taking only 24 hours to make a larva from a single fertilized egg, and its genes must respond quickly.</p><p>When combined with existing datasets, the new data revealed how mature and pri-miRNAs change as fly embryos develop. Many miRNA genes sit close together, forming clusters in the fruit fly genome. Yet rather than make them all at once, the fly embryos often copied them in sets. So, as development progressed, different groups of miRNAs came into use. To achieve this, the cells copied different parts of the cluster at different times, and altered the way they processed the pri-miRNAs. The miRNAs from the same cluster lasted for different lengths of time, and the cells rapidly destroyed unwanted mature miRNAs. Together, these mechanisms shaped the timing and composition of each distinct set of miRNAs.</p><p>Understanding the control of miRNAs is an essential step in understanding how the cell regulates its genes. There are thousands of miRNA genes in the human genome, and a failure to control them can contribute to human diseases, including cancer. Future studies could extend this work by sampling other tissues of the fly, or tissues of other organisms, including humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>miRNA stability</kwd><kwd>clustered miRNA genes</kwd><kwd>embryogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001381</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF2011NRF-NRFF001-042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Mandy Yu Theng</given-names></name><name><surname>Okamura</surname><given-names>Katsutomo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM083300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bortolamiol-Becet</surname><given-names>Diane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOE2014-T2-2-039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tolwinski</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001352</institution-id><institution>National University of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R-154-000-536-133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tucker-Kellogg</surname><given-names>Greg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS083833</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bortolamiol-Becet</surname><given-names>Diane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001352</institution-id><institution>National University of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R-154-000-562-112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tucker-Kellogg</surname><given-names>Greg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001352</institution-id><institution>National University of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R-154-000-582-651</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tucker-Kellogg</surname><given-names>Greg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Selective degradation of mature miRNAs shapes temporal miRNA expression patterns and is important for proper regulation of target genes to support normal development of Drosophila embryos.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene expression is regulated at multiple levels involving transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Small RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs) play central roles in post-transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes. Typically, miRNAs are transcribed as primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II and their molecular architectures resemble those of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). The majority of miRNAs are processed from pri-miRNAs by a two-step cleavage mechanism involving two RNase III-class enzymes, Drosha and Dicer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Okamura, 2012</xref>). The resulting 21-23nt miRNA duplexes are loaded onto Argonaute family proteins and subsequently unwound to form mature effector complexes that regulate expression of target mRNAs.</p><p>Analogous to regulation of protein-coding genes, expression of miRNAs is regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ha and Kim, 2014</xref>). Transcription of pri-miRNAs is developmentally regulated as shown by in situ hybridization and transcriptome analysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboobaker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Graveley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, recent studies also revealed a variety of mechanisms post-transcriptionally regulating miRNA processing in a gene-specific or global manner. Sequence-specific RNA binding proteins can positively or negatively regulate miRNA processing through binding to pri- or pre-miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rybak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Viswanathan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Suzuki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Trabucchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guil and Cáceres, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Treiber et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, global miRNA processing activity can be altered depending on the expression level of the core miRNA processing factors and/or the status of post-translational modifications of miRNA processing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Paroo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herbert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wada et al., 2012</xref>). miRNAs are also generally destabilized in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krol et al., 2010</xref>). As expected for important gene regulators, dysregulation of miRNA activity is often implicated in diseases. For example, aberrant expression levels of miRNA processing factors are observed in various cancers, and proteins that are involved in neurological disorders often have miRNA-related functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Emde and Hornstein, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although individual post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate miRNA processing have been studied under some cellular conditions, the extent to which these mechanisms contribute to miRNA expression profiles during natural development is not understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rüegger and Großhans, 2012</xref>). In addition, expression of alternative pri-miRNA isoforms was shown to be important for differential regulation of individual members of clustered miRNAs using cell lines, but its biological significance remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Rie et al., 2017</xref>). A previous study performed genome-wide analysis using a panel of small RNA libraries focusing on clustered miRNAs to detect effects of post-transcriptional regulation with a limited time resolution led to identification of candidate genes that are post-transcriptionally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ryazansky et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use fly embryogenesis as a model system to study regulation of miRNA biogenesis during development. We generated small RNA libraries from 8- time windows that cover the entire fly embryogenesis and quantified mature miRNA levels. Using integrated analysis of this set of small RNA libraries and total RNA-seq libraries published by modENCODE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Westholm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duff et al., 2015</xref>), we found that mature miRNA expression changes can be predicted relatively precisely based on the transcriptional activity after taking degradation of mature miRNAs into account. Our results suggested that processing efficiency and mature miRNA half-lives stay generally constant throughout embryogenesis except for very early stages. However, some individual miRNAs show distinct half-lives, and miRNA stability plays a significant role in shaping the miRNA expression profile and in turn influences evolution of target sites in 3’UTRs. Our results also indicate that transcriptional start/termination sites (TSSs/TTSs) are flexibly used to express distinct sets of miRNAs from a single cluster and selection of alternative pri-miRNA isoforms is regulated in a developmental stage and signaling dependent manner.</p><p>These results provide insight into miRNA regulation in developmental processes at the global level and reveal complex mechanisms that support precise regulation of miRNA expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Global changes in the bulk miRNA abundance during embryogenesis</title><p>To understand how the miRNA expression profile changes during fly embryogenesis, we prepared small RNA libraries in 2 hr windows from 0 to 12 hr after egg laying (hAEL) and 6 hr windows from 12-24hAEL. We prepared libraries in biological triplicate, each of which contained 9.8–23.8 million reads perfectly mapping to the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Sheet 1). To study the composition of the small RNA population, small RNA reads were first grouped under four categories: (1) miRNA, (2) endo-siRNA + piRNA, (3) reads from abundant non-coding RNAs (rRNAs and tRNAs etc.) and (4) other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Sheet 2). In 0-2hAEL embryos, category two small RNAs constituted &gt;50% of the small RNA population, consistent with the large amount of maternally deposited piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) produced from various transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brennecke et al., 2008</xref>). The fraction of category two small RNAs continuously declined until 12-18hAEL, with a concomitant increase of the miRNA fraction. In 18-24hAEL, we observed a reproducible increase of small RNAs derived from abundant ncRNAs. Closer inspection revealed that these small RNAs were mainly derived from rRNAs, and no specific size peaks were observed with this category of small RNAs in this time window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggested that rRNA-derived small RNAs may be degradation intermediates with no functionality, but the reason for this rapid increase of these fragments in this developmental stage is not known.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38389.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mature and pri-miRNA profiles revealed by RNA-seq analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Composition of small RNA libraries.

The normalized values were expressed as reads per thousand spike-in reads (RPTS). We believe that this normalization scheme permits more accurate comparisons of the miRNA levels in different libraries as compared to conventional normalization methods. The conventional approach using the total counts of mappable reads assumes that the total amount of small RNAs stays constant in different samples, but such assumptions might not be appropriate for certain analyses. For example, the large number of rRNA reads in 18-24hAEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) could strongly affect normalization factors of the conventional methods.</p><p>We first analyzed the overall abundance of miRNAs after normalizing read counts against the spike-in counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Sheet 2). We observed a continuous increase of the total mature miRNA abundance throughout embryogenesis. This may be consistent with the notion that early embryos generally show relatively low miRNA activity and differentiated cells rely more strongly on miRNA-mediated mechanisms for gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kumar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kumar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Suh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ohnishi et al., 2010</xref>).

For each of the 87 miRNAs whose expression levels satisfied our cutoff (&gt;50 RPTS), we calculated relative expression levels in the eight time windows, and grouped the miRNA genes into four clusters using the k-means clustering method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hartigan and Wong, 1979</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left). Cluster 1 included 15 miRNAs that showed the highest expression levels in early stages. The majority of miRNA genes in this group were maternally deposited miRNAs with weak zygotic expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marco, 2015</xref>). The rapid decrease of maternal mature miRNA species was consistent with Wispy-mediated degradation of maternal miRNAs as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Cluster 4 included 6 genes and showed detectable decrease in late stages. This observation suggested that these miRNAs are relatively unstable, and the small number of genes in this category was consistent with the conclusion in previous cell culture-based studies that a small subset of miRNAs is degraded relatively quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duffy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marzi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The majority (75.8%; 66 out of 87 genes) of genes belonged to clusters 2 and 3 that showed increasing trends throughout embryogenesis. This indicated that the increase in the expression level is a general trend for many miRNA genes in fly embryos, and that the increase in the bulk miRNA abundance was not caused by a small number of miRNA species. Coincidentally, the AGO1 protein level was also lower in very early embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3B</xref>, 0–2h and 2–4h lanes). This may suggest that the AGO1 protein level may be a limiting factor that determines the bulk miRNA abundance. Alternatively, the lower level of mature miRNAs may trigger degradation of apo-AGO1, as observed in tissues depleted of miRNA processing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Smibert et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>These results confirmed distinct behaviors of small RNA families during fly embryogenesis, reflecting their distinct biological functions. The large difference of the total miRNA levels (eight times increase from 0-2hAEL to 18-24hAEL) estimated by our method underscores the importance of the selection of normalization methods, as the conventional RPM (reads per million) normalization method generally disregards the change in the size of small RNA population.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Transcription levels of individual pri-miRNAs estimated by total RNA-seq analysis</title><p>To profile transcription levels of individual miRNA genes on a genome-wide scale, we reanalyzed ribosomal RNA-depleted, stranded total RNA-seq data from fly embryos on a similar time course that were generated by the modENCODE consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Westholm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duff et al., 2015</xref>). The expression level of each miRNA gene was estimated using the density of total RNA-seq reads in the 100-nucleotide window immediately upstream of the pre-miRNA hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>Pri-miRNA species (or introns in the case of miRNAs residing in introns of protein-coding mRNAs) are believed to have much shorter half-lives compared to mature mRNAs or mature miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gaidatzis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nojima et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this notion, transient peaks of the pri-miRNA levels were often observed, suggesting that miRNA transcription is activated generally in short time-windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right). For example, even for the miRNAs in clusters 2 and 3 that showed the highest mature miRNA levels in the last time window, their corresponding primary miRNAs generally exhibited expression peaks in earlier time windows while mature miRNA remained present for at least several hours.</p><p>The change rate of mature miRNA level per unit of time (hereafter ‘miRNA change rate’) should be determined by two factors: new synthesis and degradation. We sought to test how well the miRNA change rate could be predicted by taking only these two factors into consideration. For simplicity, we approximated the model based on the following two assumptions: the level of transcription would be the primary determinant of the miRNA synthesis rate and the amount of mature miRNA that is degraded at a given moment would be proportional to the amount of miRNA products present at the moment. Based on these assumptions, we performed multiple linear regression analysis to obtain coefficients by fitting the quantified values of mature and primary miRNAs to the following equation: <italic>z</italic> ~ a<italic>x</italic>+ b<italic>y</italic> +c, where <italic>z</italic> = change rate of mature miRNA, <italic>x</italic> = initial miRNA level, and <italic>y</italic> = upstream density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, see Materials and methods for details). When we tested the correlation between the predicted and observed change rates for all time windows of all miRNAs, we found that the change rates could be generally accurately predicted (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.81; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This suggested that, for the majority of miRNAs, the production rate per pri-miRNA molecule as well as the degradation rate of mature miRNAs were relatively constant throughout embryogenesis. Nevertheless, when we analyzed the prediction accuracy in each window, we observed a trend where the predicted change rate tended to be higher than the observed data in early time windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This may mean that mature miRNAs were less efficiently processed from pri-miRNAs in early embryos. It is also possible that pri-miRNA degradation might be slower in these windows, leading to an overestimation of transcriptional activity. Although we excluded miRNAs that are deposited as maternal miRNAs at high levels from this analysis, the small amount of maternal miRNAs and their rapid degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2014</xref>) might also contribute to this inaccurate prediction in this window. In other time windows, the distribution of prediction errors did not show clear trends, suggesting that the kinetics of miRNA production/degradation stayed relatively constant in these windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Our integrated analysis of mature and primary miRNAs confirmed the general assumption that transcription level is important for determining the expression patterns of mature miRNAs and suggested that global miRNA production and degradation rates are relatively constant during embryogenesis except for early embryos. However, we note that individual predicted values may not be accurate due to the inaccuracy of sequence-based quantification and the relatively low time-resolution of our time course. In addition, it is also possible that there are a small number of individual miRNAs that are regulated post-transcriptionally in a time-window specific manner in embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Influences of the 5’ nucleotides on mature miRNA stability</title><p>While production of miRNAs would be the major determinant of miRNA expression profiles, degradation of mature miRNAs should also play a role. The identity of 5’ end nucleotide of the guide RNA influences the interactions between the guide RNA and the MID domain of Argonaute with 5’-uridine (5’-U) showing the highest affinity among the four nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frank et al., 2010</xref>). Since mature miRNAs are believed to be protected by Argonaute proteins from degradation, we wondered if the identity of the 5’ nucleotide could also influence the stability of miRNAs.</p><p>We asked whether our results of multiple linear regression analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) could be used to estimate miRNA degradation rates. Our analysis relies on the assumption that the mature miRNA change rate is determined by the miRNA production rate that is proportional to the level of transcription and the miRNA degradation rate that is proportional to the level of the mature miRNA abundance. In theory, the slopes associated with the mature miRNA abundance values should be negative because we expect the values to reflect the degradation rates per mature miRNA molecule per unit of time (Column ‘Coef_mature_Level’ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), while the coefficients for pri-miRNA abundance (Column ‘Coef_Updensity’ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) were expected to be positive values because they would reflect processing efficiency. However, we found that some individual miRNAs showed poor correlation (Column ‘r2’ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>; 12 out of 45 genes showed <italic>r<sup>2</sup></italic> &lt; 0.5) when data points were fitted to a linear plane. In addition, many of the coefficients for the mature miRNA levels were unexpectedly positive, suggesting that there were large errors in the estimated coefficients. Nevertheless, when the values were compared between groups of miRNAs with 5’-U and other 5’-nucleotides, we observed a trend whereby the coefficient values associated with the mature miRNA abundance were generally higher with mature miRNAs carrying 5’-U than those carrying other 5’-nucleotides (p=<italic>0.01</italic>, one-tailed Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; mean<sub>5’U</sub>=-0.0016, mean<sub>non-5’U</sub>=-0.088; median<sub>5’U</sub>=0.013, median<sub>non-5’U</sub>= -0.087) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). One may expect this trend if miRNAs with 5’-U are more stable than miRNAs with other nucleotides at the 5’ end. However, due to the observed inaccuracy in estimating relative degradation rates by our genome-wide analysis, which even resulted in the unexpected positive median of the coefficient values for 5’-U species, we were unable to make a confident conclusion.</p><p>Inspired by the observations above, we experimentally tested the hypothesis that 5’ nucleotides influence miRNA stability by mutating a mature miRNA carrying a non-5’-U. For this test, we chose miR-283, which has an adenine (A) at the 5’ end, as a model miRNA and generated a construct to express a miR-283 mutant carrying a 5’-U (A-to-U mutant). The strand selection of this miRNA is highly asymmetric with a strong bias for 5p accumulation, and introducing a 5’-U to the 5p-5’ end is not expected to change the strand selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014</xref>).

Therefore, we examined whether the miRNAs were properly loaded to the major miRNA Argonaute AGO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Okamura et al., 2004</xref>), by precipitating the AGO1 complex from two time windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We observed no obvious difference in the loading efficiency between stable (miR-4, –5, −6 and −286) and unstable (miR-3 and −309) miRNAs from this cluster. Furthermore, clear reduction of the mature miRNA species in the supernatant samples suggested that a large fraction of all the examined mature miRNAs were properly loaded to AGO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> charts).

To this end, we quantified the levels of Vang mRNA in wild-type and the <italic>mir-309</italic> cluster null mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bushati et al., 2008</xref>) embryos, as well as in embryos overexpressing miR-3/–309 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Suh et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Consistent with the sensor results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), Vang mRNA was up-regulated in the null mutant and down-regulated upon overexpression of miR-3/–309 when mixed stage embryos were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> left). As predicted, Vang mRNA expression was not significantly altered in mutant embryos in late stages where miR-3 and miR-309 were undetectable due to quick degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7E</xref> right). Furthermore, Vang mRNA expression could be repressed in late embryos when miR-3/–309 was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> right).</p><p>We further verified that the levels of overexpressed miR-3/–309 products did not exceed the natural levels of these miRNAs at the expression peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming that the level of overexpression was within the physiological range. Reanalysis of RNA-seq data indicated that the reduction of miR-3/–309 preceded the increase of Vang mRNA, consistent with our hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these observations support the notion that rapid degradation of miR-3/–309 is biologically important.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Effects of miRNA stability on target site evolution</title><p>Due to the regulatory activity of miRNAs against 3’UTRs harboring seed target sites, 3’UTRs tend to avoid seed target sequences of miRNAs that are expressed in the same tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stark et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Farh et al., 2005</xref>). In turn, this target avoidance leaves evolutionary signatures that could be detected by population genetics analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen and Rajewsky, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marco, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Since miR-3 and miR-309 share the same seed sequence and are present at very low levels in late embryos, we hypothesized that miR-3/–309 target sites would be less strongly selected against in 3’UTRs of zygotically expressed genes compared to those of the other cluster members. We analyzed the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) data generated from 205 inbred lines (DGRP: <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Genetic Reference Panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mackay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). We tested whether miRNA target sites on 3’UTRs of maternally and zygotically expressed genes show distinct behaviors. Maternally and zygotically expressed mRNAs were defined in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Paris et al., 2015</xref>). We first plotted distributions of allele frequencies of polymorphic miRNA target sites for each miRNA seed sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Due to random selection in the fly population, two alleles with neutral effects are predicted to show a symmetric ‘U-shaped’ distribution of allele frequencies with most individuals homozygous for each allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marco, 2015</xref>). Selective pressure for or against an allele would shift the U-shaped distribution to the right or left, respectively.</p><p>To estimate the relative selective pressure against miRNA target sites in 3’UTRs between maternal and zygotic genes, the ratios of fractions of the target alleles in the 0–0.1 bin between zygotic and maternal mRNAs were calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). The ratio between zygotic/maternal target allele fractions showed lower values with miR-3/–309 target sites compared to the other four seed sequences, consistent with our hypothesis that zygotic genes would avoid miR-3/–309 target sites less strongly compared to seed target sites of the other miRNAs from this cluster. To verify that this is a result of the selective pressure against target sites, we turned to DAF (Derived Allele Frequency) analysis. We first identified derived miRNA target sites that are non-target sites in the ancestral state, and plotted the allele frequency. We found that the DAF was generally lower for maternal mRNAs than zygotic mRNAs for miR-3/–309 target sites, whereas target sites for the other four miRNAs in maternal and zygotic gene sets showed more similar DAF distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).</p><p>These results demonstrate that miRNA stability has detectable effects on target site evolution in the transcriptome. Together with the experimental evidence suggesting the significance of rapid degradation of miR-3 and miR-309 in target regulation in embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>), our results highlight the importance of miRNA degradation rates in shaping gene regulatory networks and their evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Dynamic changes of the total miRNA abundance during fly embryogenesis</title><p>Spike-in normalization of small RNA library data allowed us to understand changes in the total abundance of small RNA families during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected, piRNA reads gradually decreased during embryogenesis, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brennecke et al., 2008</xref>). This was associated with concomitant decrease of the mRNA levels of piwi-clade Argonaute genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). On the other hand, the total abundance of miRNAs kept increasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This trend with lower miRNA abundance in the fertilized eggs and continuous increase during embryogenesis appears to be conserved broadly including mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ohnishi et al., 2010</xref>). However, mRNA levels of the miRNA processing factors were relatively low in late embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is unclear how embryos can support the dramatic (~8-fold) increase of total miRNA level. One possibility is that general miRNA processing activity is not a rate-limiting factor, and transcription activity of individual miRNA genes largely determines the levels of mature miRNAs. This is consistent with our results that miRNA expression changes could be predicted by the level of transcription and the level of mature miRNA at a given moment, which suggested that miRNA production rate per pri-miRNA molecule and degradation rate generally stayed constant during fly embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Expression of miRNAs from polycistronic genes</title><p>miRNAs often form gene clusters and miRNA hairpins within a cluster are generally co-transcribed. Although it is unclear why miRNA genes are often clustered, recent biochemical studies provide some clues. Some miRNA cluster transcripts form intramolecular structures that interfere with processing of miRNA hairpins by Drosha, and in some cases, additional processing steps are required to resolve the structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaulk et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chaulk et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chaulk et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, a recent study suggests that processing efficiency of clustered miRNAs show a positive correlation with the distance from TSS, potentially due to interaction between the microprocessor complex and the transcription machinery in a manner dependent on phosphorylation status of the Pol II-CTD (C-Terminal Domain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Church et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the clustered configuration of miRNA genes likely adds another layer of regulation to miRNA processing.</p><p>Due to the lack of sensitive in situ detection methods of mature miRNA species in fly embryos and tissues, spatial expression patterns were mainly studied by in situ hybridization against primary miRNAs or detecting reporter genes fused with the regulatory elements of miRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboobaker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brennecke et al., 2003</xref>). Our study suggested that the transcriptional activity of the miRNA locus is an important determinant of miRNA gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), supporting the validity of such pri-miRNA analyses for understanding miRNA expression. However, results of these approaches need to be carefully interpreted considering several factors: (1) alternative pri-miRNA isoforms: miRNA genes can utilize multiple TSSs and TTSs to generate alternative pri-miRNA isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Rie et al., 2017</xref>). Depending on the probe design for pri-miRNA detection, only subsets of pri-miRNA isoforms may be detectable. (2) miRNA stability: pri-miRNAs are often transiently expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and mature miRNA stability has significant effects on the mature miRNA steady state level.</p><p>The <italic>mir-317</italic> cluster provides an interesting example. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, expression of <italic>mir-34</italic> is induced in aged flies compared to young adults, and <italic>mir-34</italic> null mutant exhibits shortened lifespan with evidence for progressive neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). The function of miR-34 in regulating longevity is at least in part mediated by down-regulation of Eip74EF, a transcription factor that mediates down-regulation of ecdysone-repressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shlyueva et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, a plausible possibility is that <italic>mir-34</italic> and the ecdysone pathway form a double negative feedback loop to create a bistable switch by using the promoter at the upstream TSS of the <italic>mir-317</italic> cluster as speculated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sempere et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xiong et al., 2016</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by our observation that ecdysone treatment leads to a decrease in the miR-34 level, favoring the use of TSS3 for the transcription and maturation of miR-277 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Besides its well-known roles in metamorphosis, the ecdysone pathway plays a role in regulation of longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Simon et al., 2003</xref>), and the miR-34/Eip74EF axis may be an upstream regulatory mechanism of this pathway.</p><p>Another cluster member miR-277 appears to play roles in longevity in a different way. Alteration of miR-277 activity resulted in short lifespans by indirectly modulating the activity of TOR (target of Rapamycin) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Esslinger et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, the level of miR-277 expression was reduced in aged flies compared to young adults, in contrast to the level of miR-34. The independent TSS for <italic>mir-277</italic> specific pri-miRNA isoform could enable the independent regulation of miRNAs in a single cluster. The biological significance of the gene organization remains unclear, however, the organization of the homologous <italic>mir-317</italic> cluster is conserved in <italic>Capitella</italic>, which is estimated to have split from the Ecdysozoan branch &gt;600 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>). This may suggest that the gene arrangement is essential for proper regulation of individual genes in the cluster. Similarly, alternative selection of TSS in miRNA clusters has been noted in mammalian systems for the <italic>let-7</italic> cluster miRNAs, which is another deeply conserved miRNA cluster whose gene order is also generally conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2015</xref>). Complex cis-regulatory elements embedded in miRNA clusters may impose evolutionary constraints that maintain the gene order, and may explain why the miRNA cluster configuration is often preserved during evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mature miRNA degradation and its importance in gene regulation</title><p>The <italic>mir-309</italic> cluster is known to be a fast-evolving miRNA cluster with frequent gene duplications and rearrangements leading to gains or losses of individual cluster member homologs during insect evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ninova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mohammed et al., 2013</xref>). Homologs of the <italic>mir-309</italic> cluster members show similar expression patterns in Drosophilids, but in mosquitoes, the gene organization and apparent functions are different.

The level of miR-309 peaks at 36 hr post blood-meal (hPBM) and sharply decreases by 48hPBM. This suggests that the short half-life of miR-309 is conserved in other dipteran insects and in different tissues, even though the biological functions have diverged. Its short half-life may be suitable for gene regulation during fast processes like oogenesis and early embryogenesis.</p><p>The evolutionary patterns of miR-3/–309 target sites and misregulation of Vang in late embryos upon miR-3 overexpression suggest the importance of rapid degradation of these two miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Generally, they find global changes during embryogenesis and miRNAs can be grouped according to their expression levels. The sequencing data is confirmed by Northern blotting of a number of selected miRNAs. In order to compare miRNA abundance with transcription rates, the authors analyzed publicly available total RNAseq data from different <italic>Drosophila</italic> developmental stages. Overall, transcription levels correlate with the abundance of mature miRNAs and thus they conclude that transcription is one important aspect of shaping miRNA profiles. Closer examination of cluster miRNAs reveals that these miRNAs are not equally expressed. In fact, the authors identify different isoforms of pri-miRNAs with different TSS or TTS explaining differential expression of several of the cluster miRNAs. Another important aspect of miRNA profile determination is miRNA stability and turn over. As an example, they analyzed the miR-309 cluster, which is transcribed at early stages. Nevertheless, some of the mature miRNAs are still present at late stages while others are rapidly degraded. Genome-wide analyses revealed that the presence of a 5' U is a major determinant of miRNA stability. Finally, they validate Vang as a target of miR-3 and miR-309 and show that regulation of miRNA stability is functionally important for embryogenesis.</p><p>The authors present a comprehensive analysis of features that determine mature miRNA expression profiles during different stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis. The manuscript is well written, and the results are presented clearly. Several of the findings are not entirely new but are combined into a comprehensive analysis. Nevertheless, there are a number of points that need clarification.</p><p>1) Figure 4C: The authors claim in the text that all three miRNAs are equally degraded in the BG3-c2 cell line. This is not obvious from Figure 4C. There is not much difference between of miR-277 between the left (Kc167) and the right panel (BG3-c2). Maybe it would be clearer if the signals of the Northern blots were quantified.</p><p>2) One main claim of the study is that uridines (Us) at the 5' end determine the half-lives of miRNAs. The authors mutate a miRNA that contains an A at the 5' position to a U and find that this change mildly stabilizes the miRNA. This is not new since structural work has demonstrated that Us are better bound by the MID domain than other nucleotides. The authors should analyze these finding more systematically. They should mutate miR-283 to all four nucleotides at the 5' end and analyze decay rates. Which of the miRNAs shown in Figure 5 contain Us at the 5' end? Is this consistent with the overall finding that Us increase stability?</p><p>3) The authors should also test whether the dwelling time on AGO1 is changed when Us or other terminal nucleotides are present at the 5' end. This would mechanistically explain the observed effects.</p><p>4) It has been reported that primary transcripts of clustered miRNAs can fold into specific structures with limited Drosha accessibility for some of the miRNAs. Is folding relevant here as well? Folding could also be dynamic allowing for differential Drosha processing during <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis.</p><p>5) It has been shown recently that specific human primary miRNAs can be cleaved into two intermediate pri-miRNAs independently of the microprocessor (Du et al., 2015). Since the authors only look at transcript levels, shorter variants could also derive from such cleavage events rather than differential TSS or TTS.</p><p>6) The RNAseq data that is used to model transcription rates only detects primary transcripts. It could be possible that pre-miRNAs are not cloned and sequenced in these data sets because adaptor ligation might be difficult or at least inefficient for double-stranded RNAs. Thus, pre-miRNA molecules would not be present in the entire analysis. Some of the conclusions might be difficult without knowing anything about pre-miRNA levels. The authors should check whether this is relevant for the conclusions that have been made in this manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript, Zhou and colleagues use a replicated Small RNA-Seq time-course analysis of small RNAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos to measure the dynamics of miRNA abundance during embryonic development. Comparing their small RNA data to published RNA-seq libraries (which can inform them on the abundance of pri-miRNAs), they can then use a simplified mathematical model to describe steady-state miRNA accumulation by a first-order processing of pri-miRNAs, and a first-order decay of mature miRNAs. The authors conclude that, for most miRNAs, both pri-miRNA processing and mature miRNA decay are rather constant during embryogenesis (meaning that mature miRNA accumulation is mostly governed by the pri-miRNA transcription rate), but that modeling analysis is very poorly detailed, and the accuracy of its results appears fragile (see below). The authors then perform a comparison of the dynamics of miRNAs expressed from clustered genes (which are often assumed to be co-transcribed) and propose explanations for the reasons why the expression of clustered miRNAs can appear uncoordinated (dynamic regulation of alternative transcription initiation and termination; differential stability of the mature miRNA). They finally interrogate the biological functionality of such differential miRNA stability, but the conclusions are not very clear (see below).</p><p>Overall, this could be a very interesting article (not much is known about the control of the kinetics of miRNA expression in vivo), but several important issues have to be solved.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Normalization is always an issue in RNA-Seq, and the authors are rightfully concerned about it. But their claim that spike-in normalization is &quot;robust and reliable&quot; (subsection “Global changes in the bulk miRNA abundance during embryogenesis) is not rigorously supported by the data. It is important to realize that spike-in normalization is formally equivalent to a normalization to the amount of total RNA. When spike-ins are introduced in the RNA sample prior to library preparation, they are introduced in proportion to the quantity of total RNA (e.g., X fmol of oligos per microgram of RNA). Normalizing to spike-ins is thus equivalent to normalizing to total RNAs or (almost equivalently) to full-length ribosomal RNAs (because they constitute most of the cellular pool of RNA). That normalization scheme does not account for potential changes in total intracellular RNA (e.g., after the onset of zygotic transcription). Please note, too, that the Northern blots shown on Figure 2 were loaded with a fixed amount of total RNA (10 μg RNA per lane) so it is no surprise that spike-in-normalized Small RNA-Seq and Northern blots are in good agreement. I would recommend defining precisely what are the expected features of a &quot;robust and reliable&quot; normalization (should the values be proportional to the intracellular concentration of the RNA of interest? to its fraction in total RNA? to its fraction in the small RNA population? etc.) before concluding anything about the robustness and reliability of this particular normalization scheme. As a matter of fact, I do think that spike-in normalization is good (i.e.: it makes sense to quantify RNAs by their fraction in total RNA), but this has to be explained explicitly, and Northern blots loaded with a fixed amount of total RNA cannot be seen as an independent validation.</p><p>2) The so-called &quot;3D linear model&quot; is very imprecisely explained. At the very least, the equation of the model should be presented, and the meaning of these mysterious symbols in Supplementary PDF 1 should be explained (what are the red crosses, squares, and circles? What is the black grid?). I am assuming that &quot;upstream density&quot; is the title of the y-axis (but please write it parallel to the axis, and centered on the axis); if it is not, then I am completely lost. My understanding of the strange figures shown on Supplementary PDF 1 is that the authors are representing graphically a linear relationship with two variables (changes in steady state miRNA level as a function of the initial miRNA level and of the density of pri-miRNA reads, which is assumed to be proportional to pri-miRNA abundance). The authors expect a linear relationship because pri-miRNA processing and mature miRNA decay are assumed to be first-order reactions. Hence, on these tridimensional plots shown in Supplementary PDF 1, the possible solutions of the equation would fall on a plane. Maybe the black grids represent these expected planes, but then I would expect a negative slope for the variable &quot;initial miRNA level&quot; (and a positive slope for &quot;upstream density&quot;). For many miRNAs (see bantam, miR-, miR-14 …), the slope for &quot;initial miRNA level&quot; is positive. It is possible that I completely misunderstood that whole analysis (the absence of details in the manuscript didn't help); or there is clearly something that needs to be discussed by the authors. One obvious possibility is that RNA-Seq measurements in embryos may not be precise enough for such an analysis, and these slopes are just heavily contaminated by some technical noise (which could even turn them positive). But if precision really is so bad, then there's not much to be concluded from that analysis (the main text should then be modified accordingly (subsection “Transcription levels of individual pri-miRNAs estimated by total RNA-seq analysis” and subsection “Genome-wide analysis of miRNA stability”).</p><p>3) The functional assessment of the destabilization of miR-3 (subsection “Biological importance of miR-3/-309 family miRNAs”) is not fully convincing. The authors want to know whether the regulated decay of miR-3 in late embryos triggers some phenotypes. But they assess it by over-expressing miR-3/-309 under an eq-gal4 driver, and nothing indicates that the magnitude of the resulting over-expression is the same than what would be observed in the absence of a regulated miRNA decay (which could be approximated by simply looking at the miRNA level in earlier embryos, and assuming it would remain unchanged in the absence of a regulated decay). Here, the observed bristle phenotype may simply be due to an exceedingly large, non-physiological over-expression of the miRNAs. For that experiment, it is important to measure how much the miRNAs have been over-expressed under the eq-gal4 driver (and use a weaker driver if they were too strongly over-expressed). I also have to report that the identification of Vang as a relevant target is somewhat deceiving. It is merely based on the fact that Vang is a TargetScan-predicted target, with a known role in the PCP pathway. But the luciferase assay is hardly meaningful (co-expressing an artificial reporter with an over-expressed <italic>Drosophila</italic> miRNA in human cells); it does not add much to the simple fact that Vang is a TargetScan-predicted target (once we know the 3´ UTR has a perfect seed match to the miRNA, it is quite obvious that an artificial co-expression of both would result in miRNA binding). The in vivo test (quantifying Vang expression in mir-309 cluster mutant embryos, over-expressing embryos, and wt embryos) is less artificial, but the results were also expected, given that Vang is a TargetScan-predicted target. A real, convincing assessment of the role of the miR-3/Vang interaction in the bristle phenotype would consist in the mutagenesis of the miR-3 binding sites in the Vang UTR in vivo, followed by an analysis of the bristle phenotype.

They obtained miRNA expression profiles of embryo at different time windows by their own sequencing, and also obtained pri-miRNA profiles from modENCODE project. Their miRNA sequence analyses revealed several different patterns of changes in expression profiles through embryogenesis. Their pri-miRNA analysis suggested that transcription levels of miRNA gene (levels of pri-miRNAs) are involved in determination of miRNA expression levels. In addition to that, the authors raised regulated expression of precursor RNA isoforms and miRNA stability (degradation rate) as additional mechanism for regulation of miRNA expression levels, and finally, they showed functional significance of the regulated miRNA expression. The manuscript contains interesting insights into miRNA biology, and the following points would improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) There are some inconsistencies between Figure 5D and 5C. For example, miR-3 &quot;input&quot; bands look similar between 2-4h and 4-6h in Figure 5D, but their intensities are very different in Figure 5C. Northern blots for 2-4h and 4-6h in Figure 5D should be done in the same membrane to accurately compare.</p><p>2) In Figure 5D, &quot;input&quot; bands between 2-4h and 4-6h looked similar, but the amounts of each miRNA loaded onto AGO1 were very different (much more abundant in 2-4h than in 4-6h). Although the authors focused on &quot;reduction rate&quot;, can’t the results suggest different efficiency of AGO1-loading? Also, purified AGO1 protein levels in the immunoprecipitates should be examined by Western blot.</p><p>3) In Figure 6A, I am curious how the other three nucleotides (5'A, 5'G, and 5'C) affect miRNA levels. It would be better not to collectively show &quot;other 5'-nucleotide&quot; but to show the data for each four nucleotides.</p><p>4) In Figure 6B, only one example (analyses of only miR-283) is not enough to say the effect of 5'-U in miRNA stability, because the expression of miRNA can cause many things in the cells. I would suggest that the analyses of at least 3-5 different miRNAs are required to confirm their hypothesis.</p><p>5) Figure 7 suggested regulation of Vang mRNA by miR-3/309. Because these miRNAs were drastically decreased through embryogenesis (Figure 3), it would be great if the authors quantify Vang mRNA levels through embryogenesis and observe anti-correlation of their expression profiles to further confirm that Vang mRNA is regulated by the miRNAs.</p><p>6) AGO1 protein level was not investigated, but it should be a factor involving in miRNA expression levels and stabilities.

Zhou and colleagues quantify mature miRNAs and pri-miRNA precursors during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, to derive molecular rules governing miRNA abundance in that dynamic process. The modified manuscript addresses most of my previous concerns, and it has been clearly improved. One of my main concerns remains though: the provided data suggest that the &quot;3D lineal model&quot; predicts mature miRNA abundance very poorly, most probably because of quantification inaccuracies (which may very well be impossible to improve with the current technologies). A precise description of that model is (still) desperately needed in the main text, as well as an estimation of the fitted coefficients' precision. The provided data suggest that precision is too low to permit the analyses that the authors perform – if so, then I would simply suggest to remove that modeling analysis (it would be mostly describing technical noise).</p><p>Once that issue is fixed, I think the manuscript will be a very good candidate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Regarding the &quot;3D linear model&quot; whose results are presented in Supplementary PDF 1: I appreciate the authors' clarification, but they mostly appear in their point-by-point response to the referees, and the readers themselves are left without much information. As I said in my evaluation of the first submission, it is important to write down the model's equation (please do that in the main text and write explicitly that the coefficient for &quot;initial miRNA level&quot; is expected to be negative, while the coefficient for &quot;upstream density&quot; is expected to be positive – and explain why, in each case). Without this, the reader will be completely lost. As for the accuracy of the estimation of coefficients by this model: the added sentence (&quot;However, we note that this analysis has a caveat […]&quot;) is an improvement, but it lacks rigor. The fact that not every point falls on the plane is not a surprise (nothing is perfect in experimental science); the fact that they fall &quot;far away&quot; from the plane would be a problem, but for this we need to know how far is &quot;far away&quot;. The authors' current formulation is deceiving (&quot;significant&quot; has a very precise meaning: it means that a statistical test was performed, and the null hypothesis was rejected with a given p-value cutoff). Here it looks like the authors use &quot;significant&quot; as a synonym for &quot;large&quot; (without defining how large is &quot;large&quot;), which it is not. Even more problematic, the fact that many slopes for &quot;initial miRNA level&quot; appear to be positive is not discussed. Honestly, from what I see, it looks like these measurements are extremely imprecise, and they cannot be used to conclude anything regarding the miRNA turnover rate. The fact that &quot;5´ U&quot; values end up begin mostly larger than &quot;other 5´ nucleotide&quot; values seems to be pure luck (with another, similarly imprecise RNA-Seq-based quantification, the values may have very well fallen in the opposite order). In their Point-by-point response, the authors say that the global analysis of every miRNA is certainly more precise than each individual measurement, which is certainly true – but whether this improvement is sufficient in order to perform an analysis like the one shown in Figure 6A remains to be demonstrated. For this, the authors need to evaluate the accuracy of their modeled coefficients (a linear modeling analysis does not only compute the fitted coefficients, it also provides an estimate of its precision; simply giving the coefficient without giving the precision is pointless). Given the aspect of the 3D graphs and given the dispersion of the points on Figure 6A (with the median for &quot;5´ U&quot; values being positive while their mean is negative), I expect precision to be too bad to allow a meaningful comparison of 5´ U miRNAs and 5´ non-U miRNAs (note that Figure 1D does not show that the model &quot;worked reasonably well&quot;: most points fall next to the origin, with a high relative error). If indeed it is the case, then I recommend dropping the &quot;3D linear model&quot; analysis (which would be too noisy to be informative), and simply find another way to explain why the authors wanted to perform the analyses shown in Figure 6. (on a side note: Figure 6—figure supplement 1 is useless: if the authors wanted to compare 5´ U miRNAs to 5´ non-U miRNAs, they just had to compare the two datasets shown in Figure 6A, and they did not have to stratify &quot;5´ non U&quot; into &quot;5´ A&quot;, &quot;5´ C&quot; and &quot;5´ G&quot; as shown in that supplement).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors responded well to the raised points in the first review with additional experimental results.

We are declining the manuscript but encourage resubmission if and when these issues have been thoroughly addressed.</p><p>Reviewer #1:.</p><p>[…] 1) Figure 4C: The authors claim in the text that all three miRNAs are equally degraded in the BG3-c2 cell line. This is not obvious from Figure 4C. There is not much difference between of miR-277 between the left (Kc167) and the right panel (BG3-c2). Maybe it would be clearer if the signals of the Northern blots were quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments were repeated three times and the quantification results have been added as Figure 4—figure supplement 3. This analysis supported our conclusion that miR-277 expression was better correlated with miR-34 and miR-317 in BG3-c2 cells than in Kc167 and S2-R+ cells.</p><p> <italic>2) One main claim of the study is that</italic> uridines (Us) <italic>at the 5' end determine the half-lives of miRNAs. The authors mutate a miRNA that contains an A at the 5' position to a U and find that this change mildly stabilizes the miRNA. This is not new since structural work has demonstrated that Us are better bound by the MID domain than other nucleotides. The authors should analyze these finding more systematically. They should mutate miR-283 to all four nucleotides at the 5' end and analyze decay rates. Which of the miRNAs shown in Figure 5 contain Us at the 5' end? Is this consistent with the overall finding that Us increase stability?</italic></p><p>To clarify, we do not believe the 5’ nucleotide is the sole determinant of miRNA stability. Based on our observations, we concluded that the 5’ nucleotides can influence miRNA stability and would be among a number of factors that determine half-lives. Therefore, if we compare the groups of miRNAs according to the 5’ nucleotides, we observe some trends as seen in Figure 6A. If we compare half-lives of a small number of miRNAs individually, the trend may not be obvious. In fact, if we only look at the mir-309 cluster miRNAs, the trend is not clear (Figure 5, Mir-309: G, Mir-3: U, Mir-286: U, Mir4: A, Mir-5: U, Mir-6: U). In particular, we believe that the instability of mir-3/309 is mediated by other mechanisms because the accelerated degradation rate cannot be explained by the effect of 5’ nucleotides that can only cause mild changes of stability as shown by the targeted mutagenesis (~20%, Figure 6D).</p><p>To further support our conclusion regarding the effects of miRNA 5’ nucleotides on mature miRNA stability, we made additional mutants by changing the 5’ end to all three possible nucleotides. This experiment is not as simple as it may sound. We needed to find miRNAs whose strand selection and the cleavage sites by Drosha/Dicer were not altered by the 5’ nucleotide changes. Through careful selection of miRNAs and experimental verification, we managed to find two additional miRNAs that were suitable for this analysis, and almost all possible mutants could be made (except the AtoG mutant of miR-263a, whose Drosha cleavage site was altered by the mutation). Unexpectedly, we observed stabilizing effects of 5’-C, in addition to the expected effect by 5’-U mutations. We added these results as Figure 6D and Figure 6—figure supplement 2. Taken together, we report a role for 5’ nucleotides in determining the mature miRNA half-lives.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should also test whether the dwelling time on AGO1 is changed when Us or other terminal nucleotides are present at the 5' end. This would mechanistically explain the observed effects.</p></disp-quote><p>To our best knowledge, <italic>Drosophila</italic> AGO1 has not been used for single molecule imaging analysis potentially due to the low abundance of empty AGO1 in the fly system. The rapid degradation of empty AGO1 may be the cause of this (Smibert et al., 2013). The detailed single-molecule analysis is certainly an interesting direction, but precise mechanisms and dynamics of Argonaute-guide RNA interactions are beyond the scope of this manuscript. We plan to follow up this mechanism in the future as better tools are developed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It has been reported that primary transcripts of clustered miRNAs can fold into specific structures with limited Drosha accessibility for some of the miRNAs. Is folding relevant here as well? Folding could also be dynamic allowing for differential Drosha processing during Drosophila embryogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>It has been reported that the mammalian mir-17-92 cluster transcript is folded into globular structures, which reduces processing efficiency of miRNA hairpins that are located in the core of the structure (Chaulk et al., 2014; Chaulk et al., 2017). As the same reviewer points out below, the same cluster has been reported to undergo post-transcriptional regulation via the action of the endonuclease CPSF3 to cleave the pri-miRNA to generate “pro-miRNA” in which all hairpins in this cluster can be efficiently processed by Drosha (Du et al., 2015). There is certainly additional complexity observed with processing of clustered miRNAs as also highlighted by recent reports. Therefore, we added more information in the Discussion section to highlight these studies further. We believe that the disparity we detected with expression changes between members of certain clusters may reflect some aspects of complex post-transcriptional regulation of clustered miRNA processing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It has been shown recently that specific human primary miRNAs can be cleaved into two intermediate pri-miRNAs independently of the microprocessor (Du et al. Cell, 2015). Since the authors only look at transcript levels, shorter variants could also derive from such cleavage events rather than differential TSS or TTS.</p></disp-quote><p>While we do not exclude this possibility pointed out by the reviewer, we found that histone modification marks support the hypothesis of alternative TSSs in this cluster (New Figure 4—figure supplement 2). We added this information and mentioned both possibilities in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The RNAseq data that is used to model transcription rates only detects primary transcripts. It could be possible that pre-miRNAs are not cloned and sequenced in these data sets because adaptor ligation might be difficult or at least inefficient for double-stranded RNAs. Thus, pre-miRNA molecules would not be present in the entire analysis. Some of the conclusions might be difficult without knowing anything about pre-miRNA levels. The authors should check whether this is relevant for the conclusions that have been made in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the total RNA libraries (that are generally selective for &gt;200nt species) are devoid of pre-miRNAs. While there are protocols for pre-miRNA expression profiling, those experiments are not straightforward and accurately measuring pre-miRNA levels remains a challenge. Therefore, we decided to make conclusions based on the levels of pri-miRNAs and cognate mature miRNAs. We believe that the lack of pre-miRNA information does not affect our conclusions (Usage of TSS/TTS, the stability of mir-309 cluster miRNAs and roles of 5’ nucleotide in loaded mature miRNAs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) Normalization is always an issue in RNA-Seq, and the authors are rightfully concerned about it. But their claim that spike-in normalization is &quot;robust and reliable&quot; (p. 6) is not rigorously supported by the data. It is important to realize that spike-in normalization is formally equivalent to a normalization to the amount of total RNA. When spike-ins are introduced in the RNA sample prior to library preparation, they are introduced in proportion to the quantity of total RNA (e.g., X fmol of oligos per microgram of RNA). Normalizing to spike-ins is thus equivalent to normalizing to total RNAs or (almost equivalently) to full-length ribosomal RNAs (because they constitute most of the cellular pool of RNA). That normalization scheme does not account for potential changes in total intracellular RNA (e.g., after the onset of zygotic transcription). Please note, too, that the Northern blots shown on Figure 2 were loaded with a fixed amount of total RNA (10 μg RNA per lane) so it is no surprise that spike-in-normalized Small RNA-Seq and Northern blots are in good agreement. I would recommend defining precisely what are the expected features of a &quot;robust and reliable&quot; normalization (should the values be proportional to the intracellular concentration of the RNA of interest? to its fraction in total RNA? to its fraction in the small RNA population? etc.) before concluding anything about the robustness and reliability of this particular normalization scheme. As a matter of fact, I do think that spike-in normalization is good (i.e.: it makes sense to quantify RNAs by their fraction in total RNA), but this has to be explained explicitly, and Northern blots loaded with a fixed amount of total RNA cannot be seen as an independent validation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer points out potential issues with normalization methods and interpretation of the results. We decided to use the normalization method that is based on the assumption that the amount of total RNA per embryo stays constant. However, we could not find a study explicitly testing the amount of total RNA per embryo in different stages of development. We attempted to estimate the amounts of total RNA per embryo at different time windows, and the results suggested that the total RNA per embryo stayed roughly at the same level. Therefore, we decided to adhere to the spikein-based normalization for miRNA analysis. We also clarified in the main text that Northern blotting is to verify the sequence-based quantification results that relies on the same assumption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The so-called &quot;3D linear model&quot; is very imprecisely explained. At the very least, the equation of the model should be presented, and the meaning of these mysterious symbols in Supplementary PDF 1 should be explained (what are the red crosses, squares, and circles? what is the black grid?). I am assuming that &quot;upstream density&quot; is the title of the y-axis (but please write it parallel to the axis, and centered on the axis); if it is not, then I am completely lost. My understanding of the strange figures shown on Supplementary PDF 1 is that the authors are representing graphically a linear relationship with two variables (changes in steady state miRNA level as a function of the initial miRNA level and of the density of pri-miRNA reads, which is assumed to be proportional to pri-miRNA abundance). The authors expect a linear relationship because pri-miRNA processing and mature miRNA decay are assumed to be first-order reactions. Hence, on these tridimensional plots shown in Supplementary PDF 1, the possible solutions of the equation would fall on a plane. Maybe the black grids represent these expected planes, but then I would expect a negative slope for the variable &quot;initial miRNA level&quot; (and a positive slope for &quot;upstream density&quot;). For many miRNAs (see bantam, miR-, miR-14 …), the slope for &quot;initial miRNA level&quot; is positive. It is possible that I completely misunderstood that whole analysis (the absence of details in the manuscript didn't help); or there is clearly something that needs to be discussed by the authors. One obvious possibility is that RNA-Seq measurements in embryos may not be precise enough for such an analysis, and these slopes are just heavily contaminated by some technical noise (which could even turn them positive). But if really precision is so bad, then there's not much to be concluded from that analysis (the main text should then be modified accordingly subsection “Transcription levels of individual pri-miRNAs estimated by total RNA-seq analysis” and subsection “Genome-wide analysis of miRNA stability”).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the poor presentation of the charts and inadequate descriptions in this file, and we appreciate the reviewer’s effort to correctly interpret the results. As the reviewer describes, we meant to present the linear relationship between the initial miRNA level, the density of pri-miRNA reads and the change rate of the mature miRNA. This equation worked reasonably well in predicting the overall change rate as shown in Figure 1D. However, the slope for “initial miRNA level” was variable and some genes even showed positive slope in contrast to our expectation, as correctly pointed out by the reviewer. We believe that this is due to the high variation of the estimated values and slow degradation of mature miRNA species. Therefore, we decided not to overly interpret the slope for each miRNA. However, when the values were considered in groups of larger number of genes, we believe the distributions of slope values carry meaningful information. For example, the means of slopes were negative values (mean<sub>5’U</sub>=-0.0016, mean<sub>non-5’U</sub>=-0.088). Although we recognize the fluctuation of the estimation of individual degradation rates, the accuracy was high enough to detect the difference in the mature miRNA stability of 5’U- and non-5’U-species (Figure 6A). This led to the finding that 5’ nucleotides may affect mature miRNA stability, and this hypothesis could be verified experimentally by using individual miRNA constructs mutating 5’ nucleotides (Figure 6B-D). Therefore, we believe that this analysis could provide meaningful information depending on how we interpret it. We modified the main text to clarify these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The functional assessment of the destabilization of miR-3 (subsection “Biological importance of miR-3/-309 family miRNAs”) is not fully convincing. The authors want to know whether the regulated decay of miR-3 in late embryos triggers some phenotypes.

Our point is that rapid degradation of miR-3 may have biological significance, and regulation of Vang could be part of it as ectopic expression of miR-3 causes detectable phenotypes that are consistent with Vang misregulation (Figure 7B and C). We agree with the reviewer’s comments regarding the level of overexpression because, if the level of overexpressed miRNAs exceed the highest level of natural miR-3/-309 expression, the phenotypes we are seeing may simply be artifacts due to the unnatural levels of overexpression. To test this, we decided to focus on the embryonic phenotypes and used the RNA samples that were used for Vang mRNA quantification with mir-3/-309 overexpression (Figure 7E). The levels of overexpressed miR-3/-309 were compared with the levels of those miRNAs at the highest expression peaks (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). For this analysis, we only used embryos overexpressing miR-3/-309 by the ubiquitous da-Gal4 because it is difficult to measure the expression levels for miR-3/-309 driven by eq-Gal4, which activates transcription only in a part of the wing disc (Tang and Sun, 2002). We found that the levels of overexpressed miR-3/-309 driven by da-Gal4 reached only &lt;50% of the levels of endogenous miR-3/-309 at 3.5-4h embryos. Because the mir-309 cluster is known to be transcribed broadly in the somatic cells (doi: 10.1073 pnas.0507817102, 10.1073 pnas.0508823102), we believe that our experiment mimics a situation where the miR-3/-309 mature products were not degraded quickly.</p><p>The strictest experiment to demonstrate this is to identify the elements that make miR-3/-309 unstable, generate a mutant that has the same target specificity as the wild-type miR-3/-309, and analyze the organismal phenotype. We have started experiments to identify the destabilizing elements of miR-3/-309 and successful identification of the mechanisms would allow us to design the stricter experiments to study biological effects of miR-3/-309 degradation. However, we believe that identification of mechanisms and generation of mutants are beyond the scope of the current manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we added the results testing the levels of overexpressed miR-3/-309 (Figure 7—figure supplement 1) and discussed this point further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) There are some inconsistencies between Figure 5D and 5C.

We observed a correlation between the AGO1 protein level and the total miRNA levels. However, because the mutual dependence of AGO1 and mature miRNAs for their stability (Smibert et al., 2013), this result itself did not allow us to conclude whether the level of AGO1 protein is limiting the amount of bulk mature miRNAs. This has to be further studied perhaps when researchers find the mechanism of empty AGO1 degradation and generate mutants of AGO1 whose stability does not rely on loaded guide RNAs. We discussed the Western blotting results in the main text.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This resubmitted manuscript is a significant improvement over the previous submission. The only remaining issue is the presentation of the 3D lineal model. Because this model is only presented in supplementary material, it is strongly suggested that the authors remove it from the manuscript. If they do so, the manuscript would be acceptable for eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to resubmit this revised version of the manuscript. As suggested by the editors, we removed the Supplementary PDF, which the reviewers and editors appeared to find confusing rather than useful. We also changed the order figures for a better flow. In addition, we made changes to address specific points that were raised by reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) Regarding the &quot;3D linear model&quot; whose results are presented in Supplementary PDF1: I appreciate the authors' clarification, but they mostly appear in their Point-by-point response to the referees, and the readers themselves are left without much information. Given the aspect of the 3D graphs and given the dispersion of the points on Figure 6A (with the median for &quot;5´ U&quot; values being positive while their mean is negative), I expect precision to be too bad to allow a meaningful comparison of 5´ U miRNAs and 5´ non-U miRNAs (note that Figure 1D does not show that the model &quot;worked reasonably well&quot;: most points fall next to the origin, with a high relative error). If indeed it is the case, then I recommend dropping the &quot;3D linear model&quot; analysis (which would be too noisy to be informative), and simply find another way to explain why the authors wanted to perform the analyses shown in Figure 6. (on a side note: Figure 6—figure supplement 1 is useless: if the authors wanted to compare 5´ U miRNAs to 5´ non-U miRNAs, they just had to compare the two datasets shown in Figure 6A, and they did not have to stratify &quot;5´ non U&quot; into &quot;5´ A&quot;, &quot;5´ C&quot; and &quot;5´ G&quot; as shown in that supplement).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we edited the main text to more clearly explain the model and the assumptions used. The reviewer is also concerned about the inaccuracy of the results that were previously shown as Figure 6A to present the predicted relative degradation rates of 5’-U and non-5’-U species. Although it is not surprising that some coefficients show positive values when the true value is expected to be very close to zero (as mature miRNAs are generally stable) and the statistical test indicated a small p-value with a widely used method (p=0.01, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) when the values for the 5’-U and non-5’-U groups were compared, we recognize the risk of using noisy data for making conclusions. According to the reviewer’s comments, we made it clear that this analysis did not allow us to make a confident conclusion regarding the miRNA degradation rates by explicitly explaining the observed fluctuations and highlighting the unexpected positive median value for the 5’-U group. However, we kept the chart (previously main Figure 6A) as a figure supplement (now Figure 3—figure supplement 1) to explain what prompted us to mutate the 5’ nucleotides of the model miRNAs. It was difficult to explain this in another way. We performed these mutagenesis experiments only because we observed the difference in the distribution of coefficients between the 5’-U and non-5’-U groups as described in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
