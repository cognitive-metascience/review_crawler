for pulsatile release of GnRH and reproduction. Since 17β-estradiol (E2) decreases <italic>Kiss1 and Tac2</italic> mRNA expression in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, the role of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons during E2-driven anorexigenic states and their coordination of POMC and NPY/AgRP feeding circuits have been largely ignored. Presently, we show that E2 augmented the excitability of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons by amplifying <italic>Cacna1g, Hcn1 and Hcn2</italic> mRNA expression and T-type calcium and h-currents. E2 increased <italic>Slc17a6</italic> mRNA expression and glutamatergic synaptic input to arcuate neurons, which excited POMC and inhibited NPY/AgRP neurons via metabotropic receptors. Deleting <italic>Slc17a6</italic> in Kiss1 neurons eliminated glutamate release and led to conditioned place preference for sucrose in E2-treated KO female mice. Therefore, the E2-driven increase in Kiss1 neuronal excitability and glutamate neurotransmission may play a key role in governing the motivational drive for palatable food in females.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>17-beta-estradiol</kwd><kwd>T-type calcium current</kwd><kwd>h-current</kwd><kwd>vGluT2</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DK068098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>Martin J</given-names></name><name><surname>Rønnekleiv</surname><given-names>Oline K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS043330</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rønnekleiv</surname><given-names>Oline K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS038809</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>Martin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DA024908</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palmiter</surname><given-names>Richard D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Estrogen increases hypothalamic arcuate kisspeptin neuronal excitability and glutamate release to coordinate autonomic functions for maximizing reproductive success.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypothalamic arcuate nucleus kisspeptin (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) neurons and anteroventral periventricular and periventricular nucleus Kiss1 (Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup>) neurons are regulated in a species-, sex, and gonadal steroid-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Estrada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lehman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ramaswamy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith, 2008</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons are essential for positive feedback by estradiol on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuronal activity and the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clarkson et al., 2008</xref>). 17β-estradiol (E2) increases <italic>Kiss1</italic> mRNA expression in these rostral Kiss1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smith et al., 2005</xref>), and their excitability is increased by the E2-driven upregulation of T-type calcium, hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic-nucleotide gated (h)- and persistent sodium (I<sub>NaP</sub>) currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Piet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">2013</xref>). In addition, glutamate induces burst firing and pacemaking activity in Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons, E2 significantly inhibits <italic>Kiss1</italic> mRNA expression in ARH neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lehman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Navarro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smith et al., 2005</xref>). However, the effect of E2 on ion channel expression and excitability is less clear in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, and we do not fully understand the mechanism(s) by which E2 affects the excitability of the Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neuronal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons co-express the peptide neurotransmitters kisspeptin (Kiss1), tachykinin 2 (Tac2; <italic>a.k.a</italic>. neurokinin B; NKB) and dynorphin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lehman et al., 2013</xref>), which have been proposed to be responsible for pulsatile release of GnRH and LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Navarro et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, the cellular mechanisms by which Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons synchronize to drive GnRH pulses was recently elucidated and involves a combination of co-released Tac2 excitation via Tac3 receptors and dynorphin presynaptic inhibition via κ-opioid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>). Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons also express the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGluT2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cravo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nestor et al., 2016</xref>), an indication that they have the potential to package and release the neurotransmitter glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herman et al., 2014</xref>). Optogenetic activation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons evokes glutamatergic EPSCs not only in Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>) but also in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nestor et al., 2016</xref>), which further establishes direct functional connections between Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and hypothalamic neurons important for the control of reproduction and energy homeostasis. In males, <italic>Slc17a6</italic> (encodes vGluT2) mRNA and glutamate release are increased in gonadectomized as compared to intact animals, an indication of inhibitory effects of gonadal steroids on glutamate neurotransmission in these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nestor et al., 2016</xref>). Based on pronounced male/female differences in feeding behavior and the excitatory glutamatergic input from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons to Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asarian and Geary, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>), we hypothesized that the mRNA expression of <italic>Slc17a6</italic> and glutamate release in females in contrast to males, would be amplified by E2 in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons in order to help maintain reproduction during different energy states. Therefore, we investigated the effects of ovariectomy (OVX) and E2-replacement on neuronal excitability as well as the effect of E2 on mRNA expression of <italic>Slc17a6</italic> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and the release of glutamate from these neurons onto Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup>, POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons. Also, to evaluate the main functional role of glutamate release from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons in females, we deleted the expression of <italic>Slc17a6</italic> in Kiss1 neurons and measured electrophysiological changes in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neuronal transmission as well as behavioral changes in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Estradiol treatment reduces the mRNA expression of neuropeptides while increasing the expression of the T-type calcium channels, HCN channels, and the excitability of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons</title><p>It has been shown repeatedly in a number of species, that the mRNA expression of the peptide neurotransmitters kisspeptin, Tac2 and dynorphin, which are co-expressed in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, is increased in OVX animals and reduced in E2-treated animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lehman et al., 2013</xref>). However, vGluT2 is also expressed in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cravo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nestor et al., 2016</xref>), and <italic>Slc17a6</italic> mRNA levels are reduced in intact as compared to castrated males, an indication of sex-steroid regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nestor et al., 2016</xref>).

Mice were given access to sucrose-filled lids in one chamber (e.g. white), then on alternating days they were presented with empty lids in the other chamber (e.g. black). Mice were tested for acquisition of a CPP to sucrose on Day 10, which was indicated by increased time spent in the sucrose-conditioned chamber. Animals were fed <italic>ad lib</italic> standard low-fat chow in their home cage throughout the study. For cyclical estradiol treatment, animals were given a priming (0.25 μg) and a surge (1.5 μg) dose of 17β-estradiol Benzoate (E2) at 9 AM prior to the BPP and prior to the CPP as indicated.

E2 also directly excites POMC neurons via inhibition of GIRK current, but inhibit NPY/AgRP neurons via activation of GIRK current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kelly and Rønnekleiv, 2015</xref>). These congruent actions of E2 on POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons contribute to the control of homeostatic feeding. High frequency photo-stimulation (focal light stimulation of channel rhodopsin, ChR2) in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons releases glutamate to further excite POMC neurons via mGluRs group I and inhibit NPY/AgRP neurons via mGluRs group II/III; and excite Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons via NMDA/AMPA receptors.

However, our past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gottsch et al., 2011</xref>) and current findings that these Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons express T-type calcium and pacemaker h-currents and are keenly sensitive to excitation by glutamate are indications that these neurons have pacemaker electrophysiological properties similar to other CNS neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bal and McCormick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lüthi and McCormick, 1998</xref>). Additionally, in contrast to the neuropeptides, E2 increased <italic>Slc17a6</italic> mRNA expression in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and increased glutamate release onto Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons in the POA, and onto POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons in the ARH. This is a clear indication that the amino acid and peptide neurotransmitters are regulated differentially by E2 in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons in females. Interestingly, we have reported that <italic>Slc17a6</italic> mRNA expression in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and the probability of glutamate release are decreased along with the neuropeptides in intact versus castrated males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nestor et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, there is a significant male/female difference in sex-steroid regulation of glutamate signaling by Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nestor et al., 2016</xref>). This could underlie the sex differences in feeding behavior between males and females, namely that testosterone increases feeding in castrated males, whereas E2 reduces feeding in OVX females and during the peri-ovulatory phase of the estrous cycle when E2 levels are maximal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asarian and Geary, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asarian and Geary, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which E2 signals in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons to inhibit the expression of neuropeptides appears to be via ERα, given that ablation of ERα in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons prevents E2-induced suppression of <italic>Kiss1</italic> mRNA, and also global KO of ERα prevents suppression of <italic>Tac2</italic> and <italic>Pdyn</italic> by E2 in the ARH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dubois et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). The mechanism by which E2 enhances glutamatergic expression and transmission in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons is currently unknown. Potentially, E2 acting via different E2 receptors and/or signaling pathways in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons could be responsible for the diverse actions of E2 (decrease in the expression of neuropeptides versus the increase in expression of excitatory ion channels and glutamate release) similar to what has been reported previously in hippocampal neurons and in hypothalamic NPY/AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boulware et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith et al., 2013</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The excitatory glutamatergic inputs to NPY/AgRP neurons play a key role in the response to fasting, although the origin of this excitatory input has not been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, it has been shown that glutamatergic neurons other than POMC neurons within the arcuate nucleus are responsible for a fast acting satiety signal to suppress feeding even after a 24 hr fast in male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fenselau et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, our current findings using optogenetic stimulation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons in vitro have documented direct excitatory projections to both POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons by low-frequency stimulation, whereas high-frequency stimulation activated POMC and inhibited NPY/AgRP neurons in both males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nestor et al., 2016</xref>) and females (current findings). The low-frequency excitation was blocked by TTX, but reinstated by application of the potassium channel blocker 4-AP, which is biophysical evidence of direct synaptic input from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons to POMC and NPY/AGRP neurons in agreement with our previous findings in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nestor et al., 2016</xref>). High-frequency optogenetic stimulation (20 Hz) of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, which mimics a firing rate that is observed in these ARH neurons in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moss et al., 1975</xref>), excited POMC neurons. This appears to be generated by an activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors 1 and 5, both of which we have documented are expressed in POMC neurons. Also, we found that the group I mGluR agonist DHPG excited POMC neurons in the presence of TTX and ionotropic glutamate receptor blockers. Collectively these data demonstrate that there is a direct excitatory input to POMC neurons from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons via glutamate actions on ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. In contrast, we found that high-frequency stimulation generated an inhibition of NPY/AgRP neurons, which was mediated by glutamatergic type II/III metabotropic receptors. Indeed, we found that NPY/AgRP neurons express <italic>Grm7</italic> mRNA (encoding mGluR7), and to a lesser extent <italic>Grm2</italic> mRNA (encoding mGluR2) and that the high frequency response was inhibited by the mGluR7 antagonist ADX71743. In addition, these neurons were inhibited by bath application of the group II mGluR agonist DCG-IV and the group III mGluR agonist AMN082 in the presence of synaptic blockade by TTX, and ionotropic glutamate and GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibitors, providing evidence for a direct inhibitory Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> glutamatergic input to NPY/AgRP neurons. The response in POMC neurons to group I metabotropic agonist DHPG, which activates a TRPC current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tozzi et al., 2003</xref>), was not different between oil- and E2-treated, OVX females. In contrast, the GIRK current in NPY/AgRP neurons, which was activated by the group II and the group III metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists, was augmented by E2-treatment, as was the mRNA expression of mGluR7. Congruent with these findings, we have shown that E2-treatment increases KCNQ 5 channel expression and the corresponding inhibitory M-current in NPY/AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roepke et al., 2011</xref>) and augments postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor coupling ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 2014</xref>).

Given that we have documented previously that Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons do not express Slc17a6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>) and do not release glutamate, we believe that the KO would be specific for Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. However, Kiss1 neurons are expressed in other brain regions, including the medial amygdala and BNST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lehman et al., 2013</xref>), and although <italic>Slc17a6</italic> has not yet been documented in these neurons, we cannot rule out the possibility that vGluT2 has been deleted in extra-hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons.</p><p>Within the Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurocircuitry, the lack of glutamate resulted in a diminished slow EPSP in E2-treated animals. The slow EPSP is attenuated by E2 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>), and it was further reduced in E2-treated <italic>Slc17a6</italic> KO females. Given that the slow EPSP underlies Tac2-dependent engagement of synchronous activity in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>), these findings support the idea that glutamate may play a role in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> synchronous firing activity and LH pulsatility in the presence of high circulating levels of E2, when peptide neurotransmitters are low and glutamate levels are high in female Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Interestingly, females with ablation of vGluT2 in Kiss1 neurons appeared to exhibit a normal ovulatory cycle, an indication that glutamatergic neurotransmission from Kiss1 neurons may not be necessary to support reproductive function. However, deletion of ERα in all kisspeptin neurons (KERKO) significantly attenuates glutamatergic synaptic input (spontaneous EPSCs) to the Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons, which could be due to lack of E2-stimulated glutamate release from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). The net result is an increase in LH pulse frequency in KERKO mice, which was proposed to represent a lack of negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Clearly further experiments, including deletion of <italic>Slc17a6</italic> specifically in adult females, which would prevent potential developmental compensation, are necessary to determine whether glutamate and/or peptide neurotransmission from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons to Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons are involved in reproductive functions.</p><p>High-frequency stimulation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons in slices from E2-treated OVX <italic>Slc17a6</italic> KO females induced a low-amplitude, inward current in POMC neurons and a low-amplitude, outward current in NPY/AgRP neurons, an indication of residual excitatory and inhibitory inputs, respectively to these neurons. Given that the high frequency stimulation has been documented to induce peptide release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>), this is an indication that kisspeptin release from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons evoked the excitation of POMC neurons and inhibition of NPY/AgRP neurons. In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fu and van den Pol, 2010</xref>), bath application of kisspeptin activated POMC neurons most likely by signaling via the Kiss1 receptor, GPR54, which is expressed in POMC neurons. Similarly, kisspeptin inhibited firing and hyperpolarized NPY/AgRP neurons via activation of a GIRK current. The Kiss1 receptor is not expressed in NPY/AgRP neurons. However, NPFFR1 is expressed, and its agonist RFRP-3 inhibited firing and hyperpolarized NPY/AgRP neurons via activation of a GIRK current. Based on evidence that both RFRP-3 and kisspeptin bind to and activate NPFFR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonini et al., 2000</xref>), we propose that the two different neuropeptides inhibit NPY/AgRP neurons by action on the same receptor. Collectively, these data indicate that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons may use both kisspeptin and glutamate to activate POMC neurons but inhibit NPY/AgRP neurons, and compensatory kisspeptin input could be one of the reasons why deleting vGluT2 was not effective to alter body weights on a normal chow diet over the time-course of our study.</p><p>As the Kiss1 <italic>Slc17a6</italic> KO females did not appear to gain weight on standard low-fat mouse chow diet, we used a place preference paradigm to determine the motivation for sucrose in <italic>Slc17a6</italic> KO as compared to control Kiss1 and <italic>Slc17a6</italic> Het females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prus et al., 2009</xref>). These experiments revealed a preference for the sucrose-paired chamber by the E2-treated, OVX mice lacking <italic>Slc17a6</italic> in Kiss1 neurons compared to Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup> and Het females. The <italic>Slc17a6</italic> Het females did not exhibit a CPP to sucrose, but did consume more sucrose in comparison to control Kiss1 females. Importantly, the E2-treated <italic>Slc17a6</italic> Het females expressed low levels of <italic>Slc17a6</italic> mRNA in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, an indication that glutamate release was attenuated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herman et al., 2014</xref>), which could be why the <italic>Slc17a6</italic> Het females behaved more like <italic>Slc17a6</italic> KO than control Kiss1 animals thereby exhibiting a behavioral gene-dosage/threshold effect. While reward-seeking behaviors have not been specifically associated with Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons are involved in hedonic feeding in addition to controlling homeostatic food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayward et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lippert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pandit et al., 2014</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pandit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rubinstein and Low, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stuber and Wise, 2016</xref>) Although it is clear that homeostatic feeding is regulated by NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons, the motivational drive to eat palatable foods are more complex behaviors that are regulated by multiple interconnected neural systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Denis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fenselau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rossi and Stuber, 2018</xref>). Therefore, further analyses of the neural circuits underlying these physiological responses are essential for understanding such complex behavior. Regardless, our findings have revealed a novel role for glutamate neurotransmission by Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>), which appears to be sex-specific based on our findings that glutamate signaling is regulated differently in female and male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nestor et al., 2016</xref>) mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species)or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>M.Musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top">The Jackson <break/>laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID <break/>:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>M.Musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre:GFP</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Dr. Robert A Steiner; <break/>University of <break/>Washington; <break/>PMID:21933870</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:017701">IMSR_JAX:017701</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Full <break/>nomenclature: Kiss1<sup>tm1.1(cre/EGFP)Stei</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>M.Musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Kiss1<sup>Cre:GFP</sup> <break/>version 2 (V2)</td><td valign="top">Dr. Richard D. <break/>Palmiter; <break/>University of <break/>Washington; <break/>PMID: 29336844</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>M.Musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Pomc<sup>EGFP</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Dr. Malcolm J. <break/>Low; University <break/>of Michigan; <break/>PMID:11373681</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:009593">IMSR_JAX:009593</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Full nomenclature: <break/>Tg(Pomc-EGFP) <break/>1Low</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>M.Musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Npy<sup>GFP</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Dr. Brad <break/>Lowell; Harvard <break/>University; PMID:19357287</td><td valign="top">JAX stock #006417</td><td valign="top">Full nomenclature: <break/>Tg(Npy-hrGFP) <break/>1Lowl</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic <break/>reagent (<italic>Adeno-</italic> <break/><italic>associated virus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AAV1-Ef1α-DIO- <break/>ChR2:YFP</td><td valign="top">Dr. Stephanie L. <break/>Padilla; University <break/>of Washington; <break/>PMID: 25429312</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic <break/>reagent (<italic>Adeno-</italic> <break/><italic>associated virus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AAV1-Ef1α-DIO- <break/>ChR2: mCherry</td><td valign="top">Dr. Stephanie L. <break/>Padilla; University <break/>of Washington; <break/>PMID: 25429312</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-mCherry <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Abcam: ab167453 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2571870">AB_2571870</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:10,000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-kisspeptin <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Dr. Alain Caraty <break/>Universite Francois <break/>-Rabelais Tours; <break/>PMID:16621281</td><td valign="top">No. 564 <break/>AB_2622231</td><td valign="top">(1:2500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat anti-rabbit <break/>conjugated to <break/>Alexa 594</td><td valign="top">Life Technologies <break/>(ThermoFisher)</td><td valign="top">Cat.

To track the estrous cycle, a vaginal lavage with sterile 0.1M PBS was performed daily between 0700 hr to 0800 hr, and evaluated by light microscopy for the appearance of: cornified epithelial cells, leukocytes, and nucleated epithelial cells. The loss of leukocytes and presence of an abundance of nucleated cells was scored as proestrus, while the transition to primarily cornified epithelial cells was scored as estrus. Note one acyclic mouse was excluded from both the wild type and homozygous groups. For fertility measurements, females were mated with a sexually-experienced wild type male on day 0. Litters were tracked from day 16 through 30. The length of time until conception was calculated as the number of days until parturition minus a 20 day gestation period. Note, two wild type and two homozygous animals were excluded because they did not give birth within the 30 day trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Conditioned place preference (CPP) behavioral assay for vGluT2 deleted and control Kiss1 animals</title><p><italic>Slc17a6</italic> Het (<italic>Slc17a6<sup>+/lox</sup>::Kiss1<sup>Cre:GFP/+</sup></italic>, n = 4) and KO (<italic>Slc17a6<sup>Δ/lox</sup>::Kiss1<sup>Cre:GFP/+</sup></italic>, n = 8) females were initially injected with AAV1-DIO-ChR2:YFP in the arcuate nucleus as described above in order to do optogenetic experiments in vitro following in vivo conditioned place preference (CPP) tests. Control Kiss1 (Kiss1<sup>Cre:GFP/+</sup>) females (n = 8), destined for CPP analysis, received sham surgery, but without viral injection. In addition, we prepared another set of control females (<italic>Kiss<sup>Cre:GFP/+</sup></italic>, n = 7), which similar to <italic>Slc17a6</italic> Het and KO females received viral injection prior to the CPP test. Both Kiss1 control groups exhibited similar results in the CPP test, indicating that the presence of unstimulated ChR2::YFP fusion protein had no effect on behavior.</p><p>The animals were OVX at the time of viral injections or sham surgery and received equal cyclical (~every 3–5 days) priming 0.25 μg and/or a surge 1.0–1.5 μg dose of 17β-estradiol benzoate (E2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosch et al., 2013</xref>) prior to and throughout the CPP procedure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>). The E2-treatment started on days 5–6 following OVX with a 2 μg dose, followed 6–7 days later with another 2 μg dose during the recovery period from viral or sham injections. Thereafter, the cyclical E2-treatment was initiated with a 0.25 μg dose followed the day after with 1.5 μg E2, a treatment shown to induce a LH surge in GnRH mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosch et al., 2013</xref>) and Kiss1 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>, we used this E2-treatment immediately prior to the baseline place preference (BPP; initiated 18–20 days after OVX) and prior to the CPP in all groups. The animals were handled daily over a 7 day period prior to the CPP procedure in order to adapt to the investigator and minimize handling stress. The protocol for inducing CPP with sucrose consisted of four phases over the course of 11 days (sucrose habituation, a BPP test, sucrose conditioning, and a CPP test) as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>. During sucrose habituation (Day −1), mice received sucrose in their home cage to prevent neophobia. Animals received 0.5 g of sucrose reward pellets (TestDiet, Richmond, IN) in a scintillation vial lid left in cages overnight. The next morning cages were changed so no sucrose remained. All behavior testing was conducted in a separate room kept on the same light schedule as the colony room. Mice were transferred into the animal testing room 1 hr prior to dark onset (1700 hr). The CPP behavioral assay was conducted in the dark cycle (beginning at 1800 hr). During the baseline place preference test (Day 1), mice were placed in the central chamber of a three-chamber place preference apparatus (Product Number: MED-CPP-3013, Med Associates Inc, Fairfax, VT) to determine pretest values. Doors were left open for mice to explore all three chambers for 15 min. An unbiased assignment was used where mice for each experimental group Kiss1<sup>Cre:GFP</sup> controls, vGluT2 KO (<italic>Slc17a6<sup>Δ/lox</sup>::Kiss1<sup>Cre:GFP/+</sup></italic>), and heterozygous vGluT2 animals (Slc17a6<sup>+/lox</sup>::<italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre:GFP/+</sup></italic>) were subdivided into counterbalanced subgroups based on their assigned conditioning chamber (white or black chamber) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cunningham et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2006</xref>). During the sucrose conditioning phase, mice received sucrose-filled lids (CS+, Days 2, 4, 6, 8) in one chamber or empty lids (CS-, Days 3, 5, 7, 9) in the other chamber on alternating days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>). Mice were confined to a chamber (black or white) with access to sucrose (0.5 g) or without it for 30 min. Lids were stabilized in the chamber with heavy-duty magnets. We had separate sets of lids and magnets for paired (sucrose access) and unpaired days (no sucrose access). To test for acquisition of a CPP for sucrose (Day 10), mice were placed in the central chamber of the apparatus with door open for 15 min. Time spent in the sucrose-paired chamber was recorded pretest (Day 1) and posttest (Day 10). After each animal, the chambers were wiped down with 70% ethanol and paper towels located at the bottom of cages were replaced. At the end of the testing period, animals were returned to the colony room. All animals had free access to normal chow in their home cage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Drugs</title><p> All drugs were purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Minneapolis, MN) unless otherwise specified, and made up as stock solutions as follows: DL-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP5) (50 mM), 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) (10 mM), 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) (100 mM), 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) (50 mM), (2<italic>S</italic>,2'<italic>R</italic>,3'<italic>R</italic>)−2-(2',3'-Dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCG-IV) (10 mM), and RFRP 3 (human, 10 mM) were dissolved in H<sub>2</sub>O.

Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agree that your manuscript successfully uses state of the art in vitro methods to extend findings from in vivo experiments to examine the functional relationships between the estrogen-sensitive kisspeptin neurons of the arcuate nucleus and hypothalamic circuits. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed according to the three reviewers:</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) The major concern is that the conditioned place preference (CPP) conclusions are not supported by the results and should not be overstated in the title. Specifically, the fact that WT OVX-E2 mice do not develop CPP for sucrose raises the issue of whether this test can adequately assess food preference/reward in this model system. Although the authors acknowledge the challenges to measure CPP for sucrose in mice, it is premature to conclude that KO mice have a behavioral phenotype compared to controls not showing the expected response. Alternative CPP protocols (food restriction, high fat-high sucrose pellets) should be considered as well as operant conditioning to measure food reward. Also, simple tests such as a fast-refeeding challenge, food preference or high-fat feeding may help highlight a feeding or metabolic phenotype. Based on the data showing normal energy balance in KO mice, the authors cannot conclude: &quot;Collectively, these data indicate that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons may use both kisspeptin and glutamate to activate POMC but inhibit NPY neurons and thus, participate to maintain normal energy balance&quot;.</p><p>Accordingly, we suggest that you drop the behavioral work (conditional place preference (CCP) paradigm) and concentrate on addressing the neurobiological issues of specificity of expression etc. leaving behavioral work to a later paper.</p><p>2) The physiological relevance of the work is limited because the experiments were done in ovariectomized (OVX) mice in the absence or presence of estradiol (E2) supplementation. Unless the generalization of the work was in the context of abrupt onset of menopause or ovariectomy in patients, it does not seem widely applicable. The study would have had much more breadth if it had been conducted in female mice at key stages of the estrous cycle such as diestrus and proestrus. Typically, studies that intend to use the OVX and the OVX + E2 mouse model to recapitulate the changes in circulating E2 levels occurring during the actual estrous cycle usually implant a silastic capsule filled with E2 in OVX mice to avoid full deprivation in E2 (a condition that never happens in mice) and mimic the diestrus stage.</p><p>3) The authors have to be cautious when they state that because <italic>Slc17a6</italic> is not expressed in the kisspeptin neurons of the preoptic region (AVPV/PeN), the lox/Cre mediated ablation of <italic>Slc17a6</italic> using the kisspeptin promoter is specific for kisspeptin neuron in the arcuate nucleus (ARH). there is increasing evidence that the kisspeptin gene is expressed in extra-hyphothalamic areas, some of which could well be involved in controlling motivated behavior. The only way the authors could convincingly show that ARH kisspeptin neurons indeed regulate motivational drive for palatable food, as claimed in the title of the paper, would be to perform experiments in mice in which they selectively manipulate opto/chemo-genetically ARH kisspeptin neurons in mice in vivo (using the tools the authors master well) and hopefully validate their interesting findings in the animal model in which they knockout selectively <italic>Slc17a6</italic> KO only in kisspeptin neurons. In addition, being able to manipulate (stimulate) the activity of ARH kisspeptin neurons in vivo, this would also extend the significance of the present study by determining whether the kisspeptin neurons could actually be the glutamatergic neurons of the ARH that have recently been described to mediate satiety in mice fed at libitum (see Resch et al., 2017, which has not been discussed in the paper).</p><p>4) Finally, the authors conclude (Abstract) that the E2-driven increase in excitability and glutamate release from ARH kisspeptin neurons plays a significant role in dampening the motivational drive for palatable food during critical reproductive states. Unfortunately, the authors only performed the experiments in OVX + E2 animals. Because the authors have studied the effect of <italic>Slc17a6</italic> KO in kisspeptin neurons on the estrous cycle and showed that it had no effect on it, they should study condition place preference in these animals in diestrus and proestrus to convincingly corroborate their statement.</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>1) Results section: The methods for these experiments are not very clear. How did they measure ion channel currents? What channel blockers did the authors use and in what concentration? Stock concentrations are given in the methods but not the final working concentration. For rebound firing – what is the current injection protocol, how long after the hyperpolarizing current do the authors consider a spike to be a rebound spike?</p><p>2) Results section: It would be good to see some discussion about why there is a difference in the response of NPY neurons to low frequency vs high frequency stimulation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. The authors suggest that the high frequency stimulation is more physiological, in which case I don't understand the point of doing the low frequency stimulation. Do low frequency stimulations not activate the inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors? Would there be any physiological conditions where the release of glutamate from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons switches from being inhibitory for NPY to being excitatory?</p><p>3) A description of the validation of the injection sites of AVV is not clearly stated.</p><p>4) AVPV Kiss1 neurons has been described to project to the ARC (Yeo SH et al., 2016). Because the mouse model expresses Cre in both neuronal populations, even proper injection of AAVs into the ARC could infect AVPV Kiss1 neurons. Therefore, while the lack of action in the presence of TTX indicates that there is synaptic activation, this does not exclude that other AVPV Kiss1 neurons may contact and activate each other when photo-stimulated. Evidence that cell bodies of AVPV Kiss1 neurons (that should be GFP labeled) are devoid of mCherry is necessary.</p><p>5) Indicate at what time after OVX or E2 replacement the experiments were performed as well as dose of E2 used.</p><p>6) Subsection “High frequency stimulation of glutamate release from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons excites POMC neurons and inhibits NPY neurons via metabotropic receptors”, &quot;revealed a significantly reduced slow EPSP&quot; However, Figure 11G does not show this different to be significant.</p><p>7) Has DHPC been used on NPY neurons and DCG-IV on POMC neurons?</p><p>8) The authors addressed the role of mGluR2 in NPY neurons, which is expressed only in 10% of them. Therefore, the study of mGluR7, which is more abundant, is missing.</p><p>9) E2 dramatically decreases Kiss1 expression (Figure 2) to suggest a decreased Kiss release. As such, it is expected that the Kisspeptin tone onto POMC and NPY neurons would be minimal at high Hz stimulation in OVX-E2 vs. OVX VGluT2 KO mice. Did the authors do these measurements? This should be at least discussed along with potential studies assessing the impact of E2 on responses to Kisspeptin in POMC or NPY neurons.</p><p>10) Did the authors test the effect of high Hz stimulation of ARC Kiss1 on AVPV Kiss1 activity in VGluT2 KO mice? This aspect should be at least discussed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Estrogenic-dependent Glutamatergic Neurotransmission from Kisspeptin Neurons Governs Feeding Circuits in Females&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have also tempered and modified our CPP conclusions (e.g., see Discussion section). We agree that it would be advantageous to test for body weight gain differences between WT and KO mice fed energy dense food. These experiments are planned with vGluT2 deletion specifically in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons in adult mice using available techniques and will be done in the future in order to more completely characterize the role of Kiss1 neurons in feeding behavior and energy balance. Still, we feel that the current CPP data adds functional significance to the cellular findings, and we would prefer to keep it; but we have deemphasized the data because more research is needed as stated above.</p><p>However, based on studies conducted in several mouse models (e.g., Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup> females, n=8; POMC-EGFP females, n=10; and Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup> males, n=15), E2-treated OVX female mice do not appear to develop a CPP for sucrose pellets, unless vGluT2 is deleted in Kiss1 neurons. In contrast, intact Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup> males, which express lower levels of vGluT2 in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons versus E2-treated females, do develop a CPP for sucrose. Data from Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup> females and males have been added as Figure 15—figure supplement 1. With the E2-treatment paradigm, which is designed to maximize <italic>Slc17a6</italic> mRNA expression differences in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons between the WT and Het as compared to the KO females, we would expect to find no or low preference for sucrose and no body weight gain in E2-treated WT animals. Importantly, WT, Het and KO mice were all OVX and treated equally with E2 and tested simultaneously for sucrose-reinforced CPP according to the unbiased method recommended by Dr. Chris Cunningham, who is a recognized expert on the use of CPP for measuring motivated behavior (Cunningham et al., 2006). The E2-treatment and experimental design have been described in more detail in the Materials and Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The physiological relevance of the work is limited because the experiments were done in ovariectomized (OVX) mice in the absence or presence of estradiol (E2) supplementation.

Eventually, we want to explore which estrogen receptors are involved. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to do these type of experiments in cycling female mice (see response to comment #4). This is the reason why the majority of published behavioral data (including behavioral data in the Lowell lab, 2016, referred to below) are based on experiments done in male mice. Also, it should be noted that during proestrus in females, estrogen, progesterone and inhibin are all circulating at high levels and found to act on the hypothalamus. Therefore, the findings would not be specific for estradiol’s actions.</p><p>Concerning the estradiol-treatment paradigm, we started using estradiol implants, which increased Cav3.1, Cav3.3 mRNA expression in GnRH neurons (Zhang et al., 2009). However, with E2 implants we were not able to induce a LH surge in our mouse models. Therefore, we developed an E2-injection procedure utilizing a priming dose followed by a surge-producing dose of E2, which also increases Cav3.1 and 3.3 in GnRH neurons, and with this treatment we have been able to induce a LH surge in GnRH mice (Bosch et al., 2013) and in Kiss1 mice (Zhang et al., 2013). Therefore, we believe that our model is of physiological relevance. We are aware that different steroid replacement mouse models are being used, and sometimes conflicting data are reported (see Liu et al., 2017). Unfortunately, the mouse is not a good model for studying reproduction, and eventually studies have to be done in species with long ovulatory cycle with true follicular and luteal phases such as the guinea pig and non-human primates.</p><p><italic>3) The authors have to be cautious when they state that because Slc17a6 is not expressed in the kisspeptin neurons of the preoptic region (AVPV/PeN), the lox/cre mediated ablation of Slc17a6 using the kisspeptin promoter is specific for kisspeptin neuron in the arcuate nucleus (ARH). there is increasing evidence that the kisspeptin gene is expressed in extra-hyphothalamic areas, some of which could well be involved in controlling motivated behavior.

We reported in Qiu et al., 2016 that we did not detect <italic>Slc17a6</italic> mRNA in Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons using scRT-PCR. Also, using our scRT-PCR procedure, we detect vGAT mRNA in close to 100% of AVPV/PeN Kiss1 neurons. We have not detected glutamate release from these rostral Kiss1 neurons. High frequency stimulation releases kisspeptin (Qiu et al., 2016). Although, Kiss1 neurons have been detected in the amygdala and in the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis, these Kiss1 neurons have not been reported to express vGluT2 (See Discussion section). However, we have been more cautious and now refer to vGluT2 KO in Kiss1 neurons (rather than Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) throughout the manuscript. Also, with this in mind, we have changed the title to the following: “Estrogenic-dependent Glutamatergic Neurotransmission from Kisspeptin Neurons Governs Feeding Circuits in Females”. The Fenselau et al., paper (Lowell lab), which is quite relevant for the current findings, has been added to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Finally, the authors conclude (Abstract) that the E2-driven increase in excitability and glutamate release from ARH kisspeptin neurons plays a significant role in dampening the motivational drive for palatable food during critical reproductive states. Unfortunately, the authors only performed the experiments in OVX + E2 animals. Because the authors have studied the effect of Slc17a6 KO in kisspeptin neurons on the estrous cycle and showed that it had no effect on it, they should study condition place preference in these animals in diestrus and proestrus to convincingly corroborate their statement.</p></disp-quote><p>Doing CPP conditioning in intact cycling female mice comparing diestrus versus proestrus animals in control and KO would be difficult and costly. In particular, it has been quite difficult to get the necessary number of <italic>Slc17a6</italic> KO animals of either sex. We would need to have a large group of females in order to have 8-12 diestrus and proestrus females (based on power analysis) from each group to test together for BPP and CPP (on the same day and time). Therefore, as described above, we have developed OVX vehicle- and E2-treated animals as physiological models for E2-induction of the LH surge, and for preventing weight gain in aging females (also see Asarian and Geary, 2013). However, the statement referred to in the Abstract has been modified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) Results section. The methods for these experiments are not very clear. How did they measure ion channel currents? What channel blockers did the authors use and in what concentration? Stock concentrations are given in the methods but not the final working concentration. For rebound firing – what is the current injection protocol, how long after the hyperpolarizing current do the authors consider a spike to be a rebound spike?</p></disp-quote><p>A citation to a previous paper was inadvertently omitted for the rebound spike measurements and is now included in the legend to Figure 2 (Zhang et al., 2013). We have added the drug concentrations for CNQX (10 μM) and AP5 (50 μM) to the legend for Figure 7, and the baclofen concentration (10 μM) for Figure 13. For Figure 14, we have included a reference (Qiu et al., 2010) in the Materials and methods section for the internal Cs<sup>+</sup> concentration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Results section: It would be good to see some discussion about why there is a difference in the response of NPY neurons to low frequency vs high frequency stimulation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons.

Do low frequency stimulations not activate the inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors? Would there be any physiological conditions where the release of glutamate from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons switches from being inhibitory for NPY to being excitatory?</p></disp-quote><p>The low frequency stimulation is used for verifying a direct synaptic connection between Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> and NPY/AgRP neurons. The high frequency stimulation probably reflects the physiological activity based on in vivo recordings (e.g., Moss et al., 1975). It is thought that mGluRs are extra-synaptic such that with the high frequency generated glutamate release there is “spillover” from the synaptic cleft to activate these receptors (Watanabe et al., 2003; Nietz et al., 2017.). This has been discussed in the Results section. The physiological conditions when Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neuronal glutamate release would switch from being inhibitory to excitatory for NPY neurons has not yet been studied specifically. However, during high E2 conditions, such as on proestrus, animals are getting ready to mate and reproduce and at this stage of the cycle it has been shown in many animal models including primates that feeding is suppressed (see Asarian and Geary, 2006, 2013). A potential mechanism is Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> glutamatergic inhibitory output to NPY neurons. On the other hand, if animals are food deprived, it has been shown that NPY neurons receive excitatory ionotropic glutamate input (Liu et al., 2012), some of which could come from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. This has now been added to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A description of the validation of the injection sites of AVV is not clearly stated.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Materials and methods section, we have described the validation of the injection site. We have published previously in males injected with AAV1-DIO-ChR2-YFP in the ARH, that 100% of the YFP neurons expressed Kiss1 mRNA (Nestor et al., 2016). In females, we have published that arcuate AAV1-DIO-ChR2-mCherry-labeled Kiss1 cells are co-expressed with Kiss1<sup>GFP</sup> cells (Qiu et al., 2016). We refer to these publications in the Materials and methods section. In addition, we have done a thorough neuroanatomical analysis comparing neuronal projections following ARH and AVPV/PeN viral injections in our Kiss1 animal model. These anatomical data are being prepared for publication elsewhere. Also see response to specific comment # 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) AVPV Kiss1 neurons has been described to project to the ARC (Yeo SH et al., 2016). Because the mouse model expresses Cre in both neuronal populations, even proper injection of AAVs into the ARC could infect AVPV Kiss1 neurons. Therefore, while the lack of action in the presence of TTX indicates that there is synaptic activation, this does not exclude that other AVPV Kiss1 neurons may contact and activate each other when photo-stimulated. Evidence that cell bodies of AVPV Kiss1 neurons (that should be GFP labeled) are devoid of mCherry is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to specific comment #3. Also, we have published that photostimulation of Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons caused auto-inhibition, not auto-excitation (Qiu et al., 2016, Figure 2I). Therefore, optogenetic activation of AVPV Kiss1 neurons does not activate other AVPV Kiss1 neurons but appears to inhibit each other via GABA release. We have now added higher power confocal images (Figure 6A1-A3) illustrating that mCherry-labeled Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons (Figure 6A1) project to the AVPV/PeN area but that the AVPV/PeN does not express mCherry-labeled cells (Figure 6A2), only immunoreactive kisspeptin neurons (Figure 6A3). Also, see Results section and Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Indicate at what time after OVX or E2 replacement the experiments were performed as well as dose of E2 used.</p></disp-quote><p>The time of ovariectomy and E2 replacement and dose have been included in the Materials and methods section. Also, E2-treatments during the CPP have been added to Table 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “High frequency stimulation of glutamate release from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons excites POMC neurons and inhibits NPY neurons via metabotropic receptors”, &quot;revealed a significantly reduced slow EPSP&quot; However, Figure 11G does not show this different to be significant.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made it clear that we are comparing differences between the control and knockout with E2 replacement (Results section). (The response in E2-treated, OVX females; unpaired t-test, t <sub>(25)</sub> = 2.735, p = 0.0113). a-a, p&lt;0.05) in Figure 11G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Has DHPC been used on NPY neurons and DCG-IV on POMC neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, and we have now included a statement in the Results section that DHPG had no effect on NPY, and DCG-IV had no effect on POMC neurons (see Results section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors addressed the role of mGluR2 in NPY neurons, which is expressed only in 10% of them. Therefore, the study of mGluR7, which is more abundant, is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the electrophysiological responses to mGluR7 agonists in oil and E2-treated OVX females (Results section; Figure 10D-F) and have also illustrated the effects of E2-treatment on mGluR7 mRNA expression in NPY neurons in Figure 10I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) E2 dramatically decreases Kiss1 expression (Figure 2) to suggest a decreased Kiss release. As such, it is expected that the Kisspeptin tone onto POMC and NPY neurons would be minimal at high Hz stimulation in OVX-E2 vs. OVX VGluT2 KO mice. Did the authors do these measurements? This should be at least discussed along with potential studies assessing the impact of E2 on responses to Kisspeptin in POMC or NPY neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not compare E2-treated, OVX KO versus Oil-treated, OVX vGluT2 KO mice, since we had very few vGluT2 KO animals to work with. But we did compare E2-treated, OVX controls versus E2-treated, OVX vGluT2 KO mice. Please compare Figure 12I,J (KO) with Figure 7B,D (controls), animals in both groups were E2-treated. We have more fully emphasized the significant reduction in the postsynaptic responses in the Results section. In addition, we have discussed the possibility that kisspeptin excitatory action on POMC neurons and inhibitory actions on NPY/AgRP neurons could be one of the reasons why deleting vGluT2 was not effective to alter body weight on standard low fat chow over the time-course of our study (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Did the authors test the effect of high Hz stimulation of ARC Kiss1 on AVPV Kiss1 activity in VGluT2 KO mice? This aspect should be at least discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, because of the limited number of vGluT2 KO animals, we did not systematically test the effect of high frequency stimulation on the input to the AVPV in vGlut2 KO. The AVPV/PeN Kiss1 neurons do not express Kiss1 or NKB receptors (Navarro et al., 2013). They do express κ receptors (Zhang et al., 2013) and would possibly be inhibited by dynorphin following high frequency stimulation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> inputs. We do not know if AVPV Kiss1 neurons express metabotropic glutamate receptors. We have added a note in the Discussion section that further studies are needed to determine whether glutamate and/or peptide neurotransmission from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> to Kiss1<sup>AVPV</sup> neurons are involved in reproductive functions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been largely improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance: could you please add a sentence justifying the use of the OVX and OVX+E2 animal models in the text?</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased that our revised manuscript was favorably evaluated by the editors and reviewers, and we have made the final requested revision by including a sentence in the Materials and methods section justifying the use of OVX and OVX + E2 animal models.
