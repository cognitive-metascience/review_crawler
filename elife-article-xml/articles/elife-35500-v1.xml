However, there is limited information on the timing and the relative magnitudes of maximum and minimum mortality, by local climate, age group, sex and medical cause of death. We used geo-coded mortality data and wavelets to analyse the seasonality of mortality by age group and sex from 1980 to 2016 in the USA and its subnational climatic regions. Death rates in men and women ≥ 45 years peaked in December to February and were lowest in June to August, driven by cardiorespiratory diseases and injuries. In these ages, percent difference in death rates between peak and minimum months did not vary across climate regions, nor changed from 1980 to 2016. Under five years, seasonality of all-cause mortality largely disappeared after the 1990s. In adolescents and young adults, especially in males, death rates peaked in June/July and were lowest in December/January, driven by injury deaths.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35500.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the USA, more deaths happen in the winter than the summer. But when deaths occur varies greatly by sex, age, cause of death, and possibly region. Seasonal differences in death rates can change over time due to changes in factors that cause disease or affect treatment.</p><p>Analyzing the seasonality of deaths can help scientists determine whether interventions to minimize deaths during a certain time of year are needed, or whether existing ones are effective. Scrutinizing seasonal patterns in death over time can also help scientists determine whether large-scale weather or climate changes are affecting the seasonality of death.</p><p>Now, Parks et al. show that there are age and sex differences in which times of year most deaths occur. Parks et al. analyzed data on US deaths between 1980 and 2016. While overall deaths in a year were highest in winter and lowest in summer, a greater number of young men died during summer – mainly due to injuries – than during winter. Seasonal differences in deaths among young children have largely disappeared and seasonal differences in the deaths of older children and young adults have become smaller. Deaths among women and men aged 45 or older peaked between December and February – largely caused by respiratory and heart diseases, or injuries. Deaths in this older age group were lowest during the summer months. Death patterns in older people changed little over time. No regional differences were found in seasonal death patterns, despite large climate variation across the USA.</p><p>The analysis by Parks et al. suggests public health and medical interventions have been successful in reducing seasonal deaths among many groups. But more needs to be done to address seasonal differences in deaths among older adults. For example, by boosting flu vaccination rates, providing warnings about severe weather and better insulation for homes. Using technology like hands-free communication devices or home visits to help keep vulnerable elderly people connected during the winter months may also help.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>seasonality</kwd><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>seasonal dynamics</kwd><kwd>mortality</kwd><kwd>cause of death</kwd><kwd>wavelet analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>205208/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ezzati</surname><given-names>Majid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000139</institution-id><institution>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RD-83587301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ezzati</surname><given-names>Majid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>All parts of the USA are similarly adapted to temperature seasonality, although mortality seasonality, and how it has changed since the 1980s, depend on age and sex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is well-established that death rates vary throughout the year, and in temperate climates there tend to be more deaths in winter than in summer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fowler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Healy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McKee, 1989</xref>).

In a large country like the USA, which possesses distinct climate regions, the seasonality of mortality may vary geographically, due to geographical variations in mortality, localized weather patterns, and regional differences in adaptation measures such as heating, air conditioning and healthcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braga et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalkstein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Medina-Ramón and Schwartz, 2007</xref>).

Although mortality seasonality is well-established, there is limited information on how seasonality, including the timing of minimum and maximum mortality, varies by local climate and how these features have changed over time, especially in relation to age group, sex and medical cause of death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rau, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rau et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we comprehensively characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality in the USA by sex and age group, through the application of wavelet analytical techniques, to over three decades of national mortality data. Wavelets have been used to study the dynamics of weather phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moy et al., 2002</xref>) and infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grenfell et al., 2001</xref>). We also used centre of gravity analysis and circular statistics methods to understand the timing of maximum and minimum mortality.

Our results on strong seasonality of cardiorespiratory diseases deaths and weak seasonality of cancer deaths, restricted to older ages, are broadly consistent with these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feinstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rosenwaike, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seretakis et al., 1997</xref>), which had limited analysis on how seasonality changes over time and geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feinstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rosenwaike, 1966</xref>). Similarly, our results on seasonality of injury deaths are supported by a few prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feinstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rosenwaike, 1966</xref>), but our subnational analysis over three decades revealed variations in when injury deaths peaked and in how seasonal differences in these deaths have changed over time in relation to age group which had not been reported before.</p><p>A study of 36 cities in the USA, aggregated across age groups and over time, also found that excess mortality was not associated with seasonal temperature range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kinney et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, a European study found that the difference between winter and summer mortality was lower in colder Nordic countries than in warmer southern European nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Healy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McKee, 1989</xref>) (the study’s measure of temperature was mean annual temperature which differed from the temperature difference between maximum and minimum mortality used in our analysis although the two measures are correlated). The absence of variation in the magnitude of mortality seasonality indicates that different regions in the USA are similarly adapted to temperature seasonality, whereas Nordic countries may have better environmental (e.g. housing insulation and heating) and health system measures to counter the effects of cold winters than those in southern Europe. If the observed absence of association between the magnitude of mortality seasonality and seasonal temperature difference across the climate regions also persists over time, the changes in temperature as a result of global climate change are unlikely to affect the winter-summer mortality difference.</p><p>The cause-specific analysis showed that the substantial decline in seasonal mortality differences in adolescents and young adults was related to the diminishing seasonality of (unintentional) injuries, especially from road traffic crashes, which are more likely to occur in the summer months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2005</xref>) and are more common in men. The weakening of seasonality in boys under five years of age was related to two phenomena: first, the seasonality of death from cardiorespiratory diseases declined, and second, the proportion of deaths from perinatal conditions, which exhibit limited seasonality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10—figure supplement 3</xref>), increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">MacDorman and Gregory, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to young and middle ages, mortality in older ages, where death rates are highest, maintained persistent seasonality over a period of three decades (we note that although the percent seasonal difference in mortality has remained largely unchanged in these ages, the absolute difference in death rates between the peak and minimum months has declined because total mortality has a declining long-term trend). This finding demonstrates the need for environmental and health service interventions targeted towards this group irrespective of geography and local climate. Examples of such interventions include enhancing the availability of both environmental and medical protective factors, such as better insulation of homes, winter heating provision and flu vaccinations, for the vulnerable older population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katiyo et al., 2017</xref>). Social interventions, including regular visits to the isolated elderly during peak mortality periods to ensure that they are optimally prepared for adverse conditions, and responsive and high-quality emergency care, are also important to protect this vulnerable group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Healy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lerchl, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katiyo et al., 2017</xref>). Emergent new technologies, such as always-connected hands-free communications devices with the outside world, in-house cameras, and personal sensors also provide an opportunity to enhance care for the older, more vulnerable groups in the population, especially in winter when the elderly have fewer social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morris, 2013</xref>). Such interventions are important today, and will remain so as the population ages and climate change increases the within- and between-season weather variability.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data</title><p>We used data on all 85,854,176 deaths in the USA from 1980 to 2016 from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Age, sex, state of residence, month of death, and underlying cause of death were available for each record. The underlying cause of death was coded according to the international classification of diseases (ICD) system (9<sup>th</sup> revision of ICD from 1980 to 1998 and 10<sup>th</sup> revision of ICD thereafter). Yearly population counts were available from NCHS for 1990 to 2016 and from the US Census Bureau prior to 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingram et al., 2003</xref>). We calculated monthly population counts through linear interpolation, assigning each yearly count to July.</p><p>We also subdivided the national data geographically into nine climate regions used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karl and Koss, 1984</xref>). On average, the Southeast and South are the hottest climate regions with average annual temperatures of 18.4°C and 18°C respectively; the South also possesses the highest average maximum monthly temperature (27.9°C in July). The lowest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the Southeast (an average range of 17.5°C). The three coldest climate regions are West North Central, East North Central and the Northwest (7.6°C, 8.0°C, 8.2°C respectively). Mirroring the characteristics of the hottest climate regions, the largest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the coldest region, West North Central (an average range of 30.5°C), which also has the lowest average minimum monthly temperature (−6.5°C in January). The other climate regions, Northeast, Southwest, and Central, possess similar average temperatures (10°C to 14°C) and variation within the year of (23°C to 26°C), with the Northeast being the most populous region in the United States (with 19.8% total population in 2016).</p><fig id="fig18" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35500.048</object-id><label>Figure 18.</label><caption><title>Climate regions of the USA.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-35500-fig18-v1"/></fig><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35500.049</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of climate regions of the USA.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><bold>Climate region</bold></th><th><bold>Constituent states</bold></th><th><bold>Population (2016)</bold></th><th><bold>Mean annual temperature (1980–2016) (°C)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Central</td><td>Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, West Virginia</td><td>50,191,326</td><td>11.6</td></tr><tr><td>East North Central</td><td>Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin</td><td>24,418,738</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Northeast</td><td>Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont</td><td>64,046,741</td><td>10.6</td></tr><tr><td>Northwest</td><td>Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington</td><td>13,811,810</td><td>8.2</td></tr><tr><td>South</td><td>Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas</td><td>45,388,414</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Southeast</td><td>Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia</td><td>59,356,072</td><td>18.4</td></tr><tr><td>Southwest</td><td>Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah</td><td>17,613,981</td><td>13.6</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>California, Hawaii, Nevada</td><td>43,708,574</td><td>16.6</td></tr><tr><td>West North Central</td><td>Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming</td><td>5,168,753</td><td>7.6</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Data were divided by sex and age in the following 10 age groups: 0–4, 5–14, 15-24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, 75–84, 85+ years. We calculated monthly death rates for each age and sex group, both nationally and for sub-national climate regions. Death rate calculations accounted for varying length of months, by multiplying each month’s death count by a factor that would make it equivalent to a 31 day month.</p><p>For analysis of seasonality by cause of death, we mapped each ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to four main disease categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and to a number of subcategories which are presented in the Supplementary Note. Cardiorespiratory diseases and cancers accounted for 56.4% and 21.2% of all deaths in the USA, respectively, in 1980, and 40.3% and 22.4%, respectively, in 2016. Deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases have been associated with cold and warm temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basu and Samet, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braga et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gasparrini et al., 2015</xref>). Injuries, which accounted for 8% of all deaths in the USA in 1980 and 7.3% in 2016, may have seasonality that is distinct from so-called natural causes. We did not further divide other causes because the number of deaths could become too small to allow stable estimates when divided by age group, sex and climate region.</p><p>We obtained data on temperature from ERA-Interim, which combines predictions from a physical model with ground-based and satellite measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dee et al., 2011</xref>). We used gridded four-times-daily estimates at a resolution of 80 km to generate monthly population-weighted temperature by climate region throughout the analysis period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>We used wavelet analysis to investigate seasonality for each age-sex group. Wavelet analysis uncovers the presence, and frequency, of repeated maxima and minima in each age-sex-specific death rate time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hubbard, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Torrence and Compo, 1998</xref>). In brief, a Morlet wavelet, described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cazelles et al., 2008</xref>), is equivalent to using a moving window on the death rate time series and analysing periodicity in each window using a short-form Fourier transform, hence generating a dynamic spectral analysis, which allows measuring dynamic seasonal patterns, in which the periodicity of death rates may disappear, emerge, or change over time. In addition to coefficients that measure the frequency of periodicity, wavelet analysis estimates the probability of whether the data are different from the null situation of random fluctuations that can be represented with white (an independent random process) or red (autoregressive of order one process) noise. For each age-sex group, we calculated the p-values of the presence of 12 month seasonality for the comparison of wavelet power spectra of the entire study period (1980–2016) with 100 simulations against a white noise spectrum, which represents random fluctuations. We used the R package WaveletComp (version 1.0) for the wavelet analysis. Before analysis, we de-trended death rates using a polynomial regression, and rescaled each death rate time series so as to range between 1 and −1.</p><p>To identify the months of maximum and minimum death rates, we calculated the centre of gravity and the negative centre of gravity of monthly death rates. Centre of gravity was calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths, with each month weighted by its death rate; negative centre of gravity was also calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths, but with each month was weighted by the difference between its death rate and the year’s maximum death rate. In taking the weighted average, we allowed December (month 12) to neighbour January (month 1), representing each month by an angle subtended from 12 equally-spaced points around a unit circle. Using a technique called circular statistics, a mean <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>of the angles (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) representing the deaths (with n the total number of deaths in an age-sex group for a particular cause of death) is found using the relation below:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mfenced close="}" open="{" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>arg</italic> denotes the complex number argument and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> denotes the month of death in angular form for a particular death <italic>j</italic>. The outcome of this calculation is then converted back into a month value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher, 1995</xref>). Along with each circular mean, a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by using 1000 bootstrap samples. The R package CircStats (version 0.2.4) was used for this analysis.</p><p>For each age-sex group and cause of death, and for each year, we calculated the percent difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months. We fitted a linear regression to the time series of seasonal differences from 1980 to 2016, and used the fitted trend line to estimate how much the percentage difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months had changed from 1980 to 2016. We weighted seasonal difference by the inverse of the square of its standard error, which was calculated using a Poisson model to take population size of each age-sex group through time into account. This method gives us a p-value for the change in seasonal difference per year, which we used to calculate the seasonal difference at the start (1980) and end (2016) of the period of study. Our method of analysing seasonal differences avoids assuming that any specific month or group of months represent highest and lowest number of deaths for a particular cause of death, which is the approach taken by the traditional measure of Excess Winter Deaths. It also allows the maximum and minimum mortality months to vary by age group, sex and cause of death.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Robbie Parks is supported by a Wellcome Trust ISSF Studentship.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eduardo Franco as a Reviewing Editor and Prabhat Jha as the Senior Editor. The Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. As is common in <italic>eLife</italic>, decision narratives are an amalgamation of the essential points of the reviewers' critiques after eliminating redundancies in comments and suggestions.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper examines the seasonality in age- and disease-specific mortality in the US using geocoded data analyzed via wavelet statistical modelling and Poisson regression techniques. The key results indicate mortality increases in adults over 45 years old in winter from cardiorespiratory causes and injuries. Injuries, attributable mainly to road traffic crashes were seen to rise in the summer months among young men. No variation in seasonality was found by climate region, indicating no apparent disparities in adaptation by geographic location. This study provides insights as to whether climate changes could have an impact on the mortality patterns observed in the US as a model. The findings could assist in planning surveillance mechanisms and in projecting workforce requirements in primary and emergency healthcare.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) By choosing only 4 disease groups the authors seem to have missed a key opportunity to investigate seasonal patterns in finer subgroups despite possessing a large sample size (n = 77,771,264), Furthermore, the rationale for choosing the subgroups presented is unclear. For example, the authors chose to group cardiorespiratory diseases into one large outcome when cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes have differing mechanisms in their association with heat or cold exposure. Within respiratory diseases itself, it makes sense to separate acute and chronic causes because the mechanisms vary so starkly and are related to seasonal patterns, i.e. the incidence of pneumonia and acute respiratory outcomes are likely heightened in the winter and this observation may differ to how/why the incidence of chronic respiratory deaths vary seasonally. Furthermore, the mechanisms for how heat is associated with elevated respiratory deaths is understudied and knowing more about seasonal patterns here would be a useful addition to the literature.</p><p>I believe it's important to investigate seasonal patterns of deaths from infectious disease, maternal and neonatal causes, endocrine disorders, genitourinary conditions and neuropsychiatric conditions (which are all associated with temperature) to add valuable insight into understudied but important disease groups, but these have been excluded from the present analysis. Considering the tragic opioid epidemic in USA, it would be a valuable contribution to the literature to understand whether seasonal patterns (at least in more recent years) are observed with deaths related to substance use disorders.</p><p>2) The authors pointed out in the Introduction that global warming may impact on excess cold weather death rates. Presumably a major part of the rationale for testing the differences in regions over time was to help inform our understanding of what the impact may be. However no conclusions were reached with regard to the implications of the findings. Clearly any such conclusions would need to be appropriately and heavily caveated but as this is a major reason for the analysis. Please expand the Discussion to include these points.</p><p>3) Methodology:</p><p>A) Wavelet power spectra are not always easy to interpret, and the uncertainty in estimated wavelet coefficients is difficult to quantify. The wavelet analysis makes for an interesting exploratory tool, showing that for the most part cycles have a duration of 12 months and are reasonably stable over time. It does not seem possible to draw firm conclusions about the research hypothesis using wavelets, however. All cause male mortality for 15-24 year olds appears to be less cyclical in recent years, although how to quantify this effect and assign a statistical significance to it is not apparent from the power spectrum shown.</p><p>The second analysis is more appropriate, although the details of this analysis are sparse. It appears that the model used is something like the following, where Yit is the count of deaths in age group i at time t.</p><p>--------------------- -------------------------------------</p><p>Yit∼ Poisson(Nit ⋅ λit)log(λit)= μi + βit + Mit ⋅ [α1i ⋅ cos(2πt/12)</p><p>+α2i ⋅ sin(2πt/12)+α3i ⋅ cos(2πt/6)</p><p>+α4i ⋅ sin(2πt/6)]</p><p>Mit= ρi + γit</p><p>--------------------- -------------------------------------</p><p>A model of this could answer the following questions, with p-values produced from a likelihood ratio test.</p><p>- Is γi negative? If so the seasonal effect is becoming less severe for age group i.</p><p>- Does it look like all age groups have the same trend, with γi = γ₀ for all i?</p><p>- Do all age groups have the same cycle, with αpi = αp0?</p><p>- Does γ vary by region (negative in cold-climate regions?)</p><p>- Do the cycles, given by the α, vary by region or is a nation-wide cycle sufficient?</p><p>The above model is easier to interpret than the wavelet analysis. The quantity 1 − exp(120γ) is the change per decade in the seasonality effect, which could be reported with a 95% confidence interval.</p><p>B) The approach is different to a number of those referenced (particularly the standard measure of excess winter deaths). It would be helpful to have some comment on this, particularly the generalisability to other studies. The focus has been on peak months in this analysis, but the standard assessment of excess winter deaths is to compare December to March months to the rest of the year.</p><p>C) Appropriate rationale was given to the regional splits used in the analysis. However no description was given of the characteristics of these regional areas other than subsequent information on temperatures. As pointed out there could be a number of factors that are important. I would expect some reference to their differing characteristics.</p><p>4) Interpretation:</p><p>A) No table is presented with descriptive statistics, i.e. on the sample size of cases that fall into each disease category.</p><p>B) I may be misreading the paper (in which case it would be helpful to clarify so others do not make the same mistake), however the analysis in Figure 6 compares the difference in temperature experienced in those regions between the warmest and coldest months versus the% seasonal difference in death. In the Discussion this in contrasted with findings from Europe where countries with a more temperate winter have, paradoxically, higher rates of excess winter mortality. However this is not an appropriate direct comparison, regional extremes in variation were not looked at when comparisons between countries are made. This does not invalidate the comparison but it would be helpful to explicitly summarise if there are any differences between regions and examine what those are.</p><p>C) One option for this paper would be to be admittedly exploratory, avoiding the use of the word 'significant' and simplifying the analysis. Simple monthly averages and testing for the months having the same mean could replace the wavelet analysis. A second option would be to focus on a specific research hypothesis, explain carefully how the model estimates relate to this research hypothesis, and adjust the p-values for multiple testing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35500.063</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) By choosing only 4 disease groups the authors seem to have missed a key opportunity to investigate seasonal patterns in finer subgroups despite possessing a large sample size (n = 77,771,264), Furthermore, the rationale for choosing the subgroups presented is unclear.

In the specific case of cardiorespiratory diseases, they are commonly analysed together when studying the effects of temperature and air pollution (Basu, 2009; Basu, Dominici, and Samet, 2005; Basu and Samet, 2002; Bennett et al., 2014; Braga, Zanobetti, and Schwartz, 2002; Curriero et al., 2002; Dockery et al., 1993; Gasparrini et al., 2015; Hoek et al., 2013; Pope et al., 2002), possibly because of their shared aetiology (e.g., death from cor pulmonale arising from COPD or death from pneumonia in patients with acute vascular events) and because assignment of cause of death may use them interchangeably. We now present a third layer of disaggregation following the above suggestions (figure supplements for Figures 6-13; Table 1; Materials and methods).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors pointed out in the Introduction that global warming may impact on excess cold weather death rates.

As correctly pointed out in this comment, the current analysis can nonetheless provide qualitative insights into such effects, which we have now discussed with appropriate caveats (Discussion, second, third and fourth paragraphs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Methodology:</p><p>A) Wavelet power spectra are not always easy to interpret, and the uncertainty in estimated wavelet coefficients is difficult to quantify.

The uncertainty of wavelet spectra are also well-characterised (Hubbard, 1996). We follow wavelet analysis with a centre of gravity analysis to identify the months of maximum and minimum mortality (Figure 12 and respective figure supplements; subsection “Statistical methods&quot;), and with a quantitative analysis of (percentage) difference in death rates from 1980 to 2016 (Figure 13 and respective figure supplements; subsection “Statistical methods&quot;).</p><p>We note that even in standard statistical comparisons, p-values and statistical significance are not apparent from figures but are a part of the analysis.

The wavelet analysis allows greater flexibility when compared to the above model suggested because it does not require assuming only 6- and 12-month periodicity.</p><p>We have nonetheless implemented the above approach. We note that some the parameters of this model (e.g., the ρ, γ, and α terms) cannot be interpreted on their own, because the model includes involve interaction terms, for example (γ x α1i). In addition, the interpretation of γ is also dependent on the sign of α, as, for example, a negative value of α with a negative value of γ indicates the percentage difference between maximum and minimum mortality is increasing, whereas a positive value of α with a negative value of γ indicates that the percentage difference between maximum and minimum mortality is decreasing. For these reasons, interpretable results require predicting the outcomes in specific years and not simply the model parameters. We have done so for one of the outcomes presented in the paper, namely percent difference in death rates between maximum and minimum mortality months, with results presented in the table below. Conclusions were similar to those from the existing method.</p><p>We believe that our current approach has the dual advantage over the proposed method of using a more general and flexible framework and being more easily understandable. We welcome guidance on whether adding this additional method would improve the paper.</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom"><bold>Sex</bold></td><td valign="bottom"><bold>Age (years)</bold></td><td valign="bottom"><bold>Percent difference 1980</bold></td><td valign="bottom"><bold>Percent difference 2016</bold></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Male</td><td valign="bottom">0-4</td><td valign="bottom">11.9</td><td valign="bottom">6.9</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Female</td><td valign="bottom">0-4</td><td valign="bottom">10.6</td><td valign="bottom">6.9</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Male</td><td valign="bottom">5-14</td><td valign="bottom">56.2</td><td valign="bottom">19.4</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Female</td><td valign="bottom">5-14</td><td valign="bottom">26.3</td><td valign="bottom">20.9</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Male</td><td valign="bottom">15-24</td><td valign="bottom">39.1</td><td valign="bottom">10.8</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Female</td><td valign="bottom">15-24</td><td valign="bottom">14.9</td><td valign="bottom">2.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Male</td><td valign="bottom">25-34</td><td valign="bottom">17.3</td><td valign="bottom">7</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Female</td><td valign="bottom">25-34</td><td valign="bottom">6.9</td><td valign="bottom">4.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Male</td><td valign="bottom">35-44</td><td valign="bottom">4.9</td><td valign="bottom">4</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Female</td><td valign="bottom">35-44</td><td valign="bottom">6.5</td><td valign="bottom">7.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Male</td><td valign="bottom">45-54</td><td valign="bottom">10.9</td><td valign="bottom">7.9</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Female</td><td valign="bottom">45-54</td><td valign="bottom">11.4</td><td valign="bottom">11.2</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Male</td><td valign="bottom">55-64</td><td valign="bottom">13.7</td><td valign="bottom">11.7</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Female</td><td valign="bottom">55-64</td><td valign="bottom">13.1</td><td valign="bottom">13.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Male</td><td valign="bottom">65-74</td><td valign="bottom">17.6</td><td valign="bottom">14.5</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Female</td><td valign="bottom">65-74</td><td valign="bottom">16.6</td><td valign="bottom">15.4</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Male</td><td valign="bottom">75-84</td><td valign="bottom">24.3</td><td valign="bottom">20.2</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Female</td><td valign="bottom">75-84</td><td valign="bottom">24.6</td><td valign="bottom">21.2</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Male</td><td valign="bottom">85+</td><td valign="bottom">35.2</td><td valign="bottom">25.5</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Female</td><td valign="bottom">85+</td><td valign="bottom">34.2</td><td valign="bottom">27.6</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p><bold>Author response table 1.</bold> Percent difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months for all-cause mortality in 2016 versus 1980 by sex and age group using the alternative method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) The approach is different to a number of those referenced (particularly the standard measure of excess winter deaths).
