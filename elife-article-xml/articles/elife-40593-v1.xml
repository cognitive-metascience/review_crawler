Here we demonstrate sleep-promoting effects of dietary threonine (SPET) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Dietary threonine markedly increased daily sleep amount and decreased the latency to sleep onset in a dose-dependent manner. High levels of synaptic GABA or pharmacological activation of metabotropic GABA receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>-R) suppressed SPET. By contrast, synaptic blockade of GABAergic neurons or transgenic depletion of GABA<sub>B</sub>-R in the ellipsoid body R2 neurons enhanced sleep drive non-additively with SPET. Dietary threonine reduced GABA levels, weakened metabotropic GABA responses in R2 neurons, and ameliorated memory deficits in plasticity mutants. Moreover, genetic elevation of neuronal threonine levels was sufficient for facilitating sleep onset. Taken together, these data define threonine as a physiologically relevant, sleep-promoting molecule that may intimately link neuronal metabolism of amino acids to GABAergic control of sleep drive via the neuronal substrate of sleep homeostasis.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

In stark contrast to the homeostatic nature of sleep, the internal machinery of sleep is vulnerable to external (e.g., environmental change) or internal conditions (e.g., genetic mutation) that lead to adaptive changes in sleep behaviors. Sleep behavior is conserved among mammals, insects, and even lower eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Allada and Siegel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joiner, 2016</xref>). Since the identification of the voltage-gated potassium channel <italic>Shaker</italic> as a sleep-regulatory gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cirelli et al., 2005</xref>), fruit flies have been one of the most advantageous genetic models to dissect molecular and neural components that are important for sleep homeostasis and plasticity.</p><p>To date, a number of sleep-regulatory genes and neurotransmitters have been identified in animal models as well as in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allada et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Artiushin and Sehgal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tomita et al., 2017</xref>). For instance, the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is known to have a sleep-promoting role that is conserved in invertebrates and vertebrates. Hypomorphic mutations in mitochondrial <italic>GABA-transaminase</italic> (<italic>GABA-T</italic>) elevate GABA levels and lengthen baseline sleep in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). The long sleep phenotype in <italic>GABA-T</italic> mutants accompanies higher sleep consolidation and shorter latency to sleep onset, consistent with the observations that pharmacological enhancement of GABAergic transmission facilitates sleep in flies and mammals, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holmes and Sugden, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lancel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schneider et al., 1977</xref>). In addition, <italic>resistance to dieldrin</italic> (<italic>Rdl</italic>), a <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of the ionotropic GABA receptor, suppresses wake-promoting circadian pacemaker neurons in adult flies to exert sleep-promoting effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agosto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parisky et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4 c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP), an agonist of the ionotropic GABA receptor, promotes sleep in insects and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dissel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Faulhaber et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lancel, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Many sleep medications modulate GABAergic transmission. A prominent side effect of anti-epileptic drugs relevant to GABA is causing drowsiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jain and Glauser, 2014</xref>). Conversely, glycine supplements improve sleep quality in a way distinct from traditional hypnotic drugs, minimizing deleterious cognitive problems or addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bannai and Kawai, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamadera et al., 2007</xref>). In fact, glycine or D-serine acts as a co-agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and promotes sleep through the sub-type of ionotropic glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tomita et al., 2015</xref>). Emerging evidence further supports the roles of amino acid transporters and metabolic enzymes in sleep regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboudhiaf et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sonn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stahl et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, we have demonstrated that starvation induces the expression of metabolic enzymes for serine biosynthesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brains, and elevates free serine levels to suppress sleep via cholinergic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sonn et al., 2018</xref>). These observations prompted us to hypothesize that other amino acids may also display neuro-modulatory effects on sleep behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dietary threonine promotes sleep and facilitates sleep onset</title><p>To determine if amino acid supplements modulate sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we employed an infrared beam-based <italic>Drosophila</italic> activity monitor (DAM) that detects locomotor activity in individual flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfeiffenberger et al., 2010</xref>). Sleep behaviors in wild-type flies fed 5% sucrose containing 17.5 mM of each amino acid were quantitatively assessed in 12 hr light:12 hr dark (LD) cycles at 25°C. The strongest impact on sleep quantity and quality was observed with cysteine supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, dietary cysteine compromised locomotion and caused high lethality during our sleep assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). We thus excluded it from further analyses. Intriguingly, threonine supplementation potently elevated total sleep amount by increasing the number of sleep bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, dietary threonine evidently shortened the latency to sleep onset after lights-off. The sleep-promoting effects of dietary threonine (SPET) were dose-dependent and observed in both male and female flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Transgenic silencing of sensory neurons that express either gustatory receptors (<italic>Gr66a</italic>, <italic>Gr33a</italic>, and <italic>Gr5a</italic>) or olfactory co-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lone et al., 2016</xref>) negligibly affected SPET as compared to relevant heterozygous controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results suggest that sensory perception of dietary threonine is less likely responsible for SPET. We further found that flies fed nutrient-rich food containing additional protein sources (e.g., cornmeal, yeast) also exhibited SPET, although higher concentrations of threonine were required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). We reason that flies may ingest smaller volume of daily food on nutrient-rich diet than on sucrose-only diet as a compensation for their difference in calories per volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carvalho et al., 2005</xref>). Nonetheless, these data indicate that SPET is not limited to carbohydrate-only diets.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40593.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dietary threonine promotes sleep and facilitates sleep onset.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild-type male flies were individually loaded on to 5% sucrose food containing 17.5 mM of each amino acid (day 0) and entrained in LD cycles at 25°C.

It is also noteworthy that low waking activity does not necessarily associate with long sleep phenotypes as observed with tryptophan supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To examine if SPET affects arousal threshold (i.e., sleep depth), we quantified arousal responses to sensory stimuli during sleep.

However, threonine-fed flies displayed shorter latency to the first post-stimulus bout of sleep. Consistent results were obtained when nighttime sleep was interrupted by a pulse of light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that a higher sleep drive, but not a change in sleep depth, may contribute to SPET.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Circadian clock-dependent control of sleep onset is dispensable for SPET</title><p><italic>Rdl</italic> and <italic>wide awake</italic> (<italic>wake</italic>) are two evolutionarily conserved genes that contribute to circadian clock-dependent control of sleep onset in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agosto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2014a</xref>).

Since threonine supplementation exhibited cumulative effects on baseline sleep in LD cycles, we reasoned that it might be necessary to monitor the long-term changes in neural activity associated with threonine diet. Accordingly, we employed a transgenic reporter of the calcium-sensitive transcriptional activator LexA (CaLexA) that translocates into nucleus in a calcium-dependent manner and induces the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Masuyama et al., 2012</xref>). Confocal microscopy of adult fly brains revealed the strongest GFP expression by the GABAergic CaLexA in neurons projecting into antennal lobe (AL), medial antenno-cerebral tract (mACT), and lateral horn (LH) among other GAD1-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>). These observations suggest a heterogeneity in baseline Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels among GABAergic neuron subsets. Interestingly, threonine, but not arginine, induced the CaLexA signal in a subset of GABAergic neurons adjacent to the antennal lobe (LN, lateral neurons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B and C</xref>). By contrast, no detectable changes were observed in the CaLexA signals from other sleep-regulatory loci such as mushroom body or dopaminergic neurons upon threonine diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4D and E</xref>). Although the sensitivity of CaLexA may limit the detectable size and duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in our experimental condition, these results support the relative specificity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in LN to the threonine diet. Given that dietary threonine decreased GABA levels, GABAergic LN may selectively display a compensatory increase in their neural activity. Alternatively, it is possible that auto-inhibitory GABA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pinard et al., 2010</xref>) are expressed more strongly in these LN than other GABAergic neurons. Low GABA levels in threonine-fed flies may then relieve this negative feedback and stimulate their neural activity upon threonine diet. In either case, these results prompted us to ask if GABAergic transmission would be necessary for SPET.</p><p>To further validate the implication of GABAergic transmission in SPET, we expressed a <italic>shibire</italic><sup>ts</sup> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kitamoto, 2001</xref>) in GAD1-expressing GABAergic neurons. The <italic>shibire</italic><sup>ts</sup> is a temperature-sensitive mutant allele in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of dynamin that interferes with synaptic vesicle recycling and thus, blocks synaptic transmission at restrictive (29°C) but not permissive (21°C) temperature. The conditional blockade of synaptic transmission in GABAergic neurons induced sleep in control-fed condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and it significantly masked SPET (p&lt;0.0001 for sleep amount; p=0.0012 for sleep latency by two-way ANOVA). These long sleep phenotypes were partially but consistently observed by the pan-neuronal depletion of metabotropic GABA receptor R1 or R3 (GABA<sub>B</sub>-R1 or GABA<sub>B</sub>-R3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, their effects were in contrast with those observed by hypomorphic <italic>GABA-T</italic> mutations that suppressed SPET but did not promote baseline sleep in control-fed condition. We further found that co-administration of an agonist of metabotropic GABA receptors (SKF-97541), but not of ionotropic GABA receptors (THIP), with threonine suppressed SPET particularly on sleep latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, p=0.1285 for THIP; p=0.0096 for SKF-97541 by two-way ANOVA). Adult-specific manipulations of GABAergic transmission by the temperature-sensitive allele or by the oral administration of receptor-specific agonists excluded possible developmental effects of GABA on SPET. Collectively, these data suggest a possible model that SPET involves the down-regulation of metabotropic GABA transmission to induce sleep whereas genetic or pharmacological elevation of the GABA transmission interferes with this process to suppress SPET. Nonetheless, the multimeric nature of GABA receptors and their expression in either wake- or sleep-promoting neurons likely complicate the net effects of general activation or silencing of GABA transmission on sleep. We thus asked if more specific suppression of the metabotropic GABA transmission in a dedicated neural locus would induce sleep and mask SPET, thereby supporting our hypothesis above.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Metabotropic GABA transmission in ellipsoid body R2 neurons contributes to SPET</title><p>A previous study mapped a subset of ellipsoid body (EB) neurons in the adult fly brain (hereafter referred to as R2 EB neurons) as a neural locus important for sleep homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Neural activity in R2 EB neurons positively correlates to sleep need, and the transgenic excitation of R2 EB neurons is sufficient to induce rebound sleep. Considering that SPET involves a higher sleep drive, we hypothesized that dietary threonine might affect the activity of R2 EB neurons via metabotropic GABA transmission. Since the intracellular signaling downstream of metabotropic GABA receptors triggers cAMP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Onali et al., 2003</xref>), we employed Epac1-camps, a transgenic fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shafer et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Using a <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetic model, we have investigated whether dietary amino acids could affect sleep behaviors and thereby discovered SPET. Previous studies have demonstrated that the wake-promoting circadian pacemaker neurons are crucial for timing sleep onset after lights-off in LD cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agosto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parisky et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, WAKE-dependent silencing of clock neurons and its collaborative function with RDL have been suggested as a key mechanism in the circadian control of sleep onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2014a</xref>). However, our evidence indicates that SPET facilitates sleep onset in a manner independent of circadian clocks. We further elucidate that SPET operates likely via the down-regulation of metabotropic GABA transmission in R2 EB neurons, a neural locus for generating homeostatic sleep drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Both food availability and nutritional quality substantially affect sleep behaviors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Sucrose contents in food and their gustatory perception dominate over dietary protein to affect daily sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catterson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Linford et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Linford et al., 2015</xref>). Starvation promotes arousal in a manner dependent on the circadian clock genes <italic>Clock</italic> and <italic>cycle</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keene et al., 2010</xref>) as well as neuropeptide F (NPF), which is a fly ortholog of mammalian neuropeptide Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chung et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, protein is one of the nutrients that contribute to the postprandial sleep drive in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>) and this observation is possibly relevant to SPET. While <italic>Leucokinin</italic> (<italic>Lk</italic>) and <italic>Lk</italic> receptor (<italic>Lkr</italic>) play important roles in dietary protein-induced postprandial sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>) and in starvation-induced arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murakami et al., 2016</xref>), we observed comparable SPET between hypomorphic mutants of <italic>Lk</italic> or <italic>Lkr</italic> and their heterozygous controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>). Therefore, SPET and its neural basis reveal a sleep-regulatory mechanism distinct from those involved in sleep plasticity relevant to food intake.</p><p>What will be the molecular basis of SPET? Given the general implication of GABA in sleep promotion, a simple model will be that a molecular sensor expressed in a subset of GABAergic neurons (i.e., LN) directly responds to an increase in threonine levels, activates GABA transmission, and thereby induces sleep. Several lines of our evidence, however, favored the other model that dietary threonine actually down-regulates metabotropic GABA transmission in R2 EB neurons, de-represses the neural locus for generating homeostatic sleep drive, and thereby enhances sleep drive. The latter model does not necessarily conflict with sleep-promoting effects of genetic or pharmacological conditions that generally elevate GABA levels or enhance GABAergic transmission since those effects will be the net outcome of activated GABA transmission via various sub-types of GABA receptors expressed in either wake- or sleep-promoting neurons and their circuitry.</p><p>The structural homology among threonine, GABA, and their metabolic derivatives (e.g., alpha-ketobutyrate and gamma-hydroxybutyrate) led us to the hypothesis that these relevant chemicals may act as competitive substrates in enzymatic reactions for their overlapping metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). Consequently, dietary threonine may limit the total flux of GABA-glutamate-glutamine cycle possibly through substrate competition, decreases the size of available GABA pool, and thereby down-scales GABA transmission for SPET. This accounts for why genetic or pharmacological elevation of GABA levels rather suppresses SPET. Threonine, GABA, and their derivatives may also act as competitive ligands for metabotropic GABA receptors, explaining weak GABA responses in R2 EB neurons of threonine-fed flies. Biochemical and neural evidence supportive of this hypothesis is quite abundant. It has been previously shown that alpha-ketobutyrate, GABA, and the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate act as competitive substrates in common enzymatic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beyerinck and Brass, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lund et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suzuki et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, functional interactions of beta-hydroxybutyrate or gamma-hydroxybutyrate with GABAergic signaling have been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Absalom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lund et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nasrallah et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Snead and Gibson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suzuki et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, threonine and GABA derivatives have anti-convulsive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Growdon et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hauser et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 1990</xref>), which further support their common structural and functional relevance to GABAergic signaling.</p><p>The removal of the amino group is the initial step for amino acid metabolism, and various transaminases mediate its transfer between amino acids and alpha-keto acids. On the other hand, a group of amino acids (i.e., glutamate, glycine, serine, and threonine) has their own deaminases that can selectively remove the amino group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bender, 2014</xref>). The presence of these specific deaminases is indicative of active mechanisms that individually fine-tune the baseline levels of these amino acids in metabolism, and possibly in the context of other physiological processes as well. This idea is further supported by the conserved roles of glutamate, glycine, and serine as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators important for brain function, including sleep regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tomita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zimmerman et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, serine, glycine, and threonine constitute a common metabolic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), and threonine may contribute indirectly to glycine- or serine-dependent activation of sleep-promoting NMDAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tomita et al., 2015</xref>). Nonetheless, we found that sleep-modulatory effects of dietary glycine were distinct from SPET and thus, we speculate that threonine may act as an independent neuromodulator, similar to other amino acids with their dedicated deaminases.</p><p>While several lines of our data support that threonine is likely to be an endogenous sleep driver in fed conditions, we have recently demonstrated that starvation induces serine biosynthesis in the brain and neuronal serine subsequently suppresses sleep via cholinergic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sonn et al., 2018</xref>). These two pieces of our relevant works establish a compelling model that the metabolic pathway of serine-glycine-threonine functions as a key sleep-regulatory module in response to metabolic sleep cues (e.g., food ingredients and dietary stress). We further hypothesize that the adaptive control of sleep behaviors by select amino acids and their conserved metabolic pathway suggests an ancestral nature of their sleep regulation. Future studies should address if the serine-glycine-threonine metabolic pathway constitutes the sleep homeostat that can sense and respond to different types of sleep needs. In addition, it will be interesting to determine if this metabolic regulation of sleep is conserved among other animals, including humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Each fly was housed in a 65 × 5 mm glass tube containing 5% sucrose and 2% agar (behavior food). For amino acid supplements, the indicated amount of each amino acid was dissolved in the behavior food. For oral administration of GABA-T or GABA transporter inhibitors, 10 mM of EOS (Tokyo Chemical Industry) or 10 mg/ml of NipA (Sigma) was directly dissolved in the behavior food containing the indicated amount of threonine. For oral administration of GABA receptor agonists, 10 mg/ml of THIP (Tocris) or SKF-97541 (Tocris) stock solution was diluted into the behavior food at the indicated final concentration. Flies were fed on amino acid- and/or drug-containing behavior food in LD cycles at 25°C for 4.5 days. Locomotor activity was recorded using the DAM system (Trikinetics) and quantified by the number of infrared beam crosses per minute. Sleep bouts were defined as no activity for &gt;5 min. Sleep parameters were analyzed using an Excel macro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfeiffenberger et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Measurements of arousal threshold and sleep latency after arousal</title><p>The arousal threshold to mechanical stimuli was measured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2008</xref>) with minor modifications. Locomotor activities were recorded similarly as in the sleep analyses, while behavioral test tubes containing individual male flies were scraped with a thin wood stick at zeitgeber (ZT) 16 (lights-on at ZT0; lights-off at ZT12) during the fourth LD cycle. Mechanical stimuli used in our tests include: 1) scraping sound and vibration without direct scraping (a weak stimulus), 2) gentle scraping (a moderate stimulus), and 3) hard scraping repeated 3–4 times (a strong stimulus). Flies were defined as aroused if they displayed inactivity for &gt;5 min prior to the stimulus but showed any stimulus-induced locomotor response within 10 min. The percentage of aroused flies was calculated per each group in individual experiments and averaged from three independent experiments. Latency to sleep onset after the arousal was calculated in individual flies and averaged per each group. To measure the arousal threshold to a light stimulus, LD-entrained flies were exposed to a 1 min light pulse at ZT16 instead of the mechanical stimuli. The percentage of light-aroused flies and sleep latency after the light-induced arousal were measured similarly as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Video analyses of sleep and locomotor activity</title><p>Wild-type male flies were placed individually into the video-tracking arena (diameter x height = 16 mm x 2 mm) in a 24-well plate filled with the behavior food (5% sucrose +2% agar±25 mM threonine) (day 0). Flies were entrained in 12 hr light:12 hr dim red light (red LED) cycles at 25°C before 24 hr time-lapse images were obtained at 0.3–1 Hz using HandyAVI software (AZcendant) on day 4. Their positional changes in X- and Y-axes were calculated from two consecutive frames of the time-lapse images per each arena. Any positional difference larger than eight pixels was considered as a movement. A window of the time frames with no positional change for &gt;5 min was defined as a sleep bout. Additional parameters for sleep or locomotor activity were analyzed using Excel. For the higher-resolution analysis of locomotor behaviors, male flies were pre-fed on control or amino acid-containing behavior food for four LD cycles at 25°C. After brief anesthetization, flies were individually placed into 6-well plates (diameter x height = 35 mm x 2 mm). After 25 min of habituation, time-lapse images were obtained at 10 Hz using HandyAVI software (AZcendant). Approximately 3000 frames (corresponding to a 5 min video recording) were analyzed using ImageJ software to quantify locomotor activity in individual flies as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Aversive phototaxic suppression (APS)</title><p>An APS-based short-term memory test was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dissel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seugnet et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, adult male flies were individually housed and fed either control or threonine-containing behavior food for four LD cycles. A single fly was placed in the dark chamber of a T-maze without anesthesia. A filter paper (3M) was soaked with 180 μL of 1 μM quinine hydrochloride solution (Sigma) and was placed in the light chamber to give aversive condition in concordance with a light stimulus. After 1 min of habituation in the T-maze, a middle bridge between two chambers was opened and the light source was gradually turned on. Any fly which did not move to the light chamber at the first trial was excluded from further analysis. If a fly entered the light chamber within 20 secs, it was considered as a pass. The whole procedure was repeated 16 times in four sessions (four trials/session) at 1 min intervals. A performance index was calculated per each fly by the percentage of ‘non-pass’ in the last session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Whole-brain imaging</title><p>Transgenic flies were fed on control or amino acid-containing behavior food for four LD cycles at 25°C prior to imaging experiments. Whole brains were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde. Fixed brains were washed three times in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBS-T), blocked in PBS-T containing 0.5% normal goat serum, and then incubated with mouse anti-GFP (NeuroMab) and rabbit anti-GABA (Sigma) antibodies for 2 days at 4°C. After washing three times in PBS-T, brains were further incubated with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 day at 4°C, washed three times with PBS-T, and then mounted in VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Confocal images of whole-mount brains were acquired using a Multi-Photon Confocal Microscope (LSM780NLO, Carl Zeiss) and analyzed using ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vivo Epac1-camps imaging</title><p>Transgenic flies fed either control or threonine-containing behavior food were anesthetized in ice. A whole brain was briefly dissected in hemolymph-like HL3 solution (5 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 70 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 5 mM Trehalose, 115 mM Sucrose) and then placed on a 25 mm round coverslip. A magnetic imaging chamber (Chamlide CMB, Live Cell Instrument) was assembled on the coverslip and filled with 900 μl of HL3 solution. Where indicated, 100 μl of 10x GABA stock solution in HL3 was added to the imaging samples. Live-brain images were acquired at ~1 Hz using a multi-photon confocal microscope (LSM780NLO, Carl Zeiss) with a Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.3 oil lens. The power of a 458 nm-laser projection was 3% at a pixel resolution of 256 × 256. Each frame constituted two slices by ~5 µm of step sizes. Gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) detectors were set by two ranges (473–491 nm and 509–535 nm) for ECFP and EYFP channels, respectively. Pinhole was fully opened (599 µm) to avoid any subtle z-drift during the image acquirement. The fluorescence intensities of CFP and YFP were quantified using ZEN software (Carl Zeiss) and any changes in FRET signals were calculated in Excel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantitative PCR</title><p>Total RNA was purified from 10 flies per each genotype (five males and five females) using Trizol Reagent, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA was prepared from DNase I-treated RNA samples using the M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase reagent (Promega) and random hexamers. Diluted cDNA samples were quantitatively analyzed by SYBR Green-based Prime Q-Mastermix (GeNet Bio) and gene-specific primers using the LightCycler 480 real-time PCR system (Roche). To validate the efficiency of transgenic RNA interference, total RNAs from head or body extracts were analyzed similarly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantification of threonine levels</title><p>Quantitative measurement of threonine was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2014b</xref>) with minor modifications. Briefly, 30 female flies were homogenized in 200 μL of PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100. Whole-body extracts were clarified twice by centrifugation, and total proteins in the extracts were quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After boiling, soluble extracts were further clarified by centrifugation and subjected to an enzymatic reaction. Each reaction mixture included 40 μL of 5 × HEPES reaction buffer (500 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 1 mM NADH, 0.25 mM pyridoxal 5-phosphate, and 5 mM dithiothreitol), 160 μL of soluble body extracts, and 1 U of alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma). In parallel, control reactions with a serial dilution of threonine stock solution (16 mM) were used to generate a standard curve for quantification. The enzymatic reactions were set up in a 96-well microplate (Corning) and incubated for 30 min at 4°C followed by 10 min incubation at 25°C. Absorbance at 340 nm was measured for each reaction mixture using an Infinite M200 microplate reader (Tecan) before 1 µL of bacterially purified L-threonine aldolase (LTA) was added to each reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was further incubated at 37°C for 5 min and post-LTA absorbance was measured to calculate decreases in NADH levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Protein purification of L-threonine aldolase</title><p>The coding sequence of LTA was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (a gift from R.J.

Bacterial purification of His-tagged LTA proteins using Ni-NTA Agarose (Qiagen) was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Purified proteins were dialyzed using a dialysis buffer (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 8.0, 10 μM pyridoxal 5-phosphate, and 1 mM dithiothreitol), diluted in 50% glycerol, quantified using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and stored at −80°C prior to use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantitative analyses of free amino acids and energy metabolites</title><p>Wild-type male flies were loaded on to standard cornmeal-yeast-agar food containing either 0 mM (control) or 50 mM threonine, and then entrained in LD cycles at 25°C for 4 days before harvest. Extracts were prepared from 100 fly heads per condition and the relative levels of free amino acids were measured using ion exchange chromatography as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sonn et al., 2018</xref>). For quantification of energy metabolites, fly heads were homogenized in 400 µl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was dried by vacuum centrifugation, and then reconstituted with 50 μL of 50% acetonitrile prior to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis using 1290 HPLC (Agilent), Qtrap 5500 (ABSciex), and a reverse phase column (Synergi fusion RP 50 × 2 mm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>Appropriate sample sizes were not determined by statistical computation but based on those reported in previous studies. For all the analyses, ‘n’ refers to the total number of biological replicates which were tested in more than two independent experiments, unless otherwise indicated in figure legends. For immunofluorescence assay, ‘n’ refers to the total number of brain hemispheres which were tested in 2–4 independent experiments. For cAMP imaging, ‘n’ refers to the total number of brains which were tested in 2–3 independent experiments. Individual flies were allocated into each group of biological replicates by their specific diet or genotype. Raw sleep data were collected non-blindly to the conditions but analyzed by an automated macro program. For immunofluorescence assay, GFP-positive neurons were scored in a way of double-blinded to the conditions. Short-term memory tests were performed blindly to the conditions. All the statistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc) as described in figure legends. F distributions with degrees of freedom were indicated by F[DFn, DFd]. All the <italic>P</italic> values from post hoc tests after one-way or two-way ANOVA were corrected for multiple comparisons. Violin plots present mean ± 95% confidence intervals and were generated using Python with the help of Seaborn library. Bar graphs indicate mean ± SEM and were generated using Excel.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank JM Han at Yonsei University College of Pharmacy for

to the issues raised during peer review. The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Threonine enhances sleep drive via a circadian clock-independent GABAergic pathway in for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has highlighted the concerns that require revision and/or responses, and we have included the separate reviews below for your consideration. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript from the Lim laboratory follows upon their recent work showing that serine modulates sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The focus here is on threonine, which appears to be sleep-promoting, likely through an effect on GABA signaling. The idea that metabolic factors are important regulators of sleep is gaining recognition, and this study is an interesting addition in that regard. As written though, this big picture view of the work does not come across until the end of the Discussion; laying it out earlier in the manuscript (e.g. Abstract and Introduction) would significantly boost the appeal of the work. From a scientific perspective, it would be good to have the mechanism nailed. This will require attention to the major points in each of the reviews below. Attending to these will likely involve experiments that will take about 2-3 months in addition to the time needed for re-writing parts of the manuscript.</p><p>Major concerns that require revision and/or responses.</p><p>These concerns derive from our consultation on the two reviews. They highlight specific points and need to be seen along with the two reviews.</p><p>1) The scope of the paper's title gets lost in detail. As pointed out in the summary above, the big overview needs to be linked to the core of every section of the Results.</p><p>2) The fundamental matter is that the authors have not nailed the mechanism. Ideally, they should show how GABA signaling is affected, but at the very least address the points made by the reviewers or satisfactorily exclude clock cells</p><p>3) The authors suggest that Threonine and GABA are competitive substrates. Yet, the results suggest that an explanation could be at the level of GABA synthesis presynaptically (Figure 4—figure supplement 6). This need to be better discussed.</p><p>4) Both reviewers have pointed out the need to connect neuronal CalExa signals with threonine to sleep in a robust way. For example, do GAD+ cells with increased CaLexA signal have anything to do with sleep? Although this may be much more difficult to show. (Are there known GAD+, sleep-relevant drivers the authors could use?)</p><p>5) The GAD-Gal4 shibire experiment is not making a persuasive point. Maybe it should be repeated? Please particularly note the points about rutabaga made by reviewer #1. Both reviewers feel that this is an important experimental point to address.</p><p>6) With regard to reviewer #2's point 3, our consultation agreed in the general principle that multiple alleles should be used for each gene, but if some of these genes fall into the same pathway and/or corroborate findings made in other ways (pharmacology), then this could be seen as mitigating,</p><p>To deal with potential developmental roles, it will be good to see at least one adult- specific manipulation and phenotype of GABA manipulation.</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors favor the idea that threonine acts through GABA signaling, pointing out that threonine and GABA and their metabolic derivatives are competitive substrates? For what-for the GABA receptor? This would explain why GABA-T mutants are unresponsive to threonine as they have high extracellular GABA, and would be consistent with the modest block produced by threonine in GABA action in an ex vivo preparation. However, how does this explain interactions of threonine with presynaptic GABA-CaLexa signals are increased in GAD neurons by threonine and blocking GAD neurons with shibire is stated to attenuate effects of threonine?</p><p>Does the CaLexa signal increase in non-GABA cells with threonine treatment? The manuscript shows specificity for threonine by using another amino acid as control (arginine), but what about specificity for GABAergic cells?</p><p>The blocking effect of GAD-GAL4 driven shibire on threonine action is questionable (Figure 4) as the threonine effect in controls in this experiment is even smaller than normal, and even normally it is not great. Is this really relevant (even if significant)?</p><p>The comparisons in Figure 4B are hard to follow. If the point is that threonine has no effects when GABA<sub>B</sub>-R1 is knocked down, then it should be shown that threonine increases sleep in the GAL4 alone control, but not in the knockdown, relative to the same genotypes not treated with threonine (from the data, it looks like threonine does increase sleep, probably significantly, in the knockout). Instead, control and knockdown are compared with each other, both in the presence of threonine. What this says is that knockdown of GABA<sub>B</sub>-R1 does not have any effect in threonine-treated flies, which is not the point (I think).</p><p>If the learning assay with rutabaga is to show that increased sleep (with threonine) rescues learning in rutabaga, then the authors should show that blocking the sleep increase (with deprivation) abrogates rescue. Otherwise, the direct effects of threonine on learning cannot be excluded.</p><p>Does threonine or the threonine-increasing mutant display any kind of metabolic phenotype, as does the GABAT mutant (Maguire et al., 2015)? Given that the underlying mechanisms are the same or overlapping, it is worth at least discussing this point.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>The authors use Student's t-test a lot, which is not ideal or stringent enough for most measurements.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Ki and Lim demonstrates sleep-promoting effects of dietary threonine (SPET) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The authors make several interesting claims regarding the mechanism of SPET: 1) decreased sleep latency in response to dietary threonine (Thr) does not require functional clock genes or pacemaker neurons; 2) GABA signaling through GABA<sub>B</sub>-R1 is involved in SPET; and 3) Thr activates a subset of GABAergic neurons, reduces GABA responsiveness of sleep-relevant R2 EB neurons, and rescues memory defects of rutabaga mutants; and 4) genetic manipulations that increase endogenous Thr levels enhance sleep. These are potentially interesting findings, but additional data are required to strengthen some of the claims.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) To demonstrate the relevance to GABA signaling for SPET, the authors show increased CaLexA signal in response to Thr in neurons lateral to the antennal lobe, which they call LNs. However, they do not show that these neurons have any role in sleep. Nor do they show any increase in CaLexA signal in known sleep centers in response to Thr.</p><p>2) The authors claim that a slightly reduced GABA response to Thr in R2 EB neurons implies that threonine-induced behavioral quiescence is physiologically relevant to sleep. However, it is unclear whether the effect is sufficient to contribute significantly to SPET. Does R2 EB specific knockdown of GABA<sub>B</sub>-R1 affect SPET?</p><p>3) The involvement of GABA-T in SPET is supported by a single allelic combination (hypomorph over deficiency) and that of GABA<sub>B</sub>-R1 is based on a single RNAi construct. The involvement of <italic>CG5955</italic> is based on one allelic combination and one RNAi. To show that a gene is involved in a process, it is important to provide converging evidence from multiple sources: e.g., multiple mutant alleles or allelic combinations, multiple RNAi constructs to minimize the potential off-target effects, and rescue with transgene expression.</p><p>4) Potential developmental defects could be a confounding factor for the effects of GABA-T, GABA<sub>B</sub>-R1, and <italic>CG5955</italic> on SPET. Adult specific knockdown or developmental rescue could alleviate the concern.</p><p>5) The data behind the claim that <italic>Rdl</italic> and PDF neurons are not involved in SPET are not compelling. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, <italic>Rdl</italic> MMDR/1 mutants seem to have reduced SPET (i.e., the difference between – and + Thr is smaller in mutants than het controls). If the reduction is not statistically significant, it may be due to the unusually large error bar in one of the conditions. Additional data may provide a clearer picture.</p><p>A related concern is that without Thr, sleep latency is not reduced in <italic>Rdl</italic> MMDR/1 mutants relative heterozygous controls (B), as would be expected based on previous reports. Similarly, without Thr, PDF and CRY neuron silencing does not lead to sleep latency reduction (C). These unexpected features of the data raise concerns about the validity of the rest of the data.</p><p>6) Rescue of memory defects in rut mutants by Thr is interesting. However, it would strengthen the conclusion if additional memory mutants were tested. Please see reviewer 1 's points on this,</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) It is unclear how the effects of Thr vary as a function of time-of-day. It would be informative to show these data in a format where sleep amount per 30min or 1h is plotted as a function of time of day.</p><p>2) To further examine the clock- and light-dependence of SPET, it would be helpful to repeat the basic +/- Thr experiments in DD and LL.</p><p>3) As the authors note, GABA-T effects on SPET could be due to a floor effect. Although pharmacological data somewhat alleviate this concern, a genetic demonstration (using hypomorphs?) would strengthen the claim.</p><p>4) In Figure 1A and related figures, it is unclear whether p values were corrected for multiple comparisons.</p><p>5) Figure 1—figure supplement 3. In this and other similar figures, to determine whether SPET is affected by an experimental manipulation (in this case, silencing of gustatory or olfactory neurons), it is important to test whether the difference between + and – Thr is different across the three genotypes.</p><p>6) Discussion section: &quot;…SPET facilitates sleep onset in a manner independent of light&quot;. Where are the data for light-independence of SPET?</p><p>7) Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B. Some of the error bars are so big that it is difficult to believe the differences are significant at p&lt;0.001 as indicated. In these situations, standard ANOVAs that assume equal variance across conditions are not appropriate.</p><p>8) In Figure 3A, the CaLexA signal for LNs is not symmetric. Is this common?</p><p>9) Figure 4B is formatted differently from all other figures. Why?</p><p>10). Some of the N's for behavioral experiments are as low as 8. This seems too low.</p><p>11) SEM, which takes into account N's, would more informative than SD.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>As noted in the minor point #7, some of the statistics do not seem appropriate.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40593.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns that require revision and/or responses.</p><p>These concerns derive from our consultation on the two reviews.

First, SPET was detectable even in constant light (LL) where wild-type flies lose circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles (Figure 2C and D; Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Second, a genetic loss of <italic>per</italic> or <italic>Clk</italic> shortened or lengthened sleep latency, respectively, in LD cycles (Liu et al., 2014) while these arrhythmic clock mutants displayed SPET robustly (Figure 2A). Third, PDF neuron-specific overexpression of dominant-negative CLK proteins lengthened sleep latency (Liu et al., 2014) whereas the loss of molecular clocks in PDF neurons did not compromise SPET (Figure 2B).</p><p>We further showed that transgenic depletion of metabotropic GABA receptors in R2 EB neurons promoted sleep non-additively with SPET (Figure 5C). Given that dietary threonine reduced metabotropic GABA responses in R2 EB neurons, these results support that SPET may involve the down-regulation of metabotropic GABA transmission in this specific neural locus for generating homeostatic sleep drive. Please see our point-by-point responses to additional points made by each reviewer below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors suggest that Threonine and GABA are competitive substrates.

While this could be a compensatory decrease, additional lines of our evidence indicated that suppression of the metabotropic GABA transmission indeed induced SPET-like sleep phenotypes in control-fed flies and displayed non-additive effects with SPET in threonine-fed flies (please see our responses to the reviewer comment #1-1 and the reviewer #2, major point #2 below).

While our pharmacological manipulations of GABA transmission independently confirmed the genetic evidence, oral administration of GABA-relevant inhibitors and agonists to adult flies also excluded the possible developmental effects of GABA manipulations. These adult-specific, pharmacological manipulations of GABA transmission included 1) GABA-T inhibitor (Figure 3B), 2) GABA transporter inhibitor (Figure 3B), and 3) agonists of ionotropic or metabotropic GABA receptors (Figure 4D). We further showed that a conditional blockade of synaptic transmission from adult neurons expressing GAD1 impaired SPET, supporting adult-specific effects of the transgenic GABA manipulation on SPET (Figure 4B).

As the reviewer suggested above, they may similarly act as competitive ligands for GABA receptors (i.e., metabotropic GABA receptors, in particular), explaining weaker GABA responses in R2 EB neurons of threonine-fed flies than those in control.</p><p>In our revised manuscript, we further found that threonine-fed flies displayed low levels of GABA and glutamate compared to those in control-fed flies (Figure 4A). Although this could be a compensatory decrease, a simple hypothesis would be that dietary threonine limits the total flux of GABA/glutamate/glutamine cycle possibly through substrate competition, decreases the size of available GABA pool, and thereby down-scales GABA transmission for SPET. This model is consistent with our observations that genetic suppression of GABA transmission by the conditional blockade of synaptic transmission in GAD1-expressing neurons or by the transgenic depletion of metabotropic GABA receptors in R2 EB neurons drives sleep in control-fed flies (i.e., mimics SPET in control-fed flies) and displays non-additive effects with SPET in threonine-fed flies. By contrast, high levels of extracellular GABA (e.g., <italic>GABA-T</italic> mutants or EOS/NipA-fed flies) or pharmacological enhancement of the metabotropic GABA transmission (e.g., oral administration of the GABA-B receptor agonist) may interfere with this process, thereby conferring the resistance to SPET.</p><p>Given this revised model, we reason that some group of GAD1 neurons (i.e., LN) may express presynaptic GABA receptors to suppress their own GABA transmission via a negative feedback. Threonine diet could then de-repress the auto-inhibitory GABA transmission, elevating the CaLexA signals selectively in those GAD1 neurons. Accordingly, we revised our Results and Discussion to clarify this model and better interpret our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does the CaLexa signal increase in non-GABA cells with threonine treatment?

We confirmed that overexpression of the temperature-sensitive shibire in GAD1-expressing neurons induced sleep in control-fed condition and masked SPET only at restrictive temperature. We also noted that low (i.e., permissive) temperature delayed SPET even in heterozygous controls, explaining smaller SPET in our original data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The comparisons in Figure 4B are hard to follow. If the point is that threonine has no effects when GABA<sub>B</sub>-R1 is knocked down, then it should be shown that threonine increases sleep in the GAL4 alone control, but not in the knockdown, relative to the same genotypes not treated with threonine (from the data, it looks like threonine does increase sleep, probably significantly, in the knockout). Instead, control and knockdown are compared with each other, both in the presence of threonine. What this says is that knockdown of GABA<sub>B</sub>-R1 does not have any effect in threonine-treated flies, which is not the point (I think).</p></disp-quote><p>We thought that the comparisons in the original Figure 4B would better visualize the effects of neuronal GABA<sub>B</sub>-R1 depletion on SPET among other genotypes.

Accordingly, we presented all our behavioral data in the same format in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the learning assay with rutabaga is to show that increased sleep (with threonine) rescues learning in rutabaga, then the authors should show that blocking the sleep increase (with deprivation) abrogates rescue.

By contrast, caffeine alone did not significantly affect short-term memory in control and <italic>dumb</italic> mutants under our experimental condition. These data thus support that dietary threonine rescues memory mutants in a sleep-dependent manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does threonine or the threonine-increasing mutant display any kind of metabolic phenotype, as does the GABAT mutant (Maguire et al., 2015)?

Threonine diet lowered GABA and glutamate levels, but it did not significantly affect ATP levels or the ratio of NAD+ to NADH (Figure 4A and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). While dietary glutamate rescued metabolic phenotypes in <italic>GABA-T</italic> mutants (Maguire et al., 2015), it affected neither long sleep in <italic>GABA-T</italic> mutants (Maguire et al., 2015) nor SPET (Figure 4—figure supplement 3), indicating that low glutamate levels do not explain either sleep phenotypes. Accordingly, we compared and discussed these metabolic phenotypes in <italic>GABA-T</italic> mutants and threonine-fed flies in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>The authors use Student's t-test a lot, which is not ideal or stringent enough for most measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>Wherever possible, we avoided Student’s t-test to increase the stringency for our statistical analyses in the revised manuscript.

The authors make several interesting claims regarding the mechanism of SPET: 1) decreased sleep latency in response to dietary threonine (Thr) does not require functional clock genes or pacemaker neurons; 2) GABA signaling through GABA<sub>B</sub>-R1 is involved in SPET; and 3) Thr activates a subset of GABAergic neurons, reduces GABA responsiveness of sleep-relevant R2 EB neurons, and rescues memory defects of rutabaga mutants; and 4) genetic manipulations that increase endogenous Thr levels enhance sleep. These are potentially interesting findings, but additional data are required to strengthen some of the claims.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) To demonstrate the relevance to GABA signaling for SPET, the authors show increased CaLexA signal in response to Thr in neurons lateral to the antennal lobe, which they call LNs. However, they do not show that these neurons have any role in sleep. Nor do they show any increase in CaLexA signal in known sleep centers in response to Thr.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in our response to the reviewer comment #1-1 above, we did not see any detectable increase in the CaLexA signals from sleep-regulatory mushroom body or dopaminergic neurons upon threonine diet (Figure 4—figure supplement 4D and E). Although the sensitivity of CaLexA may intrinsically limit the detectable size and duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in our experiment, these results support the relative specificity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in LN to the threonine diet. Lack of a specific Gal4 driver that targets these LN only, however, did not allow us to validate that these effects were necessary for SPET. Nonetheless, it led us to find that a conditional blockade of synaptic transmission in GAD1-expressing neurons, including LN, actually induced sleep in control-fed flies, and masked SPET in threonine-fed flies. Given our revised model for the implication of GABA transmission in SPET, we toned down our conclusion from the CaLexA experiment and discussed a possible explanation for the CaLexA phenotypes in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors claim that a slightly reduced GABA response to Thr in R2 EB neurons implies that threonine-induced behavioral quiescence is physiologically relevant to sleep. However, it is unclear whether the effect is sufficient to contribute significantly to SPET. Does R2 EB specific knockdown of GABA<sub>B</sub>-R1 affect SPET?</p></disp-quote><p>In our revised manuscript, we tested several RNAi transgenes to individually deplete metabotropic GABA receptors in R2 EB neurons and examined their effects on SPET. Depletion of GABAB-R2 or GABAB-R3 in R2 EB neurons indeed enhanced sleep drive non-additively with SPET (Figure 5C). This contrasted with our observations that genetic elevation of GABA levels or pharmacological enhancement of the metabotropic GABA transmission suppressed SPET, but it did not comparably affect sleep drive in control-fed flies (Figure 3A and Figure 4D). Considering our additional finding that dietary threonine reduces GABA levels, we revised our model for SPET and proposed that 1) sleep drive by low metabotropic GABA transmission in R2 EB neurons may mediate SPET, and 2) genetic/pharmacological elevation of the GABA transmission may interfere with this process, thereby masking SPET. We revised our manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The involvement of GABA-T in SPET is supported by a single allelic combination (hypomorph over deficiency) and that of GABA<sub>B</sub>-R1 is based on a single RNAi construct. The involvement of CG5955 is based on one allelic combination and one RNAi. To show that a gene is involved in a process, it is important to provide converging evidence from multiple sources: e.g., multiple mutant alleles or allelic combinations, multiple RNAi constructs to minimize the potential off-target effects, and rescue with transgene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested, we provided converging evidence from multiple sources in the revised manuscript. These included 1) multiple allelic combinations (<italic>GABA-T, CG5955</italic>), 2) transgenic rescue (<italic>GABA-T</italic>), 3) multiple RNAi transgenes (metabotropic GABA receptors, <italic>CG5955</italic>), and 4) adult-specific, pharmacological manipulations of target gene function (<italic>GABA-T</italic>, GABA transporter, GABA receptors) to exclude any development effects on SPET.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Potential developmental defects could be a confounding factor for the effects of GABA-T, GABA<sub>B</sub>-R1, and CG5955 on SPET. Adult specific knockdown or developmental rescue could alleviate the concern.</p></disp-quote><p>We have been testing adult-specific knockdown or developmental rescue using tubGal80ts. Unfortunately, heterozygous controls of the key UAS transgenes (e.g., UAS-GABA-T, UAS-GABA receptor RNAi) displayed Gal4-independent effects on the genetic rescue or SPET at high temperature. Although it was likely due to their leaky expression, this limited our experimental conditions to genetically validate the developmental defects. Nonetheless, we provided a series of compelling evidence that supports adult-specific effects of GABA manipulations on SPET. First, adult-specific administration of GABA-T inhibitor or GABA transporter inhibitor potently suppressed SPET (Figure 3B). Second, an adult-specific blockade of synaptic transmission in GAD1-expressing cells induced sleep drive non-additively with SPET (Figure 4B). Third, adult-specific administration of the agonist of metabotropic GABA receptors, but not of ionotropic GABA receptors, suppressed SPET (Figure 4D). Regarding CG5955, we could not fully exclude the possibility of metabolic compensation or developmental effects using transgenic reagents available to us. So, we toned down our conclusion and stated these possibilities in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The data behind the claim that Rdl and PDF neurons are not involved in SPET are not compelling. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, Rdl MMDR/1 mutants seem to have reduced SPET (i.e., the difference between – and + Thr is smaller in mutants than het controls). If the reduction is not statistically significant, it may be due to the unusually large error bar in one of the conditions. Additional data may provide a clearer picture.</p><p>A related concern is that without Thr, sleep latency is not reduced in Rdl MMDR/1 mutants relative heterozygous controls (B), as would be expected based on previous reports. Similarly, without Thr, PDF and CRY neuron silencing does not lead to sleep latency reduction (C). These unexpected features of the data raise concerns about the validity of the rest of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>In our original manuscript, we examined sleep behaviors in male trans-heterozygous mutants of <italic>Rdl</italic> and could not observe their short sleep latency compared to heterozygous controls in control-fed condition.

Consistent with the previous finding, female <italic>Rdl</italic> MMDR/1 mutants displayed shorter sleep latency than their heterozygous controls in control-fed condition (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We further observed comparable SPET between <italic>Rdl</italic> mutants and their heterozygous controls (<italic>P</italic>=0.1381 for sleep amount; <italic>P</italic>=0.2881 for sleep latency by two-way ANOVA). These data indicate that loss of <italic>Rdl</italic> function does not impair SPET.</p><p>Regarding the transgenic manipulations of circadian pacemaker neurons, we tested male transgenic flies in our original manuscript and could not detect any phenotype in their sleep latency. As the reviewer mentioned above, these data were not consistent with previous observations in female flies that have suggested the wake-promoting role of PDF-expressing neurons (Parisky et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2014). Accordingly, we examined SPET in female transgenic flies that have been validated for clock-dependent control of sleep latency in PDF neurons. Consistent with the published result (Liu et al., 2014), we found that overexpression of dominant-negative CLOCK proteins only in PDF neurons was sufficient to lengthen sleep latency in female flies fed control food (Figure 2B). The loss of molecular clocks in PDF neurons did not compromise SPET on the sleep amount as well as sleep latency. These new pieces of our genetic evidence more convincingly demonstrate that SPET requires neither <italic>Rdl</italic>- nor PDF clock-dependent control of sleep drive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Rescue of memory defects in rut mutants by Thr is interesting.

In our revised manuscript, we showed that SPET was also detectable in LL or DD (Figure 2C and D, Figure 2—figure supplement 2).
