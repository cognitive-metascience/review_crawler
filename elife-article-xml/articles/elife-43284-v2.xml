pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43284.001</object-id><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent signaling pathways from chloroplasts and mitochondria merge at the nuclear protein RADICAL-INDUCED CELL DEATH1 (RCD1). RCD1 interacts in vivo and suppresses the activity of the transcription factors ANAC013 and ANAC017, which mediate a ROS-related retrograde signal originating from mitochondrial complex III. Inactivation of <italic>RCD1</italic> leads to increased expression of mitochondrial dysfunction stimulon (MDS) genes regulated by ANAC013 and ANAC017. Accumulating MDS gene products, including alternative oxidases (AOXs), affect redox status of the chloroplasts, leading to changes in chloroplast ROS processing and increased protection of photosynthetic apparatus. ROS alter the abundance, thiol redox state and oligomerization of the RCD1 protein in vivo, providing feedback control on its function. RCD1-dependent regulation is linked to chloroplast signaling by 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP). Thus, RCD1 integrates organellar signaling from chloroplasts and mitochondria to establish transcriptional control over the metabolic processes in both organelles.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43284.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most plant cells contain two types of compartments, the mitochondria and the chloroplasts, which work together to supply the chemical energy required by life processes. Genes located in another part of the cell, the nucleus, encode for the majority of the proteins found in these compartments.</p><p>At any given time, the mitochondria and the chloroplasts send specific, ‘retrograde’ signals to the nucleus to turn on or off the genes they need. For example, mitochondria produce molecules known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) if they are having problems generating energy. These molecules activate several regulatory proteins that move into the nucleus and switch on MDS genes, a set of genes which helps to repair the mitochondria. Chloroplasts also produce ROS that can act as retrograde signals. It is still unclear how the nucleus integrates signals from both chloroplasts and mitochondria to ‘decide’ which genes to switch on, but a protein called RCD1 may play a role in this process. Indeed, previous studies have found that Arabidopsis plants that lack RCD1 have defects in both their mitochondria and chloroplasts. In these mutant plants, the MDS genes are constantly active and the chloroplasts have problems making ROS.</p><p>To investigate this further, Shapiguzov, Vainonen et al. use biochemical and genetic approaches to study RCD1 in Arabidopsis. The experiments confirm that this protein allows a dialog to take place between the retrograde signals of both mitochondria and chloroplasts. On one hand, RCD1 binds to and inhibits the regulatory proteins that usually activate the MDS genes under the control of mitochondria. This explains why, in the absence of RCD1, the MDS genes are always active, which is ultimately disturbing how these compartments work.</p><p>On the other hand, RCD1 is also found to be sensitive to the ROS that chloroplasts produce. This means that chloroplasts may be able to affect when mitochondria generate energy by regulating the protein. Finally, further experiments show that MDS genes can affect both mitochondria and chloroplasts: by influencing how these genes are regulated, RCD1 therefore acts on the two types of compartments.</p><p>Overall, the work by Shapiguzov, Vainonen et al. describes a new way Arabidopsis coordinates its mitochondria and chloroplasts. Further studies will improve our understanding of how plants regulate these compartments in different environments to produce the energy they need. In practice, this may also help plant breeders create new varieties of crops that produce energy more efficiently and which better resist to stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group

eukaryotes are unique in harboring two types of energy organelles, the chloroplasts and the mitochondria, which interact at an operational level by the exchange of metabolites, energy and reducing power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Noguchi and Yoshida, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cardol et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bailleul et al., 2015</xref>). Reducing power flows between the organelles through several pathways, including photorespiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Watanabe et al., 2016</xref>), malate shuttles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Scheibe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>) and transport of photoassimilate-derived carbon rich metabolites from chloroplasts to mitochondria. At the signaling level, the so-called retrograde signaling pathways originating from the organelles influence the expression of nuclear genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Souza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Leister, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Waszczak et al., 2018</xref>). These pathways provide feedback communication between the organelles and the gene expression apparatus in the nucleus to adjust expression of genes encoding organelle components in accordance with changes in the developmental stage or environmental conditions.</p><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS), inevitable by-products of aerobic energy metabolism, play pivotal roles in plant organellar signaling from both chloroplasts and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dietz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Noctor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Waszczak et al., 2018</xref>). Superoxide anion radical (O<sub>2</sub><bold>˙ <sup>–</sup></bold>) is formed in the organelles by the transfer of electrons from the organellar electron transfer chains (ETCs) to molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). In illuminated chloroplasts, superoxide anion formed from O<sub>2</sub> reduction by Photosystem I (PSI) is converted to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) which is further reduced to water by chloroplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-scavenging systems during the water-water cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asada, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Awad et al., 2015</xref>). Chloroplastic ROS production can be enhanced by application of methyl viologen (MV), a chemical that catalyzes shuttling of electrons from PSI to O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Farrington et al., 1973</xref>). The immediate product of this reaction, O<sub>2</sub><bold>˙ <sup>–</sup></bold>, is not likely to directly mediate organellar signaling; however, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is involved in many retrograde signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Leister, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mullineaux et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Waszczak et al., 2018</xref>). Organellar H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been suggested to translocate directly to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caplan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Exposito-Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>), where it can oxidize thiol groups of specific proteins, thereby converting the ROS signal into thiol redox signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Møller and Kristensen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nietzel et al., 2017</xref>). One recently discovered process affected by chloroplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is the metabolism of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP). PAP is a toxic by-product of sulfate metabolism produced when cytoplasmic sulfotransferases (SOTs, e.g., SOT12) transfer a sulfuryl group from PAP-sulfate (PAPS) to various target compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Klein and Papenbrock, 2004</xref>). PAP is transported to chloroplasts where it is detoxiﬁed by dephosphorylation to adenosine monophosphate in a reaction catalyzed by the adenosine bisphosphate phosphatase 1, SAL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Quintero et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 2016</xref>). It has been proposed that oxidation of SAL1 thiols directly or indirectly dependent on chloroplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> inactivates the enzyme, and accumulating PAP may act as a retrograde signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Estavillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crisp et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>ROS are also produced in the mitochondria, for example by complex III at the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cvetkovska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Blocking electron transfer through complex III by application of the inhibitors antimycin A (AA) or myxothiazol (myx) enhances electron leakage and thus induces the retrograde signal. Two known mediators of this signal are the transcription factors ANAC013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Clercq et al., 2013</xref>) and ANAC017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ng et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Van Aken et al., 2016b</xref>) that are both bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a transmembrane domain. Mitochondria-derived signals lead to proteolytic cleavage of this domain. The proteins are released from the ER and translocated to the nucleus where they activate the mitochondrial dysfunction stimulon (MDS) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Clercq et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Van Aken et al., 2016a</xref>). MDS genes include the mitochondrial alternative oxidases (<italic>AOXs</italic>), <italic>SOT12</italic>, and <italic>ANAC013</italic> itself, which provides positive feedback regulation and thus enhancement of the signal.</p><p>Whereas multiple retrograde signaling pathways have been described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Souza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Leister, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Waszczak et al., 2018</xref>), it is still largely unknown how the numerous chloroplast- and mitochondria-derived signals are integrated and processed by the nuclear gene expression system. Nuclear cyclin-dependent kinase E is implicated in the expression of both chloroplastic (<italic>LHCB2.4</italic>) and mitochondrial (<italic>AOX1a</italic>) components in response to perturbations of chloroplast ETC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blanco et al., 2014</xref>), mitochondrial ETC, or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ng et al., 2013a</xref>). The transcription factor ABI4 is also suggested to respond to retrograde signals from both organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Giraud et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blanco et al., 2014</xref>), although its significance in chloroplast signaling has recently been disputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kacprzak et al., 2019</xref>). Mitochondrial signaling <italic>via</italic> ANAC017 was recently suggested to converge with chloroplast PAP signaling based on similarities in their transcriptomic profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Van Aken and Pogson, 2017</xref>). However, the mechanistic details underlying this convergence remain currently unknown.</p><p>Arabidopsis RADICAL-INDUCED CELL DEATH1 (RCD1) is a nuclear protein containing a WWE, a PARP-like [poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-like], and a C-terminal RST domain (<underline>R</underline>CD1-<underline>S</underline>RO1-<underline>T</underline>AF4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Overmyer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahlfors et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jaspers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jaspers et al., 2010a</xref>). In yeast two-hybrid studies RCD1 interacted with several transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jaspers et al., 2009</xref>) including ANAC013, DREB2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Vainonen et al., 2012</xref>), and Rap2.4a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hiltscher et al., 2014</xref>) <italic>via</italic> the RST domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jaspers et al., 2010b</xref>), and with the sodium transporter SOS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Katiyar-Agarwal et al., 2006</xref>). In agreement with the numerous potential interaction partners of RCD1, the <italic>rcd1</italic> mutant demonstrates pleiotropic phenotypes in diverse stress and developmental responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jaspers et al., 2009</xref>). It has been identified in screens for sensitivity to ozone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Overmyer et al., 2000</xref>), tolerance to MV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fujibe et al., 2004</xref>) and redox imbalance in the chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heiber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hiltscher et al., 2014</xref>). RCD1 was found to complement the deficiency of the redox sensor YAP1 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belles-Boix et al., 2000</xref>). Under standard growth conditions, the <italic>rcd1</italic> mutant displays differential expression of over 400 genes, including those encoding mitochondrial AOXs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jaspers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brosché et al., 2014</xref>) and the chloroplast 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (2-CP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heiber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hiltscher et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here we have addressed the role of RCD1 in the integration of ROS signals emitted by both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Abundance, redox status and oligomerization state of the nuclear-localized RCD1 protein changed in response to ROS generated in the chloroplasts. Furthermore, RCD1 directly interacted in vivo with ANAC013 and ANAC017 and appeared to function as a negative regulator of both transcription factors. The RST domain, mediating RCD1 interaction with ANAC transcription factors, was required for plant sensitivity to chloroplastic ROS. We demonstrate that RCD1 is a molecular component that integrates organellar signal input from both chloroplasts and mitochondria to exert its influence on nuclear gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The response to chloroplastic ROS is compromised in <italic>rcd1</italic></title><p>Methyl viologen (MV) enhances ROS generation in illuminated chloroplasts by catalyzing the transfer of electrons from Photosystem I (PSI) to molecular oxygen.

To reveal the significance of nuclear protein RCD1 in these reactions, rosettes of Arabidopsis were pre-treated with MV in darkness.

Treatment with MV led to similar changes in kinetics of PSI oxidation in Col-0 and <italic>rcd1</italic>. Oxidation of PSI reaction center (P700) was measured using DUAL-PAM. Leaves were first adapted to far-red light that is more efficiently used by PSI than PSII. In these conditions PSI is producing electrons at a faster rate than they are supplied by PSII, thus P700 is oxidized. Then a flash of orange light was provided that is efficiently absorbed by PSII (orange arrow). Electrons generated by PSII transiently reduced PSI, after which the kinetics of PSI re-oxidation was followed. Note the progressive decrease in the effect of the orange flash occurring in Col-0 at later time points, which suggests deterioration in PSII function. This was not observed in <italic>rcd1</italic>. Three leaves from three individual plants were used for each measurement. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results.

However, in Col-0 it coincided with progressive destabilization of PSII complex with its light-harvesting antennae (LHCII) and accumulation of PSII monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). No signs of PSI inhibition were evident either in DUAL-PAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or in PSI immunoblotting assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>) in either genotype. The fact that production of ROS affected PSII, but not PSI where these ROS are formed, suggests that PSII inhibition results from a regulated mechanism rather than uncontrolled oxidation by ROS, and that this mechanism requires the activity of RCD1.</p><p>Previous studies have described <italic>rcd1</italic> as a mutant with altered ROS metabolism and redox status of the chloroplasts, although the underlying mechanisms are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fujibe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heiber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hiltscher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cui et al., 2019</xref>).

None of these showed significantly altered abundance in <italic>rcd1</italic> compared to Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>).

Finally, the redox status of chloroplast thiol redox enzymes was addressed. The chloroplast stroma-localized 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (2-CP) is an abundant enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">König et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Peltier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Liebthal et al., 2018</xref>) that was recently found to link chloroplast thiol redox system to ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ojeda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Vaseghi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Yoshida et al., 2018</xref>). The level of the 2-CP protein was unchanged in <italic>rcd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). However, when protein extracts were subjected to thiol bond-specific labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Nikkanen et al., 2016</xref>) as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, most 2-CP was reduced in <italic>rcd1</italic> both in darkness and in light, while in Col-0 the larger fraction of 2-CP was present as oxidized forms. Thus, RCD1 is likely involved in the regulation of the redox status of chloroplastic thiol enzymes.</p><p>Taken together, the results hinted that the mechanisms by which RCD1 regulates chloroplastic redox status are independent of the photosynthetic ETC, or steady-state levels and distribution of nucleotide electron carriers. However, they appear to be associated with changed thiol redox state of chloroplast enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RCD1 protein is sensitive to ROS</title><p>It was next tested whether the nuclear RCD1 protein could itself be sensitive to ROS, thus accounting for the observed alterations. For that, an RCD1-HA complementation line was used (line ‘<italic>a</italic>’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). No changes were detected in RCD1-HA abundance during 5 hr amid the standard growth light period, or during 5 hr high light treatment. On the other hand, both MV and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatments led to a gradual decrease in RCD1 abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When plant extracts from these experiments were separated in non-reducing SDS-PAGE, the RCD1-HA signal resolved into species of different molecular weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Under standard growth conditions or high light, most RCD1-HA formed a reduced monomer. In contrast, treatment with MV under light or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulted in fast conversion of RCD1-HA monomers into high-molecular-weight aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Importantly, MV-induced redox changes in RCD1-HA only occurred in light, but not in darkness, suggesting that the changes were mediated by increased chloroplastic ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To test whether oligomerization of RCD1 was thiol-regulated, a variant of RCD1-HA was generated where seven cysteines in the linkers between the RCD1 domains were substituted by alanines (RCD1Δ7Cys; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The treatments of <italic>rcd1</italic>: RCD1Δ7Cys-HA plants with MV or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> led to significantly less aggregation of RCD1Δ7Cys-HA compared to RCD1-HA. In addition, the levels of RCD1Δ7Cys-HA were insensitive to MV or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In three independent complementation lines the RCD1Δ7Cys-HA variant accumulated to higher levels compared to RCD1-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This suggests the involvement of the tested RCD1 cysteine residues in the regulation of the protein oligomerization and stability in vivo. However, the tolerance of the RCD1Δ7Cys-HA lines to chloroplastic ROS and the expression of the selected RCD1-regulated genes in response to MV treatment were comparable to that of the RCD1-HA lines or Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). These results suggest that the RCD1 protein is sensitive to chloroplastic ROS. However, the changes in RCD1 abundance and redox state did not explain the RCD1-dependent redox alterations observed in the chloroplasts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43284.010</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>RCD1 protein is sensitive to chloroplastic ROS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The <italic>rcd1</italic>: RCD1-HA complementation line was used to assess RCD1-HA abundance.

This again indicated that the studied phenotypes of <italic>rcd1</italic> are associated with the induction of more than one AOX isoform. Taken together, the results suggested that inactivation of <italic>RCD1</italic> led to increased expression and activity of AOX isoforms, which could contribute to the observed changes in energy metabolism of <italic>rcd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mitochondrial AOXs affect ROS processing in the chloroplasts</title><p>Inhibition of complex III by antimycin A (AA) or myxothiazol (myx) activates mitochondrial retrograde signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

To test whether accumulation of AOXs contributed to PSII protection from chloroplastic ROS or merely correlated with it, the AOX inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) was used.

This communication network also affects gene expression in the nucleus where numerous signals are perceived and integrated. However, the molecular mechanisms of the coordinated action of the two energy organelles in response to environmental cues are only poorly understood.

The existence of such an inter-organellar regulatory system, integrating mitochondrial ANAC013 and ANAC017-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Clercq et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ng et al., 2013b</xref>) with the PAP-mediated chloroplastic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Estavillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crisp et al., 2018</xref>) has been previously proposed on the basis of transcriptomic analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Van Aken and Pogson, 2017</xref>). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remained unknown. Based on our results we propose that RCD1 may function at the intersection of mitochondrial and chloroplast signaling pathways and act as a nuclear integrator of both PAP and ANAC013 and ANAC017-mediated retrograde signals.</p><p>RCD1 has been proposed to act as a transcriptional co-regulator because of its interaction with many transcription factors in yeast two-hybrid analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jaspers et al., 2009</xref>). The in vivo interaction of RCD1 with ANAC013 and ANAC017 revealed in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) suggests that RCD1 modulates expression of the MDS, a set of ANAC013/ANAC017 activated nuclear genes mostly encoding mitochondrial components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Clercq et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>ANAC013</italic> itself is an MDS gene, thus mitochondrial signaling through ANAC013/ANAC017 establishes a self-amplifying loop. Transcriptomic and physiological data support the role of RCD1 as a negative regulator of these transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Thus, RCD1 is likely involved in the negative regulation of the ANAC013/ANAC017 self-amplifying loop and in downregulating the expression of MDS genes after their induction.</p><p>Induction of genes in response to stress is commonly associated with rapid inactivation of a negative co-regulator. Accordingly, the RCD1 protein was sensitive to treatments triggering or mimicking chloroplastic ROS production. MV and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment of plants resulted in rapid oligomerization of RCD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Involvement of chloroplasts is indicated by the fact that MV treatment led to redox changes of RCD1-HA only in light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In addition, little change was observed with the mitochondrial complex III inhibitors AA or myx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Together with the fact that MDS induction was not compromised in the <italic>rcd1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), this suggests that RCD1 may primarily function as a redox sensor of chloroplastic, rather than mitochondrial, ROS/redox signaling. In addition to fast redox changes, the overall level of RCD1 gradually decreased during prolonged (5 hr) stress treatments. This suggests several independent modes of RCD1 regulation at the protein level.</p><p>The complicated post-translational regulation of RCD1 is reminiscent of another prominent transcriptional co-regulator protein NONEXPRESSER OF PR GENES 1 (NPR1). NPR1 exists as a high molecular weight oligomer stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bonds between conserved cysteine residues. Accumulation of salicylic acid and cellular redox changes lead to the reduction of cysteines and release of NPR1 monomers that translocate to the nucleus and activate expression of defense genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kinkema et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mou et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Withers and Dong, 2016</xref>). Similar to NPR1, RCD1 has a bipartite nuclear localization signal and, in addition, a putative nuclear export signal between the WWE and PARP-like domains. Like NPR1, RCD1 has several conserved cysteine residues. Interestingly, mutation of seven interdomain cysteines in RCD1 largely eliminated the fast in vivo effect of chloroplastic ROS on redox state and stability of RCD1; however, it did not significantly alter the plant response to MV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). This suggests that redox-dependent oligomerization of RCD1 may serve to fine-tune its activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>MDS genes are involved in interactions between the organelles</title><p>How the RCD1-dependent induction of MDS genes contributes to the energetic and signaling landscape of the plant cell remains to be investigated. Our results suggest that one component of this adaptation is the activity of mitochondrial alternative oxidases, which are part of the MDS regulon. Consequently, AOX proteins accumulate at higher amounts in <italic>rcd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Pretreatment of wild type plants with complex III inhibitors AA or myx led to elevated AOX abundance coinciding with increased tolerance to chloroplastic ROS. Moreover, the AOX inhibitor SHAM made plants more sensitive to MV, indicating the direct involvement of AOX activity in the chloroplastic ROS processing. It thus appears that AOXs in the mitochondria form an electron sink that indirectly contributes to the oxidization of the electron acceptor side of PSI. In the <italic>rcd1</italic> mutant, this mechanism may be continuously active. The described inter-organellar electron transfer may decrease production of ROS by PSI (asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Furthermore, chloroplastic ROS are considered the main electron sink for oxidation of chloroplast thiol enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ojeda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Vaseghi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Yoshida et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the redox status of these enzymes could depend on the proposed inter-organellar pathway. This is in line with higher reduction of the chloroplast enzymes 2-CP and NADPH-MDH observed in <italic>rcd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43284.043</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical role of RCD1 in organelle signaling and energy metabolism.</title><p>RCD1 is the direct suppressor of ANAC transcription factors that is itself subject to redox regulation.

Altered levels of malate and increased activity of NADPH-dependent malate dehydrogenase in <italic>rcd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) suggest that in this mutant the malate shuttle could act as an inter-organellar electron carrier.</p><p>Another MDS gene with more abundant mRNA levels in the <italic>rcd1</italic> mutant encodes sulfotransferase SOT12, an enzyme involved in PAP metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Klein and Papenbrock, 2004</xref>). Accordingly, SOT12 protein level was significantly increased in the <italic>rcd1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Accumulation of SOT12 and similarities between transcript profiles of RCD1- and PAP-regulated genes suggest that PAP signaling is likely to be constitutively active in the <italic>rcd1</italic> mutant. Unbalancing this signaling by elimination of SAL1 leads to severe developmental defects, as evidenced by the stunted phenotype of the <italic>rcd1 sal1</italic> double mutant. Thus, the RCD1 and the PAP signaling pathways appear to be overlapping and somewhat complementary, but the exact molecular mechanisms remain to be explored.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>RCD1 regulates stress responses and cell fate</title><p>The MDS genes represent only a fraction of genes showing differential regulation in <italic>rcd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This likely reflects the fact that RCD1 interacts with many other protein partners in addition to ANACs. The C-terminal RST domain of RCD1 was shown to interact with transcription factors belonging to DREB, PIF, ANAC, Rap2.4 and other families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jaspers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Vainonen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hiltscher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bugge et al., 2018</xref>). Analyses of various transcription factors interacting with RCD1 revealed little structural similarity between their RCD1-interacting sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">O'Shea et al., 2017</xref>). The flexible structure of the C-terminal domain of RCD1 probably determines the specificity and ability of RCD1 to interact with those different transcription factors. This makes RCD1 a hub in the crosstalk of organellar signaling with hormonal, photoreceptor, immune and other pathways and a likely mechanism by which these pathways are integrated and co-regulated.</p><p>The changing environment requires plants to readjust continuously their energy metabolism and ROS processing. On the one hand, this happens because of abiotic stress factors such as changing light intensity or temperature. For example, a sunlight fleck on a shade-adapted leaf can instantly alter excitation pressure on photosystems by two orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allahverdiyeva et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, chloroplasts and mitochondria are implicated in plant immune reactions to pathogens, contributing to decisive checkpoints including PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Shapiguzov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Petrov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Van Aken and Pogson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). In both scenarios, perturbations of organellar ETCs may be associated with increased production of ROS. However, the physiological outcomes of the two situations can be opposite: acclimation in one case and cell death in the other. The existence of molecular mechanisms that unambiguously differentiate one type of response from the other has been previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Trotta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sowden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Van Aken and Pogson, 2017</xref>). The ANAC017 transcription factor and MDS genes, as well as PAP signaling, were proposed as organelle-related components counteracting PCD during abiotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Van Aken and Pogson, 2017</xref>). This suggests that RCD1 is involved in the regulation of the cell fate checkpoint. Accordingly, the <italic>rcd1</italic> mutant is resistant to a number of abiotic stress treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahlfors et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fujibe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jaspers et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, in contrast to its resistance to abiotic stress, <italic>rcd1</italic> is more sensitive to treatments related to biotic stress. The <italic>rcd1</italic> mutant was originally identified in a forward genetic screen for sensitivity to ozone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Overmyer et al., 2000</xref>). Ozone decomposes in the plant cell wall to ROS mimicking formation of ROS by respiratory burst oxidases (RBOHs) in the course of plant immune reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Joo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Vainonen and Kangasjärvi, 2015</xref>). The opposing roles of RCD1 in the cell fate may be related to its interaction with diverse transcription factor partners and/or different regulation of its stability and abundance. For example, transcriptomic analyses showed that under standard growth conditions, a cluster of genes associated with defense against pathogens had decreased expression in <italic>rcd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brosché et al., 2014</xref>), and no ANAC013/ANAC017 <italic>cis</italic>-element motif is associated with these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In agreement with its role in biotic stress, RCD1 is a target for a fungal effector protein that prevents the activation of plant immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wirthmueller et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Another possible factor determining varying roles of RCD1 in the cell fate is differential regulation of RCD1 protein function by ROS/redox signals emitted by different subcellular compartments. The sensitivity of RCD1 to chloroplastic ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) can be interpreted as negative regulation of the pro-PCD component. We hypothesize that this inactivation can occur in environmental situations that require physiological adaptation rather than PCD. For example, an abrupt increase in light intensity can cause excessive electron flow in photosynthetic ETC and overproduction of reducing power. The resulting deficiency of PSI electron acceptors can lead to changes in chloroplastic ROS production, which <italic>via</italic> retrograde signaling might influence RCD1 stability and/or redox status, inhibiting its activity and thus affecting adjustments in nuclear gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Among other processes, RCD1-mediated suppression of ANAC013/ANAC017 transcription factors is released, allowing the induction of the MDS regulon. The consequent expression of AOXs together with increased chloroplast-to-mitochondrial electron transfer is likely to provide electron sink for photosynthesis, which could suppress chloroplast ROS production and contribute to the plant’s survival under a changing environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;RCD1 Coordinates Chloroplastic and Mitochondrial Electron Transfer through Interaction with ANAC Transcription Factors&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in its present form.</p><p>However, we would be ready to have a second look at a resubmission of a substantially revised manuscript that comprehensively addresses the reviewer comments, including the following key experiments:</p><p>1) One important experiment would be to look for suppression of NAC17-dependent retrograde signalling in an RCD overexpression and/or RCD 7cys complemented line. Notably, these lines should be readily available, and as such these are not very challenging experiments.</p><p>2) It must be clarified whether the initial MDH activity was indeed measured after 2 h of incubation in the absence of DTT, as it presently reads in subsection “Measurements of NADPH-MDH activity”. This would have caused inactivation. If the non-aqueous fractions still exist, chloroplast malate levels would be most interesting rather than whole leaf amounts.</p><p>3) Finally, the manuscript should be substantially rewritten and rearranged. In particular, you would have to streamline your paper and focus on the novel aspects. Confirmatory experiments with respect to the literature should receive less attention and be displayed in the extended data. Moreover, often the results can only be understood when investigating the figure, reading the legend, the corresponding section in the Materials and methods and the text passage. You should aim to ease this process. For example you could provide the most important information in the legend, e.g. the light intensity used for NADPH-MDH-activity measurement (Figure 3), the incubation time with MV in Figure 3B or the positions of standard polypeptides in the Western blots.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper reports on a complex but highly interesting story, based on the compilation of diverse data linking RADICAL CELL DEATH 1(RCD1) function with regulation of redox and reactive oxygen species signaling and brings this in the wider context of retrograde information exchange in photosynthetic cells. The effect of lacking RCD1 on AOX transcript accumulation is highly interesting and correlated with high accumulation of AOX1A. Inefficient ATP production by the respiratory chain in the mutants was compensated by increased activity of glycolysis and linked pathways such as oxidative pentose pathway.</p><p>The strength of the study is that the authors attempt to test their hypotheses by using specific mutants. Another important point is the establishment of the link between the RCD1-dependent signaling and ANAC13/ 17, physically (shown before) and now deepened for the proteins ANAC13/ ANAC17/ SRO1/ RCD1 (also in human embryonic kidney cell; these results could move to the supplementary materials), indirectly functionally by corresponding changes in the transcriptomes and by increased ROS sensitivity of rd1/anac17 double mutants. The structural part on the interaction between RCD1 and ANAC13/ 17 is also significant.</p><p>It has to be taken with caution that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and methylviologen treatments specifically mimic chloroplast ROS production. This must be discussed with more care, also in the Discussion final paragraph. Exogenous application of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> acts in different cells and cell compartments, likewise MV supplementation is not a specific inducer of chloroplast ROS. Thus high light treatment affects analyzed parameters different to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and methylviologen.</p><p>Figure 3: Subsection “Evidence for increased electron transfer between chloroplasts and mitochondria in rcd1”: The activation state of NADPH malate dehydrogenase (MDH) is very low, almost unbelievably low (4-8%). Doubling the activity from this very low activation state unlikely is sufficient to explain any changes in rcd1 mutants. Kinetic modelling could help to define whether the observation is significant or not. The legend to the figure is insufficient to understand what is measured.

The incubation of the test with and without DTT for 2 h at room temperature is not clear: Was the minus DTT-sample supposed to be the initial activity? During a 2 h incubation with 250 μM DTT, the initially active MDH may inactivate and this may explain the extremely low activity? This ambiguity must be clarified.

The manuscript represents a vast amount of work and provides interesting findings in many aspects of stress response and signalling. The main novel point the study puts forward is that RCD1 may repress (mitochondrial) retrograde signalling via direct binding to ANAC013/17 transcription factors, and repressing their function. This system may be of importance during resistance to the ROS-generating herbicide methyl viologen (paraquat, leading to PSI superoxide and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production).</p><p>The study first confirms MV resistance of the <italic>rcd1</italic> mutant reported previously (e.g. Fujibe et al., 2004, Hiltscher et al., 2014). The authors show that <italic>rcd1</italic> mutants maintain Fv/Fm much better after light exposure in the presence of MV, compared to WT, but that this is not just because MV cannot reach PSI. This is accompanied by lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in <italic>rcd1</italic>, indicating that somehow loss of RCD1 (a nuclear protein) suppresses ROS formation by MV. The observation that 2-cys peroxiredoxin is in a more reduced state therefore makes sense as less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> seems to be present in the <italic>rcd1</italic> cells.</p><p>The study then shifts focus to mitochondrial alternative respiration (AOX-dependent). AOX1a gene expression was previously found by this group to be induced in <italic>rcd1</italic> mutants, and this is further confirmed at the protein level and by increased KCN-resistant respiration. This indicates that the increased alternative respiration in <italic>rcd1</italic> is largely due to AOX1a activity. The authors further indicate an increased flux through e.g. glycolysis, indicating a different metabolic state, likely independent of AOX1a.</p><p>Pre-treatment with mitochondrial complex III inhibitor AA could partially mimic the <italic>rcd1</italic> resistance to MV in WT plants, indicating that mitochondrial retrograde signalling can be of importance in MV tolerance, which is very interesting. Inhibition of AOX by SHAM made the <italic>rcd1</italic> less MV tolerant, indicating the AOX is needed for full MV tolerance. This is one of the most interesting findings in the study, that AOX is part of the <italic>rcd1</italic> mechanism for MV resistance. Follow-up experiments however showed that overexpression of AOX1a itself was not sufficient to induce MV tolerance, and <italic>rcd1</italic> aox1a plants were as MV resistant as <italic>rcd1</italic>. This suggests that other isoforms than AOX1a may be important here, and that higher AOX capacity is not sufficient in itself, and there might be additional post-translational regulation. The point of the experiment shown in Figure 3A may not be very clear to the general reader, and needs better explanation.</p><p>The authors then check NADPH-MDH activity and malate content. Both are higher in <italic>rcd1</italic> than in Col-0 after MV treatment. Overall NADPH-MDH capacity was higher in <italic>rcd1</italic>, suggesting some flux of reductive equivalent to the mitochondria via chloroplastic malate formation. The increased activation state may again have to do with the lower ROS oxidation state of the <italic>rcd1</italic> cells.</p><p>A transcriptome meta-analysis further confirms the previous findings that many mitochondrial retrograde regulation target genes are constitutively induced in <italic>rcd1</italic>, as well as by MV.</p><p>The authors then make a link to another retrograde pathway mediated by PAP, which also co-regulates MDS gene expression (Van Aken and Pogson, 2017). The authors cross <italic>rcd1</italic> with a PAP accumulating mutant <italic>sal1</italic> and find a much stronger growth inhibition phenotype than either of the single mutants. Although this quite interesting in itself, the authors don't really provide a mechanistic explanation or suggestion for this additive phenotype. The Sal1 and <italic>rcd1 sal1</italic> mutants would need to be analysed in more detail (e.g. Fv/Fm MV analysis) to show PAP is really involved here.</p><p>Constitutive induction of MDS transcripts (including ANAC013) genes suggests that their main positive transcription factors are activated (ANAC017/013). To address this, the authors made the interesting cross of <italic>rcd1</italic> anac017. Indeed, AOX levels and capacity are lower in this double mutant, supporting the role of ANAC017 in MDS upregulation in <italic>rcd1</italic>. The anac017 mutant was previously shown to be highly MV-sensitive, and ANAC013/ANAC017 overexpression lines are more tolerant (e.g. De Clercq et al., 2013). The observed hypersensitivity of the anac017 mutant in the Fv/Fm MV assay is in line with this. The <italic>rcd1</italic> anac017 is more sensitive than <italic>rcd1</italic> indicating the NAC MRR pathway plays a partial role in the <italic>rcd1</italic> MV phenotype. No descriptions of the visual, developmental and stress (e.g. ozone) phenotype of the <italic>rcd1 anac017</italic> mutant are provided, which would be very interesting.</p><p>The authors then support the previously reported interaction of ANAC013 with RCD1 (Jaspers et al., 2009, O'Shea et al., 2017) using Co-IP strategies, and provide further insight into the interaction with surface plasmon resonance and NMR.</p><p>Finally, the authors show that RCD1 protein level (or at least HA-RCD1) is degraded over time by MV and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. Using non-reducing gels, they show that quickly after these treatments, a more oxidised multimeric form of RCD1 is found, indicating protein aggregation. From my interpretation of Figure 6B and Supp S5B, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> makes a predominantly much higher MW aggregate than MV, so this should be discussed. By mutating 7 Cys residues in the RCD1 protein, the authors showed that this aggregation can be largely blocked. I am somewhat confused by the statement on mitochondrial inhibitor AA in the second paragraph of subsection “RCD1 protein is sensitive to organellar ROS” and Figure S5B. To me the total (reducing gel) abundance of RCD1 after AA is much lower than after MV. This seems in contrast to the statement in the text that RCD1 is not a direct target of a mitochondrial signal from AA. This should be clarified. Also H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> seems much stronger in affecting RCD1 abundance than MV. In line with this, MV is a much weaker inducer of MDS genes than AA or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Figure 4A), so perhaps the role of RCD1 is of more importance in AA signalling than in MV, but this is under explored. In S5C, I assume the legend is mislabelled, where Col-0 should be the grey line? The identical phenotype of the 7cys RCD1 complementation compared to the normal RCD1 complementation, however questions the physiological importance of the RCD1 redox-induced aggregation, as one might expect then less efficient complementation.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript contains lots of data, and the experiments seem well performed so I trust their validity. To a large extent, many of the findings are confirming previous findings from the large body of literature surround RCD1 and MRR (binding with ANACs, upregulation of multiple MDS genes also in PAP-related mutants, MV tolerance phenotypes, potential involvement of AOX1a, involvement of ANAC013/17 in MV tolerance), and expand on them with additional techniques and measurements. The main model proposed here is that RCD1 binds and inhibits ANAC017/13, so mitochondrial retrograde signalling is blocked when no stress is present. Upon stress, the ROS-induced redox/changes alter RCD1 configuration/abundance and cause aggregation, which may reduce the inhibitory capacity of RCD1 on the NACs, thereby inducing MDS gene expression. This system is of importance also for chloroplast stress resistance such as MV, involving AOX activity.</p><p>If this is indeed true, that would be a major finding in the field, providing mechanistic insight into the relatively poorly understood ANAC MRR pathway. However, at this stage the evidence brought here is fairly circumstantial, with many nice experiments that however do not provide conclusive evidence. Many of the key findings that lead to this conclusion are already published (RCD1 ANAC interaction, induction of ANAC target genes in <italic>rcd1</italic> mutants, role of ANACs in MV resistance). Indeed, the interactions have now been confirmed by several labs independently and with great detail, so it seems very likely to occur. However, many mutants/treatments have activation of MDS genes as reported in many studies, but this may just indicate a basally stressed state of the plants (not-necessarily just ROS levels) leading to ANAC signalling, and not necessarily direct regulation on the transcription factor.</p><p>To make this more convincing, more direct experiments should be performed. One would for instance expect that an RCD1 Overexpression line (which has been made in the past, Fujibe 2006, Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 70 (8), 1827-1831, and complements the <italic>rcd1</italic> MV resistance phenotype) would suppress (AA-induced) MRR to a significant extent. The 7cys RCD1 line would also be of interest in this context, to show that redox state can affect retrograde signalling. A complementation line of mutated RCD1 lacking the clearly defined ANAC interaction domain should not be able to restore wild-type levels of MV susceptibility and MDS upregulation, but I am not aware if one is available. Experiments showing a dynamic release of sequestration/binding of ANACs from RCD1 during stress would be even more convincing, but I agree these are technically very challenging.</p><p>Overall, the study provides many new insights and is well written, and soundly presented. To really make a convincing case for their exciting model, some more specific experiments targeting the ANAC/RCD1 regulation would be beneficial.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Arabidopsis RCD1 Coordinates Chloroplast and Mitochondrial Functions through Interaction with ANAC Transcription Factors&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Christian Hardtke (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved, but the reviewers are of the opinion that you did not adequately respond to key requests from the first round of reviews. We would thus like to ask you to carefully consider the reviews pasted below, and revise your manuscript accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this revised version the authors addressed many small and large issues raised by the reviewers and editor. However, I feel some of the main concerns have not been addressed appropriately yet.</p><p>The authors try to introduce a new mechanism of how RCD1 directly binds and inhibits ANAC017/13. This possibly interaction represses the transcription factors and thus would keep MRR target gene expression under control, such as AOX1a. Upon oxidative stress, RCD1 aggregates and would then release some of the ANAC017/13 to induce MRR gene expression. This interesting model has a number of testable implications, which were suggested after initial review, and were also underlined to be important by the Editor. However some of these have not been addressed directly.</p><p>1) In comment by <italic>eLife</italic> Senior Editor: &quot;One important experiment would be to look for suppression of NAC17-dependent retrograde signalling in an RCD overexpression and/or RCD 7cys complemented line. Notably, these lines should be readily available, and as such these are not very challenging experiments.&quot;</p><p>And reviewer 2 &quot;To make this more convincing, more direct experiments should be performed. One would for instance expect that an RCD1 Overexpression line (which has been made in the past, Fujibe 2006, Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 70 (8), 1827-1831, and complements the <italic>rcd1</italic> MV resistance phenotype) would suppress (AA-induced) MRR to a significant extent. The 7cys RCD1 line would also be of interest in this context, to show that redox state can affect retrograde signalling.&quot;</p><p>The authors respond in point 1 that a number of <italic>rcd1</italic> RCD1-HA with higher and lower levels of RCD1 (thus probably equivalent to an RCD1 overexpression line, but hard to say without RCD1 specific antibody, and only an anti-HA antibody) have been generated. The authors then show the MV-dependent Fv/Fm phenotype is reverting to different extents to Col-0. This is nice, but the key experiment to address the raised question is then missing. When treated with a Mitochondrial Retrograde Regulation inducing agent (classically antimycin A), do these “overexpression” lines show a reduction in ANAC017-dependent MRR gene expression (e.g. Aox1a, UPOX, UGT74E2)? The authors did experiments along these lines but using MV (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). MV however does not directly induce mitochondrial signalling as it mainly affects chloroplastic ROS, which is supported by the fact that MRR marker genes AOX1a and UPOX are not induced by MV (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). I don't see why the authors did not do the same experiment using AA, which would address the question, and is relatively easy to perform. In the RCD1d7cys complemented line, which fails to aggregate, such a repression of AA-induction of MRR genes may not occur, and would thus be expected to show more WT-like gene expression responses.</p><p>2) A second experiment that was suggested was to use <italic>rcd1</italic> mutants complemented with RCD1 lacking the ANAC017 interaction domain (RST domain). In point 3 the authors describe RCD1dRST-HA complementation lines were generated. I assume this is indeed transformation into the <italic>rcd1</italic> mutant background, so I suggest these line are called <italic>rcd1</italic> RC1dRST-HA in the text and figures (e.g. Figure 7B-C), same for <italic>rcd1</italic> RCD1-HA. This to avoid confusion that they are in the Col-0 background, which would lead to a different interpretation. The results in Figure 7B and C are indeed in line with the fact that the RST1 domain is important for RCD1 function in this context. As RCD1 is known to interact with a wide range of transcription factors, so it is not direct evidence for a role via interaction with ANAC017/13, but overall that is a nice result.</p><p>3) My comments regarding the size of the aggregates have been addressed.</p><p>4) Also the comments regarding Fv/Fm measurement on the <italic>rcd1 sal1</italic> have been addressed, it is interesting to see that it shows much higher tolerance to MV than <italic>rcd1</italic> itself.</p><p>5) I still think it is important to show the visual phenotype of the <italic>rcd1 anac017</italic> mutant plants, even if they don't seem to revert the <italic>rcd1</italic> ozone resistance phenotype, as is partially observed for the MV Fv/Fm phenotype. This makes some sense, as <italic>anac017</italic> is not known to be involved in ozone tolerance.</p><p>6) I don't really understand the author's reasoning in point 37 of their reply letter. The authors say there is no effect of AA on RCD1-HA redox state, but Figure 4—figure supplement 2B to me shows induction of higher order complexes by AA and myx of the same size as MV in light or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, albeit weaker. 2.5 μm is a relatively low concentration, as 50 μm AA has been used most extensively throughout the literature. They also say that because MDS gene induction (by which they mean AOX protein level changes using Western blots) by AA is still occurring in <italic>rcd1</italic>, this leads them to conclude that RCD1 is unlikely part of AA signalling. As RCD1 is suggested to suppress ANAC017 signalling, an <italic>rcd1</italic> KO should still show AA gene induction, as the potential repressor is now inactive. An RCD1 OX line may display reduction in AA signalling, but this question has still not been addressed, see Point 1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have thoroughly revised their previous manuscript version and provide additional evidence for their lines of thoughts and conclusions. The study contributes important and novel information to our understanding of retrograde signaling and the integration of chloroplast and mitochondrial retrograde signals. In the following you find the combined list of minor and very few more critical points.</p><p>Introduction section, first paragraph: “… transport of carbon rich metabolites…” It is not really clear what is meant? Carbon rich might be a fatty acid? energy-rich like dihydroxyacetone phosphate or malate?</p><p>Introduction section, second paragraph: “… leakage of electrons…”; is this still an adequate description of the process?

If mitochondrial alterations in metabolism cause redox changes in the nucleus/cytosol similar to those of the chloroplast, then the conformational changes should be the same. The power of mitochondrial redox/ROS signals may just be less than chloroplast redox/ROS signals.</p><p>Subsection “RCD1 regulates stress responses and cell fate”, first paragraph: Rap2.4a</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43284.080</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) One important experiment would be to look for suppression of NAC17-dependent retrograde signalling in an RCD overexpression and/or RCD 7cys complemented line.

You should aim to ease this process. For example you could provide the most important information in the legend, e.g. the light intensity used for NADPH-MDH-activity measurement (Figure 3), the incubation time with MV in Figure 3B or the positions of standard polypeptides in the Western blots.</p></disp-quote><p>6) The manuscript has been profoundly revised.

This must be discussed with more care, also in the Discussion final paragraph. Exogenous application of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>acts in different cells and cell compartments, likewise MV supplementation is not a specific inducer of chloroplast ROS. Thus high light treatment affects analyzed parameters different to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and methylviologen.</italic> </p><p>This concern has been addressed by adding a data panel showing that MV only triggered RCD1 oligomerization under light, but not in the darkness (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B).

To avoid discrepancies, this figure has been replaced with the new Figure 4—figure supplement 2B. As it is clear from the new figure, in both treatments the aggregates migrate at a similar height.</p><p><italic>By mutating 7 Cys residues in the RCD1 protein, the authors showed that this aggregation can be largely blocked. I am somewhat confused by the statement on mitochondrial inhibitor AA in the second paragraph of subsection “RCD1 protein is sensitive to organellar ROS” and Figure S5B. To me the total (reducing gel) abundance of RCD1 after AA is much lower than after MV. This seems in contrast to the statement in the text that RCD1 is not a direct target of a mitochondrial signal from AA. This should be clarified. Also</italic> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><italic>seems much stronger in affecting RCD1 abundance than MV. In line with this, MV is a much weaker inducer of MDS genes than AA or</italic> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><italic>(Figure 4A), so perhaps the role of RCD1 is of more importance in AA signalling than in MV, but this is under explored.</italic></p><p>In the old Figure S5B antimycin A (AA) was used in the concentration 20 μM, which is much higher than in rest of this study (2.5 uM). The decrease in RCD1-HA abundance was reproducibly observed under 20 μM AA, but not under 2.5 μM AA. However, the data on 20 μM AA is hard to interpret due to possible chloroplastic off-target effects of ≥ 20 μM AA, as described in (Watanabe et al., 2016). Most importantly for this study, 2.5 μm AA (or 2.5 μm myxothiazol) was sufficient for MDS gene induction, however it did not lead to changes in either RCD1-HA abundance or redox states. To show this, the new figures were added to the manuscript (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B). The ambiguous results with 20 μM AA were excluded. Together with the fact that AA- or myx-triggered MDS gene induction was also observed in the <italic>rcd1</italic> mutant (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B) this suggested that RCD1 is unlikely part of the AA signalling. The Discussion has been updated to state this more explicitly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In S5C, I assume the legend is mislabelled, where Col-0 should be the grey line? The identical phenotype of the 7cys RCD1 complementation compared to the normal RCD1 complementation, however questions the physiological importance of the RCD1 redox-induced aggregation, as one might expect then less efficient complementation.</p></disp-quote><p>For the clearer demonstration of MV tolerance of RCD1-HA and RCD1Δ7Cys-HA complementation lines, the new datasets have been added to the manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, and Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). As can be seen in these figures, at certain low MV concentration some of the RCD1-HA complementation lines are more sensitive to MV than Col-0 (which was visible in the old Figure S5C). The added data shows that mutation of the RCD1 cysteines affects in vivoabundance and stability of the protein.

Information on the antibody against RCD1 that we have generated has been added to the Materials and methods section.</p><p>2) Abundance of <italic>RCD1</italic> mRNA in the <italic>rcd1</italic>: RCD1-HA lines was measured by qPCR and compared to that in the wild type. This has been included as Figure 1—figure supplement 1C. Taken together, the immunoblotting and the qPCR results demonstrate that the <italic>rcd1</italic>: RCD1-HA lines expressing higher levels of RCD1-HA are the true overexpressors of RCD1, as the level of both the RCD1 protein and the <italic>RCD1</italic> transcript exceed those in Col-0 about 10-fold. Moreover, in the <italic>rcd1</italic>: RCD1-Venus lines that we generated, <italic>RCD1</italic> is expressed under <italic>UBIQUITIN-10</italic> promoter. In these lines RCD1 accumulates to amounts even higher than in the shown high-expressor <italic>rcd1</italic>: RCD1-HA lines. However, even in the <italic>pUB10:RCD1</italic> lines we have never observed any signs of restoration of the <italic>rcd1</italic>-like phenotypes. Thus, we believe that the physiological response reported in (Fujibe et al., 2006) is not associated with overexpression of RCD1 protein, but has to do with more complex secondary effects such as silencing of other members of the SRO family. Thus, for the experiments proposed by the reviewers we have used the set of independent <italic>rcd1</italic>: RCD1-HA lines expressing different levels of RCD1-HA (please, see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors then show the MV-dependent Fv/Fm phenotype is reverting to different extents to Col-0. This is nice, but the key experiment to address the raised question is then missing. When treated with a Mitochondrial Retrograde Regulation inducing agent (classically antimycin A), do these “overexpression” lines show a reduction in ANAC017-dependent MRR gene expression (e.g. Aox1a, UPOX, UGT74E2)? The authors did experiments along these lines but using MV (Figure 2 sup 1D). MV however does not directly induce mitochondrial signalling as it mainly affects chloroplastic ROS, which is supported by the fact that MRR marker genes AOX1a and UPOX are not induced by MV (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). I don't see why the authors did not do the same experiment using AA, which would address the question, and is relatively easy to perform. In the RCD1d7cys complemented line, which fails to aggregate, such a repression of AA-induction of MRR genes may not occur, and would thus be expected to show more WT-like gene expression responses.</p></disp-quote><p>The suggested experiment has been conducted. The new data has been added as Figure 6—figure supplement 2 (induction of MDS genes after 3-hour treatment with 50 μm AA in Col-0, <italic>rcd1</italic>, independent <italic>rcd1</italic>: RCD1-HA and independent <italic>rcd1</italic>: RCD1Δ7Cys-HA lines), and as Figure 8—figure supplement 1 (same treatment performed in the <italic>rcd1-1 anac017</italic> double mutant). As outlined above, <italic>rcd1</italic>: RCD1-HA lines expressing higher levels of RCD1-HA were used as RCD1 overexpressors. In agreement with the reviewer’s prediction, we have observed suppressed induction of the <italic>UPOX</italic> gene in the <italic>rcd1</italic>: RCD1-HA high expressor line and in the <italic>rcd1</italic>: RCD1Δ7Cys-HA lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A second experiment that was suggested was to use rcd1 mutants complemented with RCD1 lacking the ANAC017 interaction domain (RST domain). In point 3 the authors describe RCD1dRST-HA complementation lines were generated. I assume this is indeed transformation into the rcd1 mutant background, so I suggest these line are called rcd1 RC1dRST-HA in the text and figures (e.g. Figure 7B-C), same for rcd1 RCD1-HA. This to avoid confusion that they are in the Col-0 background, which would lead to a different interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>The figures and the text have been modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results in Figure 7B and C are indeed in line with the fact that the RST1 domain is important for RCD1 function in this context. As RCD1 is known to interact with a wide range of transcription factors, so it is not direct evidence for a role via interaction with ANAC017/13, but overall that is a nice result.</p><p>[…] 5) I still think it is important to show the visual phenotype of the rcd1 anac017 mutant plants, even if they don't seem to revert the rcd1 ozone resistance phenotype, as is partially observed for the MV Fv/Fm phenotype. This makes some sense, as anac017 is not known to be involved in ozone tolerance.</p></disp-quote><p>Since previous version of the manuscript, we have discovered growth conditions under which we see partial complementation of <italic>rcd1</italic> habitus phenotype in the <italic>rcd1 anac017</italic> double mutant. This was included as the new main figure data panel. To make the results presented in the crowded former Figure 7 more visual, this figure was split in two: Figure 7 and Figure 8.</p><p><italic>6) I don't really understand the author's reasoning in point 37 of their reply letter. The authors say there is no effect of AA on RCD1-HA redox state, but Figure 4—figure supplement 2B to me shows induction of higher order complexes by AA and myx of the same size as MV in light or</italic> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><italic>, albeit weaker. 2.5 μm is a relatively low concentration, as 50 μm AA has been used most extensively throughout the literature. They also say that because MDS gene induction (by which they mean AOX protein level changes using Western blots) by AA is still occurring in rcd1, this leads them to conclude that RCD1 is unlikely part of AA signalling. As RCD1 is suggested to suppress ANAC017 signalling, an rcd1 KO should still show AA gene induction, as the potential repressor is now inactive. An RCD1 OX line may display reduction in AA signalling, but this question has still not been addressed, see Point 1.</italic></p><p>As stated above, transcriptional response to higher concentration of AA (50 uM) has been addressed and included in the manuscript. In our opinion, the experiment proposed by the reviewers has significantly added to this manuscript. In particular, it showed that <italic>rcd1</italic> mutant was not affected in the initiation of MDS signalling, that the overexpressor and the RCD1Δ7Cys lines had this signalling somewhat suppressed, and that ANAC017 played decisive role in the initiation of the MDS signal both in Col-0 and in <italic>rcd1</italic>.</p><p>At the same time, we believe that the in vivo studies of RCD1 under 50 μm AA should be interpreted with caution, because (i) RCD1 may be sensitive to redox states of various subcellular origin, and (ii) high concentrations of AA are known to inhibit chloroplast cyclic electron flow (on which account a cautionary note has been included in the legend of Figure 6—figure supplement 2). This makes it harder to interpret the effects of high concentrations of AA on RCD1 biochemistry and redox states. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewers that the possibility of RCD1 acting as a redox sensor of the mitochondrial MDS signalling has not been ruled out in this study. To account for this uncertainty, the Discussion text has been modified accordingly. (“In addition, little change was observed (in RCD1 abundance and redox state) with the mitochondrial complex III inhibitors AA or myx (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B). Together with the fact that MDS induction was not compromised in the <italic>rcd1</italic> mutant (Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2), this suggests that RCD1 may primarily function as a redox sensor of chloroplastic, rather than mitochondrial, ROS/ redox signaling.”)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] In the following you find the combined list of minor and very few more critical points.</p><p>Introduction section, first paragraph: “… transport of carbon rich metabolites…” It is not really clear what is meant?
