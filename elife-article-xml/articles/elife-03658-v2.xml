However, the mechanisms underlying this regulation are poorly understood because the inherent stochasticity and low probability of spontaneous fusion events has curtailed their visualization at individual release sites. Here, using pH-sensitive optical probes targeted to synaptic vesicles, we visualized single spontaneous fusion events and found that they are retrieved extremely rapidly with faster re-acidification kinetics than their action potential-evoked counterparts. These fusion events were coupled to postsynaptic NMDA receptor-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, and at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations there was an increase in the number of vesicles that would undergo fusion. Furthermore, spontaneous vesicle fusion propensity in a synapse was Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent but regulated autonomously: independent of evoked fusion probability at the same synapse. Taken together, these results expand classical quantal analysis to incorporate endocytic and exocytic phases of single fusion events and uncover autonomous regulation of spontaneous fusion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03658.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03658.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03658.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons communicate with one another at junctions called synapses. When an electrical signal known as an action potential arrives at a synapse, it causes packages called vesicles to fuse with the membrane that surrounds the neuron. The vesicles contain molecules called neurotransmitters, which are then released into the gap between the neurons. When these molecules bind to receptors on the surface of the second neuron, a copy of the action potential is generated and travels along the second neuron. The empty vesicles are then reabsorbed back into the first cell to be refilled with neurotransmitters so that the whole process can be repeated.</p><p>In addition to releasing neurotransmitters in response to the arrival of an action potential, neurons sometimes release vesicles spontaneously. Such events are relatively rare and occur seemingly at random, making them difficult to study. However, by labeling a synaptic vesicle protein with a fluorescent protein, Leitz and Kavalali have constructed a system in which they can observe spontaneous vesicle fusions in single synapses in cell cultures, and follow the fate of the vesicles as they are reabsorbed back into the cell.</p><p>The results reveal a number of key differences between the spontaneous events and those triggered by action potentials. Vesicles released spontaneously are retrieved and recycled much more rapidly than those that are released following the arrival of an action potential. Moreover, increases in calcium levels increase the frequency of both types of events. However, it is also clear that the calcium ions influence the two types of events independently of one another.</p><p>Recent research on flies has suggested that some regions of synapses only ever release vesicles spontaneously, whereas others only ever release vesicles in response to the arrival of an action potential. The work of Leitz and Kavalali now adds to increasing evidence that the spontaneous release of neurotransmitters may have its own role in neuronal signaling that is distinct from the role played by neurotransmitters that are released in response to action potentials.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03658.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03658.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>synaptic vesicle recycling</kwd><kwd>synaptic terminal</kwd><kwd>spontaneous neurotransmitter release</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH066198</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kavalali</surname><given-names>Ege T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 NS069562</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kavalali</surname><given-names>Ege T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Spontaneous fusion of vesicles at synapses is regulated independently of fusion triggered by action potentials, adding to evidence that the two types of fusion have distinct functions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic terminals release neurotransmitters either spontaneously or in response to presynaptic action potentials (APs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fatt and Katz, 1952</xref>). In addition to the well-established role of AP-evoked neurotransmitter release in information transfer and processing, a growing number of studies assign a key role for spontaneous release in synaptic homeostasis and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sutton and Schuman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kavalali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hawkins, 2013</xref>). Recent work indicates that these two modes of neurotransmission are largely independent in terms of their presynaptic regulation as well as postsynaptic signaling consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sutton et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atasoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Melom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nosyreva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wierda and Sorensen, 2014</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the segregation of the two forms of release are only beginning to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hua et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramirez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). There is strong evidence that synaptic vesicles recycle at rest in the absence of presynaptic APs and take up exogenous probes such as FM dyes, antibodies or horseradish peroxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murthy and Stevens, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kavalali and Jorgensen, 2014</xref>). Studies also suggest that endocytic mechanisms mediating synaptic vesicle retrieval after spontaneous fusion diverge from those that trigger endocytosis after AP-evoked exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meng et al., 2013</xref>). However, visualizing single spontaneous vesicle fusion and retrieval events has been technically difficult as the stochastic nature and low probability of spontaneous fusion requires long-term imaging with high temporal resolution, which typically gives rise to significant photobleaching and potential photodamage. Earlier attempts at detecting spontaneous synaptic vesicle exo-endocytosis using capacitance measurements heavily relied on signal averaging and was confounded by susceptibility to contamination by capacitance changes unrelated to synaptic vesicle exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The current lack of insight into single synaptic vesicle retrieval leaves open the question of whether spontaneous synaptic vesicle exocytosis is tightly and temporally coupled to vesicle retrieval. In this study, we used the vesicular glutamate transporter or the vesicle protein synaptophysin as carriers for luminal pH-sensitive fluorescent probes and optimized imaging conditions to minimize photobleaching without compromising our ability to detect a majority of spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion events. Our optical recording conditions were similar to our earlier work where we characterized single AP-evoked fusion events with a median probability of 0.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>) indicating that these settings enable visualization of release from single boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murthy et al., 1997</xref>). Under these conditions, we found that single synaptic vesicles are retrieved extremely rapidly (&lt;370 ms) after spontaneous fusion indicating the fluorescence decay of individual events was dominated by vesicle re-acidification. These spontaneous fusion events were coupled to postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals as supported by their temporal and spatial juxtaposition to D(−)-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5)-sensitive fluorescence signals originating from a Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator targeted to postsynaptic densities. Surprisingly, we uncovered a significant fraction of putative multiquantal events that increased in prevalence at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Furthermore, we could not detect appreciable correlation between the propensities of evoked and spontaneous fusion events at increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. These experiments demonstrated that spontaneous fusion propensity in a given synapse is regulated autonomously and independently of evoked release probability. Taken together, these results expand classical quantal analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Del Castillo and Katz, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyd and Martin, 1956</xref>) to incorporate exocytic and endocytic phases of single fusion events and provide insight into the properties and regulation of single spontaneous fusion events in relation to their AP-evoked counterparts that originate from the same synaptic bouton.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synaptic vesicles that fuse spontaneously recycle rapidly</title><p>To identify spontaneous fusion events, we first imaged synapses expressing vGlut-pHluorin at 8 Hz to minimize photobleaching and identified small, rapid increases in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>) in the presence of the voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX). These increases in fluorescence were distinguishable from noise and could be fit with a single Gaussian curve of mean amplitude of 623 ± 122 a.u (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) and average ΔF/F of 3.8 ± 0.93%. These events decayed rapidly with a weighted average decay time constant (heretofore referred to as ‘decay time’) of 0.29 ± 0.017 s. However, the decay times of these events were distributed according to a non-geometric β-function with a non-geometric average fluorescence decay time of 0.37 s and median decay time of 0.28 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, in contrast to our earlier observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>), the fluorescence decay of these spontaneous events proceeded immediately following fluorescence increase without any observable dwell time. To confirm that these rapidly decaying increases in fluorescence were due to genuine spontaneous vesicle fusion, we sought to manipulate the rate of decay by addition of 50 mM Tris–HCl in the extracellular solution. Indeed, equiosmolar substitution of extracellular NaCl with 50 mM Tris–HCl slowed vesicle reacidification to an average decay time of 0.55 s with median decay time 0.32 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>) indicating that the decay phase of these events was dominated by vesicle re-acidification. We then compared these spontaneous fluorescence increases to those evoked by single action potential stimulation in the absence of TTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). We found that fusion events evoked by stimulation had a mean fluorescence amplitude of 641 ± 171 a.u. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), similar to spontaneous fluorescence increases. However, these events decayed more slowly with average decay time of 0.83 s and median decay time of 0.83 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Finally, to evaluate whether we were able to visualize the entirety of the fluorescent signal originating from spontaneous vesicle fusion events, we incubated neurons with the vacuolar ATPase inhibitor, folimycin (80 nM), and measured spontaneous increases in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,K</xref>). In the presence of folimycin, increases in fluorescence take on a staircase-like waveform with mean amplitude of 609 ± 195 a.u. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), similar to that of spontaneous fusion events observed in the absence of folimycin. There were no significant differences in the mean amplitude between spontaneous increases in fluorescence with or without folimycin and those that were evoked by stimulation (ANOVA p value &gt;0.5). However, when comparing amplitude distributions there was a significant difference between spontaneous events in the absence of folimycin and both spontaneous events in the presence of folimycin and action-potential evoked single vesicle fusion events (KS<sub>test</sub> &lt; 0.05 Dmax = 0.08 at bin 450 a.u.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). This result suggests that while we were able to acquire the entire fluorescence waveform of the majority of spontaneous fusion events, there remains a small population of low amplitude events that we were unable to detect due to the rapid decay of fluorescence signals. Regardless, our results still indicate a clear divergence in the reacidification rate between vesicles that recycle at rest and those that fuse in response to action potentials.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03658.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spontaneous increases in vGlut1-pHluorin fluorescence decay rapidly.</title><p>vGlut1-pHluorin was expressed via lentiviral infection in dissociated hippocampal cultures and neurons were imaged at 16–19 days in vitro.

First, we used the same detection criteria to identify potential ‘hits’ with a negative amplitude (white bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), that is, ‘events’ that were less than −2 times the standard deviation of the points prior in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Setting our detection criteria for negative amplitudes revealed a false ‘hit’ rate of 0.065 per bouton per minute, suggesting that false hits contribute a negligible component to our measurements. Second, we analyzed the positive and negative amplitudes of transient fluorescence fluctuations seen in 0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> where genuine event frequency as verified by the presence of folimycin (leading to staircase increases in fluorescence) is extremely low (29 events in 10 min from 200 puncta from four coverslips, that is ∼0.01 events/bouton/min compared to ∼0.5 events/bouton/min in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Despite the presence of folimycin these false positive events decayed back to baseline and had a significantly lower fluorescence amplitude distribution (KS<sub>test</sub> &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). When these 0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> experiments were analyzed for a negative amplitude, the absolute value of these negative false events were not significantly different from the positive amplitude false events (KS<sub>test</sub> &gt; 0.3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Taken together these data suggest that our detection criteria reliably identify events due to genuine spontaneous vesicle fusion with a low level of false positive hits (∼10% per recording).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dual color imaging shows that spontaneously fusing vesicles elicit postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals</title><p>To investigate the relationship between these fast spontaneous increases in presynaptic fluorescence to postsynaptic receptor activation, we moved to a dual-color system utilizing the red-shifted pHluorin variant, pHTomato, fused to the presynaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin (SypHTomato) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li and Tsien, 2012</xref>) and the green fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, GCaMP5K, fused to the post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95-GCaMP5K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akerboom et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, we excluded extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> to allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through postsynaptic NMDA receptors. In this setting we can verify presynaptic vesicle fusion events in the red channel using the resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the green channel as a coincidence detector of a successful presynaptic fusion event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, this system is not without caveats: first, because we are now monitoring two wavelengths our temporal resolution decreased from &gt;8 Hz to ∼4 Hz; second, SypHTomato results in an elevated surface expression level compared to vGlut-pHluorin that required a post-hoc decay correction to compensate for photobleaching (See ‘Materials and methods’). Despite these issues, spontaneous increases in SypHTomato fluorescence were still detected and were distinguishable from noise with mean amplitude of 303 ± 92 a.u. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and ΔF/F of 1.9 ± 0.67%. In 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> approximately 69% of spontaneous increases in SypHTomato elicited a PSD-95-GCaMP5K signal within ±1 frame, increasing to 83% between −1 to +5 frames. We include this −1 group because in our system we obtain only one time point for each cycle of imaging (i.e. one frame of red channel and one frame of green channel are both assigned the same time point). Therefore, fusion events that may occur halfway through an imaging cycle would appear shifted by −1 frame. Spontaneous increases in fluorescence that were correlated (within ±1 frame) with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were distinguishable from noise with mean amplitude of 170 ± 50 a.u. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and ΔF/F of 2.2 ± 1.3%. We next compared the amplitudes of these spontaneous fusion events with increases in fluorescence elicited by single action potential stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Stimulation resulted in events that were distinguishable from noise with mean amplitude of 345 ± 95 a.u. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Although both spontaneous and AP-evoked fluorescence increases were distinguishable from noise, the small amplitude of these events combined with the rapid decay times made precise measurements of individual decay times difficult. Therefore we averaged all events within an experiment to estimate the overall average decay times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We found that, as with vGlut-pHluorin, spontaneous fluorescence increases in SypHTomato decayed faster than those evoked by stimulation with average decay times of 0.5 ± 0.2 s and 1.0 ± 1.5 s, respectively. To confirm that we were able to observe the full fluorescence increase of spontaneous fusion events with our reduced temporal resolution, we incubated neurons in folimycin and observed stepwise increases in SypHTomato fluorescence. In the same experiments to verify that the increases in the GCaMP5K fluorescence were due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through NMDA receptors, we perfused an extracellular solution containing the NMDA receptor blocker AP-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–S</xref>). We were able to identify spontaneous fusion events according to stepwise increases in SypHTomato fluorescence alone without relying on the coincidence with GCaMP5K mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–S</xref>). Under these conditions, we observed spontaneous fusion events with mean amplitude of 316 ± 64.9 a.u (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>) similar to both those in the absence of folimycin and those due to stimulation. Events in the same synapses in the presence of AP-5 were also similar with mean amplitude of 270 ± 65 a.u. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). The GCaMP5K signal in the absence of AP-5 had mean amplitude of 153 ± 57.6 a.u.

Together these data complement our observations using vGlut1-pHluorin and show that spontaneous vesicle fusion events are coupled to postsynaptic NMDA receptor-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and, following exocytosis, these vesicles are retrieved and re-acidified on a much faster time course than their AP-evoked counterparts.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03658.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dual color imaging shows that spontaneous fusion events are coupled to postsynaptic NMDA receptor-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example images of SypHTomato and PSD-95-GCaMP5K expression.

To assess if this scenario also applied to vesicles that fuse spontaneously, we measured the amplitude of spontaneous increases in vGlut-pHluorin fluorescence in 2, 4 and 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that fluorescence amplitude distributions even in 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not fit well to a single Gaussian curve (D'Agostino-Pearson omnibus K2 normality test p &lt; 0.02), nor could the sum of two Gaussian curves with means at integer multiples (i.e. a quantal distribution of amplitudes indicative of two or more vesicles undergoing fusion simultaneously) account for the distribution of amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> red lines). Instead, amplitude distributions in 2 and 4 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>, respectively) were best fit by the sum of two Gaussian curves at 1 quantal mean (1q = 623 ± 91 a.u., a slightly smaller standard deviation than in Figure 1) and 1.3 times the first mean (1.3q = 834 ± 111 a.u.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref> black lines). Fluorescence amplitudes in 8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> were best fit by the sum of three Gaussian curves distributed at 1 quantal mean (1q = 623 ± 91 a.u.), 1.3 times the first quantal mean (1.3q = 834 ± 111 a.u.) and 2 times the first quantal mean (1246 ± 182 a.u.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This shift in fluorescence may arise from the limitations of our sampling rate and the rapid fluorescence decay time of these spontaneous events, therefore the 1.3q events may reflect two spontaneous events occurring close together in time but with a slight delay such that at our acquisition rate of &gt;8 Hz, they appear to be a single event with a normalized amplitude of 1.3q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). To estimate the delay between two events that would be required for such a fluorescence signal, we modeled the fluorescence decay of two hypothetical spontaneous fusion events with randomly generated amplitudes within the observed first Gaussian distribution (1q) and fixed decay times of 371 ms (the average decay time of spontaneous events in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>). We used this model to generate 2000 hypothetical decay times and found that a fusion delay of 118 ms would result in an amplitude ∼1.3 times greater than the single quantal amplitude. We then estimated the percent of fusion events that were multivesicular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) and found that at 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> 17% of events were multivesicular, increasing to ∼30% in 4 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and up to 70% of events were multivesicular in 8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. While this analysis favors preponderance of multivesicular spontaneous release at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, this shift in fluorescence amplitudes could be also due to unequal distribution of pHluorin molecules within the population of spontaneously recycling synaptic vesicles selectively mobilized at higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. In addition, this fluorescence shift could arise from the preferential fusion, at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions, of larger synaptic vesicles that contain more fluorophores. Given their cell biological complexity (i.e. non-homogenous impact of elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations on vesicle populations with systematic differences) we consider these two alternative scenarios unlikely. Finally, it is important to note that although this observed increase in event amplitude could be due to vesicle fusion from multiple synapses within our region of interest. This is more likely at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations as the release probability estimates we present here at 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> are consistent with release from a single release site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murthy et al., 1997</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03658.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases multivesicular release.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Example traces of events in 2 mM (<bold>A</bold>), 4 mM (<bold>B</bold>) and 8 mM (<bold>C</bold>) extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Thus, it is possible that we either cannot detect a significant change in decay times, or we are missing a subset of ultra fast decay times. Regardless, these data not only suggest that the mechanisms controlling the rate of synaptic vesicle reacidification are not the same for spontaneous and stimulation-evoked vesicle fusion but that endocytosis of synaptic vesicles released at rest is rapid even during multivesicular fusion events, unlike retrieval of vesicles released in response to stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration increases the frequency of fast spontaneous vesicle fusion and retrieval</title><p>It is well established that increasing the concentration of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases spontaneous vesicle fusion rate at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). Next, we wanted to know if we see the same increase in our system. Surprisingly, we found no significant change in vesicle fusion frequency between 2 mM and 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (with 0.56 ± 0.02 fusion events per min in 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 0.49 ± 0.02 fusion events per min in 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>; p value &gt;0.1) beyond the increase in multivesicular events we reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We then counted all events with amplitudes within the first quantal mean as a single event, and events with larger amplitudes as two events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Even with this criterion we did not detect a significant difference between 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (with 0.70 ± 0.02 and 0.76 ± 0.03 fusion events per min in 2 and 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, respectively; p value &gt;0.1). However, when vesicle reacidification was buffered using 50 mM Tris–HCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) we were able to detect a slight shift in vesicle fusion rate in 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> compared to 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.42 ± 0.02 fusion events per min in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 0.53 ± 0.02 events per min in 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>; p value &lt;0.05). Addition of folimycin further exacerbated this effect and clearly showed a ∼2.7-fold increase in spontaneous fusion rate as a function of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; 0.41 ± 0.02 events per min in 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 1.1 ± 0.02 events per min in 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>; p value &lt;0.05). This increase in spontaneous fusion rate comes close to the threefold to fourfold increase we detect using postsynaptic electrophysiological recordings under the same conditions (data not shown). Note that in both the Tris-buffered and folimycin-containing experiments, events were analyzed irrespective of amplitude. Taken together, these data indicate that increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases the vesicle fusion rate in our system in a manner that is detectable in the presence of folimycin. However, this increase in spontaneous fusion rate cannot be detected without increasing extracellular pH buffering or inhibiting vesicle re-acidification, indicating that elevated extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> specifically increases fusion of synaptic vesicles that are retrieved and re-acidified rapidly, below the temporal resolution of our imaging protocol. This finding suggests that although elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels do not alter the kinetics of slower events detectable without the aid of altered re-acidification, Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation generates a new population of events that are faster in their kinetics. This observation is consistent with earlier work, which demonstrated that increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> facilitates the propensity of vesicle retrieval events with fast kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ales et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2009</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03658.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases spontaneous fusion rate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cumulative probability histogram of spontaneous event rate per synapse per minute in 2 mM and 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (n = 175 synapses from four coverslips for both conditions, KS<sub>test</sub> p = 0.55 with Dmax = 0.8 fusion events per minute per synapse, with averages of 0.56 ± 0.02 and 0.49 ± 0.02 (Student's t-test p value = 0.2) events per minute per synapse for 2 and 8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, respectively).

Increases in fluorescence that occurred within 1 s of a stimulation were considered to be due to evoked release (note that we cannot then differentiate between synchronous vesicle fusion and fast asynchronous fusion) while increases in fluorescence that did not match with a stimulation time were labeled as spontaneous vesicle fusion events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We found that while increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations increased both the overall rate of spontaneous fusion (from 0.52 ± 0.028 events per min at 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> to 0.76 ± 0.049 events per min in 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>) as well as the overall mean evoked fusion probability (from 0.15 ± 0.008 in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> to 0.44 ± 0.016 in 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>), at increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations the spontaneous vesicle fusion rate and evoked fusion probability estimates obtained from individual release sites did not show appreciable correlation (at 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>: slope = 1.0, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.08; at 4 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>: slope = −0.14, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.006; at 8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>: slope = 0.47, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>). Although, a large fraction of the nerve terminals (&gt;70%) were capable of maintaining both evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission across all Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, the rate of spontaneous transmission and the probability of successful AP-stimulated transmission are not correlated within a given release site. Furthermore, these data imply that the processes that control the kinetics of trafficking vesicles released at rest and those released in response to stimulation are distinct not only between synaptic terminals, but within a single synaptic terminal.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03658.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Spontaneous vesicle fusion rate and stimulation-evoked fusion probability do not correlate at a given synapse.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example traces of fusion events in the presence of folimycin.

In an earlier study, we employed the same approach to investigate trafficking of single synaptic vesicles that fuse in response to AP stimulation where the time of stimulation can be used to identify a successful fusion event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>). For spontaneous vesicle fusion, however, such a time stamp does not exist; therefore, to confirm our findings using vGlut1-pHluorin, we also used dual color imaging with a red-shifted pHluorin variant (pHTomato) fused to the luminal domain of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin (SypHTomato) and a green Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive probe (GCaMP5K) fused to the post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95-GCaMP5K). In this setting, we could monitor presynaptic vesicle fusion and postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry upon NMDA receptor activation. We found that in both systems, synaptic vesicles that fuse spontaneously are retrieved and re-acidified much faster than their counterparts that fuse in response to stimulation. The rapid decay was not due to lateral diffusion of the probe because in the presence of folimycin, these events remained stable without decay and fluorescence accumulated in a stepwise fashion. It is also important to note that as these experiments were performed at room temperature, we expect that at higher, more physiological temperatures the rates of endocytosis and reacidification may be much faster than are reported here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Renden and von Gersdorff, 2007</xref>). Additionally, we emphasize that the data presented here does not imply that the postsynaptic responses arising from spontaneous and evoked vesicle fusion are necessarily different. However, earlier work from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atasoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sara et al., 2011</xref>) does suggest there is a physical segregation of postsynaptic receptor activation patterns in response to evoked and spontaneous fusion events. Unfortunately, here we cannot measure evoked quantal postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during stimulation, as in our preparation, field stimulation itself causes direct postsynaptic effects. Therefore, in this study we did not examine the kinetic properties of evoked postsynaptic quantal events. Instead, we emphasize that the retrieval and reacidification of spontaneously fusing vesicles are distinct from vesicles that fuse in response to stimulation.</p><p>Unlike stimulation-evoked responses, these spontaneous increases in fluorescence decayed immediately without a detectable pause after the initial increase in fluorescence (dwell time), suggesting a minimal surface residency time of the pHluorin or pHTomato probes. Taken together, these results indicate that spontaneous synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis are tightly coupled processes and that the decay phase of these transients was mainly due to vesicle re-acidification upon endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alabi and Tsien, 2012</xref>). Although we see extremely fast endocytosis of spontaneous recycling vesicles, large probes such as antibodies against the luminal domain of synaptotagmin1 or horseradish peroxidase are known to label spontaneously endocytosing vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fredj and Burrone, 2009</xref>). Therefore, spontaneously endocytosing vesicles may still form a fairly large fusion pore or may even fully collapse onto the plasma membrane—albeit without lateral dispersion of their protein components—despite being retrieved quickly. However, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that some spontaneous fusion events may form narrow fusion pores where uptake of large probes can be curtailed as seen after spontaneous fusion of peptidergic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vardjan et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The rate of endocytosis and vesicle reacidification found here is considerably faster than some of the previous reports that describe endocytosis with a time constant of ∼14 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Granseth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Balaji and Ryan, 2007</xref>) and vesicle reacidification rate of ∼4 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atluri and Ryan, 2006</xref>). The discrepancy between our work and these earlier studies may be attributed several differences. First, our previous work has indicated that in response to increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations as well as in boutons with higher release probability the dwell time and the decay time of single vesicle fusion events increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>). Therefore, we believe it is critical to select boutons with a wide range of release probabilities for single vesicle analysis. Our current work extrapolates this observation to spontaneous release events where we detect events with even faster kinetics. The vesicle re-acidification rates we estimate, on the other hand, are in agreement with studies using synaptobrevin-pHluorin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gandhi and Stevens, 2003</xref>) as well as synaptophysin-pHluorin based measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2009b</xref>). Furthermore, it is important to note that some of these earlier studies were performed in extracellular solution containing 25 mM HEPES while here, and in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>), we chose a lower HEPES concentration of 10 mM as HEPES is known to have phototoxic effects at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zigler et al., 1985</xref>).</p><p>Why is synaptic vesicle re-acidification after spontaneous fusion faster than vesicle re-acidification after evoked fusion? We propose three non-mutually exclusive scenarios that can explain this difference. First, the pH buffering capacity of vesicles that endocytose after AP stimulation could be higher. Second, the function of the v-ATPase on vesicles that endocytose after AP stimulation may be slowed down since this complex is known to incorporate Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) and was recently shown to be differentially regulated during evoked vs spontaneous fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, vesicles endocytosed during activity may rapidly trigger formation of larger vesicular structures that are expected to be slower to re-acidify due to their larger volume, consistent with findings from capacitance measurements in salamander photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van Hook and Thoreson, 2012</xref>) as well as recent electronmicrographic analysis of endocytosis in hippocampal synapses after rapid high-pressure freeze fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we also investigated the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulation of spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion events. At elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations we detected an increase in the amplitudes of fusion events consistent with exocytosis of multiple synaptic vesicles. As noted above, at our resolution we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed increase in amplitude could be due to vesicle fusion from multiple release sites within a region of interest, especially if elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations can activate adjacent release sites resulting in apparent multivesicular release albeit originating from two neighboring release sites. The discrepancy between the increases in mEPSC frequency we detect in electrophysiological recordings vs optical recordings of spontaneous events could indicate that some of the multivesicular events are occurring at neighboring synapses activated at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, our measurements of stimulation-evoked vesicle fusion probability at 2 mM Ca2+ are consistent with the dominance of single release sites in our analysis. Additionally, it is possible that increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> specifically promotes the spontaneous fusion of synaptic vesicles containing elevated copy number of vGlut-pHluorin endowed by either a larger physical size of the vesicle or an elevated intrinsic copy number of vGlut-pHluorin. However, in part due to the similarity between our results and the bursting activity observed previously using single-synapse recordings in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abenavoli et al., 2002</xref>); we consider the increase in fluorescence amplitude as arising from the rapid successive fusion of multiple vesicles as the most cell biologically parsimonious. If this interpretation is correct, we also found that fluorescence signals originating from these multivesicular events were not slower in their rate of decay, which contrasts our earlier observations on evoked multivesicular fusion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>), indicating that spontaneous exocytic load (i.e. the number of spontaneously fused vesicles on the plasma membrane) does not significantly impact retrieval kinetics. Alternatively, even if the larger amplitude spontaneous events were due to the fusion of enlarged synaptic vesicles or synaptic vesicles containing more fluorophore, this interpretation would still imply that the size of synaptic vesicles or the number of vGlut-pHluorin molecules within a synaptic vesicle (more membrane or more cargo, that is the exocytic load) do not impact their retrieval kinetics at rest.</p><p>In contrast to our earlier findings with vesicles that fuse in response to APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>), we found that the kinetics of endocytosis of spontaneous fusion events were not slowed in response to elevated extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. In all likelihood, at 8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> the average kinetics of fluorescence decay became faster due to emergence of events that could only be detected following inhibition of re-acidification. Therefore, with increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> there was a clear increase in the rate of spontaneous fusion and the number of vesicles that undergo fusion. The relative insensitivity of vesicle retrieval kinetics to Ca<sup>2+</sup> suggests that synaptic vesicle retrieval after spontaneous and evoked fusion is regulated via diverse mechanisms consistent with differential dependence of the two forms of endocytosis on distinct dynamin isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raimondi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meng et al., 2013</xref>) and distinct postendocytic transport machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peng et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Finally, in our system we were able to directly compare the rate of spontaneous fusion and evoked-fusion probability within a single synapse. This analysis did not reveal a significant correlation between spontaneous fusion rate and evoked fusion probability estimates from individual release sites, further supporting the notion that these two modes of neurotransmission are controlled and maintained independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atasoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fredj and Burrone, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Melom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peled et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2014</xref> but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groemer and Klingauf, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilhelm et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations the propensity to fuse of each of the two forms of vesicle fusion was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, consistent with their less steep dependence on Ca<sup>2+</sup>, spontaneous fusion events showed a milder 1.5–2-fold increase compared to the threefold increase detected in the propensity of evoked fusion events. Nevertheless, their lack of correlation persisted suggesting a divergence in the mechanisms that regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of evoked and spontaneous fusion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groffen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vyleta and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ermolyuk et al., 2013</xref>). This difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of spontaneous and evoked fusion probability may underlie differential sensitivity of the two forms of neurotransmission of certain neuromodulators and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peters et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramirez and Kavalali, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bal et al., 2013</xref>). Recent studies in the Drosophila neuromuscular junction have shown that a substantial fraction of release sites carry out exclusively spontaneous or evoked neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peled et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walter et al., 2014</xref> also see ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Melom et al., 2013</xref>). In our measurements, we detected a substantial overlap of release sites that are capable of both forms of neurotransmission, in agreement with our earlier estimates from lower temporal resolution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atasoy et al., 2008</xref>). This discrepancy may be consistent with the premise that in immature presynaptic release sites, spontaneous neurotransmission dominates and release gradually shifts towards evoked transmission during synapse maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Polo-Parada et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mozhayeva et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andreae et al., 2012</xref> also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walter et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, the findings we present here provide insight into the segregation of spontaneous and evoked neurotransmitter release mechanisms at the level of single synaptic vesicle fusion events. The differential regulation of spontaneous vesicle fusion suggests it has a role in neuronal signaling distinct from information transfer patterns mediated by evoked release, even within a single synapse.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Dissociated hippocampal neurons were cultured from postnatal day 0–3 Sprague Dawley rats of either sex as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kavalali et al., 1999</xref>).

DU-897U-CSO-#BV) collected on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope with a 100X Plan Fluor objective (Nikon). For illumination we used a Lambda-DG4 (Sutter instruments, Novato, CA) with FITC filter. Images were acquired at ∼8 Hz with an exposure time of 100 ms and binning 4 (Using Nikon Elements Ar software). For analysis, square regions of interest (ROIs) with length and width of 2.5 μm were generated and the resulting fluorescence values were exported to Microsoft Excel for analysis. Successful fusion events were those where the average of 3 points was greater than twice the standard deviation of 17 points (∼2.1 s) prior provided the recordings were stable for at least 78 frames (∼10 s) preceding the increase in fluorescence. Additionally, at least one additional point after the initial fluorescence increase had to be greater than twice the standard deviation of the 17 points prior; this excluded large single point increases in fluorescence from which decay times could not be determined. Noise measurements were obtained in an analogous fashion: by subtracting the average of 3 points from the mean of 17 points prior during a random period during sampling. Decay times were analyzed in Clampfit (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) by fitting raw data with a single exponential decay using Levenberg–Marquardt least sum of squares minimizations. For all control experiments, the extracellular solution was a modified Tyrode's solution containing (in mM): 150 NaCl, 4 KCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl and varying concentrations of CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2, 4, and 8 mM), pH 7.4 (310 Osm). In experiments with folimycin (Concanamycin A, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), a final concentration of 80 nM was used. For Tris-buffered experiments, solutions contained (in mM): 108 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose and 50 Tris–HCl and 2 or 8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>. For all Tris buffering experiments, neurons were allowed to equilibrate in extracellular solution for at least 10 min prior to imaging. We elected to use a Tris-buffered extracellular solution because it does not require continuous bubbling during perfusion; a prerequisite of bicarbonate based buffers. Moreover, it has been shown that incubation in Tris can buffer, and thus slow, vesicle reacidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gandhi and Stevens, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2009a</xref>). All solutions were adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH and 310 Osm prior to use. To prevent network activity, postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX 10 μM; Sigma) and D(−)-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5 50 μM; Sigma) were added to the experimental solutions. To prevent spontaneous action potential generation, we incubated neurons in 1 µM tetrodotoxin (TTX). For simultaneous spontaneous activity and evoked stimulation experiments, TTX was omitted from the extracellular solution and neurons were stimulated using parallel bipolar electrodes (FHC) delivering 15–20 mA pulses with pulse width of 1 ms. At the end of each experiment, Tyrode containing 20 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl was added to help identify putative synaptic boutons. Due to the lower intrinsic release probability in 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we gave twice as many stimulations (20 APs delivered 15 s apart) as in 4 and 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (10 APs delivered 30 s apart), thus evoked fusion probability estimates in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> are in multiples of 0.05 and not 0.1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>SypHTomato/PSD-95-GCaMP imaging and analysis</title><p>For dual color experiments, FITC and TRITC filters (Chroma Technology, Bellows Falls, VT) were inserted into the Lamda-DG.

There are additional issues in these reviews that should also be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an excellent and very interesting paper that reveals several striking differences between spontaneous and evoked vesicle retrieval and reacidification rates. The data analysis is convincing and carefully performed. A surprisingly fast rate of vesicle endocytosis and reacidification is shown after spontaneous fusion events. The results are of fundamental importance for an understanding of CNS synaptic transmission. Together, these results present a strong case for major differences between spontaneous and evoked vesicle recycling and acidification rates.</p><p>Major:</p><p>1) Results section: For the average decay time constant (e.g. 3.7s) and median decay time (e.g. 0.28) please add an error bar to these numbers as you have done elsewhere in the Results section.</p><p>2) Results section: For how long are the neurons bathed in the 50 mM TRIS solution before experiments are performed?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> what was the average frequency of the spontaneous fusion events in 2 mM Ca and in 8 mM Ca? Please give the average number with error bar. It seems like a 3-fold increase in frequency. Also, what is the average increase in spontaneous mEPSC frequency from 2 mM external Ca to 8 mM external Ca? This seems like an easy experiment for the authors to conduct and it would be very interesting to compare the numbers of this change to the numbers from the imaging data.</p><p>4) Change the first paragraph of the Discussion into three paragraphs.</p><p>5) Why not try the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> with an external solution that is based on 25 mM bicarbonate (a more physiological pH buffer)? Is there a problem with exchanging the HEPES-based solution of the cultures with a bicarbonate-based solution and then performing the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>? A vesicle that recycles with 10 mM HEPES in its lumen may have a different pH buffering than one with 25 mM bicarbonate. If an experiment cannot be performed with bicarbonate then some discussion of this issue should be given in the text.</p><p>6) What is the CV of the distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C, 1H and 1K</xref>? Seems like a CV of about 0.4-0.5, which is close to that of mEPSCs. It would be interesting to know how well these match each other.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors use Phluorin imaging to detect spontaneously fusing vesicles and determine their reacidification kinetics, as well as their calcium-dependence. The study is well performed, the detection of spontaneous release using pHluorin constructs is impressive and overall believable, and the authors reach conclusions, which are important and interesting for the field. However, there are some points that require clarification, which will include more analysis, and the interpretation regarding multivesicular release appears not sufficiently supported (details below).</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) A major point is that it is not clear that the optically detected 'spontaneous events' really represent fusion of synaptic vesicles, and not for instance fusion of endosomes. The authors in principle address this point elegantly by co-expressing a fluorescence calcium-indicator (GCaMP5K) fused to PSD-95 and doing dual-color imaging. This is a nice approach, but from the text and analysis presented it does not become clear whether there was a tight correlation between pre- and post-synaptic events, and therefore there is not enough evidence for the conclusion: “...spontaneous fusing vesicles elicit postsynaptic Ca2+ signals”. For instance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: are those events (red and green channel) detected simultaneously? How often did spontaneous increases in the red channel correlate with increases in the green channel? How many events in the red channel did not coincide with events in the green channel? The authors could calculate and plot the waiting times between sequential red and green events at identified synapses. If the authors are right, such a plot should have a peak at very short intervals. Finally, the authors write “Spontaneous increases in fluorescence that were correlated (within {plus minus} 1 s) with Ca2+ signals..” I do not understand the {plus minus} here: presumably the relevant events would be those were the red event would precede (or coincide with) the green event, not the other way around. Overall, the authors need to present additional analysis of these data.</p><p>2) I am skeptical about the conclusion that the larger amplitudes of events at higher calcium concentrations are due to multivesicular release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, text in the Results section). The larger events in the presence of higher calcium concentration could be because of the preferential fusion of slightly larger vesicles under these circumstances (or even due to a change in the photophysical properties of pHluorin). The author's argument doesn't make sense to me: “It is unlikely that this increase in fluorescence is due to variation in the number of pHluorin molecules, as the increase in amplitude is observed when extracellular Ca2+ concentrations are increased.” Why not? The histogram of event sizes could not be fitted with a single Gaussian, but who is to say whether spontaneously fusing vesicles exactly follow a Gaussian distribution? The three distributions at 1q, 1.3q and 2q are not visible as peaks in the histogram at all; especially the fit of a distribution at 2q appears unreasonable. Finally, the suggestion that events with normalized amplitude at 1.3 q would result from multivesicular release of two vesicles with a fixed delay (118 ms) appears unreasonable; what mechanism would ensure that multivesicular release would happen always with this delay, especially as this is spontaneous release? I think the authors should remove this interpretation, which has consequences also for the interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and for the rates reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and possibly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>3) The authors use the lack of a correlation between decay time and amplitude as an argument that “there is a fundamental difference in the kinetics of endocytosis and reacidification between vesicles that fuse spontaneously and those that fuse in response to stimulation.” But I would argue that this finding, together with the previous work of the authors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitz and Kavalali, 2001</xref> is an argument against the interpretation of multivesicular release.</p><p>4) To follow up on the last statement above in point 2, to estimate the fusion frequencies (reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) the authors “counted all events with amplitudes within the first quantal mean as a single event, and events with larger amplitudes as two events”. This is not appropriate, first because it is not clear whether larger events represent multiple events, and second because the distributions at 1q and 1.3q overlap. The authors should only use the number of events that they can detect as such, independently of amplitude. The same goes for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, if the rates were calculated in the same way.</p><p>5) The correlation analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B-D</xref> has not been described in the statistics section of the Materials and Methods. Was this Pearson's correlation coefficient? The R^2 is quite small, but nevertheless the slope is positive under all circumstances. The authors should add a statistical test of the hypothesis R=0, and report whether there is a significant (but small) correlation. Finally, the authors should explain why all evoked fusion probabilities are integer multiples of 0.1 (panel C, D), or 0.05 (panel B). Why this difference between the conditions? Finally, given that fusion probabilities can be measured in only 10 (C, D), or 20 (B) discrete categories, would non-parametric correlation analysis be more appropriate?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the current manuscript, “Fast retrieval and autonomous regulation of single spontaneously recycling synaptic vesicles,” Leitz and Kavalali investigate the retrieval and re-acidification of vesicles spontaneously released, and find that these events have a faster decay than single vesicles released with AP stimulation. Using dual color imaging, they also show that spontaneous events can elicit NMDAR-mediated calcium responses. Additionally, they show that multiple vesicles can be release spontaneously at a single release site, and that this occurs more frequently with increasing calcium concentrations, without showing a change in the pHluorin decay kinetics. They argue that the different release modes, spontaneous and evoked, may use distinct methods of endocytosis. Furthermore, as they show there is no correlation between the release probability of evoked events and the frequency of spontaneously released events at single release sites, they conclude that these are two functionally distinct vesicle pools.</p><p>Overall, this is a well-written and clear paper with many appropriate controls. The dual color imaging of the spontaneous release events and postsynaptic response are important and interesting, while some concerns exist and are discussed below.</p><p>1) Detection of single, spontaneous release events is a crucial technique for this paper. Though the amplitude distribution of the detected events looks convincing, it would also be useful to show how the distribution shifts when spontaneous release is blocked (i.e. with tetanus toxin incubation). Additionally, it is not clear how the noise events were detected. It would also be necessary to show how what the detection criteria discover when run with a negative amplitude (i.e. -2X the SD of the 17 points prior to the event).</p><p>2) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the correlation between the spontaneous pHluorin events and spontaneous Ca2+ events was stated to be {plus minus} 1 s. While the limitations for time resolution in the dual color imaging are expected, since the vesicle release should directly cause the Ca2+ influx, these events should really only be considered if the Ca2+ influx occurs in a time range after the detected pHluorin event.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. What do the corresponding Ca2+ signals look like for the evoked SypHTomato events? Can they be more closely time-locked?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Multivesicular release events recorded by electrophysiology are thought to occur essentially simultaneously. The 1.3q events seem likely to be events happening with a 118 ms delay. Also to this point, how well resolved are the single release sites? Could the multiple vesicle release events be closely neighboring synapses, which happen to release vesicles in close temporal proximity? Also, are the multivesicular spontaneous events Ca2+ dependent? How do they look in the presence of Cd2+?</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The frequency of spontaneous release events clearly increases in 8 mM Ca2+ in the presence of folimycin. The authors explain this as recruitment of very rapidly retrieved vesicles. However, does the frequency of spontaneous events also increase in folimycin with 2 mM Ca2+? From the Figure, it doesn't appear to, but it would be interesting to see.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. This is an important figure for the authors' interpretation of the separate pools of vesicles (spontaneous and evoked) released with distinct properties at single synapses. However, a few issues could cloud the interpretation from the lack of correlation between evoked fusion probability and spontaneous release frequency. First, for an event to be considered evoked with a 1 s lag time from the stimulus seems too long even for asynchronous release with a single action potential. Second, there is again the issue of spatial resolution. Are these actually single release sites? Finally, the release probability (the calculation of which should be clearly stated in the text) seems very high for these synapses in 4 mM Ca2+. This could argue for the multiple release site measurement.</p><p>7) Figure S1. The increase in signal for the PSD-95-GCaMP5K is difficult to interpret, because it could be due to either the increased extracellular Ca2+ or due to the increased multivesicular release events. This could also be interesting to see in the presence of Cd2+.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were requested before acceptance, as shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Fast retrieval and autonomous regulation of single spontaneously recycling synaptic vesicles” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and the original three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>All three reviewers would like to see that all (new) analysis is properly implemented in the manuscript. Specifically, there are arguments that you made in your rebuttal letter that do not appear in the manuscript, but should. Moreover the reviewers generally all agree that support for multivesicular release is not that strong, and feel that this claim should be better balanced by dealing with caveats and alternative explanations.</p><p>Additional comments that surfaced in response to your revision are provided below:</p><p>1) Regarding detection of events, the authors added improved analysis. One reviewer would like to see addition of “false positive” events either from negative implement the detection (inversed) or from 0 Ca2+ to the histograms for amplitude and decay times. In addition, it would be helpful to subtract weighted average decay of false positives from weighted average decay of spontaneous events to obtain “net events”.</p><p>2) Coincidence of pre- and postsynaptic events: The detection of postsynaptic responses at the -1 frame will still be confusing to the reader, and additional clarification in the text is required. Given that the distribution of events puts most of them between 0 to 5 frames after stimulation, this is the time window that the authors should use for analysis. They will lose very few events and it will be more straightforward as it makes little sense that the postsynaptic signal should occur prior to the presynaptic signal. If the -1 frame events are to be included, the explanation for why these events would appear to occur before the stimulation, as included in the rebuttal letter must also be in the text.</p><p>Unfortunately, the postsynaptic signals coupled to the evoked Syp-Tomato signals are missing, and this is still an obvious gap in the paper. As the authors explain in the rebuttal letter, this is due to an understandable technical issues with field stimulation and network activity, although that the field stimulation itself causes a signal is strange when NMDARs are not blocked by Mg2+. Again, the authors should address this issue in the text. Pointing out to the reader that the recording the postsynaptic events with stimulation is technically difficult does not take anything away from the findings, and will also preempt questions from a reader who sees the comparison of the postsynaptic signals generated by evoked or spontaneous release as the obvious next step.</p><p>3) Release probability vs spontaneous release: There is only a 50% increase in the average spontaneous fusion rate with Ca2+ increase to 8 mM, while average release probability increases 3-fold. This figure could simply suggest that the release frequency of minis is much, much less sensitive to calcium than evoked release probability. This should be discussed by the authors.</p><p>4) Sensitivity to detect individual events/multiquantal release: Overall, the single site, multiquantal spontaneous release claim is still not convincing (or at least multiple release site cannot be ruled out convincingly). I do not understand how the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murthy et al., 1997</xref> citation excludes the possibility that the authors are not detecting coincident release from neighboring synapses and not the multi-quantal events they report-particularly as the release probability they claim will result in individual sites in 2mM Ca2+ and this will be less likely occur as Ca2+ increases. Additionally, aside from the increase in release probability with increased calcium, other factors that contribute to ability to differentiate individual synapses include the density of synapse and the amount of binning.</p><p>The discrepancy between mEPSC frequency increase in electrophysiological recordings and optical recordings of spontaneous events (though small) could suggest the events reported as multiquantal are, in fact, neighboring synapses. It would be worth testing when the portion of the population of events with 1.3 q and 2 q amplitudes are treated as individual events from neighboring synapses, does the frequency increase of the optical recordings better match the electrophysiological ones.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03658.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their insightful and constructive evaluation of our manuscript. In the revised paper, we have included new data and analysis. We now report the false positive detection rate and show the amplitude distributions of false positive events detected during minimal spontaneous vesicle fusion in nominal calcium concentrations (Modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Additionally, we now report the temporal correlation of postsynaptic Ca2+ entry reported by PSD-95-GCaMP5K and the presynaptic vesicle fusion reported by SypHTomato. We now include multiple interpretations for the observed Ca2+ increase in fluorescence amplitude and we now show the frequency of spontaneous fusion with and without interpreting increased fluorescence amplitude as multivesicular fusion (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The new experiments and analysis are briefly outlined below.</p><p>A) To estimate our false positive event detection rate, we re-analyzed our data using the inverse of the same detection criteria (-2X the standard deviation of the mean) we used previously to identify positive spontaneous vesicle fusion events. In this setting, we detected an average of 0.065 “negative” events per bouton per minute (compared to “positive” 0.5 events/bouton/min., see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This measurement indicates that false positive hits impart a negligible contribution to our data set as a whole.</p><p>Additionally, we performed experiments in extracellular solution lacking Ca2+ to minimize the rate of vesicle fusion but including folimycin (to increase our confidence in putative positive events) to further validate our criteria to identify spontaneous fusion events. Here, we used our earlier detection criteria to identify increases in fluorescence that may reflect vesicle fusion. In nominal Ca2+, positive bona fide fusion events (detected in folimycin) were decreased to 0.01 events/bouton/min (compared to 0.5 events/bouton/min in 2 mM Ca2+).</p><p>We found that in this setting, transient increases in fluorescence (indicating possible false positives) had a reduced amplitude compared to bona fide spontaneous fusion events in 2 mM extracellular Ca2+ (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Moreover, when our detection criteria were set to identify negative increases in fluorescence amplitude, the absolute value of these -2X events were not different from the false positive events. Together these data validate our earlier detection criteria and indicate that our false positive detection rate is ∼ 10% per recording.</p><p>B) We compared the frame number difference between spontaneous increases in SypHTomato and PSD-95-GCaMP5K increases we found that 69% of spontaneous increases in SypHTomato elicited a PSD-95-GCaMP5K signal within ± 1 frame (±200 ms). This percentage increased to 83% between -1 frame to +5 frames. We have added these findings in the text.</p><p>C) We have analyzed the spontaneous vGlut-pHluorin fusion frequency data in two ways; independent of fluorescence amplitude, and dependent of fluorescence amplitude (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We have now included alternate hypotheses (preferential fusion of larger vesicles or non-normal distribution of event amplitudes possibly due to uneven distribution of fluorophores) in the text to better address the observed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent increase in fluorescence amplitude.</p><p>D) Finally we have added additional non-parametric statistical analyses (e.g. Spearman’s Correlation) to the spontaneous fusion rate and evoked fusion probability correlation plots. This further analysis showed that there is only extremely modest correlation between the two rates at 2 and 8 mM Ca2+ concentrations whereas no detectable correlation at 4 mM Ca2+.</p><p><italic>1) Quantification. How tightly linked are simultaneously occurring pre- (single vesicle release) and post-synaptic (Ca imaging) spontaneous events? Only postsynaptic events that follow immediately after presynaptic events are of relevance</italic>.</p><p>Below, we include a temporal correlation histogram of GCaMP5K event time (in frames) relative to SypHTo fusion (0 on the x axis). 67% of GCaMP events are within plus or minus 1 frame of the SypHTo event, increasing to 84% of events that occur from -1 to + 5 frames (∼1 sec). We include this -1 group because in our system we obtain only one time point for each cycle of imaging (thus one frame of both red channel and green channel constitute one time point). Therefore, fusion events that may occur halfway through an imaging cycle would appear shifted by -1 frame. Reanalysis of our data taking into consideration only these events that occur between -1 and +5 frames did not alter our previously reported data. We now also refer to these data in the text.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-03658-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) How well can different release sites (or nearby boutons) be separated? Are multiple vesicles being released from one bouton within 120 ms (if so, please do not call this multiquantal release, which is more in the time scale of one's and tens of millisec: that is confusing)?</italic></p><p>We cannot discriminate between multiquantal fusion and near-simultaneous fusion from nearby release sites. However, our evoked fusion probability estimates are consistent with earlier measurements of vesicle fusion probability using FM1-43 uptake into individual release sites under similar conditions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murthy et al., 1997</xref>). We now added this point to the text in the Results and in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) Are events from spontaneous and evoked release really different? One potential test: Do the evoked release events also correlate with a Ca signal that is driven by NMDARs?</italic></p><p>We do not mean to imply that the postsynaptic responses arising from spontaneous and evoked vesicle fusion are necessarily different. Earlier work from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atasoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sara et al., 2011</xref>) suggested a physical segregation between postsynaptic receptor activation patterns in response to evoked and spontaneous fusion events. However, so far, we did not detect any difference between the kinetic properties of evoked and spontaneous postsynaptic quantal events. Instead, in this study, we emphasize that retrieval and reacidification of spontaneously fusing vesicles are distinct from those of stimulation-evoked fusion vesicles. Unfortunately, we cannot measure quantal postsynaptic Ca2+ signals during stimulation, as in our preparation field stimulation itself causes direct postsynaptic effects. However, we are working to improve these recording conditions in our studies for the near future.</p><p><italic>4) There were also significant concerns about the histogram analysis and multiquantal release conclusion. It was unclear why a fixed delay between two sequential release events was used while alternative hypothesis (that these events are just a bit larger and the distribution is not exactly normal) was not considered simpler? At least the alternative interpretation should be discussed. Also, it is essential that the fusion frequencies (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>) are recalculated using the actual number of detected events (regardless of amplitude), so that the frequencies are not dependent on a specific interpretation such as multivesicular release</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that our multiquantal release conclusion is one of many interpretations to our data. In our estimations we used a fixed delay to provide a proof of principle argument that multiquantal release could account for these observations. Although, we could test additional delays and kinetic parameters, given our limited resolution of these events, we prefer to refrain from over interpreting of our data. We now include a discussion of these alternative interpretations of the data in the text. We now report spontaneous fusion frequency estimates with and without taking into account the potential multiquantal nature of the events (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) Results section: For the average decay time constant (e.g. 3.7s) and median decay time (e.g. 0.28) please add an error bar to these numbers as you have done elsewhere in the Results section</italic>.</p><p>We have now added error bars for these averages. Originally, we did not include error bars to these numbers because individual event parameters were not normally distributed. The non-geometric mean decay time constants were derived from fitting with β-distributions and instead we reported the upper and lower bounds of the distribution in the figure legends. Therefore, we have now included both geometric and non-geometric means in the text.</p><p><italic>2) Results section: For how long are the neurons bathed in the 50 mM TRIS solution before experiments are performed?</italic></p><p>We have added the duration of pre-incubation (10 min) to the Methods section.</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref> <italic>what was the average frequency of the spontaneous fusion events in 2 mM Ca and in 8 mM Ca? Please give the average number with error bar. It seems like a 3-fold increase in frequency. Also, what is the average increase in spontaneous mEPSC frequency from 2 mM external Ca to 8 mM external Ca? This seems like an easy experiment for the authors to conduct and it would be very interesting to compare the numbers of this change to the numbers from the imaging data.</italic></p><p>We have added the average frequency of spontaneous fusion events into the text. When we compare mEPSC rates at 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> we detect a ∼3.7-fold increase. In our optical experiments, we detect a ∼2.7-fold increase. Although the increase in spontaneous fusion rate detected by these two methods are in broad agreement (as we now indicated in the text), we would like to refrain from a detailed comparison at this time in the current manuscript to avoid over-interpreting our results. A reliable comparison of optical/electrophysiological data is constrained by the fact that the two measures are not obtained simultaneously and electrophysiological readout of distal synapses may be altered electrotonically.</p><p><italic>4) Change the first paragraph of the Discussion into three paragraphs.</italic></p><p>We agree and we have made this change.</p><p><italic>5) Why not try the experiment in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>with an external solution that is based on 25 mM bicarbonate (a more physiological pH buffer)?

Seems like a CV of about 0.4-0.5, which is close to that of mEPSCs. It would be interesting to know how well these match each other</italic>.</p><p>We have added the CV of our amplitude distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend). However we caution comparing the two as the CV for the optical experiments is dependent on the number of pHluorins per vesicle (in addition to the number of vesicles) while the CV for mEPSCs depends on the number of postsynaptic receptors present and electrotonic filtering (besides the number of vesicles), and thus may be susceptible to different degrees of variance.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) A major point is that it is not clear that the optically detected 'spontaneous events' really represent fusion of synaptic vesicles, and not for instance fusion of endosomes. The authors in principle address this point elegantly by co-expressing a fluorescence calcium-indicator (GCaMP5K) fused to PSD-95 and doing dual-color imaging. This is a nice approach, but from the text and analysis presented it does not become clear whether there was a tight correlation between pre- and post-synaptic events, and therefore there is not enough evidence for the conclusion: “...spontaneous fusing vesicles elicit postsynaptic Ca2+ signals”. For instance in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref><italic>: are those events (red and green channel) detected simultaneously? How often did spontaneous increases in the red channel correlate with increases in the green channel? How many events in the red channel did not coincide with events in the green channel? The authors could calculate and plot the waiting times between sequential red and green events at identified synapses. If the authors are right, such a plot should have a peak at very short intervals. Finally, the authors write “Spontaneous increases in fluorescence that were correlated (within {plus minus} 1 s) with Ca2+ signals..” I do not understand the {plus minus} here: presumably the relevant events would be those were the red event would precede (or coincide with) the green event, not the other way around. Overall, the authors need to present additional analysis of these data</italic>.</p><p>We have corrected the text to state that we are looking at events that occur within -1 to +5 frames of the SypHTo signals. We found that the majority (84%) of events occurred within this time. Please refer to the answer we provided above for further details.</p><p><italic>2) I am skeptical about the conclusion that the larger amplitudes of events at higher calcium concentrations are due to multivesicular release (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>, text in the Results section). The larger events in the presence of higher calcium concentration could be because of the preferential fusion of slightly larger vesicles under these circumstances (or even due to a change in the photophysical properties of pHluorin). The author's argument doesn't make sense to me: ”It is unlikely that this increase in fluorescence is due to variation in the number of pHluorin molecules, as the increase in amplitude is observed when extracellular Ca2+ concentrations are increased.“ Why not? The histogram of event sizes could not be fitted with a single Gaussian, but who is to say whether spontaneously fusing vesicles exactly follow a Gaussian distribution? The three distributions at 1q, 1.3q and 2q are not visible as peaks in the histogram at all; especially the fit of a distribution at 2q appears unreasonable. Finally, the suggestion that events with normalized amplitude at 1.3 q would result from multivesicular release of two vesicles with a fixed delay (118 ms) appears unreasonable; what mechanism would ensure that multivesicular release would happen always with this delay, especially as this is spontaneous release? I think the authors should remove this interpretation, which has consequences also for the interpretation of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>and for the rates reported in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>and possibly in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref>.</p><p>We have included alternative interpretations of our data in the text. Briefly, we cannot exclude that the larger events are the preferential fusion of slightly larger vesicles. However, we believe it is unlikely that the larger events are due to a change in the photophysical properties of pHluorin as earlier studies including our own did not detect significant difference in unitary fluorescence amplitudes as a function of extracellular Ca2+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Balaji and Ryan 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitz and Kavalali 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The authors use the lack of a correlation between decay time and amplitude as an argument that “there is a fundamental difference in the kinetics of endocytosis and reacidification between vesicles that fuse spontaneously and those that fuse in response to stimulation.” But I would argue that this finding, together with the previous work of the authors,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25"><italic>Leitz and Kavalali, 2001</italic></xref> <italic>is an argument against the interpretation of multivesicular release</italic>.</p><p>We have added a note discussing this possibility in addition to our interpretation to the text.</p><p><italic>4) To follow up on the last statement above in point 2, to estimate the fusion frequencies (reported in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>) the authors “counted all events with amplitudes within the first quantal mean as a single event, and events with larger amplitudes as two events”. This is not appropriate, first because it is not clear whether larger events represent multiple events, and second because the distributions at 1q and 1.3q overlap. The authors should only use the number of events that they can detect as such, independently of amplitude. The same goes for</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>, if the rates were calculated in the same way</italic>.</p><p>We have clarified how we selected events in the text and have added both possible interpretations to the Figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) The correlation analysis in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B-D</italic></xref> <italic>has not been described in the statistics section of the Materials and Methods. Was this Pearson's correlation coefficient? The R^2 is quite small, but nevertheless the slope is positive under all circumstances. The authors should add a statistical test of the hypothesis R=0, and report whether there is a significant (but small) correlation. Finally, the authors should explain why all evoked fusion probabilities are integer multiples of 0.1 (panel C, D), or 0.05 (panel B). Why this difference between the conditions? Finally, given that fusion probabilities can be measured in only 10 (C, D), or 20 (B) discrete categories, would non-parametric correlation analysis be more appropriate?</italic></p><p>We agree, we have detailed the statistics used in the Materials and methods.

Briefly, due to the low release probability in 2 mM extracellular Ca2+, we stimulated neurons twice as much with half the inter-stimulation interval to increase the number of events we detect.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) Detection of single, spontaneous release events is a crucial technique for this paper. Though the amplitude distribution of the detected events looks convincing, it would also be useful to show how the distribution shifts when spontaneous release is blocked (i.e. with tetanus toxin incubation). Additionally, it is not clear how the noise events were detected. It would also be necessary to show how what the detection criteria discover when run with a negative amplitude (i.e. -2X the SD of the 17 points prior to the event)</italic>.</p><p>We agree, however we opted to use extracellular medium with nominal Ca<sup>2+</sup> to attenuate the rate of spontaneous release rather than attempt to abolish release using tetanus toxin. We chose this approach because previous work implicates the vesicular SNARE machinery may itself participate in and control the kinetics of endocytosis (Deak et al., 2004, Zhang et al., 2013) thus adding a layer of complexity to the experiments. In 0 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and in the presence of folimycin, we only detected 29 genuine events (staircase patterns as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig6">Figure 1 and 6</xref>) from 200 synapses over 10 minutes pooled from 4 coverslips. We found the amplitudes of false positive events, events that were detected using our criteria but where the amplitude returned to baseline despite folimycin presence, were smaller than what we detect in the case of events we identify as genuine spontaneous fusion. These small amplitudes of false positive events were similar to the amplitudes of the false negative events we identified when the detection criteria were run with a negative amplitude (i.e. -2X the SD of the 17 points prior to the event). This data are now shown in revised Figure 1L. Furthermore, in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> we found when we ran our detection criteria with a negative amplitude we had a hit rate of 0.065 events per minute.</p><p><italic>2) For</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>, the correlation between the spontaneous pHluorin events and spontaneous Ca2+ events was stated to be {plus minus} 1 s. While the limitations for time resolution in the dual color imaging are expected, since the vesicle release should directly cause the Ca2+ influx, these events should really only be considered if the Ca2+ influx occurs in a time range after the detected pHluorin event</italic>.</p><p>We agree, however, in our imaging system we only acquire one time stamp for one frame of both green and red channel. Therefore, if a fusion event occurred during the acquisition of the red channel it is possible for the subsequent Ca2+ signal in the green channel to be detected first and thus be reported one “frame” earlier and thus &gt;200 ms earlier. When we plot the temporal distribution of our events, we found that despite the ±1 s criterion, the majority of events occurred within ±1 frame (± 200 ms) of the red channel (please see the plot we present above). We have clarified this in the text.</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>. What do the corresponding Ca2+ signals look like for the evoked SypHTomato events? Can they be more closely time-locked?</italic></p><p>Unfortunately we cannot image the corresponding Ca2+ signal for the evoked fusion events as leaving NMDARs unblocked will generate recurrent activity in our culture system since we must also exclude TTX from the bath solution (please see our response to summary comment #3 above).</p><p><italic>4)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>. Multivesicular release events recorded by electrophysiology are thought to occur essentially simultaneously. The 1.3q events seem likely to be events happening with a 118 ms delay. Also to this point, how well resolved are the single release sites? Could the multiple vesicle release events be closely neighboring synapses, which happen to release vesicles in close temporal proximity? Also</italic>, <italic>are the multivesicular spontaneous events Ca2+ dependent? How do they look in the presence of Cd2+?</italic></p><p>Our estimates of evoked and spontaneous fusion rates suggest that in the majority of boutons we detect release from a single release site. We agree that the role of voltage-gated Ca+ channels in driving these putative multivesicular events could be interesting to examine. However, we would like to perform these experiments using specific toxins rather than Cd2+. Ongoing work in our laboratory suggests that these events are unaltered in Cd2+, however, our data on this topic is too preliminary to report at this time.</p><p><italic>5)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>. The frequency of spontaneous release events clearly increases in 8 mM Ca2+ in the presence of folimycin. The authors explain this as recruitment of very rapidly retrieved vesicles. However, does the frequency of spontaneous events also increase in folimycin with 2 mM Ca2+? From the Figure, it doesn't appear to, but it would be interesting to see</italic>.</p><p>The frequency of events in 2 mM Ca2+, if any, show a slight decrease in folimycin.</p><p><italic>6)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>. This is an important figure for the authors' interpretation of the separate pools of vesicles (spontaneous and evoked) released with distinct properties at single synapses. However, a few issues could cloud the interpretation from the lack of correlation between evoked fusion probability and spontaneous release frequency. First, for an event to be considered evoked with a 1 s lag time from the stimulus seems too long even for asynchronous release with a single action potential. Second, there is again the issue of spatial resolution. Are these actually single release sites? Finally, the release probability (the calculation of which should be clearly stated in the text) seems very high for these synapses in 4 mM Ca2+. This could argue for the multiple release site measurement</italic>.</p><p>Our evoked release probability estimates at 2 mM Ca2+ (∼ 0.15) are in line with earlier measurements in hippocampal synapses. Therefore, we believe in a majority of cases we detect release from single release sites. It is important to note that hippocampal synapses do not show significant asynchronous release under physiological circumstances.</p><p><italic>7) Figure S1. The increase in signal for the PSD-95-GCaMP5K is difficult to interpret, because it could be due to either the increased extracellular Ca2+ or due to the increased multivesicular release events. This could also be interesting to see in the presence of Cd2+</italic>.</p><p>We agree there could be multiple reasons for the increase in the Ca2+ signal. At this time, we prefer not to expand on this observation in depth particularly due to the fact that these signals are recorded in the absence of extracellular Mg2+. We are currently working on another study to examine the properties of postsynaptic Ca2+ signals triggered by spontaneous fusion events under more physiological circumstances.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were requested before acceptance, as shown below.]</p><p><italic>1) Regarding detection of events, the authors added improved analysis. One reviewer would like to see addition of “false positive” events either from negative implement the detection (inversed) or from 0 Ca2+ to the histograms for amplitude and decay times. In addition, it would be helpful to subtract weighted average decay of false positives from weighted average decay of spontaneous events to obtain “net events”</italic></p><p>We have included the false positive events in the decay times histogram (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> panel D). Because we have already included the amplitudes in the cumulative probability histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> panel L) we did not include the bars to the histograms. We have calculated a weighted average for the decay times and there was no change in decay time due to the relatively small contribution of false positive hits. We now refer to this data in the Results section (as well as in the revised Figure Legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Coincidence of pre- and postsynaptic events: The detection of postsynaptic responses at the -1 frame will still be confusing to the reader, and additional clarification in the text is required. Given that the distribution of events puts most of them between 0 to 5 frames after stimulation, this is the time window that the authors should use for analysis. They will lose very few events and it will be more straightforward as it makes little sense that the postsynaptic signal should occur prior to the presynaptic signal. If the -1 frame events are to be included, the explanation for why these events would appear to occur before the stimulation, as included in the rebuttal letter must also be in the text</italic>.</p><p><italic>Unfortunately, the postsynaptic signals coupled to the evoked Syp-Tomato signals are missing, and this is still an obvious gap in the paper. As the authors explain in the rebuttal letter, this is due to an understandable technical issues with field stimulation and network activity, although that the field stimulation itself causes a signal is strange when NMDARs are not blocked by Mg2+. Again, the authors should address this issue in the text. Pointing out to the reader that the recording the postsynaptic events with stimulation is technically difficult does not take anything away from the findings, and will also preempt questions from a reader who sees the comparison of the postsynaptic signals generated by evoked or spontaneous release as the obvious next step</italic>.</p><p>We agree and we have included these arguments in the text.</p><p><italic>3) Release probability vs spontaneous release: There is only a 50% increase in the average spontaneous fusion rate with Ca2+ increase to 8 mM, while average release probability increases 3-fold. This figure could simply suggest that the release frequency of minis is much, much less sensitive to calcium than evoked release probability. This should be discussed by the authors</italic>.</p><p>We agree. We now refer to this observation in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>4) Sensitivity to detect individual events/multiquantal release: Overall, the single site, multiquantal spontaneous release claim is still not convincing (or at least multiple release site cannot be ruled out convincingly). I do not understand how the</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31"><italic>Murthy et al., 1997</italic></xref> <italic>citation excludes the possibility that the authors are not detecting coincident release from neighboring synapses and not the multi-quantal events they report-particularly as the release probability they claim will result in individual sites in 2mM Ca2+ and this will be less likely occur as Ca2+ increases. Additionally, aside from the increase in release probability with increased calcium, other factors that contribute to ability to differentiate individual synapses include the density of synapse and the amount of binning</italic>.</p><p><italic>The discrepancy between mEPSC frequency increase in electrophysiological recordings and optical recordings of spontaneous events (though small) could suggest the events reported as multiquantal are, in fact, neighboring synapses. It would be worth testing when the portion of the population of events with 1.3 q and 2 q amplitudes are treated as individual events from neighboring synapses, does the frequency increase of the optical recordings better match the electrophysiological ones</italic>.</p><p>We now refer to this issue more specifically with the following section inserted into the Discussion section.</p><p>“As noted above, at our resolution we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed increase in amplitude could be due to vesicle fusion from multiple release sites within a region of interest, especially if elevated Ca2+ concentrations can activate adjacent release sites resulting in apparent multivesicular release albeit originating from two neighboring release sites. The discrepancy between the increases in mEPSC frequency we detect in electrophysiological recordings versus optical recordings of spontaneous events could indicate that some of the multivesicular events are occurring at neighboring synapses activated at elevated Ca2+.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
