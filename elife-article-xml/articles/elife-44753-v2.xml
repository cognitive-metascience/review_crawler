At the start of their life, most ascidians spend their first few days as free-swimming tadpole larvae. It is at the larval stage that ascidians display unmistakable chordate traits, including a prominent notochord running the length of a muscular tail and a dorsal central nervous system (CNS). Ascidian morphology abruptly changes when the larvae attach via their adhesive palps and undergo metamorphosis, the product of which is a sessile filter-feeding juvenile with little resemblance to the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Satoh, 1994</xref>). Largely because of their conserved chordate body plan, ascidian embryos and larvae have been subjects of extensive investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Satoh, 2014</xref>). Ascidian larvae are small in comparison to vertebrate larvae, with the <italic>Ciona</italic> larva measuring only about 1 mm in length, with a total of ~2,600 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Satoh, 2014</xref>). Accordingly, the larval <italic>Ciona</italic> CNS is equally simple, having ~170 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryan et al., 2016</xref>). Despite this simplicity, <italic>Ciona</italic> larvae display a range of integrated behaviors, including negative gravitaxis and phototaxis, and a response to dimming ambient light, all mediated by central sensory neurons. Also well documented is a mechanosensory/touch response, and possibly chemosensation, mediated by peripheral sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>). Anatomically, the <italic>Ciona</italic> larval CNS is comprised anteriorly of the <italic>brain vesicle</italic> (BV; also known as the <italic>sensory vesicle</italic>), a region homologous to the vertebrate forebrain and midbrain, followed by the <italic>neck</italic> region, a homolog of the vertebrate midbrain/hindbrain junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Immediately posterior to the neck is the <italic>motor ganglion</italic> (MG; also known as the <italic>visceral ganglion</italic>). The MG is thought to be homologous to the vertebrate hindbrain and/or spinal cord, and contains ten motor neurons (MN) as well as a number of interneurons – including the two <italic>descending decussating neurons</italic> (ddN) which have been equated with vertebrate Mauthner cells which mediate the startle response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ryan et al., 2017</xref>). With the completion of a synaptic connectome from one larva, the <italic>Ciona</italic> larval nervous system is now one of the best described, with the connectome providing a detailed and quantitative connectivity matrix of the 6618 chemical and 1206 electrical CNS synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44753.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cartoon of a <italic>Ciona</italic> tadpole larva with outline of the central nervous system.</title><p>The minimal visuomotor circuit is shown with circles representing classes of neurons with the number of cells of each class indicated in the parentheses of the key.

The larval photoreceptors are ciliary, like those of vertebrates, and the photoreceptor opsins and visual cycle systems are, likewise, similar to those found in the vertebrate retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kusakabe and Tsuda, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kusakabe et al., 2001</xref>). The primary photoreceptive organ of <italic>Ciona</italic> is the ocellus, which consists of two groups of photoreceptors, three lens cells, and one pigment cell. The first group of photoreceptors (called here, PR-I) is comprised of 23 cells and clustered around the ocellus pigment cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The opsin-containing outer segments of the PR-Is project into the cup shaped pigment cell, making this group sensitive to the direction of incident light and thereby mediating negative phototaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horie et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salas et al., 2018</xref>). The second group of ocellus photoreceptors (PR-II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is comprised of seven cells and is adjacent and anterior to the PR-Is, and is not associated with the pigment cell. The PR-II cluster mediates the light dimming response, likely with a contribution from the PR-Is, by evoking highly tortuous and leftward-biased swims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salas et al., 2018</xref>). There is a third set of six photoreceptors (PR-IIIs) distal to the ocellus of unknown function, although they are not involved in phototaxis or the dimming response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horie et al., 2008a</xref>), nor do they make extensive connections to interneurons, as do the PR-I and -IIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The relationship between the ascidian ocellus and visual systems in other chordates is not fully resolved. Vertebrates are characterized by the presence of paired lateral (<italic>i.e</italic>., retinal) eyes, as well as an unpaired medial/pineal eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lamb et al., 2007</xref>). The cephalochordate <italic>Amphioxus</italic> by contrast, has four distinct photoreceptive organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pergner and Kozmik, 2017</xref>). The amphioxus <italic>frontal eye</italic> has been proposed as homologous to the vertebrate lateral eyes, while the <italic>lamellar body</italic> is thought to be homologous to the vertebrate pineal organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pergner and Kozmik, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vopalensky et al., 2012</xref>). The other two amphioxus photoreceptor types, the <italic>dorsal ocelli</italic> and the <italic>Joseph cells</italic>, are thought, based on a number of criteria, including their rhabdomeric morphology- which differs from the ciliary morphology of vertebrate and ascidian photoreceptors- to be vestiges of a more primitive photoreceptive system. Based on various criteria the ascidian ocellus has been proposed as having homology to either the medial or the retinal eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kusakabe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lamb et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Ciona</italic> larval connectome predicts the neural circuity linking photoreceptors to motor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryan et al., 2016</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the simplified minimal visuomotor circuit in which neurons of the same type are clustered (<italic>e.g.</italic>, photoreceptors) and the number of neurons of each type is indicated in parentheses. The full connectivity for the visuomotor circuit showing all neurons along with chemical and gap junction/electrical synapses (and their relative strengths) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>, respectively (derived from data tables in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryan et al., 2016</xref>]). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, gap junctions are few and relatively small in the BV and become more prominent in the MG.</p><p>The minimal circuit shows the PR-I and –II photoreceptors synapsing primarily onto two classes of relay neurons (RNs) in the posterior BV (pBV). The six <italic>photoreceptor RNs</italic> (prRN) receive input exclusively from the PR-I photoreceptors and then project posteriorly to the paired right/left <italic>MG interneurons</italic> (three on each side; MGIN in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A second cluster of eight RNs, the <italic>photoreceptor ascending MG RNs</italic> (pr-AMG RN) are postsynaptic to both the PR-I and PR-II photoreceptors, and are so-named because they, unlike the prRNs, receive input from the <italic>ascending MG peripheral interneurons</italic> (AMG neurons; not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). There are also extensive synaptic connections between the pr-AMG RNs and the prRNs. Like the prRNs, the pr-AMG RNs project posteriorly to the left and right MGINs. The MGINs in turn synapse onto the paired right and left motor neurons (five on each side). The <italic>Ciona</italic> connectome thus predicts a complete visuomotor circuit from photoreceptors to muscle target cells, and provides a valuable comparative model to their chordate cousins, the vertebrates and cephalochordates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vopalensky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nilsson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suzuki et al., 2015</xref>), as well as to other well-described but much more distantly related models such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Platynereis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larderet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Randel et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we report that the <italic>Ciona</italic> PR-I and PR-II visual circuits operate by very different logic. We find that the PR-I circuit is an excitatory relay from glutamatergic photoreceptors signaling to AMPA receptors on cholinergic prRNs. On the other hand, the PR-II circuit initiates with GABAergic photoreceptors synapsing onto GABAergic pr-AMG RNs. Both the sequential array of GABAergic neurons in this pathway and the behavior of larvae treated with GABA inhibitors, or carrying a mutation that misspecifies the anterior BV, support a model in which this circuit is disinhibitory.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Glutamatergic and GABAergic photoreceptors</title><p>The <italic>Ciona</italic> connectome provides a detailed description of chemical synapse connectivity but it provides no information on neurotransmitter (NT) use. While the expression of genes in the <italic>Ciona</italic> CNS and PNS that mark NT use [<italic>e.g.,</italic> vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT), vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VACHT) for glutamatergic, GABAergic/glycinergic, dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons, respectively] has been extensively reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horie et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moret et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pennati et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takamura et al., 2010</xref>), finding exact matches of expression patterns to neurons, or groups of neurons, in the connectome is not always possible. For example, the ocellus is reported to have widespread VGLUT expression, indicating that the <italic>Ciona</italic> photoreceptors, like those of vertebrates are glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horie et al., 2008b</xref>). However, the expression domains of both VGAT and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are suggestive of a subpopulation of GABAergic/glycinergic photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoshida et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zega et al., 2008</xref>), although the identities of these cells within the ocellus is not known. To investigate this further, fertilized eggs from a stable transgenic <italic>Ciona</italic> line expressing <italic>kaede</italic> fluorescent protein under the VGAT promoter (pVGAT &gt; kaede) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horie et al., 2011</xref>) were microinjected with a pOpsin1 &gt; red fluorescent protein (RFP) construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kusakabe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kusakabe et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; n = 5 larvae observed). We observed a subset of photoreceptors coexpressing the two fluorescent markers both at the anterior and ventral sides of the ocellus (white and orange arrowheads, respectively). In the field of view shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, the eminens cells is also evident due to its expression of VGAT (white arrow), in agreement with earlier reports of GAD expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takamura et al., 2010</xref>). To investigate BV VGLUT and VGAT expression in greater detail we used Hybridization Chain Reaction in situ (HCR in situ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horie et al., 2008b</xref>) we observed VGLUT expression in the ocellus (blue arrowhead), the two otolith antenna cells (AC), and in epidermal sensory neurons (red arrowheads). Consistent with the above transgenic data, VGAT was expressed in two separate clusters within the ocellus (white and orange arrowheads), as well as in a separate group of BV neurons outside the ocellus corresponding to previously described VGAT-positive neurons that project axons to the MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoshida et al., 2004</xref>) (labeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> as RNs, see next section). The anterior VGAT-expressing photoreceptor cluster consisted of 7 cells (±1 cell, n = 17 larvae), while the posterior group consisted of two cells (n = 20 larvae). We also observed a subset of the VGAT-expressing cells in both the anterior and posterior clusters that also expressed VGLUT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). In the anterior cluster, we observed that the 2 cells (±1; n = 4 VGAT/VGLUT double in situ larvae) at the anterior edge exclusively expressed VGAT (white arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), while the four cells immediately posterior to these cells co-expressed VGAT and VGLUT. In the posterior cluster we observed in all samples (n = 5) that one of two cells co-expressed VGAT and VGLUT, while the other only expressed VGAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, orange arrowheads).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44753.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Neurotransmitter use in the ocellus.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Coexpression of opsin and VGAT reporter constructs in the ocellus (white and orange arrowheads).

The anterior/ventral location of the two VGAT-only PR-IIs suggest that they are PR-b and –e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). By contrast, the majority of the PR-Is are exclusively glutamatergic with the exception of two ventral cells, one co-expressing VGAT and VGLUT and the other expressing only VGAT. While the identities of the PR-II subpopulations were evident from the ocellus anatomy, the identities of the two VGAT-expressing PR-Is were initially less clear. To get a better indication of the identities of these two cells we performed a registration of cell centroids from multiple in situ datasets (n = 11) with the centroids from the connectome serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) dataset. This registration would only be meaningful if there is strong stereotypy in the number and position of the neurons among <italic>Ciona</italic> larvae. The ocellus photoreceptor somata and their outer segments are known to be arranged in rows, suggesting an ordered cellular architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horie et al., 2008a</xref>). Moreover, we reasoned that stereotypy in the ocellus, if present, should be evident when registering VGAT- and VGLUT-expressing cells, both across multiple in situ-stained larvae, and individually to the ssEM photoreceptor centroids. Convergence of NT type with registered photoreceptors (both between HCR in situ samples and between these and the ssEM sample) would be taken as evidence of stereotypy, and of the validity of making NT use predictions.</p><p>For photoreceptor registration, DAPI-stained ocellus nuclei from VGAT and VGLUT in situ labeled larvae were segmented from 3D image stacks to serve as cell centroids (nuclei are indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> as red spheres). Based on the in situ signal, each centroid was designated as VGAT or VGLUT, or both. Finally, the antenna cell and ddN nuclei in the image stacks were segmented to serve as anchor points for registration. Registration of the segmented HCR in situ nuclei to each other and to the connectome PR-I nuclei was done according to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Myronenko and Song, 2010</xref>). Briefly, rotation and affine transformations were applied to each set of in situ nuclei coordinates to register them individually to the connectome cell nuclei coordinates. The results are presented as a heat map showing for each PR-I the relative frequencies it registered with an in situ centroid of each NT type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). To assess the validity of registration, a confusion matrix was constructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stehman, 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In this analysis each set of HCR in situ centroids was registered to all other HCR in situ datasets, and to the connectome centroids. The confusion matrix shows the number of times a registration of the HCR in situ centroid to a connectome centroid corresponds with the registration of another HCR in situ dataset. The higher the values along the diagonal of the matrix, the more the datasets agree with each other when registered to the connectome centroids. From the matrix we observed strong overall support for the registration, although with variable confidence for each photoreceptor. The heat map indicates that among the PR-Is, PR-9 is likely to be exclusively VGAT-positive, while PR-10 is likely to be both VGAT- and VGLUT-positive. The confusion matrix gives high confidence to this assignment, particularly for PR-9. Although PR-9 and PR-10 appear to stand out from the other PR-Is in their NT use, the connectivity of these two photoreceptors in the visuomotor pathway does not appear to be qualitatively different than the other PR-Is (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, the heat map confirms that the other PR-Is are exclusively VGLUT, however with lower confidence for PR-16, which failed to register well.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Posterior brain vesicle relay neurons are mixed VGAT- and VACHT-expressing</title><p>Sensory input from the photoreceptors, antenna cells, coronet cells, bipolar tail neurons and a subset of peripheral neurons is directed to a cluster of ~30 RNs in the pBV.

Previous in situ hybridization studies identified VGAT- and VACHT-expressing neurons in the appropriate place in the BV to be RNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoshida et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, these neurons project axons posteriorly to the MG, a defining characteristic of the pBV RNs.

However, given the diversity of RN types in the pBV it is unlikely that the expression domains of VGAT and VACHT precisely correspond to the clusters of RN classes. In order to make predictions of NT use in the RNs we used the same registration approach as with the photoreceptors (n = 7 VGAT/VACHT double in situ datasets, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The confusion matrix for the RNs shows a lower level of convergence than for the PR-Is, suggesting that the cellular anatomy of the RN cluster is less structured than the ocellus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the confusion matrix also shows that the RNs are most often confused for other RNs of the same class (white boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This is most evident when the registration is performed not with single cells, but with pooled RNs of each class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), and is presumably a reflection of the clustering of RN classes in the pBV. Thus we can have higher confidence in the NT use by RN class than we can have in individual neuron identities. For example, the connectome shows the AntRNs are clustered at the rear of the BV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryan et al., 2016</xref>)), as are the VGAT expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Accordingly, the registration predicts that eight of the ten AntRNs are VGAT positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). For the present study, which focuses on the visuomotor pathway, the registration predicts that five of the eight pr-AMG RNs are VGAT expressing, two are VACHT expressing, and one (pr-AMG RN 157) cannot be resolved (no dual VGAT/VACHT expression was observed in the <italic>in situs</italic>). On the other hand, the registration predicts that the six prRNs are evenly mixed between VGAT and VACHT expression. These predictions provide starting points for experimental validation detailed below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The motor ganglion contains a mixture of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons</title><p>The MG contains five left/right pairs of motor neurons, as well as several classes of interneurons, including six MGINs, seven AMGs, two ddNs, and two posterior MG interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryan et al., 2016</xref>).

However, the connectome reports only three ACINs, with the anterior ACIN not paired. It was speculated that this was an anomalous feature of the particular larva used for the ssEM. Supporting this, a second larva being analyzed by ssEM for connectomics shows two pairs of ACINs (K. Ryan, personal communication).</p><p>Like the ocellus, the MG has a well-defined anterior-to-posterior and dorsal-to-ventral cellular anatomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>).

In a dorsal view of the MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f,g and h</xref>) a ring of VGAT-positive cells was observed with a non-VGAT expressing cell in the center (asterisk, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f and g</xref>). The VGAT-expressing cells appear to be AMGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7, while the central cell, which is instead positive for VACHT, appears to be AMG5. The connectome shows that AMG5 differs in its connectivity from the other AMGs. Significantly, AMG5 is the principle synaptic input for PNS neurons. It then synapses to the other AMGs, which in turn project their axons to other cells in the MG, including MGINs and MNs, as well as to the pr-AMG RNs in the BV. In the posterior of the MG we observed two pairs of VGAT-positive neurons, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horie et al., 2009</xref>).

Moreover, we can identify the VACHT/AMPAR-positive RNs as essential for an excitatory PR-I circuit that involves presynaptic glutamatergic PR-Is and postsynaptic cholinergic MGINs. The number and location of the VACHT/AMPAR-positive RNs, the circuit logic, and our behavioral observations are all consistent with these being prRNs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A disinhibitory circuit</title><p>Of equal significance to our observation that navigation is inhibited by perampanel, is our observation that the dimming response, which is mediated by the PR-IIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salas et al., 2018</xref>), is not inhibited by perampanel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Our expression studies show that the PR-IIs are comprised of a mixture of VGAT- and VGAT/VGLUT-expressing photoreceptors. Although it is formally possible that PR-IIs signal exclusively via glutamate in an excitatory circuit via a non-AMPA glutamate receptor on their RNs, our observations that several of the PR-IIs are VGAT-only, as are the majority of the pr-AMG RNs, suggests an alternative disinhibitory circuitry logic. This circuit would consist of the inhibitory PR-IIs synapsing to the pr-AMG RNs to reduce their inhibition on the cholinergic MGINs.</p><p>Implicit in the disinhibitory model is an autonomous level of motor activity in larvae that could be inhibited by the GABAergic pr-AMG RNs, and that this inhibition is released upon stimulation of the GABAergic PR-IIs. We investigated this possibility by two approaches. In the first approach, we inhibited GABAergic receptors with picrotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olsen, 2014</xref>), which should inhibit signals from the GABAergic photoreceptors and the pr-AMG RNs (and most likely the AntRNs), as well as PNS relay neurons, including the eminens cells and the AMGs. The ACINs, which are essential for the central pattern generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nishino et al., 2010</xref>), are glycinergic and should not be inhibited by picrotoxin. In the second approach, we took advantage of a previously described <italic>Ciona</italic> mutant, <italic>frimousse (frm)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deschet and Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hackley et al., 2013</xref>).

We observed that longer exposure to picrotoxin (&gt;1 hr) resulted in the nearly complete inhibition of spontaneous and induced swimming behavior, presumably due to overactivation at excitatory synapses following removal of inhibitory input. However, this could be reversed by washing out the picrotoxin (data not shown). This inhibitory effect was evident in assessing negative phototaxis behavior of picrotoxin-treated larvae. While these assays are typically conducted over several hours (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), this was not possible with the picrotoxin-treated larvae.

Instead, we observed a preponderance of very short swims that likely reflect the elevated rate of spontaneous tail-flick swims in the larvae. Nevertheless, there remained a number of sustained swims in the picrotoxin-treated larvae. While it is possible that these were due to incomplete inhibition by picrotoxin, we feel it was more likely due to a small contribution from the PR-Is to the dimming response, as we have speculated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salas et al., 2018</xref>). In support of this, we observed that treatment of larvae with picrotoxin and perampanel completely eliminated the evoked sustained swims.

Although the frequency of swims was higher in <italic>frm</italic> larvae, the average swim time was not significantly different between the two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>; n = 260 and 608, respectively). However as with the picrotoxin-treated larvae, a handful of very long swims were observed uniquely in the <italic>frm</italic> group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). Despite the similarity in the swim times between the <italic>frm</italic> and wild type larvae, the swim characteristics were very different (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>), with the swimming of <italic>frm</italic> larvae being much more stereotyped. For example, while average swim times of wild type and <italic>frm</italic> larvae were very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>), the standard deviations of swim times calculated and plotted for each larva show much lower swim-to-swim variation in the <italic>frm</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>; p&lt;5×10<sup>−15</sup>). The stereotypy was even more pronounced when the time interval between swims was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>).

Absent from this model is the detailed and unique connectivity of each neuron in these pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), as well as the inputs from other neurons which are not part of the minimal circuit. Nevertheless, we feel that this model will serve as a useful starting point for more detailed analyses of these components. Our findings support a model for two parallel visuomotor pathways, one mediated by the PR-Is and sensitive to the direction of light, and the other mediated by the PR-IIs and sensitive to changes in ambient light. A number of other sensory systems, including mammalian vision and olfaction and <italic>Drosophila</italic> CO<sub>2</sub> detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Callaway, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geramita et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2013</xref>) similarly split components of sensory information into parallel circuits. The PR-I circuit is a simple excitatory pathway with glutamatergic photoreceptors projecting to cholinergic prRNs, exciting them via cation-specific ionotropic AMPARs. The prRNs in turn synapse to the cholinergic MGINs, and then these onto the MNs. The fact that glutamate is used by the <italic>Ciona</italic> larvae exclusively in sensory neurons (photoreceptors, antenna cells, and epidermal sensory neurons), coupled with the very limited distribution of AMPARs, allowed us to validate essential components of this circuitry with perampanel. The PR-Is also synapse onto the pr-AMG RNs, which are predicted to be primarily GABAergic. Our observation that AMPAR expression is exclusive to the cholinergic RNs suggests that the response of GABAergic cells to the PR-Is may differ from cholinergic cells, and perhaps plays a role in visual information processing. In fact, the interconnections between the pr-AMG RNs and the AMPAR-expressing prRNs (black arrow <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), are suggestive of an incoherent feedforward loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alon, 2007</xref>). We have already documented that <italic>Ciona</italic> larvae are able to phototax in a wide range of illumination conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salas et al., 2018</xref>), and moreover, we have found that <italic>Ciona</italic> larvae show robust fold-change detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler and Alon, 2018</xref>) behavior (manuscript in preparation). Together these observations suggest that the RN cluster plays a role in visual processing, rather than simply passing information to the MG.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44753.025</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Models showing parallel visuomotor pathways for negative phototaxis (top) and light dimming response (bottom).</title><p>Neurotransmitters in parentheses are thought to play a lesser role in the proposed pathway.

From in situ hybridization we observed that some PR-IIs exclusively express VGAT, while other co-express VGAT and VGLUT. The significance of VGAT/VGLUT coexpression in the <italic>Ciona</italic> visuomotor pathway is not yet clear, although similar coexpression is widely observed in mammalian brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fattorini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zander et al., 2010</xref>) and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fabian-Fine et al., 2015</xref>). It is speculated that co-release of GABA and GLUT may serve to tune excitatory/inhibitory balance. While the connectome shows that not all of the PR-IIs project to the RNs, with a subset instead forming extensive connections to other PR-Is and PR-IIs, the connectome indicates that several of the VGAT-exclusive PR-IIs do project to the pr-AMG RNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryan et al., 2016</xref>), consistent with our hypothesis that the PR-II output to the pr-AMG RNs is predominantly inhibitory.</p><p>The <italic>Ciona</italic> genome encodes seven ionotropic/Cl<sup>-</sup> GABA receptor subunit genes (GABA<sub>A</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Okamura et al., 2005</xref>), but does not have an ortholog of the cationic EXP-1 GABA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beg and Jorgensen, 2003</xref>), confirmation that the GABAergic synaptic events are most likely inhibitory. In addition, electrophysiological studies done nearly fifty years ago on larvae of the ascidian <italic>Amaroucium constellatum</italic> reported that their photoreceptors, like those of vertebrates, were hyperpolarizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gorman et al., 1971</xref>). In other words, dimming is likely to result in a release of GABA from the PR-IIs. Although the heterogeneity of ascidian photoreceptors (<italic>e.g</italic>., PR-I and –II) was not known at the time, both the vertebrate-like ciliary structure shared by all <italic>Ciona</italic> photoreceptors and the structure of <italic>Ciona</italic> opsins appear to rule out the possibility of depolarizing phototransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kusakabe and Tsuda, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kusakabe et al., 2001</xref>). Also in agreement with an inhibitory output from the PR-IIs is our prediction that the majority of the pr-AMG RNs, the exclusive RNs of the PR-IIs, are themselves GABAergic, which would make a disinhibitory circuit most plausible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We also show that removal of BV sensory input with the <italic>frm</italic> mutant, or inhibition of GABA receptors with picrotoxin, leads to more frequent spontaneous swims, suggesting that a disinhibitory pathway could lead to stimulation of swimming. Finally, we observed that the AMGs, with the exception of one cell, are GABAergic. The AMGs are one of the primary relay centers for the PNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>) and project to the MGINs and MNs. However, the AMGs also project ascending axons to the pr-AMG RNs. It is thought that the convergence of PR-II and AMG inputs at the pr-AMG RNs serves to initiate an integrated escape response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>). Our finding that these two classes of neurons (PR-IIs and AMGs) are likely to have the same input (inhibition) on the pr-AMG RNs further bolsters the integrated response model. Finally, the PR-II mediated dimming response was not inhibited by the AMPAR antagonist perampanel, suggesting the PR-II glutamate release at pr-AMG RNs acts through other receptors, such as the NMDA receptor, and may be more involved in modulating or processing the visual response, and that GABA release may be more important.</p><p>Validation of this hypothetical disinhibitory circuit will require analysis of individual neurons in behaving larvae. Although we have been able to get robust GCaMP imagery from the CNSs of transgenic <italic>Ciona</italic> larvae (our unpublished observations), the fact that the excitation and emission spectra of GCaMP (as well as red-shifted calcium indicators) overlap with the behavioral spectrum of <italic>Ciona,</italic> and the inefficacy of GCaMP for visualizing inhibition, led us to abandon this approach. We are currently exploring methods for electrophysiological recording of <italic>Ciona</italic> BV neurons.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ascidians and the evolution of vertebrate visual systems</title><p>The evolutionary relationship between the ascidian ocellus and the visual organs of cephalochordates (<italic>e.g.</italic>, amphioxus) and vertebrates remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kusakabe and Tsuda, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lamb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamb, 2013</xref>). The observations that the <italic>Ciona</italic> PR-I and PR-II complexes are distinct morphologically, mediate different behaviors, project via distinct visuomotor circuits, and express different NTs, raises the possibility that these two complexes may have independent origins, and thus have different evolutionary relationships to the photoreceptor organs of other chordates. We speculate that the ascidian PR-I complex is likely to be homologous to the vertebrate lateral eyes and the amphioxus frontal eye, which like the PR-I complex is pigmented and appears to play a role in detecting the direction of light, although not necessarily in taxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stokes and Holland, 1995</xref>). On the other hand, the pineal eyes of amphibian tadpoles and fish larvae mediate a shadow/dimming response, suggesting homology with the ascidian PR-II photoreceptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jamieson and Roberts, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoshizawa and Jeffery, 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, the inhibitory nature of the <italic>Ciona</italic> PR-IIs makes assigning homologies more difficult. It is possible that use of GABA by these photoreceptors is a derived feature of ascidians, as inhibitory photoreceptors have yet to be described elsewhere. Alternatively, in the vertebrate retina GABAergic/glycinergic horizontal and amacrine cells are prevalent, and, moreover, it has been proposed that these cells, as well as ganglion cells, are derived from an ancient photoreceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamb, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arendt, 2003</xref>).

The sequences from which the HCR probe sets were chosen were assembled from scaffold reads available through the Aniseed website (aniseed.cnrs.fr), and are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. The in situ protocol followed the previously published <italic>Ciona in situ</italic> hybridization protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corbo et al., 1997</xref>) until the prehybridization step.

Imaris v. 9.1 (Bitplane) was used to visualize embryos and assign centroids to nuclei using the ‘add new spots’ function, followed by manual correction when necessary. Nuclei were assigned using the maximum intensity projection, cropped to the area of interest. Volume rendering of in situ patterns was also done using Imaris v. 9.1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell registration</title><p>A rotation matrix was calculated based on the 3-dimensional vectors between the anchor cells (ddN and/or antenna cells) and the center of the target cells (photoreceptors or relay neurons) using the HCR in situ (target set) and connectome cell centroids (source set). The source set was then rotated to an approximate orientation to the target set. Next, the Coherent Point Drift Algorithm was used to calculate an affine transformation matrix between the source set and the target set of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Myronenko and Song, 2010</xref>). This algorithm models the source set as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and the target set is treated as observations from the GMM. The transformation matrix is calculated to maximize the Maximum A Posteriori estimation that the observed point cloud is drawn from the GMM. A nearest neighbor mapping based on Euclidean distance is then used to find the closest corresponding point in the target cell set for each cell in the transformed source cell set. The implementation used was adapted from the pure Python implementation <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/siavashk/pycpd">https://github.com/siavashk/pycpd</ext-link>. The maximum number of iterations was set to 1000 and the maximum root mean squared error for convergence was set to 0.001.

Before uploading to ELIANE, time-lapse images were first processed with Fiji (ImageJ) by subtracting a minimum Z-projection to all the frames and then inverting black and white. ELIANE takes the processed time-lapse images and first creates a background image by averaging the pixels from all the frames. Next, it goes to the initial frame, subtracts the background image, and stores all remaining objects found in the specified region of interest (ROI) as initial objects. Then, analyzing one-by-one the initial objects, it goes frame-by-frame subtracting the background image and analyzing all objects to determine the new position of the object by comparing the Euclidean distances of it to all other objects in that frame. If the object had moved unrealistically fast (&gt;6.5 mm/s), moved outside the ROI, or did not move after a set time (1 min), the object was not analyzed.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Parallel Visual Circuitry in a Basal Chordate&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, Oliver Hobert, and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers – and the Reviewing Editor – agree that the manuscript reports an interesting, exciting set of findings that provide new insight into how visual systems evolve. However, there is also agreement that the evidence behind the GABA receptors being involved in the behavioral response to dimming is entirely indirect, and would be substantially strengthened by a pharmacological parallel to the Glutamate receptor antagonist data. That is, according to the disinhibition model, acute blockade of GABA(A) receptors with a pharmacological antagonist should produce a &quot;hyperactive&quot; movement phenotype akin to the <italic>frm</italic> mutant animal, but one that should still be capable of phototaxis (but not a dimming response). Such a result would provide an elegant &quot;double dissociation&quot; that would parallel the findings with the AMPA receptor antagonist.</p><p>There is also agreement that the manuscript requires an extensive revision to the Introduction that puts the work in a broader context. At present, the manuscript begins largely with a description of the <italic>Ciona</italic> connectome, in relation to other complete connectomes, and then plunges directly into a more detailed description of ganglia, cells and synapses. A broader audience could be engaged by the work if the authors identified the key question of interest, and provides some of the background material currently found in the Discussion section, before diving into the pertinent details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>How the functional architecture of visual systems has evolved to subserve different behavioral goals is a fundamental question of broad interest. At present, while we have a deep understanding of visual system organization in a few experimental models, such a fundamental question can be enriched through the exploration of evolutionarily divergent organisms. In this context, Smith and colleagues integrate a new description of neurotransmitter expression patterns, ultrastructural connectivity, pharmacology and behavior to derive new insights into the architecture of the Ascidian <italic>Ciona</italic> visual system.</p><p>First, by mapping RNA expression patterns onto neurons spanning the <italic>Ciona</italic> nervous system using a combination of HCR in situs and image registration, they assign neurotransmitter types to many neurons. Importantly, these studies reveal three classes of ocellus photoreceptors – one that uses glutamate as a transmitter, one that uses GABA, and one that appears to release both. Next, using a glutamate receptor antagonist, they demonstrate that blockade of signaling from glutamatergic photoreceptors blocks phototaxis, but does not affect a second behavior evoked by transient dimming. Finally, consistent with the idea that a subset of photoreceptors could control the dimming response by depolarizing to darkness, and releasing GABA, the authors describe a mutant in which visual input to motor pathways is disrupted, leading to an animal that swims constitutively.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript reports an interesting, exciting set of findings that provide new insight into how visual systems evolve. I find the idea that there might be photoreceptors that appear to hyperpolarize to light and release GABA particularly exciting, and it will be fascinating to learn more about how these photoreceptors are related to retinal and pineal photoreceptors in vertebrates. However, I do feel that the evidence behind these receptors being involved in the behavioral response to dimming is entirely indirect, and would be substantially strengthened by a pharmacological parallel to the Glutamate receptor antagonist data. That is, according to the disinhibition model, acute blockade of GABA(A) receptors with a pharmacological antagonist should produce a &quot;hyperactive&quot; movement phenotype akin to the <italic>frm</italic> mutant animal, but one that should still be capable of phototaxis (but not a dimming response). Such a result would provide an elegant &quot;double dissociation&quot; that would parallel the findings with the AMPA receptor antagonist.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The fact that there is a full map of connections in <italic>Ciona</italic> provides a great opportunity to dissect circuits. Even better, the tools are there to perform some genetic and pharmacological pertubations, and evaluate effects on behavior. This study begins to exploit these features in a study of the <italic>Ciona</italic> visual system. The authors dug deeper into two circuits that begin with photoreception. They used transgenic reporter animals and in situ hybridization to define the use of two classical neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA. Surprisingly, one type of photoreceptor uses GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter not previously described as used by photoreceptors in any species. From the known connections, they also make a case for how the two circuits are connected, and further suggest that one of the circuits is disinhibitory, perhaps along with other sensory inputs, for oscillatory swimming behavior. Through the use of a specific antagonist for a glutamate receptor they are able to show that one of the photoreceptor circuits is involved with detection of the direction of light (phototaxis), using a behavioral assay. Interestingly, inhibition of phototaxis has no effect on the other circuit, which detects dimming. However, it is likely that there is cross talk between the two photoreceptor circuits, as suggested by the known anatomy.</p><p>Overall this study provides a very nice example of photoreceptor directed behavior as controlled by two different circuits. It provides food for though regarding the evolution of different types of visually guided behaviors and the use of different types of photoreceptors. Optogenetic manipulations and calcium imaging (tried by the authors but did not work due to technical limitations) would greatly add to this story, but as it stands it constitutes a very nice addition to our understanding of a sensory circuit and behavior.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44753.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers – and the reviewing editor – agree that the manuscript reports an interesting, exciting set of findings that provide new insight into how visual systems evolve.

As you will read in the text, our results with the GABA receptor antagonist (picrotoxin) agree thoroughly with our disinhibition model (and with our observations of the <italic>frm</italic> mutant). The use of the GABA receptor antagonist was an excellent suggestion, and we feel that the results presented here greatly strengthen our model. As you will see in Figure 7, picrotoxin (like the <italic>frm</italic> mutant) leads to increased spontaneous swimming. Moreover, picrotoxin also leads to a dramatic reduction in the dimming response. We then show with use of picrotoxin combined with the AMPAR antagonist perampanel that the residual dimming response is due to parallel activation of the excitatory circuit. Finally, we show that picrotoxin-treated larvae are still capable of phototaxis. However, we observed that the phototaxis ability of the picrotoxin-treated larvae was somewhat dampened in comparison to controls, which we attribute to excitotoxicity of prolonged picrotoxin exposure (Movie5 documents the toxicity of prolonged picrotoxin exposure).</p><p>We have also extensively rewritten the Introduction along the lines suggested by the reviewer. Additionally, as requested, we have included in the text the number of animals tested using the pOpsin1/VGAT Kaede combination (n=5). Finally, we have collected additional data on neurotransmitter use by cells of the motor ganglion. These additional data are presented in revised versions of Figure 4 and Figure 4-figure supplement 1. Our conclusions regarding the minimal circuit are unchanged by this additional data; however, we are revising our neurotransmitter assignment to the anterior pair of ACINs. This reassignment was undertaken after consultation with Kerrianne Ryan (author of the <italic>Ciona</italic> connectome manuscript). We also include an approved personal communication from Dr. Ryan in this section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
