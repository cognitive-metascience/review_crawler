Here, we show that infection by <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, the causative agent of human bacillary dysentery, switches off host sumoylation during epithelial cell infection in vitro and in vivo and that this effect is mainly mediated by a calcium/calpain-induced cleavage of the SUMO E1 enzyme SAE2, thus leading to sumoylation inhibition. Furthermore, we describe a mechanism by which <italic>Shigella</italic> promotes its own invasion by altering the sumoylation state of RhoGDIα, a master negative regulator of RhoGTPase activity and actin polymerization. Together, our data suggest that SUMO modification is essential to restrain pathogenic bacterial entry by limiting cytoskeletal rearrangement induced by bacterial effectors. Moreover, these findings identify calcium-activated calpains as powerful modulators of cellular sumoylation levels with potentially broad implications in several physiological and pathological situations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>shigella</kwd><kwd>sumoylation</kwd><kwd>calpain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post-doc fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lapaquette</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009060</institution-id><institution>Sidaction</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fritah</surname><given-names>Sabrina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003762</institution-id><institution>Institut Pasteur</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sansonetti</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name><name><surname>Dejean</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sansonetti</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name><name><surname>Dejean</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dejean</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SUMOSTRESS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dejean</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Odyssey RE</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dejean</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Labelled team</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dejean</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Shigella</italic> infection induces a calpain-mediated loss of SUMO conjugates that promotes bacterial entry.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The post-translational modification by SUMO is an essential regulatory mechanism of protein function that is involved in most challenges faced by eukaryotic cells, ranging from cell communication to gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cubeñas-Potts and Matunis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flotho and Melchior, 2013</xref>). Mammals express three functional SUMO proteins, SUMO1 and SUMO2/3, with the latter two being almost identical. The sumoylation machinery is composed of an E1 SUMO enzyme (the SAE1/SAE2 heterodimer), a unique E2 SUMO enzyme (UBC9), and E3 SUMO enzymes that enhance SUMO conjugation of specific targets. The steady-state levels of sumoylated substrates are critically regulated by the action of desumoylating enzymes, such as SENPs. Sumoylation is characterized by its highly dynamic and reversible nature, resulting in only a very small fraction of a given protein substrate being sumoylated in the cell at steady state level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nayak and Müller, 2014</xref>). Whereas the vast majority of SUMO substrates identified so far in proteomic analysis are nuclear, a number of cytosolic and plasma membrane proteins can also be targeted by SUMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hendriks and Vertegaal, 2016</xref>). Cellular sumoylation levels relies on the fine equilibrium between conjugating and deconjugating activities and perturbation in this balance has been associated with disease processes, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seeler and Dejean, 2017</xref>) and infections by pathogenic micro-organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mattoscio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srikanth and Verma, 2017</xref>). However, while information on the specific roles of the different SUMO E3 and SENP enzymes is accumulating, our knowledge of possible mechanisms regulating the global sumoylation/desumoylation equilibrium still remains highly fragmentary.</p><p>Post-translational modifications enable cells to dynamically react to stress or pathogenic agents by modifying quickly, locally and specifically the activity of key proteins. Highjack of protein post-translational modifications is emerging as a key strategy used by pathogens to survive and usurp the cellular machinery to their own benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ribet et al., 2010</xref>). Whereas the interplay between SUMO and viral infection is relatively well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Everett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mattoscio et al., 2013</xref>), the molecular mechanisms by which sumoylation acts to limit bacterial infection are poorly characterized. <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> facilitates its infection capacity by inducing both a proteasome-dependent and -independent decrease in the amount of SUMO conjugates in host cells. This effect has been attributed to the pore-forming toxin LLO that is sufficient to induce a proteasome-independent degradation of UBC9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ribet et al., 2010</xref>). Another study indicates that the enteropathogenic bacteria <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium affects sumoylation through upregulation of two microRNAs, miR30c and miR30e, that post-transcriptionally repress UBC9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Verma et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, it has been reported that two human pathogenic bacteria, <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic> and <italic>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</italic>, promote SUMO modification of their own effectors to facilitate their intracellular survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunphy et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, we have shown recently that, at early stage of infection, <italic>Shigella</italic> can alter either positively or negatively the sumoylation status of a restricted set of transcriptional regulators involved in inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fritah et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In most cases, pathogenic micro-organisms manipulate sumoylation through interference with the SUMO enzymatic machinery. However the precise mechanisms by which pathogenic bacteria subvert the SUMO pathway enzymes and the nature of the relevant host SUMO substrates remain largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the sumoylation status of host proteins at late stage of <italic>Shigella</italic> infection that revealed a dramatic decrease in the global amount of SUMO conjugates in epithelial cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that this effect is, in large part, mediated by a calpain-dependent proteolytic degradation of the E1 SAE2 enzyme. We show that impaired sumoylation activity in host cells favors <italic>Shigella</italic> entry and identified RhoGDIα, a master negative regulator of the biological activities of small Rho GTPases, as an important SUMO substrate used by host cells to limit <italic>Shigella</italic> invasion. This work provides mechanistic insight into how sumoylation, by counteracting cytoskeletal rearrangement, impairs bacterial infection. In addition, it establishes calcium signaling as a novel and potent regulator of cellular sumoylation that may be relevant to transiently and/or locally alter sumoylation levels in several normal or disease states.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Shigella</italic> infection inhibits sumoylation in epithelial cells in vitro and in the gut</title><p>To investigate the impact of <italic>Shigella</italic> infection on global sumoylation of host cell proteins, we followed the global pattern of proteins conjugated to SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 at timed intervals after infection (0 to 180 min). A gradual decrease in both SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 conjugates was observed in HeLa cells infected with the invasive <italic>Shigella</italic> strain M90T. An almost complete disappearance of the higher molecular weight SUMO species was visible after 180 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These data are in agreement with a recent report showing impaired sumoylation in similar conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sidik et al., 2015</xref>). A weak, yet consistent reduction in the level of SUMO1-modified proteins was readily visible 30 min post-infection as shown by a ~ 25% decrease in the total amount of SUMO1 conjugates and a concomitant ~20% accumulation of free SUMO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). The decrease in the total amount of SUMO2 conjugates after 30 min was, in contrast, more pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), a finding in line with the higher dynamics of modification by SUMO2 compared to SUMO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saitoh and Hinchey, 2000</xref>). Of note, no accumulation of free SUMO2/3 could be detected in our setting. SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 conjugates decreased in a multiplicity-of-infection-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This loss in SUMO conjugates was not observed in cells infected with the non-invasive <italic>mxiD</italic> mutant that lacks expression of the type III secretion system (T3SS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Moreover, the global reduction in protein sumoylation was impaired in cells treated with cytochalasin D, a drug that prevents actin polymerization and thereby completely blocks <italic>Shigella</italic> entry. This indicates that actin cytoskeleton rearrangements are required for <italic>Shigella</italic> to impair sumoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–G</xref> and and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). We then validated the decrease in sumoylation on the two heavily sumoylated RanGAP1 and PML-IV substrates. In <italic>Shigella</italic>-infected HeLa cells, a reduction in sumoylated RanGAP1 was visible 90 min post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Similar results were obtained in HT1080 cells stably expressing PML-IV where a significant decrease in SUMO-modified form of PML-IV occurred after 120 min infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The hyposumoylation was more pronounced for PML-IV than for RanGAP1, in accordance with the high stability of the sumoylation state of RanGAP1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27444.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Shigella</italic> infection induces a massive loss in SUMO conjugates in vitro and in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SUMO1-conjugated protein patterns from uninfected HeLa cells or cells infected with the wild-type <italic>Shigella</italic> strain M90T for the indicated times.

Hence, suppressing RhoGDIα activity was sufficient to increase the number of <italic>Shigella</italic> entry sites. Next, to study the impact of sumoylation on RhoGDIα activity in <italic>Shigella</italic> pathogenesis, we compared the effect of wild-type RhoGDIα to that of the corresponding SUMO-deficient mutant (RhoGDIα K138R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) on actin foci formation. Of note, this sumoylation site, that obbeys the canonical consensus motif ψ–K–X–E (where ψ is a large hydrophobic residue), is evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that it may be an important feature of RhoGDIα regulatory function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We took advantage of the fact that both RhoGDIα plasmids lack the 3'-UTR sequence to design a 3'-UTR-targeting siRNA that silenced only endogenous RhoGDIα. Restoration experiments using either GFP-tagged wild-type RhoGDIα or K138R mutant were performed in HeLa cells knockdown for endogenous RhoGDIα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Although the knockdown efficiency of the 3'-UTR-targeting siRNA was not total (~60% knockdown), significantly higher number of <italic>Shigella</italic>-induced actin foci was observed by fluorescence microscopy in cells expressing RhoGDIα K138R, compared to that observed in cells expressing the wild type form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>).

Whereas some bacterial pathogens have been shown to alter the sumoylation of host proteins, the mechanisms through which the bacteria interfere with the SUMO machinery and the identity of the SUMO targets remain largely undefined. In this study, we show that <italic>Shigella</italic> induces a massive decrease in SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 conjugates at late time post-infection in epithelial cells in culture and in the intestinal mucosa. This global loss in sumoylation relies on activation of calpain proteases that target the SUMO E1 enzyme SAE2 for degradation, thus leading to sumoylation inhibition. In addition, we show that SUMO-modified RhoGDIα is rapidly lost upon <italic>Shigella</italic> infection favoring cytoskeletal rearrangements and bacterial entry. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a SUMO substrate targeted by bacteria to enhance infectivity. Thus, in addition to identifying sumoylation of RhoGDIα as an important event counteracting cytoskeletal remodeling and bacterial entry, our work reveals the ability of calcium signals to control global sumoylation levels.</p><p>Calpain proteases constitute a family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases involved in a wide range of cellular functions, including cytoskeletal rearrangements, apoptosis and cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ono and Sorimachi, 2012</xref>). An increase in free intracellular calcium is required to induce the calpain conformational changes necessary for their activity and substrate recognition. Upon host cell invasion, <italic>Shigella</italic> induces both local and global calcium responses. Whereas the local calcium response at <italic>Shigella</italic> entry sites peaks at 15 min post-infection, a global increase in calcium signaling is observed shortly thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnet and Tran Van Nhieu, 2016</xref>). Local elevation of intracellular calcium levels at early stage leads to calpain activation that affects the dynamics of cytoskeletal reorganization to promote <italic>Shigella</italic> invasion. At later stage, global calcium responses associated with sustained calpain activation leads to slow necrotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergounioux et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings that inhibiting either intracellular calcium influx or calpain activity prevented <italic>Shigella</italic>-induced loss of SUMO-conjugates and, conversely, that the sole treatment with calcium and ionomycin in the absence of <italic>Shigella</italic> triggered sumoylation inhibition indicate that increased cytosolic calcium and subsequent calpain activation are responsible for SAE2 degradation and impairment of sumoylation. To our knowledge, a single study describing a putative role of calpains in the modulation of specific sumoylation events has been reported. In this work, forced expression of calpain three was shown to lead to the cleavage the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS3 and subsequent inhibition of its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Morrée et al., 2010</xref>). A recent study reported that HeLa cells infected by <italic>Shigella</italic> show reduced sumoylation together with a slight decrease in UBC9 protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sidik et al., 2015</xref>). We repeatedly failed to detect any decrease in the amount of UBC9 following <italic>Shigella</italic> infection whereas SAE2 was systematically found to be lost. The reason for this discrepancy remains unknown. Using a panel of <italic>Shigella</italic> strains mutated for a series of bacterial effectors, we show that mutants lacking the ability to elicit a stress response at the plasma membrane, as detected by actin foci formation, are no longer able to trigger loss of SUMO conjugates. Calpain proteases have been shown to be activated by plasma membrane injuries in order to contribute to membrane repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Godell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mellgren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mellgren et al., 2007</xref>). One may thus hypothesize that, by triggering pore formation and subsequent plasma membrane stress, <italic>Shigella</italic> infection induces a calpain-dependent loss of sumoylation.</p><p>Current knowledge of the mechanisms through which bacteria interfere with the SUMO enzymatic machinery remains largely limited. To date, a unique example of a pathogen protein targeting the SAE1/SAE2 heterodimer is the adenoviral protein Gam1 that recruits SAE1/SAE2 to the Cullin2/5-EloB/C-Roc1 ubiquitin ligase complex, thus leading to SAE1 ubiquitin-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boggio et al., 2007</xref>). By contrast, the majority of bacteria known to interfere with sumoylation have been shown to target the E2 conjugating enzyme UBC9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srikanth and Verma, 2017</xref>). <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium depletes UBC9 in infected cells by upregulating the expression of two microRNAs (miR30c and miR30e) that affect UBC9 transcript stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Verma et al., 2015</xref>). Another example is the Gram-positive bacteria <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> that leads to decreased sumoylation together with UBC9 degradation. Whereas MG132, that inhibits proteasomal degradation but also calpain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee and Goldberg, 1998</xref>), partially restored the profile of sumoylated proteins in infected cells, it failed to prevent UBC9 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ribet et al., 2010</xref>). The mechanisms underlying these two apparently paradoxical findings remain to be identified. The secretion of the pore-forming toxin (PFT) LLO triggers UBC9 degradation and this bacterial toxin alone can recapitulate the decrease in sumoylation observed during <italic>Listeria</italic> infection. Moreover, this effect on host cells has also been observed for PFTs from other Gram-positive bacteria, such as PFO and PLY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ribet et al., 2010</xref>). It is possible that, upon <italic>Shigella</italic> infection, the translocator-forming IpaB and IpaC proteins, by inducing a stress at the plasma membrane, act in a similar manner. In this context, it will be interesting to investigate whether the abilities of the Gram-positive bacteria PFTs to decrease host sumoylation might be linked to calpain activation since many PFTs, including LLO, are described to activate these proteases by elevating intracellular calcium levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bischofberger et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A common theme in the pathogenicity of bacteria is the manipulation of host cells by targeting the cytoskeleton for their own needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbieri et al., 2002</xref>). Among the multiple regulation steps of the actin cytoskeleton, bacterial factors interfere preferentially with Rho GTPases either directly <italic>via</italic> covalent modification or through interfacing with regulators of Rho GTPase control. As Rho GTPases are active in the GTP-bound state, several bacteria produce toxins that modulate the nucleotide state of the Rho GTPases for activation or inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Finlay, 2005</xref>). For example, <italic>Shigella</italic> injects into host cells the virulence factors IpgB1 and IpgB2 that activate the Rho GTPases Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA through their guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity toward these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klink et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohya et al., 2005</xref>). However, few reports have described direct effects of bacterial infection on RhoGDIα activity. One example is the <italic>Yersinia</italic> effector YpkA that mimics eukaryotic RhoGDIα, leading to global Rho GTPase inhibition and cytoskeletal disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prehna et al., 2006</xref>). We report here that RhoGDIα silencing increases the number of intracellular <italic>Shigella</italic> and actin foci, indicating that RhoGDIαregulatory functions are required to limit <italic>Shigella</italic> entry into host cells. Moreover, sumoylation of RhoGDIα is important for this activity as a SUMO-deficient RhoGDIαmutant shows a reduced ability to impair bacterial entry. These data are consistent with the finding that SUMO-RhoGDIαplays an inhibitory role on actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). It is thus tempting to speculate that the rapid loss in SUMO-RhoGDIα triggered by <italic>Shigella</italic> entry could promote de novo infection by extracellular <italic>Shigella</italic> thus amplifying the infection process. Intriguingly, whereas the degradation of SAE2 is hardly visible before 2 hr post-infection, the decrease in SUMO-RhoGDIαoccurs earlier, as soon as 30 min following infection, and coincides with the first visible signs of global hyposumoylation. Since the loss of SAE2 and SUMO conjugates are both calpain-dependent, a possible explanation for these differing kinetics may be that the two events result from the two consecutive waves of calcium responses triggered by <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. Whereas, the second, global calcium response would trigger complete SAE2 degradation, ultimately leading to a generalized loss of SUMO-conjugated proteins, the rapid loss of SUMO-RhoGDIα would most likely result from the first and localized wave of Ca2+ responses induced by <italic>Shigella</italic> in the vicinity of the entry sites. This response would lead to calpain-induced degradation of a small local pull of SAE2, barely detectable by Western blot, and subsequent loss of sumoylated RhoGDIα. Such a local and long-lasting Ca2+ response was shown previously to be confined to bacterial invasion sites, being induced as early as 5 min after bacterial contact with epithelial cells, with a peak response at 15 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnet and Tran Van Nhieu, 2016</xref>). Moreover, these local calcium responses at Shigella entry sites occur at about 10 μM, a concentration quite compatible with the activation of calpains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khorchid and Ikura, 2002</xref>). In line with this notion, local calpain activation at the plasma membrane has been extensively described for many membrane-associated substrates, such as FAK, talin, insulin receptor and VE-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Su and Kowalczyk, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuasa et al., 2016</xref>). If, as we surmise, sumoylation of RhoGDIαwere indeed to take place in the vicinity of the bacterial entry sites, it is thus likely that the local activation of calpains by an initially localized rise in calcium may lead to SAE2 cleavage and subsequent loss of SUMO-RhoGDIα - and potentially of a limited pool of other SUMO substrates - at <italic>Shigella</italic> invasion sites. A more definitive clarification of this issue must, however, await the development of probes permitting the visualization of localized sumoylation dynamics.</p><p>In conclusion, the data presented here describe a novel mechanism by which <italic>Shigella</italic> promotes its own infection capacity by rapidly decreasing the sumoylation state of RhoGDIα. It remains to be determined to which extent the sumoylation of other host substrates can contribute to limit <italic>Shigella</italic> invasion. <italic>Shigella,</italic> however, can also positively modulate sumoylation of a restricted set of substrates. For example, the <italic>Shigella</italic> effector OspF has been described to be sumoylated, favoring its translocation into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jo et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, using a proteomic approach, we found that, whereas <italic>Shigella</italic> mainly induces hyposumoylation at early stage of infection, a small number of cellular substrates also become hypersumoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fritah et al., 2014</xref>). Clearly, full dissection of the spatio-temporal interplay between <italic>Shigella</italic> and sumoylation will require further investigation.</p><p>In addition, our work reveals a previously unknown strategy for modulating the global levels of cellular sumoylation through a calcium/calpain-dependent process that may have important implications in a number of pathological or physiological situations. Calcium signaling is involved in a multitude of biological processes, such as synaptic function, muscle contraction and cardiac activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clapham, 2007</xref>). It is thus not surprising that alteration in calcium homeostasis is known to participate in a number of pathological processes including cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carafoli, 2004</xref>). An interesting challenge in the future will be to probe whether situations associated with changes in cytosolic calcium levels, such as during the sleep-wake cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berridge, 2014</xref>), could translate into the modulation of global cellular sumoylation. Morever, the highly localized nature of calcium signals, as exemplified by the local calcium response confined to the <italic>Shigella</italic> invasion site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnet and Tran Van Nhieu, 2016</xref>), offers the intriguing possibility for localized variations in sumoylation, as shown recently for ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McGourty et al.,

To determine the number of actin foci per cell, at least 100 <italic>Shigella</italic>-infected cells were counted. Each microscopy image is representative of at least three independent experiments. Intestinal samples from newborn mice were fixed for 2 hr in 4% PFA and kept in 70% ethanol before paraffin embedding. Microtome sections of 7 μm were prepared. Sections were rehydrated, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, saturated with Ultra-V-Block (Thermo Scientific) and then incubated overnight at 4°C with SUMO2/3 antibody. After washing, the sections were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunotech) for 1 hr at room temperature. Nuclei were counternstained with DAPI, and slides were mounted (Prolong, Life technologies). All images were acquired using Apotome microscope (Zeiss).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Shigella</italic> entry unveils a calcium/calpain-dependent mechanism for inhibiting sumoylation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hubert Hilbi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Lapaquette et al., represents an important advance in our understanding of mechanisms of host-pathogen communication and provides novel insight about how an invasive bacterial pathogen facilitates its uptake.</p><p><italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery hijacks the host ubiquitin-like system SUMOylation, Entry into epithelial cells is an obligatory event for <italic>Shigella</italic> virulence antagonized by SUMOylation. To dissect how <italic>Shigella</italic> interferes with the SUMO system they extend these findings to an in vivo model of infection (newborn mouse). Next, they explore a possible link between hyposumoylation and calcium activated proteases, calpains, which are known to be activated upon <italic>Shigella</italic> infection.

We thus did not perform the experiment that would combine both approaches as each one, taken individually, leads to the complete loss in SUMO-modified proteins. However, to address the point raised by the reviewers of the direct link between the loss of SAE2 and the loss of SUMO-RhoGDIα, we depleted SAE2 through siRNA in Hela cells, thus mimicking <italic>Shigella</italic>-induced SAE2 disappearance, and then monitor the basal state of RhoGDIα sumoylation. Even upon forced sumoylation conditions (by overexpression of SUMO1), we observed that a decrease in SAE2 protein level results in a nearly complete loss of sumoylated RhoGDIα, without affecting the level of unmodified form (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27444.024</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Sumoylation of RhoGDIα is affected by SAE2 impairment.</title><p>HeLa cells were treated with control siRNA (siScr) or siSAE2, and then co-transferred with expression vectors for GFP-RhoGDIα and SUMO1.

Beyond the identification of RhoGDIα as an important SUMO substrate targeted by bacteria to enhance infectivity, the finding that global sumoylation can be regulated by modulation of intracellular calcium levels is indeed the second main message of this work. We believe the link between calcium and SUMO signaling discovered here provides a new conceptual framework for the regulatable nature of sumoylation, that goes well beyond the sole infection by <italic>Shigella</italic>. Indeed, as stressed by the reviewers, many physiological and pathological situations are associated with changes in cytosolic calcium levels. This result points out once again to the importance of pathogenic micro-organisms to unveil fundamental biochemical processes of the host cell. Moreover, <italic>Shigella</italic>-induced calcium response is highly specific in terms of kinetics, localization and intensity. Notably, the highly localized nature of the calcium response induced by <italic>Shigella</italic> at early time points of infection (Bonnet and Tran Van Nhieu, 2016) raises the intriguing possibility that sumoylation of a small subset of substrates (including sumoylation of RhoGDIα) can be affected locally during the early stages of infection, suggesting a novel paradigm for sumoylation.</p><p>With regards to the relevance of (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced) sumoylation inhibition in the context of <italic>Shigella</italic> infection, we had shown previously that sumoylation is an important negative regulator of <italic>Shigella</italic> infectivity (Fritah et al., 2014). Decreasing experimentally the global level of sumoylation in host cells favors <italic>Shigella</italic> spreading in vitro as well as bacterial invasion and intestinal mucosa inflammation in vivo. However, whether <italic>Shigella</italic> indeed targets the global SUMO pathway in host cells was unknown. Here we report that <italic>Shigella</italic> inhibits sumoylation and that this effect is mediated via a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calpain-induced degradation of SAE2 which in turn facilitates <italic>Shigella</italic>-induced cytoskeletal rearrangements and bacterial entry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is unclear how the global desumoylation and specific RhoGDIα desumoylation, are linked.

The authors need to explain how RhoGDIα desumoylation and cytoskeleton rearrangements fit to the global desumoylation effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the link between the global inhibition of sumoylation, the specific loss of SUMO-RhoGDIα and the calpain-induced degradation of SAE2 is an important issue. One may distinguish here the kinetics of loss of SUMO-RhoGDIα, global SUMO conjugates and SAE2.</p><p>The loss of SUMO-RhoGDIα coincides with the first visible reduction in the amount of total sumoylated proteins after 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Quantification showing a slight, yet consistant ~25% reduction in the level of SUMO1 conjugates and concomitant accumulation of free SUMO1 after 30 min has been added in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and in the Results section. The strong decrease in the total amount of SUMO2-conjugates after 30 min was readily shown in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>. The early global inhibition of sumoylation and the specific loss of SUMO-RhoGDIα are thus directly linked. The rapidity with which the sumoylated form of a given protein is lost is highly specific for the substrate and relies on its half-life and the dynamics of its proper sumoylation/desumoylation equilibrium which also depends on its intracellular localization. The impairment of sumoylation will result in a gradual loss of SUMO conjugates starting with the most sensitive substrates, such as RhoGDIα, and will ultimately affect the most heavily and stably modified ones like RanGAP1. To remove the original ambiguous formulation and make this clearer in the revision, we now mention: “Whereas the levels of unmodified RhoGDIα remained unaffected, we observed the complete disappearance of SUMO-RhoGDIα as quickly as 30 min post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The reduction in the global amount of SUMO1 conjugates was only moderate in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that RhoGDIα is highly sensitive to sumoylation inhibition” (subsection “Endogenous RhoGDIα and SUMO proteins are recruited at bacteria entry sites and <italic>Shigella</italic> rapidly impairs RhoGDIαsumoylation”).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that there is an apparent discordance between the loss of SAE2, which is not yet visible 1 h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and the reduction in global sumoylation, that begins 30 min after infection. This point has been now clearly stated in the Results section and extensively discussed (Discussion section). Because of this readily noticeable time lag for SAE2 degradation, we feel that earlier time points between 0 and 1 h would not be really informative. The mechanisms responsible for the early reduction in SUMO conjugates triggered by <italic>Shigella</italic> infection remain to be elucidated. As pointed by the reviewers, <italic>Shigella</italic> may have developed additional strategies to impair sumoylation early during infection, such as activation of desumoylases. However, a direct involvement of increased SENP activities seems unlikely as the loss in SUMO-modified proteins is, like SAE2 loss, strictly dependent on calpains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>), and no link has been so far established between calpain and SENP activities. Moreover, we have now measured the global desumoylase activity in <italic>Shigella</italic> M90T non-denatured lysates. Using fluorogenic 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin SUMO substrates (SUMO1-AMC and SUMO2-AMC), we failed to reveal any SUMO1 or SUMO2 protease activities in M90T extracts when compared to recombinant SENP2 used here as a positive control. The data are shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Since the loss of SAE2 and SUMO conjugates are both calpain-dependent, we favor the hypothesis that the rapid loss of SUMO-RhoGDIα results from the first and localized wave of Ca<sup>2+</sup> response induced by <italic>Shigella</italic> in the vicinity of the entry sites. This response would lead to a local calpain-induced degradation of a small pull of SAE2, hardly detectable by Western blot, and subsequent loss of highly sensitive SUMO conjugates including SUMO-RhoGDIα. A more definitive clarification of this issue must, however, await the development of probes permitting the visualization of localized sumoylation dynamics. We have modified and expanded the corresponding section in the Discussion section to comment more in depth on this point. Since we cannot strictly rule out that non-SAE2-dependent mechanisms are involved in the early hyposumoylation triggered by <italic>Shigella</italic>, we have also added the word 'mainly' in the sentence “this effect is mainly mediated by a calcium/calpain-induced cleavage of the SUMO E1 enzyme SAE2” in the Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The dependence of RhoGDIα colocalization with Shigella on UBC9 is unconvincing.

As requested, quantification has been performed by using the colocalization studio plugin of Icy software (Lagache et al., 2015), enabling the calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficients (Rr) between fluorescent signals from SUMO1, SUMO2/3 or RhoGDIα immunostaining and signal from actin foci at <italic>Shigella</italic> entry site. We have included these data as new figure panels 7B, D and F and in the corresponding Results section. Analysis in Ubc9 WT MEFs reveals a moderate positive correlation between SUMO1 (Rr=0.41, p=0.008), SUMO2/3 (Rr=0.36, p=0.025), RhoGDIα (Rr=0.47, p=0.000017) and actin at bacteria entry site (at least 40 entry foci analysed per condition), confirming an enrichment in SUMO1, SUMO2/3 and RhoGDIα at <italic>Shigella</italic> entry foci in Ubc9 WT-infected MEFs. These positive correlations are weaker and lose significance for SUMO1 (Rr=0.226, p=0.073) and SUMO2/3 (Rr=0.290, p=0.082) in Ubc9 KO cells, indicating a decrease in conjugated SUMO signal at <italic>Shigella</italic> entry site in cells depleted in sumoylation. The positive correlation between RhoGDIα immunostaining and <italic>Shigella</italic> entry sites remains statistically unchanged upon loss of sumoylation (Rr= 0.487, p=0.0006), indicating that, in contrast to what we suggested initially, RhoGDIα colocalization with <italic>Shigella</italic> entry foci does not depend on an active SUMO machinery.

Data are presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. Among these mutants, the strain mutated for the transcriptional activator MxiE is still able to induce a loss in SUMO conjugates, despite the fact that this mutant is unable to express and secrete numerous <italic>Shigella</italic> effectors and some IpaH proteins encoded by chromosomal genes (Bongrand et al., 2012; Kane et al., 2002; Mavris et al., 2002). Similar observations were made for the strains defective for the IpgD and OspG effectors. In contrast, mutants for the genes encoding the translocator proteins IpaB and IpaC are no longer able to trigger loss of SUMO conjugates, a feature shared with the <italic>mxiD</italic> mutant. These findings indicate the involvement of T3SS-related processes in <italic>Shigella</italic>-induced sumoylation inhibition. Interestingly, IpaB and IpaC proteins act as translocator-forming proteins that are able to target the host plasma membrane. As described in the Discussion section, three pore forming toxins produced by Gram positive bacteria have already been reported to induce a massive loss in SUMO conjugates (Ribet et al., 2010), thus suggesting a similar mechanism for the Gram negative <italic>Shigella</italic>. The use of two insertion mutants of IpaC, <italic>ipaC</italic>/pC57 and <italic>ipaC</italic>/pC351 (Mounier et al., 2009), further revealed that the stress at the plasma membrane triggered by this translocator protein, appears to be sufficient to induce the loss in SUMO conjugates. Indeed, the <italic>ipaC</italic>/pC57 mutant, that is defective for invasion but still able to induce actin foci formation at the host plasma membrane, induces hyposumoylation, whereas the <italic>ipaC</italic>/pC351 mutant, defective for actin foci formation, is unable to do so. Calpain proteases have been amply described to participate in the healing of damaged plasma membranes by allowing local remodeling of the cortical cytoskeleton (Godell et al., 1997; Mellgren et al., 2007; Mellgren et al., 2009). One may thus hypothesize that, by triggering pore formation and subsequent plasma membrane stress, <italic>Shigella</italic> infection induces a calpain-dependent loss of sumoylation. We have included these data as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p>With regards to the effect of VirA pointed out by the reviewers, Bergounioux et al., (2012) have reported that the virA defective strain is still able to induce calpain activation, albeit less rapidly than the wild-type strain.
