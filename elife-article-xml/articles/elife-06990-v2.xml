apoptosis while neighboring α cells are preserved. Viral infections by coxsackieviruses (CVB) may contribute to trigger autoimmunity in T1D. Cellular permissiveness to viral infection is modulated by innate antiviral responses, which vary among different cell types. We presently describe that global gene expression is similar in cytokine-treated and virus-infected human islet cells, with up-regulation of gene networks involved in cell autonomous immune responses. Comparison between the responses of rat pancreatic α and β cells to infection by CVB5 and 4 indicate that α cells trigger a more efficient antiviral response than β cells, including higher basal and induced expression of STAT1-regulated genes, and are thus better able to clear viral infections than β cells. These differences may explain why pancreatic β cells, but not α cells, are targeted by an autoimmune response during T1D.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06990.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06990.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06990.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Type 1 diabetes is caused by a person's immune system attacking the cells in their pancreas that produce insulin. This eventually kills off so many of these cells—known as beta cells—that the pancreas is unable to make enough insulin. As a result, individuals with type 1 diabetes must inject insulin to help their bodies process sugars. One of the mysteries of type 1 diabetes is why the beta cells in the pancreas are killed by the immune system while neighboring alpha cells, which produce the hormone glucagon, are spared.</p><p>Scientists suspect a combination of genetic and environmental factors contributes to type 1 diabetes. Certain viruses, including one called Coxsackievirus, appear to trigger type 1 diabetes in susceptible individuals. Other factors may also make these individuals more likely to develop the disease. For example, they may ‘express’ genes that are thought to increase the risk of type 1 diabetes, many of which control how the immune system responds to viral infections. These genes may make susceptible individuals experience excessive inflammation, because inflammation is what ultimately kills off the beta cells.</p><p>Now, Marroqui, Lopes, dos Santos et al. provide evidence that suggests why the alpha cells are spared the immune onslaught in type 1 diabetes. In initial experiments, clusters of cells—known as islets—from the human pancreas were either exposed to small proteins that cause inflammation or infected with the Coxsakievirus. Both events caused a similar increase in the expression of particular immune response genes in the islets. This indicates that these islet cells are able to react to the virus and trigger a first line of defense, which will be further boosted when the immune system is subsequently called into action.</p><p>Islets contain both alpha and beta cells, and so further experiments on alpha and beta cells from rats investigated whether the two cell types respond differently when infected by the Coxsakievirus. The results revealed that alpha cells boost the expression of the genes needed to clear the virus to a greater extent than the beta cells, and so respond more efficiently to the virus. Therefore, an infection is more likely to establish itself in the beta cells and consequently trigger inflammation and the immune system's attack on the cells.</p><p>These observations explain one of the puzzling questions in the diabetes field and reinforce the possibility that a long-standing viral infection in beta cells—which seem to have a limited capacity to clear viral infections—may be one of the mechanisms leading to progressive beta cell destruction in type 1 diabetes. This knowledge will help in the search for ways to protect beta cells against both viral infections and the consequent immune assault.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06990.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06990.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>pancreatic beta cell</kwd><kwd>pancreatic alpha cell</kwd><kwd>virus</kwd><kwd>cytokine</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FNRS- F 5/4/5.MCF/KP.

This leads to death of most of the β cells while neighboring α cells survive. The disease is characterized by pancreatic islet inflammation (insulitis) and progressive β cell loss by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ziegler and Nepom, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morgan et al., 2014</xref>). The triggering of T1D probably depends on environmental factors that interact with predisposing genes to induce autoimmunity against the β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eizirik et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Santin and Eizirik, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morgan and Richardson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morgan et al., 2014</xref>). Among the potential environmental factors, epidemiological, clinical, and pathological studies in humans support the implication of viral infections, particularly enteroviruses (e.g., coxsackievirus; CVB), as triggers for the development of T1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helfand et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dotta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yeung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morgan and Richardson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richardson et al., 2014</xref>). CVB-specific antibodies and enteroviral RNA are more frequently observed in serum samples from T1D patients than in healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helfand et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lonnrot et al., 2000</xref>), and staining of human pancreatic islets revealed that the enteroviral capsid protein VP1 is present at a higher frequency in insulin-containing islets from patients with recent-onset T1D when compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dotta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richardson et al., 2013</xref>). A meta-analysis of 33 prevalence studies involving 1931 T1D cases and 2517 controls confirmed a clinically significant association between enteroviral infections and islet autoimmunity and T1D in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yeung et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, it has been shown that the presence of enterovirus RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oikarinen et al., 2011</xref>) or antibodies anti-CVB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Laitinen et al., 2014</xref>) in blood can predict the development of T1D.</p><p>Insulitis is established and exacerbated in the context of a ‘dialog’ between pancreatic β cells and the immune system, regulated by the local production and release of chemokines and cytokines. These proteins attract and stimulate cells of the immune system, such as macrophages and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eizirik et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Willcox et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arif et al., 2014</xref>). The immune cells cause selective β cell destruction both directly and via the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), type II interferon (IFNγ), and tumor necrosis factor α. These cytokines are released closely to the target cells and modulate the expression of complex gene networks in β cells, leading to the release of chemokines and eventually to the activation of the intrinsic pathway of cell death in β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eizirik et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gurzov and Eizirik, 2011</xref>). A key unanswered question in the field is why highly differentiated and specialized pancreatic β cells express these immune-related pathways.</p><p>Host defense in vertebrates is usually viewed as the task of specialized immune cells. This perception underestimates the capacity of many non-immune cells to trigger ‘self-defense’ or ‘cell autonomous immune responses’ against infection. These mechanisms are pre-existing in many cell types and can be up-regulated upon virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan and Chen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Randow et al., 2013</xref>). This is an ancient form of cellular protection, present both in bacteria and metazoans. In vertebrates, for instance, cellular self-defense synergizes with innate and adaptive immunity to fight infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Randow et al., 2013</xref>). The cell susceptibility/resistance of highly differentiated and poorly proliferating cells, such as neurons and pancreatic β cells, to microbial infection is a major determinant of clinical outcome. It has been shown that cerebellum granule cell neurons and cortical neurons (CNs) have unique self-defense programs that confer differential resistance to infection by West Nile virus. Specifically, higher basal expression and faster up-regulation of IFN-induced genes improves the survival of granule cell neurons infected by West Nile virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2013</xref>). These responses rely on detection of microbial signatures by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Randow et al., 2013</xref>). Several candidate genes for T1D expressed in human islets, such as the RIG-like receptor <italic>MDA5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colli et al., 2010</xref>) and the regulators of type I IFNs <italic>PTPN2</italic> and <italic>USP18</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Santin et al., 2012</xref>), modulate viral detection, antiviral activity, and innate immunity. The candidate genes described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Santin et al., 2012</xref>) and CVB5 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colli et al., 2011</xref>) regulate β cell apoptosis via activation of the BH3-only protein Bim. These observations support the concept that genetically modulated self-defense responses in β cells might play an important role in determining the outbreak of insulitis and the progression to T1D in face of viral infection or other stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Santin and Eizirik, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Against this background, we have presently evaluated the global gene expression of cytokine-treated and virus-infected human islet cells, observing that these two treatments lead to similar up-regulation of a large number of genes, gene networks, and transcription factors involved in cell autonomous immune responses. This conclusion generated two additional questions, namely whether this self-defense response is islet cell specific and, if yes, whether these putative cellular differences may explain the preferential β cell targeting by the autoimmune assault. To answer these questions, we next compared the responses of FACS-purified rat pancreatic α and β cells to infection by potentially diabetogenic CVB5 and CVB4. The results obtained indicate that α cells trigger a more effective antiviral response than β cells, including higher basal and induced expression of STAT1-regulated genes, and are thus able to better clear viral infections as compared to β cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exposure of human islets to pro-inflammatory cytokines or infection by CVB5 induces expression of a similar network of cell autonomous-related immunity genes</title><p>We used previous microarray and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis made by our group to compare the global gene expression of CVB5-infected human islets, evaluated by microarray analysis 48 hr after viral infection (HV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ylipaasto et al., 2005</xref>), against the gene expression of human islets exposed to the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β + IFNγ, evaluated either by microarray analysis at 24, 36, or 48 hr (HC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lopes et al., 2014</xref>) or by RNAseq at 48 hr (HC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eizirik et al., 2012</xref>), focusing the analysis on over-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Comparison of human islets exposed to cytokines and analyzed by either microarray or RNAseq showed a strong similarity in the top 20% ranked genes (50% common genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Comparison between CBV5-infected human islets against cytokine-treated human islets indicated a large number of common genes, in particular among the top 20% genes (30–50% common genes). Interestingly, the area under the curve (AUC) for a comparison between different batches of human islets exposed to cytokines and analyzed either by microarray or RNAseq analysis was 0.209 (subtracted by a null area of 0.5), while the AUC for the comparisons virus vs cytokines (microarray vs microarray or microarray vs RNAseq) was, respectively, 0.154 and 0.127, that is, 74% and 61% of the cytokines vs cytokines comparison, indicating a close similarity between human islet cell responses to virus or cytokines. To exclude that these similarities were the result of non-specific cell stress responses, we compared the viral-induced gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ylipaasto et al., 2005</xref>) against genes modified by palmitate (HP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cnop et al., 2014</xref>), a metabolic stress unrelated to the immune response.

By further comparing the RNAseq data obtained in human islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eizirik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lopes et al., 2014</xref>) against known PRRs and other antiviral/antibacterial factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Randow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carty et al., 2014</xref>), we noticed that cytokine-exposed human islets highly express and up-regulate antiviral (e.g., TLR3, MDA5, RIG-1, APOBEC36, SAMHD1, TRIM22, CNP, Tetherin, Viperin etc) factors, while antibacterial factors (e.g., TLR4, NLRP1, CLEC6A, CLEC7A.) are lowly or not expressed, suggesting that these cells are under evolutionary pressure to counteract viral but not bacterial infections, probably because they are seldom confronted by bacteria.

These observations indicate that both a viral infection by CVB5 and exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines trigger a cell autonomous immune response in human islet cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pancreatic α cells are resistant against CVB- but not against cytokine- or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced cell death</title><p>The experiments described above were performed with whole-human islets, composed to a large extent by β and α cells. Since it has been described that different brain cells present diverse innate immune response programs to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2013</xref>), and since β but not α cells are killed in T1D, we next examined whether pancreatic β and α cells present different susceptibility to viral infections or to pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is presently not technically feasible to FACS-purify human β and α cells for long-term in vitro experiments due to the high-background fluorescence of human β cells caused by marked lipofuscin accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cnop et al., 2010</xref>) and the putative impact of antibody-mediated techniques on the long-term survival and function of the sorted cells. These follow-up experiments were thus performed in FACS-purified rat β and α cells (&gt;90% pure cells and with &gt;90% viability after 4 days in culture; there was also similar expression of the housekeeping gene GAPDH between α and β cells under different experimental conditions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

One of the mechanisms involved in cytokine-induced cell death is NO production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eizirik and Mandrup-Poulsen, 2001</xref>), and β and α cells showed roughly similar iNOS expression and medium nitrite accumulation, with slightly higher nitrite production by β cells, but basal iNOS expression was higher in α than β cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Similarly, cytokines induced expression of the chemokines CXCL10 and CCL2 in both cell types, but CCL2 expression was higher in α cells basally and following cytokine-exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). In line with the cytokine data, the synthetic dsRNA polyinosinic-polycitidilic acid (PIC) induced a similar percentage of cell death in β and α cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), but a slightly higher expression of the downstream genes IFNα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>) and CCL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3F</xref>) in α compared to β cells.

UV-inactivated virus did not kill β cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figures supplement 5</xref>), indicating that cell death is the consequence of actual viral infection and proliferation. Additionally, there were no differences in the number of α cells attached to the well before and after the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>), supporting the assumption that the α cells remain alive after CVB5 infection. α cells resistance was independent of the glucose/fetal bovine serum (FBS) concentration used in the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>), and it was paralleled by a markedly lower expression of the CVB5 marker VP1 in α than in β cells, as evaluated by mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>) expression, and by titration of the production of infective virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Dose-response experiments in α cells indicated that even at a M.O.I. of 100, CVB5 still induced markedly less cell death in α than in β cells infected at an M.O.I. 20-fold lower, that is, M.O.I. 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This is not a phenomenon restricted to CVB5, since α cells were also much more resistant than β cells to CVB4-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This cannot be explained by different expression of receptors for the virus, since the CVB receptors coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) and decay accelerating factor for complement have similar or higher mRNA expression in rat α as compared to β cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). The similar expression of CAR was confirmed at the protein level in α and β cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figures supplement 1</xref>). Consistently, the same quantity of CVB5 remained associated with α and β cells after adsorption of the virus as measured by titration 2 hr after virus exposure (data not shown). In line with these findings, the percentage of infected α and β cells by a non-replicating adenoviral vector encoding GFP, which also enters the cells via CAR, was similar in α and β cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). On the other hand, the intensity of GFP fluorescence was several-fold lower in α than in β cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B,D</xref>), indicating that the virus enters α cells but cannot properly translate its cargo protein. These observations may explain a common knowledge in the field that α cells are ‘difficult to transduce’ with adenoviral vectors.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06990.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The higher susceptibility of β cells to virus-induced cell death, as compared to α cells, is not due to higher expression of virus receptors.</title><p>FACS-purified rat α and β cells (&gt;90% purity) were infected with CVB5 (M.O.I. 5, 50 or 100 for α cells; M.O.I. 5 for β cells) (<bold>A</bold>), CVB4 (M.O.I. 5) (<bold>B</bold>), or CVB5 (M.O.I. 5) (<bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold>) for 36 hr.

Our present findings suggest an alternative hypothesis, namely that α cells may become infected but are able to eradicate the virus more effectively than β cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). If this hypothesis is correct, CVB infection should not be detectable in α cells of T1D patients when their islets are examined months/years after the putative initial infection. To test whether CVB may indeed infect human α cells, we first infected dispersed human islets from two donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>) in vitro with CVB5 (M.O.I. 10) for 8 hr, the time point when maximum expression of VP1 was observed in a time-course experiment on α cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

Similar results were observed with CVB4 (data not shown). To confirm these results in clinically relevant samples, we examined the pancreas of three children who died from myocarditis during the course of an acute and severe CVB infection.

From an evolutionary point of view, it would not make sense that these glucose-sensing and insulin-producing cells express these complex gene networks with the sole purpose to commit suicide during insulitis. The present observations, indicating a close similarity between cytokine- and virus-induced gene expression, suggest that these gene networks are actually part of a complex cell autonomous immune response, regulated at least in part by candidate genes for T1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Santin and Eizirik, 2013</xref>), aiming to eradicate putative viral infections without excessive cell loss. Indeed, β cells, like neurons, have a very limited replication potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cnop et al., 2010</xref>), and an excessive loss of β cells would be disastrous for the host. In some genetically susceptible individuals, however, the putative initial viral infection might not be resolved leading to a persistent low-level infection, which in these individuals could trigger a specific autoimmune assault against β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dotta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Santin and Eizirik, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richardson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Pancreatic α and β cells are neighboring endocrine cells with a common embryonic origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Teitelman, 1993</xref>). If an islet viral infection, which in theory should affect all islet cells, contributes to trigger T1D, an important question arises; namely, why are β cells killed while α cells survive? It has been previously suggested that α cells are more resistant to cytokine-induced apoptosis than β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mandrup-Poulsen et al., 1987</xref>). The present observations, however, based on highly purified and viable rat α and β cells, cultured under similar conditions, indicate that both cell types are killed roughly to the same extent by the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β + IFNγ. α and β cells are also equally susceptible to dsRNA-induced apoptosis, but α cells are several-fold more resistant to CVB-induced infection and consequent cell death than β cells. This suggests that the main difference between these two cell types is not their actual ability to detect signals of the viral infection (e.g., dsRNA) but how they respond to the virus once it is actively translating proteins inside the cells. In line with this hypothesis, both α and β cells were infected with an adenoviral vector encoding GFP, but α cells efficiently blocked (by 90%) the translation of virally-encoded GFP. A limitation of the present study is that the experiments described above were performed in FACS-purifed rat α and β cells, which limits extrapolation to the human disease.</p><p>Analysis of the expression of cell autonomous immunity-related genes in α and β cells (present data) and comparison between global expression of these genes in virus-resistant mouse granule cell neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2013</xref>) and α cells indicate that a large number of IFN- and STAT1-dependent genes are expressed at higher level in α cells as compared to β cells. This suggests that this IFN-STAT1 gene network contributes to the resistance of α cells to viral infection. In support of this hypothesis, KD of STAT1 prevents CVB-induced MX1 expression in α cells and enables a more active infection with CVB5, as evaluated by higher expression of the enteroviral capsid protein VP1. Of note, unphosphorylated STAT1 supports the induction of antiviral genes in other cell types even without IFN-dependent stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang and Stark, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheon and Stark, 2009</xref>) and increased basal expression of STAT1 amplifies cell-intrinsic immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amit et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Previous histological studies in pancreas from T1D individuals have shown that CVB is detected in β but not α cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ylipaasto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richardson et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anagandula et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morgan et al., 2014</xref>), leading to the suggestion that CVB does not infect human α cells. Our present findings, obtained in highly purified α cells in vitro and by the analysis of dispersed human islets and pancreas from children with an acute and severe CVB infection, suggest an alternative hypothesis, namely that α cells indeed get infected but they rapidly eradicate the virus, probably due to their enhanced cell autonomous immunity responses.</p><p>Our proposal that a strong cell immune response protects α cells against viral infection and subsequent death in T1D seems at odds with the association of polymorphic variants of MDA5 that reduce helicase activity with a lower risk to develop T1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nejentsev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Winkler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lincez et al., 2015</xref>).

In this context, the continuous stimulation of vigorous antiviral responses, in an attempt to control the infection, may lead to protracted presentation of β cell autoantigens, local release of chemokines and cytokines and eventually autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Santin and Eizirik, 2013</xref>). This process, however, would not take place in α cells, which, as presently shown, have in place adequate mechanisms to swiftly eliminate the virus in the early stages of infection.</p><p>As mentioned above, pancreatic α and β cells have a common embryonic origin and are localized in the same microorgan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Teitelman, 1993</xref>). They thus provide a unique model to understand how molecular regulation of self-defense against viral infection in β cells, as compared to α cells, may determine cell death, local inflammation, and eventual diabetes. The present observations suggest that pancreatic α and β cells have different cell autonomous signatures. This may explain their different ability to clear viral infections and potentially explain why putative chronically infected pancreatic β cells, but not α cells, are targeted by an autoimmune response and killed during T1D.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Gene expression data sets</title><p>Gene expression after cytokine exposure was analyzed based on two data sets.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three external reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers identified two major concerns with the paper that were the subject of considerable discussion.</p><p>1) The first concerned the focus on rodent cells, rather than human cells which would potentially have more clinical relevance. The initial gene expression analysis is conducted in whole human islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and some of the supplements), while the isolated β-cell and α-cell studies that form the crux of the paper are conducted in sorted rat islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4 fig5 fig6 fig7 fig8 fig9 fig10">Figures 2-10</xref>). The authors state that the reason for using rat cells in the majority of this work is technical: “It is presently not technically feasible to FACS-purify human β and α cells for long-term in vitro experiments due to the high background fluorescence of human β cells caused by marked lipofuscin accumulation”. The reviewers agreed that autofluorescence cannot be used, but it is not clear that β-cells and α-cells cannot be labeled with fluorescent proteins, similar to what has been done in many rodent studies. Recognising that this would be a considerable amount of work, the reviewers did not consider it essential that the work be repeated in human cells, but do require that any revision makes the limitations of working in rodent cells explicit.</p><p>2) The second concerned the relevance of the first part of the paper that makes a comparison between already published data sets on gene expression signatures in cytokine- or virus infected islets from humans. One of the reviewers felt that this was quite divorced from the rest of the paper and should be omitted (“nowhere else are cytokines used and the main part of the paper is neither supported nor refuted by these data”), but the others were more positive. On balance, we prefer that this section of the paper remains provided the authors can make clear how these data shed light on the substantive questions in the paper.</p><p>The reviewers also raised a number of comments that they considered less major but which are still substantive and require attention.</p><p>3) The authors state: “Both β and α cells were killed to the same extent after a 24 h exposure to IL-1β + IFNγ”. Is this what is commonly found? This reviewer was under the impression that multiple publications have shown that β-cells were more susceptible to such stresses. If not, perhaps it is related to the dose used here. Please include a more extensive dose-response study to confirm these findings.</p><p>4) There are a few overly generalized assumptions. For example, “we focused the analysis on over-expressed genes, since human islet genes down regulated after long-term exposure to stressful stimuli are often non-specific adaptive or apoptotic responses to cellular stress.” It is not clear whether this statement can be backed up with strong evidence. Please amend.</p><p>5) The time-course data are compelling, but in order to assess cell survival, time-courses would ideally be extended by several days. The life and death battle of islet cells can last 2-3 days. Ideally repeat the studies with longer exposure, otherwise explain why it was necessary to limit the duration of study.</p><p>6) The main conclusion of the paper is that α cells are only transiently infected with CBVs and can clear the virus infection, while β cells are infected without the ability to eradicate the virus. The stainings performed on pancreata from neonates who died from acute infections may in part support such a conclusion. The authors' conclusions would however be substantially supported if infections of whole pancreatic islets (which the authors should have at hand) would demonstrate that β cells die and α cells survive over time. Also, did the authors count the α cells before and after infection (e.g. 36h)? No change in cell numbers would support the conclusions drawn by the authors. Please provide the data requested.</p><p>7) On a similar note, α and β cells are, according to the Material and methods section, grown in different concentrations of FBS and glucose (α cells: 6.1 mM glucose and 10% FBS; β cells: β cells: 10 mM glucose and 5% FBS). Could the different culture conditions contribute to the differences in susceptibility to infection? Please comment on this, and if possible address.</p><p>8) The authors use CBV4 and CBV5 to infect cells. These viruses were grown in cell lines. An appropriate control in these experiments would be UV-inactivated virus, as cellular debris including cytokines etc. could have an effect on cell survival. Was such a control included? Please provide data, and if not, undertake studies to show that UV inactivated virus does not impact on cell survival.</p><p>9) By PCR it is demonstrated that both α and β cells express receptors for CBVs. More appropriate would have been to analyse surface expression by FACS, as mRNA expression. Please address this or explain why this is not possible.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>10) Provide a rationale for why you selected the CBV5 serotype for these experiments and not e.g. CBV1.</p><p>11) Virus concentrations are given as MOI, but the titers of replicating viruses in cells and media are given as TCID50 making these concentrations difficult to compare.

Recognising that this would be a considerable amount of work, the reviewers did not consider it essential that the work be repeated in human cells, but do require that any revision makes the limitations of working in rodent cells explicit</italic>.</p><p>The concern raised by the editor and referees is well taken. The methods indicated by the editor and referees, i.e. labeling with fluorescent antibodies, recently used to sort α and β cells in pancreatic human islets (Dorrell et al., Stem Cell Res 183-194, 2008; Kirkpatrick et al., PLoS ONE e11053, 2010; Blodgett et al., Diabetes db150039, 2015) are indeed useful for studies involving RNA-seq or arrays of freshly isolated islet cells. They pose, however, a problem for the maintenance of the isolated cells in culture for several days after the purification, as required in the present study. Some of these methods require fixation of the cells, while others, where surface antibody are used without fixation, may affect cell function and trigger innate cellular responses secondary to antibody binding. Thus, and unfortunately, we presently cannot reproduce the current experiments based on viable and fully functional purified human β and α cells. In this context, the use of rodent FACS purified β and α cells provides a “second best” alternative. Indeed, Benner et al. assessed transcriptome-wide similarities and differences between rodent and human β cells, observing that 9905 genes are commonly expressed and 1540 differentially expressed between mouse and human β cells (Benner et al. BMC Genomics 620, 2014). In line with this study, a very recent paper compared the core proteomes of rat and human pancreatic β cells by label-free LC-MS/MS, quantifying more than 700 proteins belonging to key functional pathways, such as protein synthesis and intermediary metabolism (Martens GA, J Diabetes Res 549818, 2015). The authors describe that expression levels of these core functional pathways are highly conserved between rat and human β cells, despite some differences in proteins involved in glucose sensing pathways and redox control. On the other hand, we are well aware that working with rodent rather than human β cells present limitations, as these cells display structural and functional differences (Cabrera et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2334-2339, 2006; Henquin et al., Diabetes 3470-3477, 2006; Parnaud et al., Diabetologia 91-100, 2008).</p><p>We have now acknowledged the limitation of working with rat β and α cells in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) The second concerned the relevance of the first part of the paper that makes a comparison between already published data sets on gene expression signatures in cytokine- or virus infected islets from humans. One of the reviewers felt that this was quite divorced from the rest of the paper and should be omitted (</italic>“<italic>nowhere else are cytokines used and the main part of the paper is neither supported nor refuted by these data</italic>”<italic>), but the others were more positive. On balance, we prefer that this section of the paper remains provided the authors can make clear how these data shed light on the substantive questions in the paper</italic>.</p><p>The comparison between gene expression signatures was a crucial step in the study, allowing us to realize that cytokine-treated β cells triggered a “cellular innate immune response”. This conclusion generated the second question of the study, namely whether this response is cell specific and, if yes, whether putative cell differences can explain why β cells, but not α cells, are eventually targeted and killed in T1D. We have now introduced a sentence in the Introduction, last paragraph, explaining how these data shed light on the key questions of the paper. Of note, I (DLE) have presented lectures based on these data at the EASD and Immunology of Diabetes Society meetings, and in both cases the audience understood well our strategy of starting with gene expression signatures of cytokine- and viral-infected islet cells and then evolving to the subsequent questions, as done in the present manuscript.</p><p><italic>The reviewers also raised a number of comments that they considered less major but which are still substantive and require attention</italic>.</p><p><italic>3) The authors state:</italic> “<italic>Both β and α cells were killed to the same extent after a 24 h exposure to IL-1β + IFNγ</italic>”<italic>. Is this what is commonly found? This reviewer was under the impression that multiple publications have shown that β-cells were more susceptible to such stresses. If not, perhaps it is related to the dose used here. Please include a more extensive dose-response study to confirm these findings</italic>.</p><p>The point is well taken. It has been indeed previously shown that α cells present higher resistance than β cells to proinflammatory cytokines, but these studies were mostly carried in mouse α and β cell lines, namely αTC1 and βTC1, respectively (Hamaguchi and Leiter, Diabetes 415-25, 1990; Iwahashi et al., Diabetologia 530-536, 1996; Barbagallo et al., BMC Genomics 62, 2013), and not in primary purified α and β cells, as in the present study.</p><p>Following the referees’ relevant suggestion, we have now performed a dose-response study using three concentrations of IL-1β + IFNγ, respectively 10 + 100 units/mL; 25 + 250 units/mL; and 50 + 500 units/mL. At these three different concentrations of cytokines we did not observe significant differences between α and β cell apoptosis (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). These results reinforce the idea that, under the present experimental conditions, α and β cells are similarly susceptible to cytokines. We have now introduced a sentence in Results emphasizing that the present observations are related to specific experimental conditions, i.e. FACS purified rat α and β cells.</p><p><italic>4) There are a few overly generalized assumptions. For example,</italic> “<italic>we focused the analysis on over-expressed genes, since human islet genes down regulated after long-term exposure to stressful stimuli are often non-specific adaptive or apoptotic responses to cellular stress.</italic>” <italic>It is not clear whether this statement can be backed up with strong evidence. Please amend</italic>.</p><p>This point is well taken. As suggested by the referees we have now removed the statement that “since human islet genes down regulated after long-term exposure to stressful stimuli are often non-specific adaptive or apoptotic responses to cellular stress”. This statement is actually based on our own unpublished bioinformatics analysis of RNAseq/microarray data of cytokine-, palmitate- and virus-infected β cells, but since these data is not yet publically available, we agree with the referees that it is better to remove the statement.</p><p><italic>5) The time-course data are compelling, but in order to assess cell survival, time-courses would ideally be extended by several days. The life and death battle of islet cells can last 2-3 days. Ideally repeat the studies with longer exposure, otherwise explain why it was necessary to limit the duration of study</italic>.</p><p>To address this relevant question, we have now complemented our analysis by evaluating the impact of longer exposure of β and α cells to CVB5 (up to 96 h post infection). We observed a progressive increase in virus-induced β cell death, reaching 60-70% of cell death by 96 h. In contrast, most α cells remained alive (apoptotic levels similar to <italic>Mock</italic> condition) during the whole experiment (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3–figure supplement 4</xref>). These findings suggest that α cells are indeed more resistant to CVB infection than β cells. A sentence regarding these results is now included in the subsection headed “Pancreatic α cells are resistant against CVB- but not against cytokine- or double stranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced cell death”.</p><p><italic>6) The main conclusion of the paper is that α cells are only transiently infected with CBVs and can clear the virus infection, while β cells are infected without the ability to eradicate the virus. The stainings performed on pancreata from neonates who died from acute infections may in part support such a conclusion. The authors' conclusions would however be substantially supported if infections of whole pancreatic islets (which the authors should have at hand) would demonstrate that β cells die and α cells survive over time. Also, did the authors count the α cells before and after infection (e.g. 36h)? No change in cell numbers would support the conclusions drawn by the authors. Please provide the data requested</italic>.</p><p>These relevant points are well taken. We have now performed new experiments in dispersed human islets infected with CVB5 (M.O.I 10, 8 h of infection; n = 2), where we detected by immunofluorescence the presence of the enteroviral capsid protein VP1 in both α cells (glucagon-positive) and β cells (insulin-positive) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Thus, we found that 52% (Experiment 1) or 33% (Experiment 2) of insulin-positive cells were also positive for VP1, while 28% (Experiment 1) or 27% (Experiment 2) of cells were double positive for glucagon and VP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Similar results were observed when CVB4 was used (data not shown). These findings confirm the human islet data described in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> of the manuscript. A sentence regarding these results is now included in the subsection “Pancreatic α cells express a vigorous cell-autonomous immune response against viral infection”.</p><p>Unfortunately, and due to technical issues, we have not been successful in measuring apoptosis in dispersed human islets infected with CVB5 (M.O.I 10, 24 hr of infection). In these experiments we immunostained dispersed islets for glucagon, insulin and cleaved caspase 3 (used as a marker of apoptosis), but could not discriminate between cleaved caspase 3 staining and background autofluorescence signals under the different experimental conditions tested.</p><p>Following the additional suggestion by the referees, we have now carried out new experiments to count the number of α cells before and after viral infection. The number of α cells was counted both in the supernatant and attached to the coverslip after trypsinization. As observed in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3–figure supplement 6</xref>, the number of α cells in both conditions did not change before or after viral infection, indicating that α cells survived the infection. We have now mentioned these new findings in Results (subsection “Pancreatic α cells are resistant against CVB- but not against cytokine- or double stranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced cell death”).</p><p><italic>7) On a similar note, α and β cells are, according to the Material and methods section, grown in different concentrations of FBS and glucose (α cells: 6.1 mM glucose and 10% FBS; β cells: β cells: 10 mM glucose and 5% FBS). Could the different culture conditions contribute to the differences in susceptibility to infection? Please comment on this, and if possible address</italic>.</p><p>To address this relevant question, we have now performed new experiments where FACS-purified α cells were cultured under the same conditions as β cells, i.e. 10 mM glucose and 5% FBS. The results obtained indicate that, regardless of the culture conditions, α cells remain resistant to virus-induced apoptosis (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3–figure supplement 7</xref>). These new findings are now mentioned in Results (please see the subsection “Pancreatic α cells are resistant against CVB- but not against cytokine- or double stranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced cell death”).</p><p><italic>8) The authors use CBV4 and CBV5 to infect cells. These viruses were grown in cell lines. An appropriate control in these experiments would be UV-inactivated virus, as cellular debris including cytokines etc. could have an effect on cell survival. Was such a control included? Please provide data, and if not, undertake studies to show that UV inactivated virus does not impact on cell survival</italic>.</p><p>Following the referees’ suggestion, CVB5 stock was inactivated by UV and tested for toxicity on α and β cells. These results are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3–figure supplement 5</xref>, outlined in the Results, and the procedures used indicated in Material and methods, in the subsection headed “Viral infection”.</p><p><italic>9) By PCR it is demonstrated that both α and β cells express receptors for CBVs. More appropriate would have been to analyse surface expression by FACS, as mRNA expression. Please address this or explain why this is not possible</italic>.</p><p>In an attempt to detect by FACS the presence of CAR at the cell surface of rat islet cells, we tested two antibodies: a polyclonal rabbit serum (sc-15405; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the monoclonal mouse RmcB clone (Merck-Millipore). Unfortunately, none of these antibodies allowed a specific detection of CAR at the surface of rat β cells in both living and paraformaldehyde fixed cells (data not shown). The available antibodies for FACS detection of CAR were raised against sequences of the human protein, which are poorly conserved in the rat protein. This may explain why we did not manage to detect CAR at the surface of rat cells.</p><p>As an alternative to the detection of the receptor, we measured virus bound to the cells shortly after infection, which may be more biologically relevant in light of the viral cycle. For this purpose we measured the input virus load in α and β cells two hours after initial exposure. To achieve this, cells were washed 3 times in medium before lysis and titration on GMK cells, done by limit-dilution assay. As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 1</xref> the viral titers obtained were similar for α and β cells.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06990.032</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Viral titers of CVB5 bound to FACS sorted primary rat α or <bold>β</bold> cells. FACS-purified rat α cells (˃90% purity) were infected with CVB5 (M.O.I. 5). After 2 hr incubation cells are washed with medium 3 times before freezing in complete medium. The cell-bound virus was then titrated by limit dilution assay and TCID50 titers calculated according to the Kärber formula. To determine the background of unbound virus, wells devoid of cells were treated the same way and corresponding titers. The unbound viruses were subtracted in each experiment. Results are Mean and SEM of 2-3 independent experiments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06990.032">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06990.032</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06990-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>In addition, we detected the rat CAR protein by western blot with the polyclonal sera, and observed equivalent expression of CAR protein in both α and β cells. These results reinforce the idea that the CAR protein is well expressed in both cell types and the data are now presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>. A sentence regarding these results is now included in the subsection headed “Pancreatic α cells are resistant against CVB- but not against cytokine- or double stranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced cell death”.</p><p>In line with the observations described above, the percentages of adeno-GFP positive α and β cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> confirm the presence of functional CAR receptor (used also by the adenovirus) at the surface of both cell types.</p><p><italic>Minor comments:</italic></p><p><italic>10) Provide a rationale for why you selected the CBV5 serotype for these experiments and not e.g. CBV1</italic>.</p><p>We choose to analyze the effect of CVB5 and CVB4, both serotypes detected in T1D donors (Yeung et al., BMJ 342: d35, 2012), in order to allow comparisons with our previous studies based on infection of β cells with these viral serotypes (Ylipaasto et al., Diabetologia 47: 225-239, 2004; Ylipaasto et al., Diabetologia 48: 1510-1522, 2005; Ylipaasto et al, Diabetologia 55:3273–3283, 2012). Importantly, both CVB4 and CVB5 have been detected in islets of T1D donors (Yeung et al., BMJ 342: d35, 2012) and CVB4 has been associated to diabetes onset (Dotta et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 104: 5115-5120, 2007; Gallagher et al., Diabetes 64:1358-69, 2015). We did not test CVB1 serotypes in rat primary cells because a study by Nair and collaborators indicate that CVB1 does not multiply in rat β cells (Nair et al., J Med Virol 82:1950–1957, 2010). This information is now provided in Methods, in the subsection headed “Cell treatments and nitric oxide measurement”.</p><p><italic>11) Virus concentrations are given as MOI, but the titers of replicating viruses in cells and media are given as TCID50 making these concentrations difficult to compare. Please, clarify</italic>.</p><p>The viral stocks are produced in GMK cells and titrated by plaque assay in GMK cells to provide a titer in pfu/ml. As this titration protocol demands a larger volume of virus, we preferred the titration protocol by limit dilution assay that provides a titer in TCID50. To compare both viral concentrations, we titrated our viral stocks in both ways and obtained similar values as presented in the table below. This observation is now mentioned in Material and methods, in the subsection headed “Viral infection”.<table-wrap id="tblu1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Viral stocks</th><th>Titration in pfu/ml</th><th>Titration in TCID50/ml</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="3">CVB5 29/04/2013</td><td>4·10<sup>7</sup></td><td>7.9·10<sup>7</sup></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">4·10<sup>7</sup></td><td>3.2·10<sup>7</sup></td></tr><tr><td>2.5·10<sup>7</sup></td></tr><tr><td>CVB5 10/10/2014</td><td>10<sup>8</sup></td><td>3.1·10<sup>8</sup></td></tr><tr><td>CVB4 21/05/2014</td><td>3·10<sup>7</sup></td><td>6.3·10<sup>7</sup></td></tr><tr><td>CVB4 27/09/2014</td><td>1.9·10<sup>7</sup></td><td>1.6·10<sup>7</sup></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></body></sub-article></article>
