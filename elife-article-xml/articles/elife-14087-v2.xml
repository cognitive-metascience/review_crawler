However, key regulators of ubiquitination during innate response and roles of new types of ubiquitination (apart from Lys48- and Lys63-linkage) in control of innate signaling have not been clearly understood. Here we report that F-box only protein Fbxo21, a functionally unknown component of SCF (Skp1–Cul1–F-box protein) complex, facilitates Lys29-linkage and activation of ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1), and promotes type I interferon production upon viral infection. Fbxo21 deficiency in mice cells impairs virus-induced Lys29-linkage and activation of ASK1, attenuates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 signaling pathway, and decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferon, resulting in reduced antiviral innate response and enhanced virus replication. Therefore Fbxo21 is required for ASK1 activation via Lys29-linkage of ASK1 during antiviral innate response, providing mechanistic insights into non-proteolytic roles of SCF complex in innate immune response.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14087.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14087.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14087.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The innate immune system is the body’s first line of defense against being infected by viruses and other microbes. Upon recognizing a virus, host cells trigger the innate immune response in an effort to eliminate the threat. However, innate immune responses must be carefully controlled because an excessive response can cause inflammation that harms the body.</p><p>The innate immune response involves a variety of cells and processes that are each activated through a series of communication systems called signaling pathways. While much has been learned about which parts of a virus trigger the innate immune response, it is not clear how the immune response to the virus is controlled.</p><p>It has been suggested that a process known as ubiquitination could be involved in regulating the activity of signaling pathways that activate the innate immune response. During ubiquitination, enzymes attach a small molecule called ubiquitin to a specific target protein. Ubiquitin often acts as a label that targets a particular protein for destruction. Enzymes called E3 ubiquitin ligases play central roles in identifying specific target proteins for ubiquitination. Some of these enzymes consist of a single protein unit that acts alone, but other E3 ubiquitin ligases are formed by groups (or “complexes”) of several proteins working together.</p><p>Members of the F-box only protein family are components of some ubiquitin ligase complexes. Here, Yu et al. used a “microarray” technique to assess which F-box only proteins in mice are produced during an immune response to two viruses. The experiments identified an F-box protein called Fbxo21 as a potential candidate for a role in regulating the innate immune response.</p><p>Additional experiments revealed that Fbxo21 is involved in adding ubiquitin to a specific location on a signaling protein called ASK1, which is known to be crucial for innate immune responses. Instead of targeting ASK1 for destruction, this ubiquitination activates ASK1. Therefore, Yu et al.’s findings demonstrate that Fbxo21 plays an important role in regulating innate immune responses. A future challenge is to investigate exactly how ASK1 is activated by the ubiquitin.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14087.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14087.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Fbxo21</kwd><kwd>ASK1</kwd><kwd>SCF complex</kwd><kwd>polyubiquitination</kwd><kwd>antiviral response</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2010CB911903</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Taoyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013CB530500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xuetao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81222039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Taoyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81471566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Taoyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81172851</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Taoyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31470874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jianli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By joining the Skp1-Cul1-Rbx1 SCF complex, Fbxo21 interacts with ASK1 and mediates Lys29-linkage of ASK1, leading to type I IFN production.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Innate immune system serves as the first line defense of invading microorganisms and endogenous danger signals. Host cells can recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of invading pathogens via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), initiate signaling pathways to regulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFN α/β) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yin et al., 2015</xref>). Upon virus infection, host cells can also recognize viral components, especially nucleic acids derived from viral genome or produced during viral life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gürtler and Bowie, 2013</xref>). Viral RNAs are mainly detected by RIG-I-like receptors (such as RIG-I and MDA5) that induce type I IFNs via MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein, also known as IPS1, Cardif and VISA)–dependent activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)–interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan and Gack, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoneyama et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, viral DNAs are detected by multiple DNA sensors that induce type I IFNs mainly via stimulator of interferon genes (STING, also known as MITA, MPYS and ERIS)–dependent TBK1–IRF3 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paludan and Bowie, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 2014</xref>). Despite of these findings, the innate response to viruses has not been completely understood. Studies are still required to elucidate detailed signaling and regulatory mechanisms initiated by PRRs in antiviral innate response.</p><p>Ubiquitin (Ub) modification is one type of the crucial posttranslational modification mechanisms, and has been implicated in regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang and Chen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zinngrebe et al., 2014</xref>). As compared to the typical single subunit E3 ligases (such as RING-finger type and HECT type E3 ligases), the Cullin-RING multisubunit ligase complexes are assembled on the cullin backbones and have been implicated in diverse processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2014</xref>). S phase kinase-associated protein 1 (Skp1)–cullin 1 (Cul1)–F-box protein (SCF) complex is example of the Cullin-RING multisubunit ligase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2014</xref>). In this complex, Skp1 binds to F-box domain of many F-box proteins. More than sixty F-box proteins have been identified up to date, and they have been classified into three categories: those with WD40 domain (Fbxw), those with leucine-rich repeats (Fbxl) and those with other diverse domains (Fbxo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2014</xref>). Despite great achievements have been made for elucidating the roles of SCF complexes in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Skaar et al., 2014</xref>), the function of SCF in immunity remains poorly understood. Possibly the best characterized SCF complexes associated with immunity are the F-box– and WD40 repeat–containing Fbxw1 (also known as β-Trcp1, Fbw1a and Fwd1) and Fbxw11 (also known as β-TrCP2, Fbw11, Fbxw1b, Fbx1b and Hos) complexes that have been implicated in regulating NF-κB signaling by degrading IκBα or processing of p100 (also known as NFκB2) and p105 (also known as NFκB1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yaron et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shirane et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spencer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu and Ghosh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Orian et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fong and Sun, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amir et al., 2004</xref>). Since Fbxo proteins usually contain unidentified variable domains in addition to the F-box domain, the functions of Fbxo proteins remain largely unknown, especially in regulation of immunity.</p><p>Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1, also known as Map3k5) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase that plays pivotal roles in stress and immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ichijo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shiizaki et al., 2013</xref>). ASK1 can activate MKK4/6 and MKK3/7, leading to activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1/2) and p38 MAPKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ichijo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shiizaki et al., 2013</xref>). ASK1 is crucial for apoptosis in response to multiple stresses and factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ichijo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sagasti et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tobiume et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nishitoh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maruoka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takeda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsuzawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shiizaki et al., 2013</xref>). ASK1 has also been implicated in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-triggered innate responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsuzawa et al., 2005</xref>). Evolutionarily, ASK1 is a conserved protein expressed by many species ranging from <italic>C. elegans</italic> and drosophila to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ausubel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Irazoqui et al., 2010</xref>). ASK1 homologs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (NSY-1) and drosophila (DASK1) are important in control of apoptosis or innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ausubel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Irazoqui et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shiizaki et al., 2013</xref>). So ASK1-mediated signaling pathway may be conserved during evolution and be of great significance in control of innate response upon virus infection.</p><p>Previously we have investigated the roles of polyubiquitination in the regulation of innate signaling and innate cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). To further explore roles of Ub modification in regulation of innate response, we screened Fbxo proteins in macrophages and identified Fbxo21 as an important regulator in antiviral innate immunity. Since roles of ASK1 in TLR response has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsuzawa et al., 2005</xref>) while ASK1 is identified as the potential target of Fbxo21 in current study, we focused on the roles of Fbxo21 in antiviral response. We found that Fbxo21, by joining with Skp1-Cul1-Rbx1 (SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup>), is required for the production of inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs upon vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection. Our study suggests that Fbxo21 facilitates non-proteolytic Ub-modification of ASK1, adding insights into the mechanistic understanding of antiviral innate response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of Fbxo21 in innate response of macrophages</title><p>By using RAW264.7 cells treated with VSV and HSV-1, we screened the expression of Fbxo proteins by using GeneChip Microarrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

By using Q-PCR assays, we confirmed that <italic>Fbxo21</italic> mRNA was induced by HSV-1 infection but decreased by VSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To reconcile this discrepancy, we examined the protein levels of Fbxo21 in RAW264.7 cells after VSV and HSV-1 infection in the presence of a transcription inhibitor (actinomycin D, Act D) or a proteasome inhibitor (MG132). In the presence of Act D, the amounts of Fbxo21 protein were decreased after VSV and HSV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that Fbxo21 itself may be regulated by proteasomal degradation. In the presence of MG132 that blocks the degradation of Fbxo21, we found that VSV infection could not decrease Fbxo21 while HSV-1 infection could induce the expression of Fbxo21 protein 12 hr after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), confirming that VSV and HSV-1 may differentially regulate the transcription of Fbxo21. Given that Fbxo21 was abundantly expressed in many cell types, it may be inferred that Fbxo21 may act at an early stage of antiviral response while at a later stage the transcriptional regulation of <italic>Fbxo21</italic> mRNA may contribute to the differences in innate response to RNA virus versus DNA virus.</p><p>We then analyzed the Ub-modification type of ASK1 by SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup>. We found that Ub with only the intact Lys29 residue (K29O-Ub) could be linked to ASK1 by Fbxo21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In <italic>Fbxo21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> RAW264.7 cells reconstituted with Fbxo21, we found that Fbxo21 could promote the linkage of K29O-Ub to ASK1 after virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). When the cells were treated with MLN-4924, an inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme that has been implicated in the assembly of SCF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Soucy et al., 2009</xref>), we found that Fbxo21-mediated Lys29-linkage of ASK1 was abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>), indicating that Fbxo21-mediated ASK1 modification requires the assembly of SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup> complex. These data suggest that Fbxo21, by joining with Skp1-Cul1-Rbx1 (SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup>), is required for Lys29-linkage of ASK1.</p><p>As direct evidence, we performed in vitro polyubiquitination assays. Since the E2 enzyme(s) specific for Lys29-linkage of Ub chains have not been identified, we utilized conjugation fraction A that contains predominantly E1 and E2 enzymes instead of defined E2s in the in vitro<italic>in vitro</italic> polyubiquitination assays. In the presence of recombinant GST-Fbxo21, ASK1 and Cul1-Rbx1-Skp1, as well as the NEDD8 conjugation system (neddylation), ASK1 could be efficiently polyubiquitinated; while in the presence of MLN-4924, the polyubiquitination of ASK1 was significantly inhibited (left panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). To confirm the Lys29-linkage of Ub chains to ASK1, we used 6xHis-Ub-K29O (with only Lys29 in Ub) and 6xHis-Ub-K29R (with the Lys29 mutated into Arg in Ub) in the in vitro assays, and found that the former, but not the later, could be linked to ASK1 (right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

We predicted the ubiquitination sites in ASK1 by using the Bayesian discriminant method-prediction of ubiquitination sites algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also performed multiple alignment of ASK1 protein sequences derived from various species (for evolution conservation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–-J</xref>). By these 2 rounds of selection, ASK1 was predicted to contain 29 ubiquitination sites. To verify these ubiquitination sites, we constructed 18 mutants for ASK1 (K1-K18, mutated indicated Lys residue(s) into Arg; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and examined the ubiquitin levels associated with ASK1 after VSV treatments in HEK293 cells. We found that the K13 mutant of ASK1 (K13-ASK1; mutation of Lys946, Lys950, Lys951, Lys952, Lys953 and Lys957 into Arg) could most significantly decrease the levels of polyubiquitinated ASK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Our study shows that ASK1 activation facilitated by SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup> ubiquitin ligase complex plays an important role in promoting virus-triggered innate response, serving as a critical module in antiviral innate response. More importantly, our study reveals a new type of Ub-modification (Lys29-linkage) in regulating kinase activation, and suggests that SCF complexes may not only mediate degradation of protein substrates but non-proteolytic regulation of substrates. Considering that ASK1 is a remarkably conserved kinase crucial in defense of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ausubel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Irazoqui et al., 2010</xref>), our study may be of great significance for understanding of innate response in species other than mammals. However, in vivo roles of Fbxo21 may need to be confirmed by using Fbxo21 knockout mice.</p><p>Polyubiquitination of protein substrates represents a key posttranslational modification.

However, little is known about the roles of the multisubunit ubiquitin ligases in innate immunity. In SCF complex, the recognition of substrate is determined by F-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2014</xref>). Our study identifies Fbxo21 as a component of SCF complex and interacts with ASK1 to regulate the ubiquitination by SCF complex, thus expanding the family of SCF complex in immunity. Previously many SCF complexes have been reported whereas few of them are involved in innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2014</xref>).

Our study suggests that Fbxo21 is required for innate antiviral response by activating ASK1-JNK signaling pathway, thus revealing an important role of Fbxo21 in innate immunity. More importantly, we have identified a new modification of ASK1, that is, Lys29-linkage of ASK1. Ub-modification of ASK1 has been reported previously. E3 ligases, such as cIAP-1, SOCS1, zinc-finger protein A20 and Stub1 (also known as CHIP), have been implicated in degradation of ASK1 and thus a negative regulator of JNK and/or p38 activation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Won et al., 2010</xref>). In all these studies, Ub-modifications lead to ASK1 degradation. Since most of SCF complexes mediate degradation of substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2014</xref>), our finding of SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup>-mediated non-proteolytic polyubiquitination of ASK1 may indicate that SCF complexes may exert functions via non-proteolytic modification of substrates.</p><p>Ubiquitin serves as a small molecular marker on proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang and Chen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zinngrebe et al., 2014</xref>). Ideally, the seven lysine residues of Ub (lys6, lys11, lys27, lys29, Lys33, lys48 and Lys63) can all be transferred to protein substrates by the ubiquitin system. Lys48-linkage and Lys63-linkage of Ub have been most extensively investigated. Similar to the effects of Lys63-linkage, Lys33-linkage of CD3ζ promotes its phosphorylation and interaction with Zap70 and possibly the transport of CD3ζ to lysosomes for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ouchida et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). Recently our study revealed that K33-linkage of Zap70 by Nrdp1 promoted the dephosphorylation of Zap70 and thus terminated early TCR signaling in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). For the other types of Ub-modifications in innate response, little is known. TRAF6 has been implicated in Lys29-linkage but aggregation of huntingtin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zucchelli et al., 2011</xref>). The E3 ligase Itch may mediate Lys29-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chastagner et al., 2008</xref>). Previously deubiquitinating enzyme USP9X is implicated in the removal of Lys29-linked ubiquitin from AMPK-related kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hakim et al., 2008</xref>). Meanwhile, USP9X stabilizes ASK1 by removal of Ub chains from ASK1 and prevention of ASK1 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nagai et al., 2009</xref>). Our study suggests that SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup> may be the ligase responsible for Lys29-linkage of ASK1 by demonstrating that Fbxo21 is required for Lys29-linkage of ASK1 upon viral infection, leading to non-proteolytic modification of ASK1 and ASK1 phosphorylation. Our data also indicate that Lys29-linkage of ASK1 could facilitate its phosphorylation and activation, and a crosstalk may exist between phosphorylation and Lys29-linked polyubiquitination.</p><p>ASK1 is an important serine and threonine kinase involved in stress and immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shiizaki et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Map3k5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> MEFs, TNFα-induced apoptosis and JNK activation are attenuated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tobiume et al., 2001</xref>). In <italic>Map3k5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> thymocytes, FasL-induced activation of JNK and p38 is decreased while the apoptosis of thymocytes is not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tobiume et al., 2001</xref>). The primary neurons derived from <italic>Map3k5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice are resistant to polyglutamine-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nishitoh et al., 2002</xref>). More importantly, <italic>Map3k5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice demonstrate increased resistance to TLR4, but not TLR3 and TLR9, engagement, accompanied by impaired p38 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsuzawa et al., 2005</xref>). Upon infection with influenza virus, <italic>Map3k5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> MEFs show decreased JNK and p38 activation and inhibited cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maruoka et al., 2003</xref>). Despite these convincing results, roles of ASK1 in innate antiviral response are not fully elucidated. Our study suggests that ASK1 activation by SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup> is important in induction of type I IFN production, by using VSV and HSV-1 viruses as infection models. Our study also suggests that ASK1-mediated JNK activation, and to a lesser extent p38, is indispensable for type I IFN production, which is similar to the previous reports investigating TNFα-death receptor interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tobiume et al., 2001</xref>). Activity of ASK1 is regulated by many molecules that complex with ASK1 (ASK1 signalosome, about 1,500–2,000 kDa), such as ASK1 itself, ASK1 homologues, thioredoxin, TRAF2, TRAF6 and Daxx etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shiizaki et al., 2013</xref>). More unidentified molecules in ASK1 signalosome may exist for modulation of ASK1 activation. It has been proposed that ASK1 is usually activated via autophosphorylation after TRAF2− and TRAF6−assisted homodimerization in TNFα response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tobiume et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Noguchi et al., 2005</xref>). In our study, we have found a complex containing Fbxo21 and SCF components, thus adding new components to ASK1 signalosome. Whether SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup> associates with other components in ASK1 signalosome may need further investigation, and whether SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup>-mediated ASK1 activation needs TRAF2 and TRAF6 or upstream kinases may also be worthy of more studies.</p><p>When we are preparing the manuscript, it is reported that ASK1 is required for type I IFN production during antiviral innate response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Okazaki et al., 2015</xref>). In the current study, we also found that ASK1 deficiency led to impaired type I IFN production and increased virus replication. More importantly, we found that ASK1 deficient in Lys29-linkage could not rescue antiviral innate response in <italic>Map3k5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> RAW264.7 cells. Therefore, Fbxo21-mediated Ub-modification and activation of ASK1 are essential for innate antiviral response. It is interesting to find that JNK inhibitor could decrease the activation of IRF3 and type I IFN production. Previously it has been reported that JNK1/2 may be involved in activating IRF3 by phosphorylating IRF3 on Ser173 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) or licensing TBK1-mediated IRF3 phosphorylation on Ser396 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nociari et al., 2009</xref>), which may explain the effects of JNK1/2 inhibition on decreased innate antiviral response mediated by Fbxo21. Therefore, it can be inferred that Fbxo21-mediated ASK1 activation may be involved in regulation of antiviral innate response via JNK-dependent IRF3 activation.</p><p>In sum, our study has shown that Fbxo21 plays an indispensable role in regulating innate antiviral response by promoting the Lys29-linkage and activation of ASK1 and subsequently ASK1-mediated JNK1/2 activation. Therefore Fbxo21-mediated regulation of ASK1 polyubiquitination and ASK1 activation may represent a new type of Ub modification by SCF complex and act as an intrinsic part of antiviral innate response.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice, cells, reagents and antibodies</title><p>Wild type C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old) were purchased from Joint Ventures Sipper BK Experimental Animal (Shanghai, China).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, Hidenori Ichijo and Michaela Gack, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ruslan Medzhitov as the Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Yu et al. show that the F-box only protein, Fbxo21, is a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF complex and is critical for the innate immune response to viral infection. A microarray-based screen of Fbxo protein expression levels during viral infection identified Fbxo21 as being potentially involved in innate immune signaling. Using Fbxo21 knockout cells, the authors show that Fbxo21 plays an important role in the activation of innate immune signaling, specifically the production of cytokines and type I interferon, in response to viral infection. Using mass spectrometry analysis, the authors identify the protein kinase ASK1 as an interaction partner of Fbxo21. Through extensive characterization of ASK1 ubiquitination by SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup>, the authors conclude that Fbxo21 acts by targeting six lysine residues (Lys946, Lys950, Lys951, Lys952, Lys953 and Lys957) in ASK1 for SCF-mediated non-degradative K29-linked ubiquitination. Finally, the authors provide data which show that K29-linked ubiquitination of ASK1 is critical for downstream activation of JNK1/2, p38, and IRF3 and thus cytokine responses to infection with VSV and HSV-1. The authors propose a model in which Fbxo21 targets ASK1 for K29-linked ubiquitination by the SCF complex, which enables ASK1 to activate various innate immune signaling molecules, ultimately resulting in the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and interferons.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although it is convincing that Fbxo21 has an ability to lead Lys29-linked ubiquitination of ASK1 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, it is still not clear if Fbxo21-dependent Lys29-linked ubiquitination is required for ASK1 activity. Although ASK1 K13 mutant exhibited lower kinase activity, mutated sites in ASK1 K13 mutant might form different types of ubiquitin chain such as K48-linked or K63-linked, which might be involved in the regulation of ASK1 activity. To overcome this issue, the authors should measure ASK1 activity in Fbxo21-knockout cells and in MLN-4924-treated cells with or without virus infection. Moreover, the time course of ubiquitination and activation of ASK1 should be examined to discuss the requirement of ubiquitination for activation.</p><p>2) I recommend one additional experiment to strengthen the authors' model that Fbxo21 is a component of the SCF complex during viral infection.</p><p>The experiments intended to demonstrate that Fbxo21 is part of the SCF complex were performed by overexpressing tagged forms of individual SCF components. Performing an endogenous IP of SCF components and Fbxo21 in uninfected and virus-infected cells would strengthen the authors' point that Fbxo21 is indeed part of the SCF complex during viral infection.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14087.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) Although it is convincing that Fbxo21 has an ability to lead Lys29-linked ubiquitination of ASK1 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, it is still not clear if Fbxo21-dependent Lys29-linked ubiquitination is required for ASK1 activity.
