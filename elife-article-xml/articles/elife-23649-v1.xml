pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23649.001</object-id><p>The urokinase receptor (uPAR) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that promotes tissue remodeling, tumor cell adhesion, migration and invasion. uPAR mediates degradation of the extracellular matrix through protease recruitment and enhances cell adhesion, migration and signaling through vitronectin binding and interactions with integrins. Full-length uPAR is released from the cell surface, but the mechanism and significance of uPAR shedding remain obscure. Here we identify transmembrane glycerophosphodiesterase GDE3 as a GPI-specific phospholipase C that cleaves and releases uPAR with consequent loss of function, whereas its homologue GDE2 fails to attack uPAR. GDE3 overexpression depletes uPAR from distinct basolateral membrane domains in breast cancer cells, resulting in a less transformed phenotype, it slows tumor growth in a xenograft model and correlates with prolonged survival in patients. Our results establish GDE3 as a negative regulator of the uPAR signaling network and, furthermore, highlight GPI-anchor hydrolysis as a cell-intrinsic mechanism to alter cell behavior.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23649.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every process in the body, from how cells divide to how they move around, is tightly regulated. For example, cells only migrate when they receive the correct signals from their environment. These signals are recognised by receptor proteins that sit on the cell surface and connect the outside signal with the cell’s response. However, in cancer cells, these processes are out of control, which is why cancer cells can grow very quickly or spread to many different parts of the body.</p><p>One important receptor protein is the urokinase receptor, which helps to reorganize the tissue, for example, when wounds heal, but also enables cancer cells to grow and spread. A special feature of urokinase receptor is the way it is connected to the cell surface, namely through a molecule that acts as an anchor, called the GPI anchor. The urokinase receptor and some other GPI-anchored proteins can be released from their anchor. However, until now it was not clear why and how the urokinase receptor is released from cells, or how losing the receptor affects the cell.</p><p>Now, van Veen, Matas-Rico et al. studied breast cancer cells, and discovered that an enzyme called GDE3 cuts the urokinase receptor off its GPI anchor to release the receptor from the cells. However, when breast cancer cells shed the urokinase receptor, they also lost the receptor from the cell surface in specific areas. As a result, the receptor could not work anymore. When breast cancer cells were experimentally modified to produce high levels of GDE3, the cancer cells became less mobile and aggressive.</p><p>Van Veen, Matas-Rico et al. then implanted ‘normal’ breast cancer cells, and breast cancer cells with extra GDE3 into mice, and observed that the tumors of mice with additional GDE3 grew less quickly. Moreover, breast cancer patients with high levels of GDE3 tend to live longer than patients with low levels of GDE3. These results suggest that the enzyme GDE3 can suppress tumor growth.</p><p>These findings uncover a new way how cells can alter their behavior, namely by cleaving GPI anchors at the cell surface. Future experiments will need to address how GDE3 itself is controlled, and if it releases other GPI-anchored proteins from cells. Once we know how to increase GDE3 activity in tumor cells, the new knowledge could one day lead to therapies to help patients with cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GDE3</kwd><kwd>glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase</kwd><kwd>glycosylphosphatidylinositol</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leyton-Puig</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004622</institution-id><institution>KWF Kankerbestrijding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kedziora</surname><given-names>Katarzyna M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>GDE3 is a transmembrane GPI-specific phospholipase C that sheds the urokinase receptor (uPAR) from the cell surface resulting in loss of uPAR function in breast cancer cells and reduced tumor growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a central player in a complex signaling network implicated in a variety of remodeling processes, both physiological and pathological, ranging from embryo implantation to wound healing and tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boonstra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferraris and Sidenius, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith and Marshall, 2010</xref>). uPAR is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein and hence lacks intrinsic signaling capacity. Instead, uPAR acts by binding two major ligands, namely the protease urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein vitronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferraris and Sidenius, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Madsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith and Marshall, 2010</xref>). Through uPA binding, uPAR localizes plasmin generation to the cell surface and thereby promotes pericellular proteolysis and ECM degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferraris and Sidenius, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith and Marshall, 2010</xref>). In addition, through vitronectin binding and functional interactions with integrins and growth factor receptors, uPAR activates intracellular signaling pathways leading to cytoskeletal reorganization, enhanced cell adhesion and motility and other features of tissue remodeling and cell transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferraris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Madsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith and Marshall, 2010</xref>). As such, uPAR is a master regulator of extracellular proteolysis, cell motility and invasion. uPAR expression is elevated during inflammation and in many human cancers, where it often correlates with poor prognosis, supporting the view that tumor cells hijack the uPAR signaling system to enhance malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boonstra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferraris and Sidenius, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith and Marshall, 2010</xref>). Increased uPAR expression in solid tumors and the corresponding activated stroma is being evaluated by PET-imaging for patient stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Persson et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>It has long been known that full-length uPAR is released from the plasma membrane resulting in a soluble form (suPAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pedersen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ploug et al., 1992</xref>), which is detectable in body fluids and considered a marker of disease severity in cancer and other life-threatening disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haupt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shariat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sidenius et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stephens et al., 1999</xref>). Circulating suPAR is derived from activated immune and inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferraris and Sidenius, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith and Marshall, 2010</xref>), and also from circulating tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mustjoki et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Locally produced suPAR might function as a ligand scavenger to confer negative feedback on uPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith and Marshall, 2010</xref>). In addition, both uPAR and suPAR can undergo proteolytic fragmentation by uPA and other proteases, possibly leading to new signaling activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Montuori and Ragno, 2009</xref>). Yet, despite decades of research, the mechanism of uPAR release and its physiological implications have been elusive. A GPI-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scallon et al., 1991</xref>) has often been assumed to mediate the shedding of GPI-anchored proteins, but this unique PLD does not function on native membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mann et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>A possible clue to the mechanism of uPAR release comes from recent studies showing that a member of the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GDPD/GDE) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corda et al., 2014</xref>), termed GDE2, promotes neuronal differentiation by cleaving select GPI-anchored proteins, notably a Notch ligand regulator and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (glypicans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matas-Rico et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matas-Rico et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2013</xref>). GDE2, along with GDE3 and GDE6, belongs to a GDE subfamily characterized by six-transmembrane-domain proteins with a conserved catalytic ectodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matas-Rico et al., 2016</xref>).

By contrast, human GDE6 was mainly detected in intracellular compartments and therefore was not further tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To assess GDE activity, we generated stable uPAR-expressing HEK293 cells (HEK-uPAR cells), expressed GDE2 and GDE3 and examined the appearance of suPAR in the medium, using bacterial phospholipase C (PI-PLC) as a positive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matas-Rico et al., 2016</xref>). Strikingly, uPAR was readily released into the medium by GDE3 and PI-PLC, but not by GDE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). GDE3 competed with exogenous PI-PLC to deplete uPAR, since PI-PLC was much less efficient in GDE3-overexpressing than in control HEK-uPAR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Mutating putative active-site residue H229, corresponding to H233 in GDE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matas-Rico et al., 2016</xref>), abolished GDE3 activity without affecting its membrane localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, a transmembrane version of uPAR (uPAR-TM) lacking the GPI moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cunningham et al., 2003</xref>) was resistant to GDE3 attack, consistent with GDE3 acting through GPI-anchor hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis of GDE3-overexpressing cells confirmed decreased uPAR levels in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), while TIRF microscopy revealed substantial uPAR loss from the ventral cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>GDE2 versus GDE3: homology modeling</title><p>The selectivity of GDE3 versus GDE2 towards uPAR cleavage is striking. In an attempt to understand the structural basis of this selectivity, we constructed homology-based models of the globular α/β barrel GDPD domains, using I-TASSER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). We reasoned that the catalytic domains must recognize not only the PI lipid moiety at the membrane-water interface, but also the attached protein. While GDE2 and GDE3 have a similar putative GPI-binding groove leading to the active site, they show striking differences in their surface charge distribution, particularly at the putative substrate interaction surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). It therefore seems likely that surface properties are a major determinant of selective substrate recognition by GDEs, a notion that should be validated by future structural studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>GDE3 is a GPI-specific phospholipase C that cleaves uPAR in cis</title><p>We asked whether GDE3 attacks uPAR in cis (same cell) or in trans (adjacent cell), or both. By mixing GDE3-expressing cells (lacking uPAR) with uPAR-expressing cells (lacking GDE3), GDE3-expressing cells failed to shed uPAR from the GDE3-deficient cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, GDE3 acts in cis, attacking uPAR on the same plasma membrane, not on adjacent cells. To determine whether GDE3 acts as a phospholipase in GPI-anchor cleavage, we used Triton X-114 partitioning and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Triton X-114 partitioning revealed that suPAR did not contain lipid moieties, as it was not detected in the detergent phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Some GPI-anchored proteins are released from their anchor and detected in body fluids, implying involvement of one or more endogenous GPI-specific hydrolases. Recent studies have advanced the field by showing that cleavage and shedding of certain GPI-anchored proteins is mediated by a cell-intrinsic transmembrane glycerophosphodiesterase, termed GDE2 (or GDPD5), thereby promoting neuronal differentiation through multiple signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matas-Rico et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matas-Rico et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we focused on the shedding of GPI-anchored uPAR because of its regulatory role in multiple cellular and (patho)physiological activities, while soluble uPAR is considered a biomarker of various human pathologies. Here we report that GDE3 functions as a long-sought GPI-specific PLC that releases uPAR from its anchor. By contrast, its homologue GDE2 failed to release uPAR. As a consequence of GDE3 action, uPAR loses its vitronectin-dependent and matrix-degrading activities, when assayed in HEK293-uPAR and triple-negative breast cancer cells that express both uPAR and uPA. Importantly, loss of uPAR expression by GDE3 was found to be restricted to certain microdomains at the basolateral plasma membrane, where signal transduction is likely to take place. Thus, by acting as a GPI-specific PLC towards uPAR, GDE3 is a negative regulator of the uPAR signaling network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) that includes uPAR’s proteolytic and non-proteolytic activities. Consistent with this, GDE3 overexpression in uPA/uPAR-positive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells slowed tumor progression in a xenograft mouse model. Although statistically significant, the inhibitory effect of GDE3 overexpression on tumor growth was not dramatic, which should not come as a surprise since MDA-MBA-31 cells express the strongly oncogenic mutant K-RAS protein, which tends to override the regulation of numerous signaling pathways. Yet, this finding adds to the relevance of GPI-specific phospholipases in slowing tumor progression. Furthermore, high GDE3 expression was found to correlate with increased survival probability in triple-negative breast cancer patients. Interestingly, our previous work revealed a similar association between overexpression of GDE2 and positive clinical outcome in neuroblastoma patients, which appears attributable to GDE2-induced glypican shedding(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matas-Rico et al., 2016</xref>). The present patient survival analysis should be interpreted with caution, however, since involvement of uPAR release remains to be formally proven. Furthermore, we cannot rule out that GDE3 may cleave additional GPI-anchored substrates whose functional loss could contribute to positive clinical outcome.</p><p>The present results predict that, depending on its expression levels, GDE3 may downregulate normal uPAR-dependent remodeling processes. Indeed, upregulated GDE3 accelerates osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yanaka et al., 2003</xref>) in a manner resembling the uPAR knockout phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Furlan et al., 2007</xref>).

GDE3 was recloned into a pcDNA3(-mCherry) construct by PCR amplification with restriction sites PmI1/Xba1, followed by vector digestion using EcoRV/Xba1. GDE6 transcript variant X7 (GDPD4; NCBI: XM_011544834.1) was cloned into pcDNA5_FRT_TO_puro (provided by dr. Geert Kops, University Medical Center Utrecht). All constructs were epitope- tagged on the C-terminus unless otherwise stated. Mutant GDE3(H229A) was generated by amplification with oligos containing the mutation, followed by Dpn1 digestion of the template. The viral plasmids (pBABE-GDE3-mCh, pBABE-uPAR-GFP) were constructed by subcloning the GDE3-pcDNA3 and uPAR-GFP-pEGFP-N1 into a pBABE plasmid. GDE3-mCherry-pcDNA3 was cut using PmeI followed by digestion of the pBABE backbone with SnaBI. uPAR-GFP-pEGFP-N1 was cut with BglII and HpaI and ligated into the pBABE vector, digested with BAMHI and SnaB1. Constructs uPAR-GFP, uPAR-FLAG and non-cleavable uPAR-TM were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caiolfa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cunningham et al., 2003</xref>). Transmembrane-anchored uPAR-TM was constructed by substituting the GPI-anchoring sequence of uPAR (aa 274–313) with the transmembrane region (aa 614–653) of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cunningham et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Transfections and RNA<sub>i</sub>-mediated knockdown</title><p>Cells stably expressing uPAR-GFP or GDE3-mCherry were generated using retroviral transduction and subsequent selection with puromycin. Transient transfections were done using the calcium phosphate protocol or XtremeGene 9 agent (Roche). Stable uPAR knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells was achieved using shRNAs in a lentiviral pLKO vector; five shRNAs from three RC human shRNA library were tested: TRCN0000052637, TRCN0000052636, TRCN0000052634, TRCN0000052633 and TRCN0000052635. The latter two were used for experiments; sequences: CCGGCCCATGAATCAATGTC TGGTACTCGAGTACCAGACATTGATTCATGGGTTTTTG and CGGGCTTGAAGA TCACCAGCCTTACTCGAGTAAGGCTGGTGATCTTCAAGCTTTTTG, respectively. For virus production, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate, and virus particles were collected 48 hr thereafter. uPAR knockdown cells were selected in medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>CRISPR knockout</title><p>uPAR and GDE3 knockout cell lines were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. CRISPR sequences were designed targeting uPAR (<italic>PLAUR;</italic> exon 2<italic>; 5’- CATGCAGTGTAAGACCAACG-3’ and 5’-CCAGGGCGCACTCTTCCACA-3’</italic>) or GDE3 (<italic>GDPD2; exon 2; 5’-AGGATGCAAACCAGCAAGG-3’)</italic> and cloned into pX330 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cong et al., 2013</xref>). MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with the exon-specific pX330 plasmids in addition to a plasmid containing a guide RNA to the <italic>Danio Rerio</italic> TIA gene (5’- GGTATGTCGGGAACCTCTCC -3’) and a cassette of a 2A sequence followed by a BlastR gene, flanked by two TIA target sites. Co-transfection results in infrequent integration of the BlastR gene at the targeted genomic locus by NHEJ, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blomen et al., 2015</xref>). Successful integration of the cassette renders cells resistant to blasticidin. Three days following transfection, the culture medium was supplemented with blasticidin (25 μg/ml). Surviving colonies were clonally expanded, screened for cassette integration and indels into the query gene by PCR (GDE3; 5’- TATGAATCCTGCCCGAAAAG-3’ and 5’-AGAGCAGGCCAAACCAGATA-3’) or by western blot analysis of the target protein (uPAR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)</title><p>To determine the inositol phosphate content of cleaved uPAR, suPAR was immuno-precipitated from HEK293 cell conditioned medium using anti-GFP beads (ChromoTek). To remove inositol phosphate from suPAR, the beads were treated with 0.1M acetate buffer (pH 3.5) and subsequently with 0.5M NaNO2 or 0.5M NaCl (Control) for 3 hr as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mehlert and Ferguson, 2009</xref>). Inositol phosphate-containing samples were preprocessed by adding methanol to a final concentration of 70% and shaken at 1000 RPM at room temperature for 10 min. Following centrifugation (20,400 x <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 10 min), the supernatant was evaporated to dryness in a Speedvac at room temperature. The dried extracts were reconstituted in 50 mM ammonium acetate (pH 8.0), centrifuged (20,400 x <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 10 min) and transferred to autosampler vials. Liquid chromatography (LC) was performed using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A volume of 5 μl was injected on a Zorbax HILIC PLUS column (150 × 0.5 mm, 3.0 μm particles) maintained at 30°C. Elution was performed using a gradient: (0–5 min, 20% B; 5–45 min 20–100% B; 45–50 min 100% B; 50–50.1 min 20% B; 50.1–60 min 20% B) of 100% acetonitrile (mobile phase A) and 50 mM ammonium acetate adjusted to pH 8.0 with ammonium hydroxide (mobile phase B) at a flow rate of 15 μl/min. Inositol 1-phosphate was detected with an LTQ-Orbitrap Discovery mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated in negative ionization mode scanning from <italic>m/z</italic> 258 to 260 with a resolution of 30,000 FWHM. Electrospray ionization was performed with a capillary temperature set at 300°C and the sheath, auxiliary and sweep gas flow set at 17, 13 and 1 arbitrary units (AU), respectively. Setting for Ion guiding optics were: Source voltage: 2.4 kV, capillary voltage: −18 V, Tube Lens: −83 V, Skimmer Offset: 0 V, Multipole 00 Offset: 5 V, Lens 0: 5 V, Multipole 0 Offset: 5.5 V, Lens 1: 11 V, Gate Lens Offset: 68 V, Multipole 1 Offset: 11.5 V, Front Lens: 5.5 V. Data acquisition was performed using Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reference inositol phosphate (Sigma) was used to determine the retention on the Zorbax HILIC plus column. After applying Xcalibur’s build-in smoothing algorithm (Boxcar, 7), extracted ion chromatograms (<italic>m/z</italic> 259.02–259.03) were used to semi-quantitatively determine inositol phosphate levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cell adhesion and spreading</title><p>48-wells plates were coated overnight at 4°C with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) or vitronectin (5 μg/ml), or left untreated. Thereafter, plates were blocked for 2 hr at 37°C using 0.5% BSA in PBS. Cells were washed and harvested in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA. Equal numbers of cells were seeded and allowed to adhere for 1 hr. Non-adherent cells were washed away using PBS. Attached cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min, followed by washing and staining with Crystal violet (5 mg/ml in 2% ethanol) for 10 min. After extensive washing, cells were dried and lysed in 2% SDS for 30 min. Quantification was done by measuring absorbance at 570 nm using a plate reader. For cell-matrix contact area and lamellipodia measurements, coverslips were coated overnight with fibronectin or vitronectin and washed twice with PBS. Cells were trypsinized, washed and resuspended in DMEM and left to adhere and spread for 4 hr. After fixation (4% PFA) and F-actin staining with phalloidin, images were taken using confocal microscopy. Cell and lamellipodia area was quantified using an ImageJ macro.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cell scattering and colony formation</title><p>Cell scattering was determined as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">LeBeau et al., 2013</xref>). In brief, single MDA-MB-231 cells were allowed to grow out as colonies, and the area covered by the scattered colonies (colony size) was measured at 6 days after plating. For measuring colony outgrowth, 500 cells were plated and colonies were counted after 14 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Matrix degradation</title><p>Coverslips were coated with OG-labelled gelatin (InVitrogen) supplemented with vitronectin (5 μg/ml). About 100.000 cells per coverslip were seeded in DMEM with 10% FCS. After 20 hr, cells were washed, fixed with 4% PFM and stained with phalloidin-Alexa647 (InVitrogen). Gelatin degradation was determined from confocal images of &gt;15 randomly automatically chosen fields of view per coverslip (testing at least two coverslips/condition on two separate days: total four coverslips per condition). The images were randomized and the area of degradation was normalized to the total area of cells or to the number of cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RT-qPCRT</title><p>Total RNA was isolated using the GeneJET purification kit (Fermentas). cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription from 2 μg RNA with oligodT 15 primers and SSII RT enzyme (Invitrogen). Relative qPCR was measured on a 7500 Fast System (Applied Biosystems) as follows: 95°C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s followed by 60°C for 1 min. 200 nM forward and reverse primers, 16 μl SYBR Green Supermix (Applied Biosystems) and diluted cDNA were used in the final reaction mixture. GAPDH was used as reference gene and milliQ was used as negative control. Normalized expression was calculated following the equation NE = 2(Ct target-Ct reference). Primers used: GDE3, forward TCAGCAGGACCACGAATGTA, reverse GCTGCAGCTTCCTCCAATAG; uPAR, forward AATGGCCGCCAGTGTTACAG, reverse CAGGAGACATCAATGTGGTTC; Cyclophilin, forward CATCTGCACTGCCAAGACTGA, reverse TTGCCAAACACCACATGCTT. For RT-PCR 25 ng cDNA was used in a RT-PCR reaction using GoTaq (Promega). Primer sequences GAPDH forward 5’-CCATGTTCGTCATGGGTGT-3’, GAPDH reverse 5’-CCAGGGGTGCTAAGCAGTT-3’, GDE3 forward 1 5’-TGTTTGAGACTGATGTGATGGTC-3’, GDE3 reverse 1 5’-TTCGGGTTGGGAATACAGAG-3’</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Western blotting</title><p>For Western blotting, cells were washed with cold PBS, lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and spun down. Protein concentration was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and LDS sample buffer (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) was added to the lysate or directly to the medium. Equal amounts were loaded on SDS-PAGE pre-cast gradient gels (4–12% Nu-Page Bis-Tris, Invitrogen) followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Non-specific protein binding was blocked by 5% skimmed milk in TBST; primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C in TBST with 2% skimmed milk. Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature; proteins were detected using ECL Western blot reagent.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Triton X-114 phase separation</title><p>HEK293 cells transiently transfected with GDE2, GDE3 or empty plasmid, were plated on PEI-coated 6-well plates. After 24 hr complete medium was replaced with 1 ml serum free medium, 24 hr thereafter the conditioned medium was collected. 2% pre-condensed Triton X-114 was added to ice-cold conditioned medium and phases were separated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doering et al., 2001</xref>). The top aqueous phase and the bottom detergent phase were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Cells cultured on 24 mm, #1,5 coverslips were washed and fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked with 2% BSA for 1 hr. Incubation with primary antibodies was done for 1 hr followed by incubation with Alexa-conjugated antibodies or Phalloidin for 45 min at room temperature. For confocal microscopy, cells were washed with PBS, mounted with Immnuno-MountTM (Thermo Scientific) and visualized on a LEICA TCS-SP5 confocal microscopy (63 x objective). Super-resolution imaging was done using a SR-GSD Leica microscope equipped with an oxygen scavenging system, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matas-Rico et al., 2016</xref>). In short, 15000 frames were taken in TIRF mode, at 10 ms exposure time. After post image analysis, movies were analyzed and corrected using the ImageJ plugin Thunderstorm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) followed by correction with an ImageJ macro using the plugin Image Stabilizer. For Total Internal Reflection (TIRF) microscopy, HEK293 cells stably expressing UPAR-GFP and transiently transfected with GDE3-mCherry were imaged using a Leica AM TIRF MC microscope with a HCX PL APO 63x, 1.47 NA oil immersion lens. Excitation was at 488 and 561 nm and detection of fluorescence emission was by a GR filter cube (Leica). Before each experiment, automatic laser alignment was carried out and TIRF penetration depth was set to 200 nm. Data were acquired at 500 ms frame rate. Basolateral uPAR patches were visualized using confocal microscopy and the area was quantified using an ImageJ macro that measured the uPAR patches based on fluorescence intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>HEK293 cells stably expressing uPAR-GFP were left untreated, treated with PI-PLC or transiently transfected with GDE3-mCherry. MDA-MB-231 cells were stably transfected with GDE3-mCherry. Cells were trypsinized, blocked in 2%BSA and stained with rabbit anti-GFP primary antibody or mouse anti-uPAR (13F6) antibody followed by AlexaFluor-647 coupled anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Cells were analyzed using a BD LSR Fortessa flow cytometer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Mouse xenograft assay</title><p>Equal groups (n = 16) of eight-week-old female NMRI nude mice were injected subcutaneously into the mammary fat pads. Prior to injection, GDE3-expressing or control MDA-MB-231 cells (5 × 105) were suspended in an equal volume of cold phosphate buffered saline and diluted 1:1 with Matrigel. The tumor growth was monitored 3 times a week for 9 weeks by caliper measurements. The tumor volumes were calculated with the formula: 0,5 x length x width¬2 and statistical analysis of the tumor growth was done using a multiple t-test corrected for multiple comparison. A P value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically different. The mouse experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Netherlands Cancer Institute (protocol number: 30100 2015 407 appendix 1 WP 6061).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For all single comparisons, a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used; for multiple comparisons, an ordinary ANOVA with Tukey’s test was used. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Error bars shown in the bar diagrams were calculated as the standard error of the mean (SEM); whiskers in the box plots depict 95% confidence intervals.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the people from the Preclinical Intervention Unit of the Mouse Clinic for Cancer and Ageing (MCCA) at the NKI for performing the animal experiments.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jonathan Cooper (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Ploug (Reviewer #2); Reinhard Fässler (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>GPI-membrane-bound uPAR can be cleaved from the cell surface to produce a soluble form (soluble uPAR – suPAR), which is readily detected in blood and urine and is markedly increased in pathological conditions, such as inflammation and in various types of cancer. The mechanism of uPAR release and its physiological implications are still largely unknown. The manuscript by van Veen et al., reports the novel finding that the transmembrane glycerophosphodiesterase GDE3 can promote shedding of uPAR in cultured cells by cleavage of uPAR's GPI-anchor via a phospholipase C-like activity. This finding is interesting because of suPAR's role as a prognostic biomarker for poor patient prognosis. Moreover, increased uPAR expression in solid tumors (and the corresponding activated stroma) is being evaluated by PET-imaging for patient stratification (Persson et al. 2015, Theranostics 5, 1303-1306). However, despite some clear strengths of the submitted manuscript, the research appears to have some important shortcomings and limitations, which the authors should address in a revised submission:</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The bulk of the biochemical data on the shedding of uPAR driven by GDE3 expression/activity performed in transfected HEK293 cells (co-transfection of both uPAR &amp; GDE3) or MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell line (transfection of GDE3). Under these conditions it appears that only a fraction of the total uPAR is actually shed from the cell surface. Consequently, it is recommended the GDE3-mediated release of uPAR should be tested in cell lines that endogenously co-express both uPAR and GDE3 in which GDE3 expression is inhibited or silenced by RNA interference or CRISPR/CAS9 strategies.</p><p>2) In their Introduction the authors posit that the mechanism(s) of shedding of soluble uPAR remained enigmatic until their discovery of the potential role of GDE3 in cleaving uPAR's GPI linkage. This is an over-simplification since it is that uPAR can be shed by proteolysis. Indeed, the proteolytically released domain I fragment is actually the more powerful biomarker for poor prognosis and correlates better to cancer burden in a GEM model of breast cancer (Thurison et al., 2015 Mol Carcinog 55: 717-731). Consequently, the authors should clarify the relative role of the different mechanisms of uPAR shedding in the text.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and 1C</xref> the GDE3-mediated release of uPAR to the medium and the reduction in uPAR at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) is convincingly shown. However, it also seems that this is a relatively ineffective shedding (despite GDE3 being expressed by transfection). Indeed, the flow cytometry analysis appears to indicate that GDE3 promotes only 10% of the uPAR shedding compared to PI-PLC. This should be quantified and commented on. Moreover, how does the subcellular localization of GDE3 (filopodia, microclusters) compare to that of uPAR in cells that do not so heavily overexpress GDE3 or in the invasive front of solid tumors where uPAR is believed to be concentrated?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates that GDE3 promotes uPAR shedding by a phospholipase C-like mechanism. However, it has been noted by others (Ploug et al., 1991 JBC 266: 1926-1933) that GPI-anchors carrying an additional acylation at the 2-hydroxyl position of the inositol ring would be refractory to the action of GDE3 (and experimentally to GPI-PLC). Since a substantial proportion (~50%) of uPAR may carry this acylation event in some cells, the authors should discuss how this might alter uPAR shedding by the GDE3 mechanism in some cells.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> the authors investigate the effect of GDE3 transfection on MDA-MB-231 cells ability to cleave gelatin (denatured collagen). This is an unusual approach since it is well established that uPAR functions by focalizing uPA-mediated plasminogen activation to the cell surface and that the physiologically important substrate for this is fibrin – not collagen (Connolly et al., 2010 Blood 116: 1593-1603). Moreover, the control for inhibition of this activity should not be a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor but alpha2-antiplasmin or prevention of uPA binding by adding a neutralizing antibody or an inactivated variant of uPA (DFP-treated uPA, active site mutated (S356A) or simply the uPAR binding fragment ATF.</p><p>6) In the second paragraph of the Results and Discussion the authors speculate, based on in silico modeling, that the selectivity of GDE3 for uPAR arises due to an exosite interaction with the protein moiety of uPAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This appears highly speculative since the authors have not experimentally demonstrated selectivity of GDE3 for uPAR over other other GPI-anchored uPAR homologs in parallel (e.g. CD177, C4.4A, TEX101 or Haldisin). Moreover, the cleavage of the uPAR-GFP-hybrid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and uPAR-FLAG (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) would tend to argue against such specificity. In their Materials and methods they state that these gene fusions were generated as described by Cunningham et al. 2003 (although no GFP version was described in that paper). In the experiments described by Cunningham et al., the FLAG epitope tag or TM-region is fused at position 275 or 277 in uPAR, which eliminates the region of uPAR proximal to the GPI-attachment site (position 283) thereby eliminating the protein sequence that van Veen et al. propose to serve in exosite binding. It is possible that the citation of Cunningham et al. 2003 may be in error and what the authors actually used was a more recent strategy in which GFP is inserted between uPAR and the GPI-anchoring signal (Hellriegel et al. 2011, FASEB J 25, 2882-2897) leaving residues 276-283 of uPAR in close enough proximity to occupy a putative exosite in GDE3. Although potentially interesting, this suggestion is nevertheless also complicated by the fact that this region is completely different between mouse and human uPAR (and should be mirrored by a similar difference in GDE3). If not elaborated on experimentally this speculation should thus be omitted.</p><p>7) In the seventh paragraph of the Results and Discussion it states that invasion of pre-implantation embryos is a known uPA/uPAR-dependent process is incorrect. Although uPAR is expressed by giant trophoblasts, the fact that genetic ablation of uPAR has no effect on mouse fertility (or development, or hemostasis) suggests that this system is not essential for the invasion of pre-implantation mouse embryos (Bugge et al. 1995, JBC 270, 16886).</p><p>8) It would be interesting, and potentially important, to test the effects of GDE3 over-expression on the in vivo tumorigenicity and/or metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells in appropriately xenografted mice. More specifically, to what extent does GDE3 over-expression diminish the in vivo tumorigenicity of MDA-MB-231 cells and to what extent can any GDE3-mediated inhibitory effects on tumorigenesis be reversed by the expression of the GDE3 resistant uPAR-TM construct?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Negative regulation of urokinase receptor activity by a GPI-specific phospholipase C in breast cancer cells&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Jonathan Cooper (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The revised paper is much improved but the new data have raised additional questions. The paper now provides strong evidence that over-expressing GDE3 (but not GDE2) causes release of a soluble form of uPAR (suPAR). Combined with the in vitro experiments showing GPI-PLC activity of GDE3 but not GDE2 on uPAR, the paper makes a strong case for GDE3 down-regulating uPAR by cleavage of the inositol phosphodiester of the GPI anchor. Consistent with this hypothesis, over-expressed GDE3 opposes uPAR in various functional assays done with HEK-uPAR and MDA-MB-231 cells. The reviewers were concerned, however, that the functional assays could have been done with better controls, such as catalytically-inactive GDE3 and an uncleavable form of uPAR. Experiments to show whether GDE3 is necessary for uPAR cleavage would have been better done in cells with high levels of GDE3 and uPAR gene expression. In addition, the% decrease in uPAR when GDE3 is over-expressed seems rather small, raising questions whether or not uPAR is the primary substrate. However, the original round of review did not bring out these issues prominently, so we are only recommending minor revisions to be clear about the limitations of the results.</p><p>1.

Under these conditions it appears that only a fraction of the total uPAR is actually shed from the cell surface. Consequently, it is recommended the GDE3-mediated release of uPAR should be tested in cell lines that endogenously co-express both uPAR and GDE3 in which GDE3 expression is inhibited or silenced by RNA interference or CRISPR/CAS9 strategies.</italic> </p><p>We have addressed these points as follows:</p><p>- We have used CRISPR-based knockout strategies to knockout both GDE3 and uPAR in breast cancer cells, showing that GDE3-deficient MDA-MB-231 cells show the predicted uPAR-dependent phenotype.</p><p>- We now show that an independent triple-negative breast cancer cell line (Hs578T, which is uPAR-positive; NCI-60 panel analysis) has the same phenotype as MDA-MB-231 cells upon GDE3 overexpression.</p><p>- FACS analysis shows reduced uPAR expression at the MDA-MB-231 cell surface upon GDE3 expression. Loss of uPAR by GDE3 is indeed partial, as shown by dual-color microscopy.</p><p>- Confocal and dual-color super-resolution microscopy in TIRF mode show where GDE3 and uPAR localize at the basolateral plasma membrane, and which uPAR fraction is depleted by active GDE3 but not by inactive GDE3(H229A).</p><p><italic>2) In their Introduction the authors posit that the mechanism(s) of shedding of soluble uPAR remained enigmatic until their discovery of the potential role of GDE3 in cleaving uPAR's GPI linkage. This is an over-simplification since it is that uPAR can be shed by proteolysis. Indeed, the proteolytically released domain I fragment is actually the more powerful biomarker for poor prognosis and correlates better to cancer burden in a GEM model of breast cancer (Thurison et al., 2015 Mol Carcinog 55: 717-731). Consequently, the authors should clarify the relative role of the different mechanisms of uPAR shedding in the text.</italic> </p><p>Proteolytic fragmentation of uPAR resulting in the release of the domain 1 fragment from cells is in our opinion most correctly referred to as uPAR-cleavage as the majority of the receptor remains anchored to the plasma membrane after the event. For clarity, we now mention proteolytic fragmentation of uPAR in the Introduction, but we believe a further expansion on this point would only add confusion, as we do not investigate proteolytic cleavage of uPAR in this study. Along the same line, we do not present any biomarker data that would allow us to conclude anything on the possible importance of the GDE3-uPAR axis for the power of (s)uPAR and (s)uPAR-fragments as biomarkers. Although very interesting, we believe discussing these issues would be to speculative.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and 1C</xref> the GDE3-mediated release of uPAR to the medium and the reduction in uPAR at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) is convincingly shown. However, it also seems that this is a relatively ineffective shedding (despite GDE3 being expressed by transfection). Indeed, the flow cytometry analysis appears to indicate that GDE3 promotes only 10% of the uPAR shedding compared to PI-PLC. This should be quantified and commented on. Moreover, how does the subcellular localization of GDE3 (filopodia, microclusters) compare to that of uPAR in cells that do not so heavily overexpress GDE3 or in the invasive front of solid tumors where uPAR is believed to be concentrated?</italic> </p><p>See point #1 above. New flow cytometry data show that part of endogenous uPAR in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells is shed by active GDE3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, we have used confocal and TRIF dual-color super-resolution microscopy showing that uPAR (both transfected and endogenous) colocalizes with catalytically dead GDE3(H229A) but not with active wild-type uPAR at distinct microdomains at the ventral plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, GDE3 activity regulates endogenous uPAR only in select membrane domains, which is consistent with the observation that active GDE3 does not deplete the entire uPAR membrane pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates that GDE3 promotes uPAR shedding by a phospholipase C-like mechanism. However, it has been noted by others (Ploug et al., 1991 JBC 266: 1926-1933) that GPI-anchors carrying an additional acylation at the 2-hydroxyl position of the inositol ring would be refractory to the action of GDE3 (and experimentally to GPI-PLC). Since a substantial proportion (~50%) of uPAR may carry this acylation event in some cells, the authors should discuss how this might alter uPAR shedding by the GDE3 mechanism in some cells.</italic> </p><p>This is a somewhat confusing issue. GPI-anchors are modified by inositol acylation during biosynthesis, but it is far from clear if mature GPI-anchored proteins at the plasma membrane still carry this modification. In fact, normal inositol de-acylation could be impaired under overexpression conditions, such in HEK293 cells. GPI-anchor acylation of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase renders it resistant to bacterial PI-PLC, but not to GPI-PLD (Roberts et al. 1988, JBC 263: 18766-75), but this seems to be an exception. Consistent with previous results (for example, Hoyer-Hansen et al. 2001, Biochem J 358:673), we find that mature uPAR is efficiently shed by PI-PLC, as well as by GDE3, arguing against a GDE3-resistant fraction. Actually, Ploug et al., 1991 (JBC 266:1926) also describe efficient uPAR release by exogenous PI-PLC. That being said, we cannot find evidence for the notion that “a substantial proportion (~50%) of uPAR may carry this acylation”. We therefore prefer not to discuss this hypothesis.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> the authors investigate the effect of GDE3 transfection on MDA-MB-231 cells ability to cleave gelatin (denatured collagen). This is an unusual approach since it is well established that uPAR functions by focalizing uPA-mediated plasminogen activation to the cell surface and that the physiologically important substrate for this is fibrin – not collagen (Connolly et al., 2010 Blood 116: 1593-1603). Moreover, the control for inhibition of this activity should not be a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor but alpha2-antiplasmin or prevention of uPA binding by adding a neutralizing antibody or an inactivated variant of uPA (DFP-treated uPA, active site mutated (S356A) or simply the uPAR binding fragment ATF.</italic> </p><p>We agree that collagen is not a direct substrate for plasmin. However, it has long been known that plasmin can degrade collagen indirectly through activation of latent collagenase. See for example, Werb et al., N Engl J Med 296:1017–1023, 1977). In a tumor context, uPA/uPAR knockdown has strong effects on matrigel invasion and tumor cell angiogenesis, See for example: Subramanian et al., Int. J. Oncol. 28:831-6; 2006; Montgomery et al., Breast Cancer Res. 14:R84; 2012. Furthermore, the involvement of the uPAR-uPA signaling axis in Matrigel and gelatin degradation has been documented in various cell systems (Fleetwood, et al., J Immunol, 2014. 192:3540; Kunigal et al., Int J Cancer, 2007. 121:2307; Kargiotis et al., Int J Oncol, 2008. 33: 937; Duriseti et al. J Biol Chem, 2010. 285:26878). Since we focused on regulation of uPAR by GDE3 in breast cancer cells, we reasoned that degradation of gelatin (mixed with vitronectin and serum factors) would be a relevant model system.</p><p>To show that GDE3 expression decreases gelatin degradation through uPAR release, we originally used two hairpins against uPAR. We have now confirmed this finding by using CRISPR-based uPAR knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We used a widely used MMP inhibitor (GM6001) as a control, simply to show that loss of gelatin occurs through degradation.</p><p><italic>6) In the second paragraph of the Results and Discussion the authors speculate, based on in silico modeling, that the selectivity of GDE3 for uPAR arises due to an exosite interaction with the protein moiety of uPAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This appears highly speculative since the authors have not experimentally demonstrated selectivity of GDE3 for uPAR over other GPI-anchored uPAR homologs in parallel (e.g. CD177, C4.4A, TEX101 or Haldisin). Moreover, the cleavage of the uPAR-GFP-hybrid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and uPAR-FLAG (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) would tend to argue against such specificity. In their Materials and methods they state that these gene fusions were generated as described by Cunningham et al. 2003 (although no GFP version was described in that paper). In the experiments described by Cunningham et al., the FLAG epitope tag or TM-region is fused at position 275 or 277 in uPAR, which eliminates the region of uPAR proximal to the GPI-attachment site (position 283) thereby eliminating the protein sequence that van Veen et al. propose to serve in exosite binding. It is possible that the citation of Cunningham et al. 2003 may be in error and what the authors actually used was a more recent strategy in which GFP is inserted between uPAR and the GPI-anchoring signal (Hellriegel et al. 2011, FASEB J 25, 2882-2897) leaving residues 276-283 of uPAR in close enough proximity to occupy a putative exosite in GDE3. Although potentially interesting, this suggestion is nevertheless also complicated by the fact that this region is completely different between mouse and human uPAR (and should be mirrored by a similar difference in GDE3). If not elaborated on experimentally this speculation should thus be omitted.</italic> </p><p>These points are well taken. Yet we feel that some speculation is allowed in this case, also because the reviewer considers our suggestion ‘potentially interesting’. The uPAR-GFP and uPAR-FLAG constructs used in this study are those described in Caiolfa et al. JCB 2007 and Cunningham et al. 2003, respectively. In both of these constructs, the tag has been inserted within the disordered region between the membrane proximal domain 3 and the GPI anchoring signal. Although the exact insertion site of the tag within the disordered region is not the same in the two constructs, both insertions leave the mature uPAR protein intact and accessible for putative exosite interactions. Mapping the location of the exact exosite interaction and determining the selectivity of GDE3 towards uPAR-homologs goes beyond the scope the present paper, in our frank opinion.</p><p>It is true that GPI-anchor variants and the sequence of their pro-peptide could determine protein localization or selective cleavage by GPI-PLC’s. We now have obtained new data supporting the view that GDEs not only recognize PI-lipid moieties at the water-membrane interface (or the adjacent amino acids) but also the attached protein. We previously showed that GDE2 cleaves GPI-anchored glypican 6 (GPC6) (E. Matas-Rico et al. 2016). To show that GDE substrate specificity is not solely dependent on the GPI-anchor attachment or the unstructured region upstream of this signal, we constructed uPAR-GPC6 chimeras. We swapped the C-terminal region of uPAR with that of GPC6, and analyzed GDE2 enzymatic activity. GDE2 did not shed the uPAR-GPC6 chimaera, whereas GDE3 did (Van Veen et al., manuscript in preparation). Therefore, surface charge distributions could well determine protein-protein interactions and, consequently, selective substrate specificity of GDE3 versus GDE3.</p><p><italic>7) In the seventh paragraph of the Results and Discussion it states that invasion of pre-implantation embryos is a known uPA/uPAR-dependent process is incorrect. Although uPAR is expressed by giant trophoblasts, the fact that genetic ablation of uPAR has no effect on mouse fertility (or development, or hemostasis) suggests that this system is not essential for the invasion of pre-implantation mouse embryos (Bugge et al. 1995, JBC 270, 16886).</italic> </p><p>Our original phrasing was a bit inaccurate. Although uPAR is not essential for embryonic development (neither is GDE3, for that matter; S. Sockanathan, personal communication), its absence may be overcome by redundant or compensatory mechanisms (Teesalu et al., 1998). Thus, uPAR and GDE3 appear to be ‘involved’ in the migration and invasion of pre-implantation embryos. We have revised the text accordingly, with new references.</p><p><italic>8) It would be interesting, and potentially important, to test the effects of GDE3 over-expression on the in vivo tumorigenicity and/or metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells in appropriately xenografted mice. More specifically, to what extent does GDE3 over-expression diminish the in vivo tumorigenicity of MDA-MB-231 cells and to what extent can any GDE3-mediated inhibitory effects on tumorigenesis be reversed by the expression of the GDE3 resistant uPAR-TM construct?</italic> </p><p>We agree that it would be interesting to test the effects of GDE3 over-expression in xenografted mice, although this would make revision of our manuscript within two months impossible. Nevertheless, we have performed the mice experiments. The new results show that GDE3 overexpression slows tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We did not the test the uPAR-TM construct in mice, because of time and costs considerations</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>[…] 1.

Concerning suPAR measurements in GDE3-depleted cells, this is a valid question. The problem is that GDE3 expression in breast cancer cell lines is relatively low (Barretina et al., 2012). We therefore preferred to rely on sensitive morphological assays in GDE3 knockout cells, very similar to the protocol used in our studies on GDE2-mediated glypican release. In that case, relatively little GDE2-mediated glypican release accounts for a prominent phenotype (Matas-Rico et al., Cancer Cell. 2016;30:548). Of note, also in GDE3-expressing HEK-uPAR cells the most striking response was an altered phenotype when the cells plated were on VN. In conclusion, highly localized release of GPI-anchored proteins (by either GDE3 or GDE2) can result in dramatic phenotypic outcomes.
