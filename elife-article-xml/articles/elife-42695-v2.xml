Grb2, Sos1, SLP-76, Nck, and WASP. These condensates move radially at the IS, traversing successive radially-oriented and concentric actin networks. To understand this movement, we biochemically reconstituted LAT condensates with actomyosin filaments. We found that basic regions of Nck and N-WASP/WASP promote association and co-movement of LAT condensates with actin, indicating conversion of weak individual affinities to high collective affinity upon phase separation. Condensates lacking these components were propelled differently, without strong actin adhesion. In cells, LAT condensates lost Nck as radial actin transitioned to the concentric network, and engineered condensates constitutively binding actin moved aberrantly. Our data show that Nck and WASP form a clutch between LAT condensates and actin in vitro and suggest that compositional changes may enable condensate movement by distinct actin networks in different regions of the IS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>biomolecular condensate</kwd><kwd>T cell signaling</kwd><kwd>actin cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>compositional

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biomolecular condensates are compartments in eukaryotic cells that concentrate macromolecules without an encapsulating membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>). Numerous condensates are found in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, where they are involved in processes ranging from mRNA storage and degradation to DNA repair and ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brangwynne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Feric et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Protter and Parker, 2016</xref>). They are also found at membranes, where they control the organization, and likely the activity, of many signaling receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Banjade and Rosen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Case et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Su et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Condensates are thought to form through phase separation driven by multivalent interactions between molecules containing multiple binding elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Banjade and Rosen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Recent models suggest that a limited collection of proteins and/or RNA molecules forms the essential phase separating scaffold of particular condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ditlev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Langdon et al., 2018</xref>). These molecules then recruit larger numbers of client proteins to complete the structure. Condensate composition is thus determined by the specificity of interactions among scaffolds and between scaffolds and clients. The concentrations, interactions, and dynamics of scaffolds and clients are believed to dictate the biochemical activities, and consequent cellular functions, of individual condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holehouse and Pappu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stroberg and Schnell, 2018</xref>). The composition of many condensates is known to change in response to signals, implying regulated changes in activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dellaire et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Markmiller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Salsman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Youn et al., 2018</xref>). However, the relationships between composition and biochemical/cellular functions are not well understood in most cases.</p><p>During activation of a T cell by an antigen presenting cell (APC), condensates organized around the transmembrane adaptor protein LAT (Linker for Activation of T cells) play important roles in downstream signaling and resultant T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balagopalan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Houtman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kumari et al., 2015</xref>). These condensates are located at the interface between the T cell and APC, known as the immunological synapse (IS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bunnell et al., 2002</xref>). We recently provided evidence that these structures form through multivalency-driven phase separation of LAT and its intracellular binding partners Grb2, Sos1, SLP-76, Nck, and WASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Su et al., 2016</xref>). In this system LAT, Grb2, and Sos1 appear to act as the key scaffolds, which recruit SLP-76, Nck, and WASP as clients. During T cell activation, LAT condensates that initially appear in the periphery of the IS are moved radially to the IS center by two different actin cytoskeletal networks, a peripheral dendritic meshwork and more central circular arcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeMond et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kaizuka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mossman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murugesan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). This translocation is essential for proper T cell responses to antigen presenting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ilani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It has remained unknown how LAT condensates engage actin to move across the IS and whether their composition plays a role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hammer et al., 2019</xref>). To address these questions, we analyzed interactions between LAT condensates and actin in reconstituted biochemical systems and in cells using quantitative fluorescence microscopy and statistical analysis. Our in vitro studies revealed that LAT condensates bind actin filaments in a composition-dependent fashion, primarily through interactions of basic regions in Nck and N-WASP/WASP. In cells, we observed that Nck dissipates from LAT condensates as they traverse the IS. This loss spatially parallels the change in actin architecture from dendritic network to circular arcs. LAT condensates containing a mutant Grb2, which caused them to constitutively bind actin filaments independently of Nck, exhibited aberrant movement across the IS. These data show that Nck and N-WASP/WASP can form a molecular clutch between LAT condensates and actin in vitro. The combined cellular and biochemical data suggest a model in which LAT condensates engage actin differently depending on the density of Nck and WASP proteins in them, such that switching between compositions and actin-binding modes enables them to move radially via the two actin networks at the IS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LAT condensates reconstituted in vitro within actin networks move in a composition-dependent manner</title><p>We previously reconstituted LAT condensates on supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) through addition of various T cell signaling proteins to membrane-attached phospho-LAT (pLAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Su et al., 2016</xref>). In separate work, we also reconstituted membrane-associated contractile actomyosin networks by attaching actin to SLBs via the membrane-anchored actin binding domain of ezrin (eABD) in the presence of myosin II and capping protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Köster et al., 2016</xref>). To examine interactions of LAT condensates with actin networks, here we combined these two systems into a single assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We attached polyhistidine-tagged phospho-LAT (pLAT) and polyhistidine-tagged eABD to Ni-NTA functionalized lipids within the SLB. We induced LAT phase separation into condensates by adding an increasing subset of binding partners, in the order Grb2, Sos1, phospho-SLP-76 (pSLP-76), Nck, and, finally, WASP or N-WASP, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Su et al., 2016</xref>). Hereafter we use the nomenclature pLAT → X to indicate condensates containing pLAT and all binding partners up to X (e.g. if X is Nck, then the condensates would contain pLAT, Grb2, Sos1, pSLP-76, and Nck). In T cells, the main WASP family protein at the IS is WASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kumari et al., 2014</xref>), which acts as a constitutive complex with WASP Interacting Protein (WIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antón et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ramesh et al., 1997</xref>). We performed experiments here with either WASP or N-WASP to examine how differences between the proteins, which are 48% identical in amino acid sequence, affect interactions of LAT condensates with dynamic actin networks. We fused the N-WASP/WASP binding fragment of WIP to the N-terminus of each protein in order to stabilize its EVH1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peterson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Volkman et al., 2002</xref>), and improve bacterial expression.

This analysis revealed that in the absence of actin, condensates exhibited a distribution of diffusion coefficients with medians in the range of 3 × 10<sup>−5</sup> to 8 × 10<sup>−5</sup> µm<sup>2</sup> / s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In the presence of actin alone (i.e. no myosin), condensate movement varied with composition. pLAT → Sos1 and pLAT → pSLP76 showed an increase in mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>), while pLAT → Nck, pLAT → WASP, and pLAT → N-WASP had a tendency to align with actin filaments and showed either a decrease or no change in mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Lastly, in the presence of active actomyosin networks, condensates of all compositions exhibited an overall increase in mobility (median effective diffusion coefficient range of 1 × 10<sup>−4</sup> to 3 × 10<sup>−4</sup> µm<sup>2</sup> / s). The increase for pLAT → Sos1 and pLAT → pSLP76 was subtle, larger for pLAT → Nck, and largest for pLAT → WASP and pLAT → N-WASP. These data suggest that condensates containing Nck or, Nck and WASP, or Nck and N-WASP, which wet filaments and show a large differential in behavior between actin alone and actomyosin conditions, can be viewed distinctly from condensates containing components only up to Sos1 or Sos1 and pSLP76, which do not wet filaments and show smaller differences between the two types of actin networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>LAT condensates in vitro containing Nck and WASP or N-WASP move with contracting actomyosin networks with high fidelity</title><p>To delineate the effect of composition on the ability of LAT condensates to move with actin filaments, we devised an in vitro system where the actin filaments moved in a directional manner. This system enabled us to clearly distinguish between condensates that move with the actin filaments (because they would also exhibit directional movement) and those that do not. For this, we performed experiments where an SLB-associated actin network was induced to contract into asters by addition of myosin II filaments in the presence of low concentrations of salt and ATP (see Supplemental Methods). These experiments were especially susceptible to photo-damage caused by light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, imaging conditions were set to minimize light exposure and the actomyosin/condensate configuration at the end point of all time-lapses was compared to adjacent, non-imaged regions of the SLB. These actomyosin contraction experiments were performed with pLAT → Sos1, pLAT → WASP, and pLAT → N-WASP condensates. In the beginning of such experiments, pLAT → Sos1 condensates were randomly distributed on the membrane while pLAT → WASP or pLAT → N-WASP condensates were aligned along the actin filaments as observed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In all cases the filament network started to contract immediately upon myosin II addition and formed stable asters within 2 min (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, at the end of the contraction, most of the pLAT → Sos1 condensates remained scattered across the SLB, while virtually all of the pLAT → N-WASP condensates had moved with the actin into asters. pLAT → WASP condensates showed behavior intermediate between these extremes. To quantify these behaviors, we examined the speed and direction of both condensate movement and actin movement during actomyosin network contraction using Spatio-Temporal Image Correlation Spectroscopy (STICS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashdown et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We found that the speed of pLAT → N-WASP condensates correlated well with the speed of actin, while the speed of pLAT → Sos1 condensates did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). pLAT → WASP condensates showed an intermediate degree of correlation. Additionally, the distribution of angles between the vectors of pLAT → N-WASP condensate movement and proximal actin movement showed clear preference for smaller angles, indicating a high degree of co-movement. In contrast, the angle distribution for pLAT → Sos1 showed only a slight preference for smaller angles, which was marginally significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Again pLAT → WASP condensates displayed an intermediate behavior. Together, the steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) analyses show that LAT condensates are influenced by actin network dynamics in a composition-dependent fashion. Condensates containing Nck or Nck and WASP/N WASP bind to and move with actomyosin filaments. In contrast, condensates lacking these proteins do not bind filaments appreciably, and move through a different mechanism, likely due to non-specific steric contacts. Thus, Nck and WASP/N WASP function as a molecular clutch between LAT condensates and actin in vitro.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42695.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>pLAT → N-WASP condensates bind to and move with moving actin filaments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TIRF microscopy images of pLAT → Sos1 condensates (left two columns), and pLAT → N-WASP condensates (middle two columns), and pLAT→ WASP (right two columns), formed in an actin network before (t = 0 min) and after (t = 2 min) addition of myosin II. pLAT condensates are green and actin is magenta in merge.

We measured the fluorescence intensity of recruited actin as a function of actin filaments in solution. Fluorescence intensity showed a sigmoidal dependence on actin filament concentration, indicating cooperative recruitment to the membrane, perhaps due to avidity effects based on multi-point interactions of longer filaments with the condensates (see below). Fitting the data to a Hill equation showed that LAT → N-WASP condensates bind actin more tightly than LAT → Nck condensates (K<sub>D</sub> = 280 nM, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [250 nM, 300 nM] versus 410 nM, 95% CI [380 nM, 450 nM]) and with similar Hill coefficients (3.6, 95% CI [3.0, 4.4] vs 3.2, 95% CI [2.4, 5.6]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). LAT → N-WASP condensates also have a higher capacity for actin filaments than LAT → Nck condensates, based on a higher maximal recruited actin fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). Thus, the condensates can recruit actin filaments to membranes with high effective affinity.</p><p>We next performed co-sedimentation assays to determine whether Nck or N-WASP could bind actin filaments in solution or whether efficient binding required the proteins to be arrayed on a two-dimensional surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). At 2 µM concentration, Nck did not appreciably co-sediment with actin filaments up to 7.9 µM actin filament concentration. While these data could not yield a K<sub>D</sub> value for the interaction of Nck and actin in solution, they clearly show that binding affinity is much lower than when Nck is organized into LAT → Nck condensates on membranes. Consistent with previous reports, 2 µM N-WASP did bind filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Co et al., 2007</xref>), although only 24% of the protein co-sedimented with 7.9 µM F-actin. This contrasts with α-actinin, which has a reported K<sub>D</sub> for actin filaments of 4.7 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wachsstock et al., 1993</xref>) and shows an approximately equal distribution between supernatant and pellet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Estimating K<sub>D</sub> of N-WASP:F-actin binding in solution from the 7.9 µM F-actin data point yields an approximate value of 25 µM. Thus, as for Nck, N-WASP has appreciably lower affinity for actin filaments in solution than when organized into LAT → N-WASP condensates on membranes.</p><p>This difference in N-WASP-actin affinity between the different formats could be due to A) effects of the other proteins in LAT → N-WASP condensates (e.g. inducing conformational changes in N-WASP that increase affinity) or B) effects of concentrating N-WASP into high-density condensates on the two-dimensional membrane surface. To test whether the collection of molecules within LAT condensates alone could increase affinity of N-WASP for actin, we performed co-sedimentation assays in which the composition of the solution was increased in complexity by adding Nck, pSLP-76, Grb2, and pLAT to N-WASP and actin filaments. In solution, addition of LAT condensate components did not enhance binding of N-WASP to actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). These data suggest that it is the localization of N-WASP to LAT condensates on membranes, rather than conformation changes induced by ligands per se, that enables efficient actin filament binding. We do not know the exact source of these effects. They could arise from avidity when multiple N-WASP molecules in a high-density membrane condensate bind an actin filament. Alternatively, they could arise from actions of the membrane itself on the conformation of Nck-bound N-WASP.</p><p>Together, these data show that assembling Nck and N-WASP into phase separated condensates on membranes increases their apparent affinity for actin filaments, enabling efficient recruitment of actin filaments to membranes. This effect probably also accounts for the strong engagement of membrane-associated actin filament networks with LAT condensates containing Nck and N-WASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Basic regions of Nck and N-WASP couple LAT condensates to actin filaments</title><p>To identify the elements of Nck that mediate LAT condensate binding to actin filaments, we attached polyhistidine-tagged fragments of the proteins to SLBs and measured their ability to recruit actin filaments from solution. Nck is composed of three SH3 domains and an SH2 domain, connected by flexible linkers of 25–42 residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banjade et al., 2015</xref>). Of these seven elements, two contain dense basic patches, one contains dense acidic patches, and the remaining four are relatively free of dense charge patches. As detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>, Nck fragments containing an excess of basic elements recruited actin to the membrane, where greater excess resulted in more efficient recruitment, while neutral or acidic fragments did not. Similarly, mutating one of the basic elements (the linker between the first and second SH3 domains, L1, to neutralize it (Nck<sub>Neutral</sub>) or to make it acidic (Nck<sub>Acidic</sub>) greatly impaired actin recruitment, while making it more basic (Nck<sub>Basic</sub>) enhanced actin recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). These data indicate that basic regions of Nck likely contribute to binding of LAT condensates to actin filaments.</p><p>Like Nck, N-WASP also has a central basic region, amino acid residues 186–200. We thus asked whether this region and/or the two C-terminal WH2 motifs, which are known to bind actin monomers and filament barbed ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bieling et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Co et al., 2007</xref>), contribute to coupling of LAT condensates to actin filaments. We generated pLAT → N-WASP condensates with N-WASP fragments consisting of the basic-proline elements (BP), basic-proline +VCA (BPVCA) elements, and a BPVCA protein with mutations in the WH2 motifs in the VCA region that impair filament binding (BPVCA<sub>mut</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Co et al., 2007</xref>). All three types of condensates strongly recruited actin, indicating that WH2-actin interactions are not needed for actin filament recruitment by LAT condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>). To further examine the basic region, we generated three variants of His<sub>6</sub>-tagged full length N-WASP (fused N-terminally to the WASP-binding region of WIP, as in the earlier experiments; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>): one containing a doubled basic region (N-WASP<sub>Basic</sub>), one wild-type (N-WASP<sub>WT</sub>), and one containing a neutral linker instead of the basic region (N-WASP<sub>Neutral</sub>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</xref>, these variants recruited actin in the order N-WASP<sub>Basic</sub> &gt;&gt;N WASP<sub>WT</sub>&gt;N WASP<sub>Neutral</sub>. Thus, for both Nck and N-WASP, the degree of positive charge in basic elements correlates with the ability of the proteins and their LAT condensates to recruit actin filaments to SLBs.</p><p>To test whether these basic regions are necessary to couple LAT condensate movement to actin movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we performed actin contraction assays with condensates containing N-WASP<sub>Basic</sub> or N-WASP<sub>Neutral</sub>. Before myosin II addition, pLAT - &gt; N WASP<sub>Basic</sub> condensates aligned almost perfectly with actin filaments, while pLAT - &gt; N WASP<sub>Neutral</sub> condensates aligned only partially, consistent with the notion that the basic region mediates binding to actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). After actin network contraction, pLAT → N-WASP<sub>Basic</sub> condensates localized with actin asters to a similar degree as pLAT → N-WASP<sub>WT</sub>, while pLAT → N-WASP<sub>Neutral</sub> localized less with actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>).

We then automatically detected and tracked LAT condensates from their formation at the periphery of the IS to their coalescence with the central supramolecular activation complex (cSMAC) at the synapse center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>), monitoring the fluorescence intensity of LAT and Grb2 or Nck. We tracked condensates based on the LAT channel, and then read out the Grb2 or Nck intensities at the condensate locations (‘master/slave’ channel analysis, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Loerke et al., 2011</xref>). This scheme ensured accurate condensate detection and tracking because of the stronger signal in the LAT channel, especially when compared to the Nck channel, which tended to have high background due to soluble Nck molecules not associated with the membrane. To overcome the stochasticity and noise inherent to live-cell image data, we aligned tracks (in space or time, as described below) and averaged them to uncover underlying overall trends. For meaningful alignment and averaging, we filtered tracks by their duration, extent of directed movement, initial and final positions (to ensure that they traversed a sufficient radial distance across the IS), and initial Grb2 or Nck intensity to ensure that changes in intensity could be measured accurately (see Materials and methods for details).</p><media id="video6" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-42695-video6.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42695.032</object-id><label>Video 6.</label><caption><title>Single particle tracking of LAT condensates in activated Jurkat T cells.</title><p>TIRF microscopy of an activated Jurkat T cell expressing LAT-mCherry on a SLB coated with ICAM-1 and OKT3.

This analysis revealed that Grb2 colocalized with LAT condensates at the edge of the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>) and its fluorescence intensity in the condensates was maintained throughout the trajectory to the center of the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). In contrast, while Nck also colocalized with LAT condensates at the edge of the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>), its fluorescence diminished relative to LAT during the trajectory. The rate of change was largest in the ~0.8–0.5 interval of normalized radial positions. The decrease in the Nck:LAT ratio within condensates compared to the peak value was statistically significant starting at the 0.7–0.6 normalized radial position interval, based on a Rank-Sum test of the medians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,E</xref>). The change in composition slowed down to an almost negligible rate after the 0.6–0.5 normalized radial position interval, that is in the central half of the IS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The emergence of this pattern from averaging 125 spatially aligned tracks from 25 cells suggests that spatial position is a key determinant of Nck residence in LAT condensates. In contrast, when the condensates were aligned according to the time of their appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the composition measurements per time point were less well defined (as reflected by larger 95% confidence intervals around the median), the pattern over time was noisier, and the median Nck intensity more or less steadily decreased over the course of the trajectory. The decrease in Nck intensity is not the result of photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). This suggests that in this experimental setting, position plays a more instructive role than time in determining the residence of Nck in condensates (and presumably the residence of WASP, which is recruited to LAT condensates via Nck). However, since time and space are coupled, our data do not rule out a role for time in this process, as has previously been observed in experimental conditions where LAT condensates were immobilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barda-Saad et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42695.033</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>LAT condensates change composition as they move across the IS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TIRF microscopy image of Jurkat T cell expressing Grb2-mCherry (magenta in merge) and LAT-mCitrine (green in merge) activated on an SLB coated with OKT3 and ICAM-1.

The outer ~1/3 of the synapse is enriched in a dendritic actin meshwork generated by the Arp2/3 complex, where the filaments are on average directed radially, perpendicular to the synapse edge. Progressing toward the cSMAC this meshwork is replaced by formin-generated concentric actin arcs that are directed parallel to the synapse edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammer and Burkhardt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yi et al., 2012</xref>). The arcs dominate in the central ~1/2 of the IS. Both filament networks move through the action of myosin motors as the cell-cell conjugate matures; however, the nature of this movement is different in the two cases. The outer dendritic network moves in a direction perpendicular to the edge of the synapse in a process termed retrograde flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeMond et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kaizuka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mossman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yu et al., 2010</xref>), analogous to actin flow observed at the leading edge of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ponti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ponti et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, the inner concentric arcs sweep toward the center of the synapse in a telescoping manner and appear to have components of motion both perpendicular and parallel to the synapse edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murugesan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The spatial pattern of Nck dissipation from LAT condensates is similar to the reported actin transition from dendritic architecture to arc architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammer and Burkhardt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murugesan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yi et al., 2012</xref>). To corroborate this in our cells, we incubated Jurkat T cells with the dye SiR-Actin, which binds to actin filaments with a defined orientation (perpendicular to the filament orientation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nordenfelt et al., 2017</xref>). This dye enabled us to use instantaneous polarization TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mehta et al., 2016</xref>) to evaluate the orientation of actin filaments at the IS. We found that SiR-actin at concentrations higher than 50 nM blocked actin flow at the IS, but speckle labeling with 10 nM SiR-actin allowed for actin flow from the edge to the center (data not shown). Since the actin networks were stained as sparsely distributed speckles of SiR-actin, our analysis procedure does not involve (or require) identification of individual filaments in the images to characterize their orientations. Rather, by observing the fluorescence polarization orientation of single speckles randomly bound to actin filaments, we can build a spatial map of filament orientations across the IS. We found that actin filaments in the outer 30% of the synapse were generally oriented perpendicular to the synapse edge, while those closer to the center of the synapse were parallel to the synapse edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), in good agreement with earlier super-resolution work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murugesan et al., 2016</xref>). The rate of change of orientation was largest in the ~0.8–0.6 interval of normalized radial positions. T-test statistical analysis, in which actin filament orientation at each spatial point was compared with filament orientation at the edge of the IS, demonstrated a significant change in actin filament orientation relative to the edge starting at a normalized radial position of 0.7–0.6 and was maintained to the center of the IS. This spatial pattern of actin filament orientation correlates well with the spatial pattern of Nck dissipation from LAT condensates (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and F</xref>). The location of the changes in actin orientation is unrelated to the overall three-dimensional geometry of the cell, indicating that actin architecture at the IS, as observed via TIRF microscopy, is not determined by the position of the cell body above the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>These data show that the changes in the actin network at the IS, from a peripheral dendritic organization to a more central collection of circular arcs, are spatially correlated with the changes in composition of the LAT condensates, from high levels of Nck enrichment at the periphery to low levels nearer the center.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Constitutive engagement of LAT condensates with actin leads to their aberrant movement across the IS</title><p>Our combined biochemical and cellular data thus far indicate that Nck and WASP mediate LAT condensate engagement with actin, and that LAT condensates lose these proteins as they move from the dendritic actin meshwork in the outer part of the synapse to the contractile arcs closer to the synapse center. The biochemical data suggest that this change in composition should allow LAT condensates to interact differently with the two actin networks, with stronger adhesion to the dendritic meshwork and weaker adhesion to the contractile arcs. We hypothesized that this change in interaction might be necessary for the proper radial movement of LAT condensates at the IS, given the different orientation (perpendicular vs. parallel to the synapse edge) and movement (retrograde flow vs. telescoping motion) of filaments in the two actin networks. To test this hypothesis, we altered the adhesion of LAT condensates to the actin filament network by fusing Grb2, which remains in the condensates throughout their trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), with the doubled basic region of N-WASP (Grb2<sub>Basic</sub>).</p><p>In biochemical assays, this fusion protein generated LAT condensates that bound actin filaments in the absence of Nck or WASP.

Previous data showed that the contractile arcs are generated by the formin mDia1 and could be eliminated by the formin inhibitor, SMIFH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murugesan et al., 2016</xref>). We found that in contrast to control cells treated with DMSO, where Nck dissipated normally from LAT condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>), cells treated with SMIFH2 for five minutes prior to imaging displayed LAT condensates with virtually constant Nck intensities throughout their trajectories from the periphery to the cSMAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video12">Video 12</xref>). Thus, the activity of formin proteins, and/or perhaps the actin arcs that they generate, act to alter the composition of LAT condensates, likely altering their downstream signaling activities in the central region of the IS. We note that the SMIFH2 data further support the notion that in unperturbed cells, space, rather than time, is the key determinant of Nck residence in condensates (assuming that formins do not also create a temporal signal). Our combined data suggest that the two actin networks in activated Jurkat T cells not only spatially organize the immunological synapse by moving LAT condensates, but may also contribute to creation of specific signaling zones.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42695.047</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Formin activity is necessary for Nck dissipation from LAT condensates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescence intensity ratios of Nck/LAT in condensates in Jurkat T cells treated with DMSO (blue) or the formin inhibitor, SMIFH2, (gold) at different normalized radial positions.

However, the functional consequences of these compositional changes have generally not been elucidated. Here, we show that compositional changes alter the interactions of LAT condensates on membranes with active actomyosin networks. Our in vitro data demonstrate that Nck, WASP, and N-WASP act as a clutch that mediates strong binding of LAT condensate to actin filaments, thus coupling movement of the structures to movement of actomyosin filaments. LAT condensates lacking Nck and WASP or N-WASP can still be propelled by other, possibly steric, interactions with moving actomyosin filaments, but less efficiently than when the clutch is present. We also show that the composition of LAT condensates in activated Jurkat T cells changes as they move radially from the edge to the center of the IS. This change spatially parallels the transition from the peripheral dendritic actin network to the circular actin arcs, and inhibition of the formin mDia1 prevents loss of Nck from LAT condensates. Mutations that add a basic sequence to Grb2, thus constitutively engaging LAT condensates with actin filaments, cause aberrant movement of the condensates with a higher tendency to deviate from a straight line.</p><p>These data suggest a potential model for movement of LAT condensates across the IS by navigating the distinct cortical actin networks. Condensates form in the outer region of the IS with the full complement of signaling molecules, including Grb2, Sos1, SLP-76, Nck, and WASP. Within this collection, the basic regions on Nck and WASP could act as a molecular clutch, enabling the condensates to adhere tightly to the outer dendritic actin network, and to travel radially with the network as it moves by retrograde flow. In the transition to the formin-generated actin arcs, a formin-dependent signal causes loss of Nck, and likely WASP, which is present in condensates largely through its interactions with Nck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cannon et al., 2001</xref>) (although interactions between TCR, DOCK-8, WIP, and WASP could also contribute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Janssen et al., 2016</xref>]). We do not yet know the nature of this signal, but one possibility would be dephosphorylation of SLP-76, as Nck is known to join condensates primarily through binding SLP-76 phosphotyrosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barda-Saad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pauker et al., 2012</xref>). Other mechanisms involving weakening of different interactions, appearance of competing Nck binding partners, or mechanical disruptions are also possible. Our biochemical data suggest that loss of Nck/WASP should decrease adhesion of the LAT condensates to actin. In this state, the condensates should still be movable by actin, based on our in vitro data on LAT → Sos1 condensates, but likely through more transient, weaker contacts. This is consistent with previous observations that in the actin arcs region of the IS, LAT condensates are repeatedly hit by arcs that move them briefly but then release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murugesan et al., 2016</xref>). The circular movement of the telescoping actin arcs is randomly directed clockwise and counterclockwise, and repeated hits by arcs moving oppositely should produce no net circular motion on the condensates. But the radial component is consistently directed toward the center of the IS, and thus repeated hits could constructively produce a net movement in a radial direction. Thus, this model predicts that LAT condensates would continue to move linearly toward the center of the IS in the arc region. If the condensates were to adhere tightly to actin in the arcs region (i.e. if they contained Nck and WASP there), they would no longer undergo repeated hits by arcs moving in opposite directions, and the circumferential force would not average to zero. In the simplest case, condensates would attach to the first arc they encounter and move circumferentially with it. Such effects could account for the aberrant movement of LAT condensates containing the Grb2 mutant artificially equipped with a basic clutch, which should produce inappropriately strong adhesion to the telescoping actin arcs. Future cellular studies will directly test our proposed molecular clutch, in part by analysis of condensates lacking basic elements of Nck and WASP, and their movement in the periphery of the IS.</p><p>While we have examined Jurkat T cells here, existing data suggest that the behaviors we have described and the model we have proposed are likely relevant to primary T cells as well. The IS formed by both Jurkat T cells and primary T cells is composed of a dendritically-branched actin network at the edge of the IS, followed immediately by a concentric actomyosin cable network near the center of the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murugesan et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, condensates must be moved across two distinct actin networks in Jurkat and primary T cells. In primary T cells, condensate-associated actin polymerization localizes mostly (although not entirely) in the outer region of the IS and dissipates in the region adjacent to the branched actin network, where ICAM-1 localizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kumari et al., 2015</xref>), which would be consistent with loss of Nck and WASP toward the center of the IS. Similarly, PLC-γ1 activation by WASP-promoted actin polymerization appears to localize mostly in the dSMAC where we observe strong Nck co-localization with LAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kumari et al., 2015</xref>). One difference between the two cell types is that WASP-promoted actin polymerization is much weaker in Jurkat T cells than in primary T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kumari et al., 2015</xref>). In primary cells, this actin assembly may also play a role in the movement of condensates from the cell edge to the center, in addition to myosin-driven movement of the cortical actin. Future work addressing the modes of movement, and the precise signals that dictate compositional change, will elucidate the mechanisms by which LAT condensates move across the IS in primary T cells.</p><p>LAT condensates represent one particular type of biomolecular condensate. It is generally thought that the functions of condensates are intimately connected to their compositions, and that changes in composition could cause changes in function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banani et al., 2016</xref>). Our data here demonstrate that when Nck and N-WASP are arrayed on membranes they can bind actin filaments efficiently, even though both bind filament sides only weakly in solution. This adhesion enables condensates containing the proteins to be moved over long distances in response to actomyosin contraction. Adhesion is lost when Nck and WASP or N-WASP depart. Thus, the composition of LAT condensates plays an important role in their coupling to actin and their mode of movement at the IS. These behaviors of the LAT system are produced by generalizable features of membrane-associated condensates - their high density and composition based on regulatable interactions. Analogous behaviors are likely to be widely observed as the biochemical and cellular activities of other condensates are explored.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein reagents</title><p>Human Ezrin (aa 477–586) with an N-terminal His<sub>10</sub>-KCK tag, human Grb2 (aa 1–217), human Grb2-Double Basic (aa 1–217 of Grb2 fused with the human N-WASP basic region (x2) KEKKKGKAKKKRLTKGKEKKKGKAKKKRITK), human LAT (aa 48–233) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub> tag, human Nck1 (aa 1–377), human Nck (FL) (aa 1–377) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub>-C(GGS)<sub>4</sub> tag, human Nck (FLΔL1) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub>-C(GGS)<sub>4</sub> tag, human Nck (L1-S2-L2-S3-L3-SH2) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub>-C(GGS)<sub>4</sub> tag, human Nck (L1(K to E)-S2-L2-S3-L3-SH2) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub>-C(GGS)<sub>4</sub> tag, human Nck (L1(HM)-S2-L2-S3-L3-SH2) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub>-C(GGS)<sub>4</sub> tag, human Nck (S1-L1-S3-L3-SH2) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub>-C(GGS)<sub>4</sub> tag, human Nck (S1-L1-S2-L2-S3) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub>-C(GGS)<sub>4</sub> tag, human Nck (S2-L2-S3-L3-SH2) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub>-C(GGS)<sub>4</sub> tag, human Nck (S3-L3-SH2) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub>-C(GGS)<sub>4</sub> tag, human Nck (L3-SH2) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub>-C(GGS)<sub>4</sub> tag, human Nck (S1) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub>-C(GGS)<sub>4</sub> tag, human Nck (S2) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub>-C(GGS)<sub>4</sub> tag, human Nck (S3) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub>-C(GGS)<sub>4</sub> tag, human Nck (FL(L1 KtoE)) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub>-C(GGS)<sub>4</sub> tag, human Nck (FL(L1 basic)) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub>-C(GGS)<sub>4</sub> tag, human Nck (FL(L1 (GGSA)<sub>10</sub>)) with an N-terminal His<sub>8</sub>-C(GGS)<sub>4</sub> tag, human SLP-76 (aa 101–420), human Sos1 (aa 1117–1319), human N-WASP (aa 451–485 of human WIP fused to aa 26–505 of human N-WASP), human N-WASP (aa 451–485 of human WIP fused to aa 26–505 of human N-WASP) with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag, human N-WASP (aa 451–485 of human WIP fused to aa 26–185 and 201–505 of human N-WASP) with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag and the basic region (KEKKKGKAKKKRLTK) doubled to (KEKKKGKAKKKRLTKGKEKKKGKAKKKRITK), human N-WASP (aa 451–485 of WIP fused to aa 26–185 and 201–505) with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag and the basic region (KEKKKGKAKKKRLTK) replaced with a (GGS)<sub>5</sub> linker, human N-WASP (aa 451–485 of human WIP fused to aa 26–185 and 201–505 of human N-WASP) with the basic region (KEKKKGKAKKKRLTK) doubled to (KEKKKGKAKKKRLTKGKEKKKGKAKKKRITK), human N-WASP (aa 451–485 of WIP fused to aa 26–185 and 201–505) with the basic region (KEKKKGKAKKKRLTK) replaced with a (GGS)<sub>5</sub> linker, and human WASP (aa 451–485 of human WIP fused to aa 39–502 of human WASP) were expressed and purified from bacteria.

Supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) containing 93% POPC, 5% PS, 2% DGS-NTA-Ni, and trace PEG5000-PE were formed in 96-well glass-bottomed plates (Matrical). Glass was washed with Hellmanex III (Hëlma Analytics) for 4 hr at 50°C, thoroughly rinsed with MilliQ H<sub>2</sub>O, washed with 6M NaOH for 30 min at 45°C two times, and thoroughly rinsed with MilliQ H<sub>2</sub>O followed by equilibration with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mM KCl, and 1 mM TCEP. SUVs were added to cleaned wells covered by 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mM KCl, and 1 mM TCEP and incubated for 1 hr at 40°C to allow SUVs to collapse on glass and fuse to form the SLB. SLBs were washed with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mM KCl, and 1 mM TCEP to remove excess SUVs. SLBs were blocked with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP, and 1 mg/mL BSA for 30 min at room temperature. 20 nM His<sub>8</sub>-pLAT-Alexa488 and 5 nM His<sub>10</sub>-Ezrin(ABD) were premixed and incubated with SLBs in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP, and 1 mg/ml BSA for 30 min. SLBs were then washed with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 75 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM TCEP, and 1 mg/ml BSA to remove unbound His-tagged proteins. Polymerized, 10% rhodamine-labeled actin was added to the SLB and allowed to bind to membrane-attached Ezrin for 15 min. 100 nM myosin II and 1 mM ATP was added to the membrane-bound actin network to induce steady-state movement of actin filaments by myosin II activity. Indicated amounts of soluble proteins were added to His-tagged protein- and actomyosin-bound SLBs and imaged using TIRF microscopy. Time-lapse images were captured every 15 s for 15 min. To obtain replicates for each time-lapse, 5 fields of view were captured by sequential, multi-point image acquisition. Microscopy experiments were performed in the presence of a glucose/glucose oxidase/catalase O<sub>2</sub>-scavenging system. Identical image acquisition settings were used for each steady-state biochemical experiment.

Supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) containing 93% POPC, 5% PS, 2% DGS-NTA-Ni, and trace PEG 5000 PE were formed in 96-well glass-bottomed plates (Matrical). Glass was washed with Hellmanex III (Hëlma Analytics) for 4 hr at 50°C, thoroughly rinsed with MilliQ H<sub>2</sub>O, washed with 6M NaOH for 30 min at 45°C two times, and thoroughly rinsed with MilliQ H<sub>2</sub>O followed by equilibration with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mM KCl, and 1 mM TCEP. SUVs were added to cleaned wells covered by 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mM KCl, and 1 mM TCEP and incubated for 1 hr at 40°C to allow SUVs to collapse on glass and fuse to form the SLB. SLBs were washed with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mM KCl, and 1 mM TCEP to remove excess SUVs. SLBs were blocked with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP, and 1 mg/mL BSA for 30 min at room temperature. 20 nM His<sub>8</sub>-pLAT-Alexa488 and 5 nM His<sub>10</sub>-Ezrin(ABD) were premixed and incubated with SLBs in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP, and 1 mg/ml BSA for 30 min. SLBs were then washed with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM TCEP, and 1 mg/ml BSA to remove unbound His-tagged proteins. Polymerized, 10% rhodamine-labeled actin was added to the SLB and allowed to bind to membrane-attached Ezrin for 15 min. Indicated amounts of soluble proteins were added to His-tagged protein- and actin-bound SLBs and incubated for 15 min to allow for the formation of phase-separated condensates. TIRF microscopy was then used to capture actin contraction and associated condensate movement when 100 nM myosin II was added to the membrane-bound actin network to induce contraction of actin filaments by myosin II activity. Time-lapse images were captured every 5 s for up to 10 min, until contraction was completed. To obtain replicates for each time-lapse, 5 fields of view were captured by sequential, multi-point image acquisition. Microscopy experiments were performed in the presence of a glucose/glucose oxidase/catalase O<sub>2</sub>-scavenging system. Identical image acquisition settings were used for each actomyosin contraction biochemical experiment. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> for more information. These experiments were especially sensitive to light-induced artifacts, so images of nearby regions were captured outside of the field of view after the completion of actin contraction to ensure that time-lapse images were representative of condensate and actin movement rather than the result of an artifact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Actin binding assays on SLBs</title><p>Supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) containing 93% POPC, 5% PS, 2% DGS-NTA-Ni, and trace PEG5000-PE were formed in 96-well glass-bottomed plates (Matrical).

The laser beam was circularly polarized using a combination of a half wave plate and quarter wave plate (Meadowlark Optics). The circularly polarized beam was rotated at 300–400 Hz in the back focal plane of the objective to achieve total internal reflection at the specimen plane to achieve isotropic excitation within the focal plane.

Images were acquired using MetaMorph.software. SLBs were prepared for cellular activation as described above. Jurkat T cells expressing LAT-mCherry, Nck-sfGFP, and LifeAct-BFP were activated on the SLB for 5 min to allow the IS to form. Confocal slices were then captured with a 0.25 μm step-size. 3-dimensional images were reconstructed using Matlab and the position of the dense actin ring (LifeAct-BFP) and membrane (as indicated by LAT-mCherry fluorescence) were measured and analyzed for spatial orientation using Matlab.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Image data analysis and display</title><sec id="s4-14-1"><title>Drift correction for In Vitro movies</title><p>Due to imaging multiple time points at multiple stage positions for all in vitro reconstitution assay imaging, movies were subject to drift artifacts. To correct for drift, we aligned the frames in the pLAT channel by the maximum pixel-level cross correlation between adjacent frames. We then applied the shift to all channels to ensure identical corrections.</p><p>There were no drift artifacts from cellular imaging data because a single stage position was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-2"><title>pLAT condensates in vitro within No actin/Actin/Actomyosin Networks at Steady State</title><sec id="s4-14-2-1"><title>Detection of pLAT condensates</title><p>To detect pLAT condensates, we first pre-processed the pLAT condensate images by (i) subtracting inhomogeneous background, where the background image was estimated by filtering the pLAT image with a large Gaussian kernel (σ = 10 pixels), and (ii) suppressing noise by filtering the background subtracted image with a small Gaussian kernel (σ = 1). Next we detected pLAT condensates using a combination of local maxima detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>) to handle diffraction-limited condensates, which tended to be dim, and intensity-based segmentation (Otsu threshold) to handle larger condensates, which tended to be brighter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vega and Jaqaman, 2019</xref>). Applying these two algorithms resulted in three detection scenarios: (1) A segmented region containing one local maximum within it, taken to represent one condensate. (2) A local maximum not enclosed within a segmented region, representing a dim, diffraction-limited condensate. In this case, a circular area approximating the two-dimensional point spread function (PSF σ = 74 nm=0.46 pixels,=&gt;circle radius=3σ = 222 nm=1.4 pixels) centered at the local maximum was taken in lieu of a segmented condensate area. (3) A segmented region containing multiple local maxima. This scenario could arise from overlapping nearby condensates or from fluctuating intensity within one large condensate (possibly due to incomplete mixing following the fusion of two or more individual condensates). To distinguish between these two cases, we compared the intensity variation along the line connecting each pair of local maxima in a segmented region to the intensity variation between the center and the edge of isolated condensates (scenario 1, that is one local maximum within one condensate). Specifically, for each pair of local maxima in a segmented region, we averaged their peak intensities and then calculated the ratio of this average to the minimum intensity along the line between them. Similarly, for isolated condensates (scenario 1), we calculated the ratio of their peak intensity to the minimum intensity at the edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This provided us with a reference distribution of peak/minimum ratios for truly separate condensates. In particular, we took the 1<sup>st</sup> percentile of this distribution as a threshold to distinguish between pairs of local maxima with a segmented region belonging to separate condensates (pair peak/minimum ratio ≥threshold) and pairs of local maxima belonging to the same condensate (pair peak/minimum ratio &lt;threshold). If a pair of local maxima was deemed to belong to the same condensate, the local maximum with lower peak intensity was discarded. After eliminating superfluous local maxima with this procedure, we finalized the condensate segmentation and center estimation by using watershed on the originally segmented region with the remaining local maxima as seeds for the watershed algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-2-2"><title>Tracking of pLAT condensates</title><p>To track the detected pLAT condensates, we employed our previously developed multiple-particle tracking software ‘u-track’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jaqaman and Danuser, 2008</xref>), using a search radius of 5 pixels, a gap closing time window of 3 frames, and with the possibility of merging and splitting (all other parameters had default values). The search radius and gap closing time window were optimized by inspecting the distributions of frame-to-frame displacements and gap durations output by the software, and by visual inspection of the tracked condensates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-2-3"><title>Motion analysis of pLAT condensates</title><p>To characterize the movement of pLAT condensates, we used previously developed moment scaling spectrum (MSS) analysis of the condensate tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ewers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ferrari et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jaqaman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vega et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-2-4"><title>Analysis of actin enrichment at pLAT condensates</title><p>To quantify the enrichment of actin at pLAT condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we employed our previously developed point-to-continuum colocalization analysis algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Githaka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jaqaman, 2016</xref>).

STICS was preferred over particle tracking to analyze the pLAT channel in this assay for two reasons: 1) Experimental conditions (described above) resulted in many pLAT → N-WASP condensates strongly wetting actin filaments (when compared with steady-state experiments), thus hindering accurate detection of individual condensates; and 2) using STICS on both channels allowed direct comparisons of speed and directionality at specific image sub-regions. To perform STICS analysis, we used the STICS Fiji plug-in provided by the Stowers Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://research.stowers.org/imagejplugins/index.html">http://research.stowers.org/imagejplugins/index.html</ext-link>), and the java package Miji (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/Miji">https://imagej.net/Miji</ext-link>) to call Fiji from MATLAB via a short script. Analysis was performed on image sub-regions of size 16 × 16 pixels (16 pixels = 2.56 μm) with a step size of 8 pixels across the image, and with a temporal correlation shift of 3 frames (i.e. 15 s). This was found to be the smallest shift possible to capture both condensate and actin movement without noise dominating the measurement. To capture movements relevant to contraction, STICS analysis was applied to movies only within the time interval of contraction, which lasted 10–15 frames (i.e. 50–75 s).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-3-2"><title>Analysis of pLAT and actomyosin c-movement</title><p>After acquiring STICS movement vector fields for the two channels (over the contraction time interval), we compared the vector magnitudes (i.e. speeds) and angles at each image sub-region between the two channels (CODE WILL BE UPLOADED TO GITHIB).

Angle distributions were compared between conditions (or between a condition and its randomized control) via a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. For this, due to the hyper-sensitivity of the KS test when the distributions comprise many data points (roughly &gt;1000 data points), we performed the KS test on pairs of subsamples from the distributions (down to 500 data points each), repeated 100 times, and the average p-value of the 100 repeats was reported as the KS test p-value (e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-14-4"><title>Live cell data</title><sec id="s4-14-4-1"><title>Synapse and cSMAC segmentation</title><p>To identify the location of LAT condensates relative to the synapse edge and cSMAC center, we first segmented the synapse and the cSMAC. Both were done in a semi-automated manner. For synapse segmentation, the actin channel (LifeAct – BFP) was used when available for a condition, as this channel provided the clearest synapse edge for segmentation. In conditions where actin was not labeled, the LAT channel was used. Images were first smoothed using a Gaussian kernel (σ = 2 pixels), and then an Otsu threshold was applied to separate the image into two levels, that is synapse and background (using the MATLAB function <italic>multithresh</italic>, which generalizes the Otsu method to determine thresholds for a multimodal distribution). We retained only the synapse at the center of the image for further analysis, identified as the largest thresholded object in the image.</p><p>For cSMAC segmentation, the LAT channel was always used. In this case, <italic>multithresh</italic> was tasked to determine two thresholds that would separate the LAT image into three levels. The cSMAC was taken as the largest segmented area at the highest intensity level within the segmented synapse. For early frames in which the cSMAC had not yet formed, instead of segmenting the cSMAC we used the point that would eventually become the cSMAC center as an alternative reference. Specifically, we applied the above process but on the average of all the time-lapse frames, and through this the center of the eventual cSMAC was determined and used in those early frames (area = 0 in this case since cSMAC had not formed yet).</p><p>We then visually inspected all segmentation results (synapse and cSMAC) and in some cases manually refined the segmentation using in-house software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vega and Jaqaman, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-4-2"><title>Detection and tracking of LAT condensates</title><p>Due to the majority of condensates being diffraction limited and a lower SNR in our cellular data, thresholding as described above in 2a for in vitro condensates was not appropriate for cellular analysis, as it lacked the sensitivity to detect individual condensates in cells.

To this end, for any point in the synapse, we drew a straight line from the cSMAC center to the synapse edge going through that point, and then defined the point’s normalized radial position as the ratio of the distance between the point and the cSMAC center to the total line length. With this, the normalized radial position ranged from zero at the cSMAC center to one at the synapse edge. All LAT condensate and actin trends were then measured vs. this normalized radial position (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-4-4"><title>LAT condensate composition analysis</title><p>To analyze the composition of LAT condensates as they moved from the synapse edge toward the cSMAC, we selected condensates based on their track duration, track geometry, track start and end position, and initial Nck/Grb2 content, as explained next in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vega and Jaqaman, 2019</xref>):</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Track duration:</p><p>Only tracks lasting a minimum of 5 frames were used for any analysis, to obtain enough information per track.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Track geometry:</p><p>We reasoned that LAT condensates moving toward the cSMAC should be overall linear (asymmetric).

To this end, we used the rise and fall of actin intensity as one traversed the synapse from the edge to the cSMAC to define a position threshold (described next), such that LAT condensate tracks used for composition analysis had to start between the synapse edge and this threshold, and had to end between this threshold and the cSMAC center.</p><p>To define this position threshold, we took for every cell at each frame eight actin intensity profiles from the synapse edge to the cSMAC center, using straight lines with a 45<sup>o</sup> angle between each line and the next (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) (using the MATLAB function <italic>improfile</italic>). Pooling the intensity profiles from all time points for all cells showed that the actin intensity peak had a median normalized radial position of ~0.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To exclude condensates that had low amounts of Nck or Grb2 to begin with, only condensates that contained an average Nck or Grb2 protein intensity (as defined next) in their first three time points greater than the average standard deviation of the background intensity in the first three time points were included in the analysis (on average 88% of the tracks surviving conditions 1–3 above).</p></list-item></list><p>To quantify protein (i.e. Nck, Grb2, or LAT) content in a condensate, we subtracted local background from the protein intensity inside the condensate and then took the average background subtracted intensity as a measure of protein content. To estimate local background, we determined which condensates were in each other’s proximity (referred to as ‘condensate aggregates’) and then calculated the average and standard deviation of intensity in a two pixel thick perimeter around each condensate aggregate (thus all condensates within one aggregate had the same local background level). For composition analysis over the lifetime of each track, the protein content at each of its time points was normalized by its average protein content at its first three time points. The normalized protein content was then pooled for all condensates based on their frame-by-frame normalized radial position, specifically 0.9–1 (closest to the synapse edge), 0.8–0.9, 0.7–0.8, etc. The ratio of pooled normalized protein content (either Grb2: LAT or Nck: LAT) was plotted as a minimal boxplot showing only the median and notches, indicating the 95% confidence interval of each median (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-4-5"><title>Measuring deviation from straight path for condensate tracks</title><p>In order to measure whether condensates retaining a molecular clutch via Grb2<sub>Basic</sub> displayed aberrant movement as they traversed the two actin networks, we measured the deviation of each condensate track from a straight path towards the cSMAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vega and Jaqaman, 2019</xref>). Before measuring track deviation from a straight path, it was necessary to remove the following two parts of each condensate track, as these parts were irrelevant to the question of interest: (1) the initial time points of a track where the condensate was moving along the synapse edge instead of toward the cSMAC; and (2) the late time points of a track where the condensate had entered the cSMAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To identify the initial part of a track, that is condensate movement along the synapse edge rather than toward the cSMAC, we measured both the frame-to-frame change in distance between the condensate and the cSMAC center and the frame-to-frame change in angle between consecutive displacements taken by the condensate. The rationale was that before a condensate began to move towards the cSMAC, the change in distance should be low, while the change in angle should be high. On the other hand, once a condensate began to move towards the center, the change in distance should be high, while the change in angle should be low. Therefore, to detect the transition between moving along the synapse edge and moving toward the cSMAC, we took the ratio of the change in distance to change in angle at every track time point and chose the first time point with a value in the top 10% of all ratios within the track as the transition point. In the majority of cases (&gt;90% of tracks), the condensate position at this time point was before the actin position threshold previously discussed. However, in some cases, primarily in the case of shorter tracks, the condensate position at the transition time point chosen in this manner was after the actin position threshold. In this case, the transition time point was taken as the first time point with a change in distance-to-change in angle ratio in the top 25%. Manual inspection verified that with this strategy all transition time points were indeed before the actin position threshold.</p><p>After the initial and final track parts were removed, the remaining track segment was transformed such that the beginning and end were set to zero on the y-axis. Thus any non-zero y-position along the track could be directly measured as a deviation from a straight path. Additionally, tracks were flipped if necessary so that the majority of their deviations were in the positive direction. The entire deviation distribution from all time points of all tracks was then taken from the <italic>histogram</italic> function and plotted using the <italic>stairs</italic> function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Michael L Dustin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>As you can see, the reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. They like the paper, but request some further clarification.</p><p>This manuscript aims to define the mechanism by which T cell receptor (TCR) phase-separated microclusters are coupled to actin retrograde flow to establish spatial signaling domains in the immune synapse between a T cell and antigen presenting cell. The authors use in vitro reconstitutions with purified components of the clusters including phospho-LAT, Grb2, Sos1, phospho-Slp-76, and an N-WASP/Wip chimera, together with actomyosin networks coupled to supported lipid bilayers to mimic the T-cell cortex and plasma membrane, and compare this to the dynamics of TCR microclusters in Jurkat T-cells spreading on ligand-coated supported lipid bilayers.</p><p>Using the in vitro reconstitution system, the authors discovered a new mechanism that mediates TCR microcluster interactions with either stationary or myosin-driven actin filaments through Nck and N-WASP/Wip. Association of in vitro assembled clusters with actin filaments coupled to supported lipid bilayers involved basic regions of Nck and N-WASP/Wip, and was independent of the WH2 motifs which mediate Arp2/3 activation. Co-sedimentation assays suggested that binding through this motif was low affinity for N-WASP/Wip (although affinity was not directly determined) and absent for Nck, suggesting that the Nck-actin interaction may be dependent on association with other proteins in the clusters. Changing the net charge of the basic domains affected the association of microclusters with actin filaments, suggesting an electrostatic interaction mechanism. These experiments thus establish a novel basic actin-binding motif whose affinity for actin could possibly be regulated by association with phase-separated microclusters. The authors also performed experiments in Jurkat T cells interacting with ligand-coated supported lipid bilayers showing that the composition of TCR microclusters changed during their centripetal movement, with Nck dissociating as microclusters approached the synapse center, correlating with the location in the synapse where actin filaments switch from radially to concentrically oriented. The dynamics of WASP was not examined. They showed that addition of a basic domain to Grb2 is sufficient for mediating the recruitment of phospho-LAT clusters to actin filaments on supported lipid bilayers in vitro and caused LAT-containing microclusters to move less directionally towards the center of the synapse in cells.</p><p>Based on these results, the authors conclude that Nck and WASP act to couple ligand-engaged TCR microclusters to actin filaments undergoing retrograde flow in the immune synapse, likening them to the proteins that link ligand-engaged integrins to actin in focal adhesions in what has been termed a &quot;molecular clutch.&quot; The biochemical characterization of the molecular determinants of Nck and N-WASP association with actin filaments provides novel and valuable insight into how TCR microsclusters interact with the actin cytoskeleton at the IS.</p><p>The quality of the work is outstanding and the additional of + charge to the condensates increases interactions with F-actin in region dominated by the actinomyosin arcs. So they have generated a clear hypothesis and testing it in vitro and in vivo. The study is important in that it reveals a new way for signaling complexes to interface with F-actin cytoskeleton.</p><p>However as it stands the reviewers feel that neither the in vivo nor the in vitro work has been taken quite to the stage where it presents a comprehensive picture. We see two ways to improve this, either through the in vivo or the in vitro work.</p><p>For the in vivo work, the reviewers have the concern that the cells falls short of demonstrating that Nck and WASP constitute a molecular clutch. One idea you could consider is to knock down Slp76, the molecule that recruits Nck (and then WASP) to clusters. If this doesn't kill the cells, the clusters may move aberrantly in the periphery because they'll lack the clutch. Or perhaps you could overexpress a Slp-76 that can't be phosphorylated on the Nck binding sites, which might also make clusters that don't recruit Nck/WASP as well.</p><p>Alternatively, you could strengthen some of the biochemistry of the interactions. The actin-binding activity of Nck and N-WASP/Wip and its regulation by microcluster proteins and their phase separation behavior is not as well-characterized as it might be. The affinity of N-WASP/Wip for actin filaments should be determined in co-sedimentation assays, the effects of individual and combinations of microcluster proteins on Nck and N-WASP/Wip binding to actin should be characterized in co-sedimentation assays, and the effects of combinations of microcluster proteins (and their ability to phase separate) on cluster binding to actin should be characterized in microscopic assays.</p><p>We think that overall, if you were to tone down your conclusions, this would be very helpful. It is clear that you have shown that there is a clutch in vitro. The in vivo experiments could be better cast to show that they are supporting, but that future work on more precise perturbations will be necessary.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42695.061</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] However as it stands the reviewers feel that neither the in vivo nor the in vitro work has been taken quite to the stage where it presents a comprehensive picture.

In the end, however, we were unsuccessful. We obtained mutagenized Jurkat T cells from Dr Art Weiss in which SLP-76 had been knocked out (Cell line J14). We attempted to create four stable cell lines using lentivirus transduction: 1) LAT-BFP, SLP-76-sfGFP, mCherry-Actin; 2) LAT-BFP, SLP-76-YtoF mutation-sf-GFP (this mutant should not recruit Nck), mCherry-Actin; 3) Nck-mCherry, SLP-76-sfGFP; 4) Nck-mCherry, SLP-76-YtoF mutation-sf-GFP (this mutant should not recruit Nck). Cell lines 1 and 2 were to be used to track LAT condensates with the ability to recruit Nck via phospho-SLP-76 (Cell line 1) and compare movement with condensates that would be unable to recruit Nck because of mutations to the SLP-76-sfGFP transgene (Cell line 2). Cell lines 3 and 4 were intended to be controls so that we could determine whether Nck was recruited to SLP-76 knockout cells re-expressing either wild-type SLP-76 (Cell line 3) or mutant SLP-76 (Cell line 4). Unfortunately, expressing these combinations of transgenes either killed the J14 cells, or impaired the cells so badly that they were unable to form immune synapses with supported lipid bilayers.</p><p>Because of the failure of these experiments, we have toned down our conclusions in the manuscript. At various places in the text, beginning with the Abstract, we now say that we have shown that Nck and WASP form a clutch between LAT condensates and actin filaments in vitro, and that these data plus our cellular data suggest a model for condensate movement across the immunological synapse.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, you could strengthen some of the biochemistry of the interactions. The actin-binding activity of Nck and N-WASP/Wip and its regulation by microcluster proteins and their phase separation behavior is not as well-characterized as it might be. The affinity of N-WASP/Wip for actin filaments should be determined in co-sedimentation assays, the effects of individual and combinations of microcluster proteins on Nck and N-WASP/Wip binding to actin should be characterized in co-sedimentation assays, and the effects of combinations of microcluster proteins (and their ability to phase separate) on cluster binding to actin should be characterized in microscopic assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a series of new experiments to address these comments, and they have significantly improved the paper. First, we performed co-sedimentation assays with increasing concentrations of actin to quantify the affinity of Nck and N-WASP for the filaments. These data are shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and have been described in the third paragraph of the subsection “Phase separation on membranes enhances interactions between Nck/N-WASP and actin filaments”. Nck alone (2 µM) did not bind sufficiently tightly to actin filaments (between 2 and 8 µM) to measure the affinity of the interaction. N-WASP also did not bind well enough to afford a multi-point fit of the data for different actin filament concentrations. But based on the ratio of N-WASP in the supernatant and pelleted with actin filaments for 7.9 µM filaments, we could estimate a K<sub>D</sub> of 25 µM. We also performed analogous experiments with a fixed concentration of actin filaments (2 µM) and increasing numbers of condensate components (all at 1 µM, to avoid phase separation in solution), to determine whether these ligands might increase the affinity of N-WASP for actin filaments. As shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 4, identical amounts of N-WASP co-sedimented with actin filaments in all combinations, including pLAT/Grb2/pSLP-76/Nck/N-WASP, which represents the full set of proteins in membrane clusters. Thus, increasing the number of N-WASP binding partners did not increase the affinity of N-WASP for actin filaments. We note that the N-WASP ligands do co-sediment together in small amounts, indicating that they are binding N-WASP in solution (and associating with actin filaments through N-WASP). But these interactions do not have a measurable effect on the affinity of N-WASP for actin filaments. Thus, in solution, N-WASP, either alone or with its collection of direct and indirect ligands, binds actin filaments only weakly.</p><p>In contrast, quantitative experiments on membrane associated N-WASP clusters showed a much higher affinity for actin filaments. We performed microscopic binding assays using our supported lipid bilayer experimental system to determine the affinity of actin filaments for LAT condensates with compositions of pLAT → Nck and pLAT → NWASP. The results from these experiments are in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and are described in the second paragraph of the subsection “Phase separation on membranes enhances interactions between Nck/N-WASP and actin filaments”. Briefly, affinities were calculated from assays in which condensates were formed on supported lipid bilayers in the presence of increasing concentrations of rhodamine-labeled actin filaments in the solution, and the fluorescence of actin recruited to the bilayer was measured by TIRF microscopy. Fitting the data to a Hill equation yielded effective K<sub>D</sub> values for pLAT → Nck and pLAT → NWASP condensates binding to actin of 410 and 280 nM, respectively, with similar Hill coefficients of 3.2 and 3.6, respectively. These data and the solution binding data above yield the interesting conclusion that Nck and N-WASP bind actin filaments with appreciably higher affinity when arrayed on membranes than when dispersed in solution.</p><p>In a final set of biochemical experiments, we also purified full-length human WASP, which is the major WASP family member in T cells, and performed both “Steady-State” and “Contraction” assays with pLAT → WASP condensates. We added the relevant TIRF microscopy images and analysis to Figures 1 and 2, and included a new Figure 3—figure supplement 1 in which we compared actin binding to pLAT → Nck, pLAT → NWASP, or pLAT → WASP condensates. In all of these assays, WASP behaves intermediate between Nck and N-WASP in terms of interactions with actin, consistent with the fact that the basic region of WASP has fewer positively charged residues than that of N-WASP. The text describing both “Steady-State” and “Contraction” assays has been adjusted to include our new WASP data. The method for purification of full-length human WASP, information regarding the protein, and relevant experimental details have also been added to the Materials and methods, Table 1, and Table 2, respectively, of the manuscript.</p><p>Thus, individually weak interactions can be converted into high affinity collective interactions when signaling molecules are clustered on membranes. We believe that this is a very important emergent property of the generation of the condensate with the generation of a relevant composition (of Nck and N-WASP or WASP).</p></body></sub-article></article>
