independent of Nf1’s role in down-modulating RAS-MAPK signaling. We demonstrate in zebrafish that <italic>nf1</italic> loss leads to aberrant activation of RAS signaling in <italic>MYCN</italic>-induced neuroblastomas that arise in these precursors, and that the GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain (GRD) is sufficient to suppress the acceleration of neuroblastoma in <italic>nf1</italic>-deficient fish, but not the hypertrophy of sympathoadrenal cells in <italic>nf1</italic> mutant embryos. Thus, even though neuroblastoma is a classical “developmental tumor”, NF1 relies on a very different mechanism to suppress malignant transformation than it does to modulate normal neural crest cell growth. We also show marked synergy in tumor cell killing between MEK inhibitors (trametinib) and retinoids (isotretinoin) in primary <italic>nf1a-/-</italic> zebrafish neuroblastomas. Thus, our model system has considerable translational potential for investigating new strategies to improve the treatment of very high-risk neuroblastomas with aberrant RAS-MAPK activation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14713.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14713.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14713.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neuroblastoma is one of the most common childhood cancers and is responsible for about 15% of childhood deaths due to cancer. The neuroblastoma tumors arise in cells that develop into and form part of the body’s nervous system. Many researchers have studied the genetics of this disease and have recognised common patterns. In particular, neuroblastomas can occur when a protein called MYCN is over-produced and a tumor suppressor protein called NF1 is lost.</p><p>NF1 is a large protein with several distinct parts or domains. The most studied domain of NF1 is called the GRD, and it is mainly responsible for dampening down signals that cause cells to grow, specialize and survive. However, experiments in mice have revealed that this protein uses its other domains to control the normal development of part of the nervous system.</p><p>He et al. wanted to know which domains of NF1 are important for suppressing the growth of neuroblastomas. The experiments were conducted in zebrafish that had been engineered to produce an excess of the human version of MYCN. When He et al. also deleted the gene for the zebrafish’s version of NF1, the fish quickly developed neuroblastomas. Supplying the zebrafish with just the GRD of NF1 was enough to supress the growth of the tumors. These experiments show that NF1 uses different domains and signalling pathways to regulate the normal development of part of the nervous system and to prevent formation of neuroblastoma.</p><p>These engineered zebrafish represent an animal model of neuroblastoma that mimics the human disease in many ways. This model will make it possible to test new drug combinations and to find more effective treatments for neuroblastoma patients.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14713.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14713.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>nf1</kwd><kwd>neuroblastoma</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>peripheral sympathetic nervous system</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-12-1-0125</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Epstein</surname><given-names>Jonathan A</given-names></name><name><surname>Look</surname><given-names>A Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation for Childhood Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Shuning</given-names></name><name><surname>Look</surname><given-names>A Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001545</institution-id><institution>Children's Tumor Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>YIA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Shuning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003287</institution-id><institution>Rally Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Shuning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000402</institution-id><institution>Kay Kendall Leukaemia Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mansour</surname><given-names>Marc R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000651</institution-id><institution>Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mansour</surname><given-names>Marc R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRSG-9-14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zimmerman</surname><given-names>Mark W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA180692</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Look</surname><given-names>A Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A zebrafish model of neuroblastoma reveals that the tumor suppressor NF1 uses different mechanisms to suppress malignant transformation and to down-modulate normal neural crest cell growth during embryogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuroblastoma, a malignant embryonic tumor of childhood, arises in neural crest-derived dopaminergic neuroblasts that generate the peripheral sympathetic nervous system (PSNS). This cancer is the most common noncranial solid tumor in childhood, accounting for 8–10% of all childhood malignancies and 15% of all cancer deaths in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Maris and Matthay, 1999</xref>). Neuroblastoma is genetically heterogeneous, with multiple interacting genetic mutations required to generate fully transformed malignant tumors. As in many other pediatric cancers, resequencing studies have documented a very low frequency of somatic mutations in neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Molenaar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pugh et al., 2013</xref>), including <italic>ALK</italic> (~9.2% of cases), <italic>PTPN11</italic> (~2.9%), <italic>ATRX</italic> (~2.5%) and <italic>NF1</italic> (~1%). Amplification and overexpression of the <italic>MYCN</italic> oncogene occurs in about one-third of patients and is a principal indicator of a poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brodeur et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hansford et al., 2004</xref>). Genomic aberrations that inactivate the <italic>NF1</italic> tumor suppressor gene, including loss-of-function mutations and deletions, as well as decreased expression levels of the gene, have been identified in 6% of primary neuroblastomas and are predictive of a poor outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hölzel et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting an important role for <italic>NF1</italic> loss in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis.</p><p>The <italic>NF1</italic> gene encodes neurofibromin, a 2818 amino acid protein whose main functional domain is the ~330 amino acid GTPase-activating protein-related domain (GRD), which negatively regulates RAS signaling by catalyzing the hydrolysis of RAS-GTP into RAS-GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nur-E-Kamal et al., 1993</xref>); thus, one consequence of <italic>NF1</italic> loss is the aberrant activation of RAS signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Maertens and Cichowski, 2014</xref>). Loss of <italic>NF1</italic> in neuroblastoma cells has been shown to mediate resistance to retinoic acid via hyperactive RAS signaling, which can be abolished by enforced expression of <italic>NF1</italic>-GRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hölzel et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is known that NF1 has other functions in PSNS development besides the downmodulation of RAS signaling, because <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant mice die at birth with evidence of massive overgrowth of neural crest tissues, including the sympathetic ganglia, while overexpression of the GRD domain is unable to reverse this overgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ismat et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, studies showed identical or only modestly elevated RAS-GTP levels in <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient human neuroblastoma cells, in contrast to highly elevated RAS-GTP levels in <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient Schwannoma tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Johnson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">The et al., 1993</xref>). These results, coupled with the numerous mutations of <italic>NF1</italic> that cause the disease neurofibromatosis type 1, but do not appear to affect protein stability or GAP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abernathy et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fahsold et al., 2000</xref>), argue that functional domains outside the GRD may mediate important aspects of neurofibromin function in neuroblastoma tumor suppression.</p><p>In earlier work, we identified two separate duplicated <italic>nf1</italic> zebrafish genes, <italic>nf1a</italic> and <italic>nf1b</italic>, and generated multiple loss-of-function <italic>nf1</italic> mutant zebrafish lines affecting both of these alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Padmanabhan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shin et al., 2012</xref>). Mutant larvae carrying at least one wild-type <italic>nf1a</italic> or <italic>nf1b</italic> allele are viable, fertile, and show no obvious phenotypes during early development. To gain insight into the cellular and molecular consequences of <italic>NF1</italic> loss in neuroblastoma, we used transgenic zebrafish models of neuroblastoma that overexpresses human MYCN in the PSNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that loss of the <italic>nf1a</italic> orthologue, which is much more highly expressed than <italic>nf1b</italic> during early PSNS development, greatly accelerates the onset of neuroblastoma induced by <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression, with nearly complete penetrance by 5 weeks of age in <italic>nf1</italic>-deficient zebrafish. Loss of <italic>nf1</italic> led to the aberrant activation of RAS signaling in MYCN-induced neuroblastoma, promoting both tumor cell survival and proliferation. We also show that the very aggressive growth properties of MYCN-induced neuroblastomas with loss of <italic>nf1</italic> are due to aberrant activation of RAS signaling, because the increased penetrance and rapid growth could be suppressed by overexpressing the intact NF1 GRD domain. These findings establish <italic>nf1</italic>-deficient zebrafish that overexpress <italic>MYCN</italic> as an ideal animal model system for investigating new strategies to improve treatment of very high-risk neuroblastomas with aberrant RAS-MAPK activation.</p><p>In vivo structure-function analysis with both the wild-type and inactive GRD domain of <italic>NF1</italic> revealed that the GAP activity of the GRD domain is required for the tumor suppressor function of NF1 in neuroblastoma. By contrast, the wild-type GRD domain failed to rescue the hypertrophy of sympathoadrenal cells in <italic>nf1</italic> mutant embryos, indicating that the role of NF1 in suppressing neuroblastoma tumorigenesis differs from the mechanism that prevents PSNS hyperplasia during normal development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>nf1</italic> restricts PSNS cell growth during normal embryologic development independent of the GAP activity of GRD domain</title><p>Forced expression of the NF1 GTPase-activating protein-related domain (GRD) has been used to restore GAP activity in <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient human and mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hölzel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ismat et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Keutmann et al., 1983</xref>); however, this domain did not rescue the developmental overgrowth of neural crest-derived PSNS tissues that is observed in <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brannan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gitler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ismat et al., 2006</xref>), supporting an alternative activity of Nf1 as the mediator of growth regulation in PSNS neuronal progenitors. For our studies in the zebrafish model, we began with experiments to confirm this surprising result in zebrafish PSNS precursor cells by studying the effect of loss of <italic>nf1</italic> on growth of the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) during the normal development of early embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We bred the <italic>nf1a+/-; nf1b+/-</italic> mutant zebrafish line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shin et al., 2012</xref>) with transgenic fish overexpressing either EGFP or mCherry in the PSNS under control of the <italic>dβh</italic> promoter (<italic>dbh:EGFP</italic> or <italic>dbh:mCherry</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>).

Importantly, synergistic antitumor effects of trametinib and isotretinoin were documented in vivo at several different dosage combinations by isobologram analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), indicating that inhibition of RAS-MAPK signaling can significantly improve the treatment of this very aggressive form of neuroblastoma when it is combined with the inhibition of other key pathways. Because of the very high penetrance and rapid onset of neuroblastoma in our <italic>nf1</italic>-deficient, MYCN-transgenic zebrafish model, it becomes one of a very few systems in which extensive analysis of the synergistic activity of two or more drugs can be evaluated in primary tumors in vivo. This capability is especially valuable given the recent evidence documenting the profound impact of RAS-MAPK hyperactivation in therapy-resistant neuroblastoma of childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eleveld et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we use a zebrafish model to demonstrate that NF1 loss can potentiate the tumorigenic effects of <italic>MYCN</italic>-overexpression in high-risk neuroblastoma. We show that <italic>nf1</italic> deficiency in the fish leads to aberrant activation of RAS-MAPK signaling in MYCN-induced neuroblastoma, which promotes both tumor cell survival and proliferation, leading to marked acceleration of tumor onset and increased tumor penetrance. To establish the underlying mechanism of these observations, we performed in vivo structure-function analyses to show that the tumor suppression function of NF1 is mediated through the GAP activity of its GRD domain. The same rescue construct does not suppress the PSNS overgrowth that accompanies <italic>nf1</italic> loss during development, supporting earlier work implicating a different and still-to-be-identified activity of NF1 in the restriction of the normal growth of PSNS neuroblasts during embryogenesis.</p><p>We and others have shown that inactivation of the <italic>NF1</italic> gene in human neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines does not result in increased levels of the GTP-bound form of Ras compared to similar lines that express normal levels of the NF1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Johnson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">The et al., 1993</xref>). Ostensibly, this would seem inconsistent with our current findings in the zebrafish model implicating downregulation of the RAS pathway in NF1-mediated tumor suppression. However, a recent whole-genome sequencing study revealed that loss of <italic>NF1</italic> is one of a strikingly high frequency of diverse mutations that hyperactivate the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway in relapsed neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eleveld et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, our inability to demonstrate increased GTP on RAS in <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient neuroblastoma cell lines may reflect the strong activation of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway in essentially all high-risk neuroblastomas, if not by <italic>NF1</italic> loss then by direct mutation of <italic>RAS</italic> itself or other types of mutations. This interpretation becomes more appealing when one realizes that neuroblastomas able to grow in vitro as continuous cell lines are invariably from patients with the very highest risk of treatment failure, and often are obtained from tumor biopsies at the time of relapse. The same relationship likely applies to melanoma cell lines as well, since most of these tumors harbor activating mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway, including <italic>BRAF</italic> V600E and <italic>NRAS</italic> Q61L/R, as well as the loss of <italic>NF1</italic> in a subset of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hodis et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Studies of neural crest and PSNS development in <italic>Nf1</italic> null mice were the first to implicate a GAP-independent activity of <italic>Nf1</italic> in restricting the growth of sympathoadrenal cells, as the GRD domain was not able to rescue the overgrowth of sympathetic neuroblasts in the adrenal medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ismat et al., 2006</xref>). Our results support those studies, in that the GRD domain expressed in the same zebrafish line that suppressed neuroblastoma pathogenesis failed to suppress sympathetic neuroblast overgrowth in <italic>nf1</italic>-deficient zebrafish embryos. Thus, GAP-independent activities of <italic>NF1</italic> appear to restrict the growth of normal neural crest-derived tissues during development, as the PSNS overgrowth phenotype was not rescued by the same level of GRD restoration that suppressed the accelerated onset of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).</p><p>The recent discovery that mutations leading to activated RAS-MAPK signaling occur in nearly 80% of relapsed neuroblastomas has clear implications for the selection of targeted therapy for this tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eleveld et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, it suggests that MEK inhibitors and other agents targeting the RAS-MAPK pathway might suppress the outgrowth of resistant clones and therefore should be investigated as part of the initial combination therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma. Our zebrafish model of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma with <italic>nf1</italic> loss is ideally suited for the rapid in vivo analysis of the effects of candidate small-molecule inhibitors selected for this purpose. Neuroblastomas can be detected in most MYCN-transgenic fish with <italic>nf1a</italic> loss by 3 weeks of age, when the fish are very small, making it feasible to test the effectiveness of many drugs and drug combinations for their ability to kill primary neuroblastoma cells in vivo. This advantage of the model is readily apparent in our demonstration of marked antitumor synergy between the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the retinoid isoretinoin in <italic>MYCN-</italic>overexpressing fish with loss of nf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

Paraffin sectioning followed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining or immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Research Pathology Core. Primary antibodies included Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204, Cell Signaling #4370; 1:150), Phospho-AKT (Ser473, Cell Signaling #4060), Phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser240/244, Cell Signaling #4838), PCNA (PC10, EMD Millipore; 1:100), cleaved Caspase-3 (Cell Signaling #9664; 1:250), TH (Pel-Freez # P40101, 1:500) and HuC/D (Invitrogen #A-21271, 1:200). Antibody binding was detected with a diaminobenzidine-peroxidase (DAB) visualization system (EnVision+, Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Mayer’s hematoxylin was used for counterstaining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Imaging and quantification</title><p>For brightfield DIC images, a Zeiss Axio Imager.Z1 compound microscope equipped with an AxioCam HRc was used. For quantification of immunohistochemistry staining, brightfield images were taken with the Mantra Quantitative Pathology Workstation (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT) and analyzed with ImageJ. The color deconvolution plugin of ImageJ and the 'H DAB' vector was used to separate the hematoxylin and DAB stains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ruifrok and Johnston, 2001</xref>), and the kidney tubules adjacent to the IRG or tumor region were applied as internal references to define threshold of DAB staining for each IRG or tumor region. For live imaging, zebrafish and embryos were anaesthetized using 0.016% tricaine () and mounted in 4% methycellulose (). A Nikon SMZ1500 microscope equipped with a Nikon digital sight DS-U1 camera was used for capturing both the bright field and fluorescent images from live zebrafish and embryos. For PSNS and neuroblastoma quantification, all animals in the same experiments were imaged under the same conditions and the acquired fluorescent images were quantified using the ImageJ software by measuring the EGFP covered area. For neuroblastoma quantification, the fluorescent area was normalized against the surface area of the fish head as fish size was variable. Overlays were created using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop 7.0.1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Drug treatment</title><p><italic>nf1a-/-; nf1b+/+; dbh:EGFP; dbh:EGFP-MYCN</italic> zebrafish with GFP+ tumor were imaged individually at the age of 3 weeks, separated and treated with trametinib () and/or isotretinoin (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX) with refreshment every 2 days.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Richard Gilbertson, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Both reviewers stated that this is an important work that is well conducted, the conclusions of which are supported by the data presented.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #2 presents four very interesting and pertinent points that could significantly improve the quality of the manuscript. Having reviewed these carefully, we suggest that the authors respond to the first and last of these four points, specifically:</p><p>1) How do levels of <italic>nf1b</italic> compare to <italic>nf1a</italic> after the first week of zebrafish development? Do the authors have any insights into how loss of <italic>nf1a</italic> drives proliferation here?</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, can data be quantified, especially given the result that <italic>nf1a</italic> loss does not seemingly affect RAS downstream signaling in non-MYCN amplified cells = no effect on endogenous levels in normal sympathoadrenal cells which the authors speculate is because they &quot;rapidly differentiate into mature chromaffin cells.&quot; Quantitative data would enable comparison of data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in MYCN overexpressed <italic>nf1</italic> wt and mutant backgrounds to baseline levels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>However, the second and third points are arguably beyond the scope of the current paper and we would not require these to be addressed unless the authors wish to do so. These points are:</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, if they are aiming to test dose dependence in loss of NF1 alleles, why not go a step further with <italic>nf1a -/- nf1b +/-</italic>, since this would probably correlate with the data they showed in 2C?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> suggests that NF1 loss blocks apoptosis that is otherwise induced in response to MYCN.

The authors show that <italic>nf1</italic> loss potentiates transformation by MYCN-overexpression in zebrafish neuroblastoma. <italic>nf1</italic> deficiency in their model caused aberrant activation of RAS-MAPK signalling in MYCN-induced neuroblastoma, which promoted both tumour cell survival and proliferation, accelerating tumour onset and penetrance. Finally, using a series of in vivo structure-function analyses they show that the tumor suppression function of NF1 is mediated through the GAP activity of its GRD domain. Interesting differences in the capacity of this signal mechanism to suppress PSNS overgrowth in <italic>nf1</italic> deficient fish during development, further support the notion that a different and unknown activity of NF1 restricts the normal growth of PSNS neuroblasts during embryogenesis. This is a well done, interesting, important and informative study. The experiments are largely well conducted, the results clearly presented, and the data support the conclusions of the authors. While there are some minor issues with the experiments and additional work could be suggested, it is unlikely that these would alter what is an already excellent and interesting paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In a transgenic zebrafish model of neuroblastoma, He and colleagues demonstrate that loss of <italic>nf1a</italic> coupled with MYCN overexpression accelerates neuroblastoma tumorigenesis and that this is due to activation of RAS signaling as this phenotype is suppressed with expression of the NF1 GRD domain.

Having reviewed these carefully, we suggest that the authors respond to the first and last of these four points, specifically:</italic></p><p><italic>1) How do levels of nf1b compare to nf1a after the first week of zebrafish development?</italic></p><p>We have examined the expression of both <italic>nf1a</italic> and <italic>nf1b</italic> after the first week of zebrafish development (3, 4 and 6 weeks post fertilization) by qRT-PCR. We were only able to obtain qRT-PCR data for the whole animal at these time, because the Cherry labeled cells in the IRG and perpheral ganglia became a much lower percentage of the total cells and were difficult to dissociate in the juvenile fish. We attempetd to sort the &lt;.1% of cells that were Cherry-positive, but the RNA from sorted cells was degraded.</p><p>In RNA extracted from the whole juvenile fish, we found that <italic>nf1a</italic> and <italic>nf1b</italic> levels were quantitatively similar at 3 to 6 wpf, and that both were decreased in relative terms compared to whole embros at 1 wpf.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, this point is clarified in the Results section as follows:</p><p>“Homozygous loss of <italic>nf1a</italic> led to the same level of increase in SCG neuronal cell number as homozygous loss of <italic>nf1a</italic> plus <italic>nf1b</italic>, while the loss of <italic>nf1b</italic> had little effect on SCG cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and G</xref>), which is consistent with the fact that <italic>nf1a</italic> is expressed at a much higher level than <italic>nf1b</italic> in sympathetic neurons as well as the whole embryo during the first week of zebrafish embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Later in development at 3, 4 and 6 weeks of life, we observed lower relative <italic>nf1a</italic> and <italic>nf1b</italic> levels in RNA from the whole fish, and at these time points the expression levels of <italic>nf1a</italic> and <italic>nf1b</italic> were similar to each other, without evidence of the predominance of <italic>nf1a</italic> that was observed at 1 week of age.”</p><p>We also modified the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> to include these data.</p><p>We also inserted a sentence into the Materials and methods as follows: “For juvenlie zebrafish at the ages of 3, 4, and 6 weeks, 5 wild-type fish at each age were homogenized with a tissue grinder for RNA extraction.”</p><p><italic>Do the authors have any insights into how loss of nf1a drives proliferation here?</italic></p><p>In an attempt to address this point, we isolated RNAs from the tumors of <italic>nf1a+/+;nf1b+/+;MYCN</italic> and <italic>nf1a-/-;nf1b+/+;MYCN</italic> zebrafish and perormed qRT-PCR to assess expression of key genes involved in control of the cell cycle. We tested <italic>ccna1, ccna2, ccnb1, ccnd1, ccnd2, ccnd3, ccne, cdk2, cdk4, cdk6 and e2f1</italic>. However, we did not observe significant differences in RNA expression levels of these genes between the tumors with these two genotypes. Because the proteins encoded by these genes are regulated post-transcriptionally, their enzymatic activity will not be reflected in the RNA levels. Thus, the RNA levels alone are not enough to elucidate the mechanism driving increased proliferation. Unfortunately, antibodies for biochemistry are still lacking in the zebrafish, beyond the PCNA immunohistochemistry that we have done to demonstrate an increased fraction of cycling cells in the <italic>nf1a</italic> mutant tumors.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we modified the Results section and added a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) to include these data.</p><p>We modified the Results section as follows:</p><p>“We then isolated established neuroblastoma tumors of <italic>nf1a+/+;nf1b+/+;MYCN</italic> and <italic>nf1a-/-;nf1b+/+;MYCN</italic> zebrafish to examine expression of key genes involved in control of the cell cycle, including <italic>ccna1, ccna2, ccnb1, ccnd1, ccnd2, ccnd3, ccne, cdk2, cdk4, cdk6 and e2f1</italic>. We did not detect significant differences in mRNA levels of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that further experiments are required to decipher the molecular mechanism through which the loss of nf1a promotes increased proliferation of MYCN-overexpressing neuroblastoma tumor cells.”</p><p>We have added the primer sequences into the Materials and methods as follows:</p><p>“<italic>ccna1</italic> forward, 5’- TGGCTCAGGGTCATTTATGG-3’ and reverse, 5’- TAACTTCGCATTCACGCAGG-3’; <italic>ccna2</italic> forward, 5’-TCCACTGGAGGCCAGTTTTG-3’ and reverse, 5’- GACTTGACCTCCATTTCCCG-3’; <italic>ccnb1</italic> forward, 5’-ATTCTCCTCAGTGTTTCTCCAGTC-3’ and reverse, 5’-AAGTGTAGATGTCTCGCTCATATTC-3’; <italic>ccnd1</italic> forward, 5’-TTGCTGCGAAGTGGATACCATAAG-3’ and reverse, 5’-AGGCACAATTTCTTTCTGAACACAC-3’; <italic>ccnd2</italic> forward, 5’- CCGTCCTGATCCGAATCTTCTG-3’ and reverse, 5’-GCCACCATCCTCCGCATAAAG-3’; <italic>ccnd3</italic> forward, 5’-ACGGCTACAGAGCTGAAGTT-3’ and reverse, 5’-CATCTGCTCGGCGCTAACA-3’; <italic>ccne</italic> forward, 5’-ACAACCTGCTCGGAAAAGACAAG-3’ and reverse, 5’-CACAAACCTCCATTAGCCAGTCC-3’; <italic>cdk2</italic> forward, 5’-TCGCGCTGAAGAAAATCCGA-3’ and reverse, 5’-ACGCAACTTGACTATGTTAGGGT-3’; <italic>cdk4</italic> forward, 5’-TGAGCCAGTAGCAGAGATCG-3’ and reverse, 5’-AGTGGGAGTCCGTCCTGATT-3’; <italic>cdk6</italic> forward, 5’-TCTCACCGTGTGGTTCATCG-3’ and reverse, 5’-ATGTCACAACCACCACGGAA-3’; <italic>e2f1</italic> forward, 5’-ACAACATCCAGTGGCTAGGG-3’ and reverse, 5’-TTCGTCCAGTTTCTCCTCGG-3’.”</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, can data be quantified, especially given the result that nf1a loss does not seemingly affect RAS downstream signaling in non-MYCN amplified cells = no effect on endogenous levels in normal sympathoadrenal cells which the authors speculate is because they &quot;rapidly differentiate into mature chromaffin cells.&quot; Quantitative data would enable comparison of data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in MYCN overexpressed nf1 wt and mutant backgrounds to baseline levels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</italic></p><p>As suggested by the reviewer #2, we have quantified the immunohistochemitry staining of the tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and IRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) to enable comparison of data in MYCN-overexpressing tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and normal sympathoadrenal cells without MYCN-overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The quantified data is in agreement with our statement that elevated activation of RAS-MAPK effector pathways are only found in proliferating neuroblasts that were blocked from terminal differentiation by overexpression of MYCN.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, these data is added in the Results section as follows:</p><p>“The IRG of wild-type <italic>nf1a+/+;nf1b+/+;EGFP</italic> fish did not exhibit detectable phosphorylated ERK (pERK), phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) or phosphorylated S6 (pS6), demonstrating a very low level of basal RAS activity in the normal sympathoadrenal cells of the IRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). […] Thus, the loss of <italic>nf1</italic> did not cause a detectable increase in the basal levels of endogenous RAS signaling in normal sympathoadrenal cells of the IRG, probably because in the absence of MYCN overexpression they rapidly differentiate into mature chromaffin cells (Zhu et al. 2012).</p><p>We then assessed the role of <italic>nf1</italic> in suppressing RAS effector pathways in the neuroblastoma cells of wild-type fish overexpressing <italic>MYCN</italic>. By immunohistochemistry and measurement of the area of the diaminobenzidine-peroxidase (DAB)-stained tumor cells, we detected high levels of pERK, pAKT and pS6 in neuroblastomas from 6-week-old fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, D, G and J</xref>), indicating activation of RAS effector pathways in the proliferating neuroblasts of wild-type <italic>nf1a+/+; nf1b+/+;MYCN</italic> fishthat were blocked from terminal differentiation by overexpression of MYCN. In this context, it is not surprising that we observed much higher levels of activation of these effector pathways in neuroblastomas arising in <italic>nf1a</italic>-deficient fish, determined by significant increases of positive DAB-stained tumor areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 B, C, E, F, H, I and J</xref>). Thus, the overexpression of MYCN blocks the differentiation of sympathoadrenal precursor cells, leaving them vulnerable to the potentiating effects of <italic>nf1</italic> loss on RAS pathway activation, which in turn leads to the marked increased in neuroblastoma penetrance and growth rate.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we added two figure panels to include the quantified data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We also added the methods related to the quantification of IHC staining in the Materials and methods as follows:</p><p>“For quantification of immunohistochemistry staining, brightfield images were taken with the Mantra Quantitative Pathology Workstation (Perkin Elmer) and analyzed with ImageJ. The color deconvolution plugin of ImageJ and the “H DAB” vector was used to separate the hematoxylin and DAB stains (Ruifrok and Johnston, 2001), and the kidney tubules adjacent to the IRG or tumor region were applied as internal references to define threshold of DAB staining for each IRG or tumor region.”</p><p><italic>However, the second and third points are arguably beyond the scope of the current paper and we would not require these to be addressed unless the authors wish to do so. These points are:</italic></p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, if they are aiming to test dose dependence in loss of NF1 alleles, why not go a step further with nf1a -/- nf1b +/-, since this would probably correlate with the data they showed in 2C?</italic></p><p>We chose these representative genotypes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (<italic>nf1a+/+; nf1b+/+, nf1a+/-;nf1b+/+</italic> and <italic>nf1a-/-;nf1b+/+</italic>) for this analysis because nf1a is the dominant nf1 expressed in early development.</p><p>The <italic>nf1a-/-; nf1b+/-; MYCN</italic> fish are difficult to maintain because of the very early tumor onset and very high tumor penetrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which means they often have to be sacrificed before they reach breeding age. We can only obtain the <italic>nf1a-/-; nf1b+/-; MYCN</italic> genotype by breeding <italic>nf1a+/-; nf1b+/-; MYCN</italic> fish with <italic>nf1+/-;nf1b+/-</italic> fish lacking MYCN transgene.
