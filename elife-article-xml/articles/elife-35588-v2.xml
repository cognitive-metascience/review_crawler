other lipids via non-vesicular traffic. This novel pathway requires the SAC1 phosphatase to degrade PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> in a ‘cis’ configuration at the ER to maintain the gradient. However, SAC1 has also been proposed to act in ‘trans’ at membrane contact sites, which could oppose lipid traffic. It is therefore crucial to determine which mode SAC1 uses in living cells. We report that acute inhibition of SAC1 causes accumulation of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> in the ER, that SAC1 does not enrich at membrane contact sites, and that SAC1 has little activity in ‘trans’, unless a linker is added between its ER-anchored and catalytic domains. The data reveal an obligate ‘cis’ activity of SAC1, supporting its role in non-vesicular lipid traffic and implicating lipid traffic more broadly in inositol lipid homeostasis and function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Phosphatidylinositols</kwd><kwd>PI4P</kwd><kwd>PIP2</kwd><kwd>membrane junctions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM119412-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zewe</surname><given-names>James P</given-names></name><name><surname>Wills</surname><given-names>Rachel C</given-names></name><name><surname>Sangappa</surname><given-names>Sahana</given-names></name><name><surname>Goulden</surname><given-names>Brady D</given-names></name><name><surname>Hammond</surname><given-names>Gerald RV</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SAC1 is unable to adopt an efficient &quot;trans&quot; mode of action in living cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns4<italic>P</italic>) is arguably the most functionally diverse lipid molecule in eukaryotic cells. Firstly, PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> is a crucial metabolic intermediate in the synthesis of the plasma membrane inositol lipids PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>, PtdIns<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> and PtdIns(3,4)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brockerhoff and Ballou, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stephens et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Posor et al., 2013</xref>), each with their own array of cellular functions (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balla, 2013</xref>]). Secondly, PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> binds to and thereby recruits and/or activates many proteins involved in cellular traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). These include proteins regulating vesicular traffic at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), late endosomes/lysosomes (LEL) and Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jović et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klinkenberg et al., 2014</xref>), as well as non-vesicular lipid transport at the plasma membrane (PM), LEL and Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moser von Filseck et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhao and Ridgway, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Such a cardinal role in controlling membrane function throughout the secretory and endocytic pathways implies the existence of exquisite homeostatic mechanisms that control PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> abundance. PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> is synthesized by two families of PI 4-kinases, each with their own unique modes of regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boura and Nencka, 2015</xref>). However, much recent attention has focused on control of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> through regulation of its degradation. The primary route of the lipid’s catabolism is via removal of the 4-phosphate by SAC family lipid phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balla, 2013</xref>). The principle enzyme in budding yeast is the highly conserved SAC1 enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rivas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes et al., 2000</xref>). SAC1 is an integral membrane protein with two C-terminal transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Whitters et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Konrad et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nemoto et al., 2000</xref>), which localizes primarily to the ER but is also able to traffic to the Golgi depending on the growth status of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faulhammer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blagoveshchenskaya et al., 2008</xref>). The ER localization at first seemed counter-intuitive, given functions of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> at the Golgi, PM and endosomes; but the realization that the ER makes extensive membrane contact sites (MCS) with all of these organelles raised a tantalizing possibility as to how ER-localized SAC1 could control PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> abundance: that it could perhaps localize to these MCS and ‘reach across’ the gap to degrade PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> in a ‘trans’ configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Phillips and Voeltz, 2016</xref>). Indeed, the crystal structure of SAC1 revealed an approximately 70 amino acid region between the N-terminal catalytic domain and C-terminal transmembrane domains that was disordered in the crystal; this stretch was proposed to be able to span the 15–20 nm gap between ER and organelle at MCS and confer ‘trans’ activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manford et al., 2010</xref>). Subsequently, targeting of SAC1 to ER-PM MCS by the Osh3 protein was proposed to allow dephosphorylation of PM PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> by cortical ER-localized SAC1 in ‘trans’, hence controlling plasma membrane inositol lipid synthesis and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stefan et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, dynamic localization of SAC1 to ER-PM MCS has been proposed to regulate PM inositol lipid function in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dickson et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The picture is complicated by a recently proposed novel mode of action for PtdIns4<italic>P</italic>: that its synthesis on cellular membranes can be used to drive counter-transport of other lipids against their concentration gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Saint-Jean et al., 2011</xref>). In this model, oxysterol binding protein (OSBP)-related lipid transfer proteins operating at MCS collect their lipid cargoes from the ER (where they are synthesized) and transfer them to the destination membrane (such as the PM or Golgi). The lipid transfer domain then avoids a futile reverse transfer reaction because it preferentially collects and back-traffics a PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> molecule instead. Crucially, futile traffic of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> from the ER back to the destination membrane is prevented because the PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> is degraded by ER-localized SAC1, acting in this case in a ‘cis’ configuration. Therefore, the transporter must traffic a cargo lipid back to the destination in the next cycle, and the vectorial nature of the transfer is conserved. Ultimately, the energy of ATP hydrolysis by PI4K during PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> synthesis is harnessed to build and maintain a steep chemical gradient of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> at the destination membrane with respect to the ER. Flow of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> down this concentration gradient via OSBPs thus powers counter-transport of other lipids against their own chemical gradients. We think of this cycle as a ‘phosphoinositide-motive force’ (PPInMF), since it is conceptually related to the proton-motive force and other ionic gradients that drive counter-transport of ions and small solutes across membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>). Direct evidence for PPInMF-driven transfer reactions have now been presented at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) for sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">von Filseck et al., 2015b</xref>) and at the PM for phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moser von Filseck et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A critical requirement for the PPInMF is that SAC1 acts in a ‘cis’ configuration in the ER; ‘trans’ activity would act to dissipate the PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> gradients at MCS and make counter-transport much less efficient. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that SAC1 can indeed act in the required ‘cis’ configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">von Filseck et al., 2015b</xref>). However, an obligate ‘cis’ acting SAC1 makes it much harder to understand how PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> abundance is regulated with respect to its other metabolic and trafficking functions, especially at the PM. Therefore, a central question in understanding the regulation of protein and lipid traffic is whether SAC1 activity in cells occurs in an obligatory ‘cis’ or ‘trans’ configuration, or whether the enzyme can switch between modes. We address this crucial question here. We present evidence for ‘cis’ activity in mammalian cells, show that SAC1 fails to enrich at ER-PM MCS and, finally, we show that SAC1 does not possess a conformation that allows it to traverse ER-PM MCS and act in ‘trans’. Collectively, our results support a central role for SAC1 in driving the PPInMF, and implicate non-vesicular PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> traffic in the control of inositol lipid metabolism and function more generally.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evidence for a ‘cis’ acting SAC1</title><p>Loss of SAC1 ‘trans’ activity would cause accumulation of its PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> substrate in membranes like the PM and Golgi where the lipid is synthesized, whereas loss of ‘cis’ activity predicts accumulation of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> with deletions of their <italic>Sac1</italic> gene show 6–10 fold increases in PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rivas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 1999</xref>), with PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> reported at both the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roy and Levine, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stefan et al., 2011</xref>) and the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roy and Levine, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tahirovic et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2014</xref>), depending on the probe used.

On the other hand, acute knock-out of SAC1 in HeLa cells with CRISPR/Cas9 was reported to induce PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> accumulation on the PM and endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong et al., 2016</xref>). However, these experiments are hard to interpret, since the <italic>SACM1L</italic> gene is essential to the survival of single mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blomen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). Phenotypes in RNAi and knock-out experiments are therefore observed during the rundown of SAC1 protein levels before the cells die. The phenotype observed may thus be exquisitely sensitive to the precise amount of SAC1 protein remaining in the cell at the time of the experiment.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35588.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of SAC1 causes PtdIns4P accumulation in the ER.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A soluble fragment of SAC1 (SAC1<sup>∆TMD</sup>) is inhibited by peroxide and bpV(HOpic).

As a member of an especially redox-sensitive family of lipid phosphatases, SAC1 is inherently sensitive to inhibition by oxidizing compounds including bis-peroxovanadates (bpVs) and hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosivatz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ross et al., 2007</xref>). In fact, treatment of cells with 500 µM peroxide was shown to induce a massive 7-fold accumulation of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ross et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore sought to determine where such PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> accumulations occur, using our unbiased probe GFP-P4M that detects all cellular pools of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammond and Balla, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hammond et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Firstly, we wanted to verify that bpVs and peroxide would inhibit SAC1 in the reducing environment of a living cell’s cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To this end, we over-expressed a soluble SAC1 fragment missing the C-terminal transmembrane domain (∆TMD). SAC1<sup>∆TMD</sup> expression in COS-7 cells greatly reduced PM localization of P4M, indicating PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> was depleted, whereas a catalytically inactive C389S mutant was without effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Acute treatment of these cells with 500 µM peroxide led to a rapid (&lt;1 min) recovery of PM PtdIns4<italic>P</italic>, followed by an accumulation of P4M internally (see following paragraph for an explanation); treatment with 10 µM bpV(HOpic) caused a somewhat slower recovery of PM PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> over approximately 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Clearly, the over-expressed SAC1<sup>∆TMD</sup> could be inhibited in the context of a living cell.</p><p>Inhibition of SAC1 with these oxidative stress-inducing compounds is likely to induce an ER-stress response, which could potentially lead to disrupted ER-PM MCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van Vliet et al., 2017</xref>). However, under our experimental conditions, ER-PM MCS marked with GFP-ORP5 (that would be responsible for PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> traffic) were unaffected by peroxide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>We then sought to inhibit endogenous SAC1 with these compounds. Cells were treated with peroxide or bpV(HOpic) for one hour, which stimulated a rapid (commencing within 5 min) accumulation of ER PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> with peroxide and a slower, but robust accumulation in the ER with bpV(HOpic) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). ER localization of the accumulated PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> pool was verified by co-expression with iRFP-tagged Sec61β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We observed a similar accumulation of ER-signal with a second, high affinity PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> biosensor GFP-P4C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weber et al., 2014</xref>) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>. The rapid accumulation at the ER explains the internal accumulation seen in SAC1<sup>∆TMD</sup> over-expressing cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.

Medial confocal optical sections of GFP11-E-Syt1 and GFP-11-Sec61β also revealed exclusively ER localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saheki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leonetti et al., 2016</xref>). To look for ER-PM MCS, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Like GFP11-Sec61β, GFP11-SAC1 exhibited a reticular distribution, though unlike Sec61β, it also showed juxta-nuclear enrichment likely corresponding to the bottom of the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). GFP11-E-Syt1 also revealed a reticular distribution by TIRF, but with numerous bright puncta that are most likely ER-PM MCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Quantitative analysis of the ratio of fluorescence intensity via TIRF imaging (selective for signal within ~100 nm of the coverslip) vs conventional epi-illumination (exciting fluorescence throughout the entire volume of the cell) revealed no enrichment of GFP11-SAC1 close to the basal PM as compared to ER-localized GFP11-Sec61β, whereas GFP11-E-Syt1 showed a marked enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). So, it appeared we could not detect enrichment of SAC1 at ER-PM MCS.</p><p>To produce a more quantitative, rigorous comparison of MCS vs non-MCS localization of SAC1, we turned to expression of GFP-SAC1 in COS-7 cells, since expressed SAC1 exhibits an identical localization to the endogenous protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rohde et al., 2003</xref>). We expressed GFP-SAC1 along with GFP-ORP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2015</xref>), GFP-E-Syt2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>) and MAPPER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2013</xref>) as positive controls for proteins that localize to ER-PM MCS, along with GFP-calreticulin and GFP-Sec61β as negative controls. For each protein, we co-expressed mCherry-MAPPER as a marker for MCS and iRFP-Sec61β to label the total ER. After acquiring TIRF images of the cells, we background-subtracted the images and compared co-localization of the test protein to both Sec61β and MAPPER to give an ‘MCS index’ (see Materials and methods). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> shows results from 90 cells across three independent experiments, along with representative images (selected on the basis of values close to the median). As can be seen, GFP-SAC1 localizes to the total ER with a distribution indistinguishable from calreticulin or Sec61β, whereas the contact site proteins all exhibit punctate distributions coinciding with MAPPER, although the association between MAPPER and E-Syt2 is not as tight as it is with ORP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Collectively, these data show that, in the resting state, SAC1 does not specifically localize at ER-PM MCS.</p><p>Dynamic recruitment of SAC1 to ER-PM MCS has been proposed as a mechanism by which cells can modulate SAC1 ‘trans’ activity and thereby PM inositol lipid abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dickson et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore used time-lapse TIRF microscopy to follow the dynamic recruitment of ER-resident proteins to MCS during stimulation of cells with phospholipase C (PLC) coupled agonists. PLC induces the hydrolysis of PM PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> to produce the calcium-mobilizing messenger, Ins<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub>. The resulting calcium release from ER stores triggers transient recruitment of E-Syt1 to ER-PM MCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>), which may facilitate early re-synthesis of inositol lipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saheki et al., 2016</xref>). Subsequently, calcium release leads to depletion of ER calcium, triggering aggregation of the ER calcium sensor STIM1 and its recruitment to ER-PM MCS to activate store-operated calcium entry across the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liou et al., 2005</xref>). Finally, the continued breakdown of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> yields diacylglycerol, which is converted to phosphatidic acid and exchanged for ER-derived PtdIns by MCS-recruited Nir2, facilitating PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> replenishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2015</xref>).

GFP-Nir2 exhibited a much slower (5 min) recruitment that was sustained during the 10 min experiment.

We decided to devise experiments to deduce whether such activity is possible in living cells.</p><p>To this end, we designed a strategy utilizing chemically-induced dimerization of FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) and the FKBP and rapamycin binding (FRB) domain of mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ho et al., 1996</xref>). PM-anchored FKBP and ER-anchored FRB can be induced to form ectopic ER-PM MCS using this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Várnai et al., 2007</xref>), so we reasoned this approach could be used to target SAC1 to ER-PM MCS and assay for ‘trans’ activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Likewise, ‘cis’ activity could be tested simply by replacing the C-terminal TMDs with FKBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), similarly to how the enzyme has been introduced in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">von Filseck et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stefan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>).

Overall, there were substantial differences in PM PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> changes reported by GFP-P4M × 2 depending on the SAC1 chimera used (p&lt;10<sup>–4</sup>, repeated-measures two-way ANOVA). A fusion of FKBP to the N-terminus of SAC1 showed robust recruitment of the enzyme to ER-PM MCS within 1 min of rapamycin addition (see the inset graphs), and we detected a very subtle decline of PM PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> as compared to the catalytically inactive C389S control, though this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.15, Tukey's multiple comparison test). Fusion of FKBP to the C-terminus of the protein produced a greater depletion of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> relative to its C389S control (p=0.007), perhaps because this C-terminal fusion could pull the catalytic domain closer to the PM after complex formation. Therefore, we could induce a very limited ‘trans’ activity of over-expressed SAC1.</p><p>Replacement of the TMD with FKBP permitted SAC1 recruitment to the PM in a ‘cis’ configuration. This protein expressed poorly in cells, and recruited much less robustly than the ‘trans’ acting fusions of full-length SAC1; the insets to the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> show the change in absolute gray levels from identical exposures of the mCherry-tagged GFP-fusions acquired under the same excitation intensity, and therefore represent a relative indication of the mass of protein recruited. An order of magnitude less SAC1<sup>∆TMD</sup>-FKBP was recruited than full-length FKBP-SAC1 or SAC1-FKBP. Nevertheless, recruitment was still accomplished in &lt;1 min, and the effect on PM PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> was much more dramatic than seen with either full-length fusion or the catalytically inactive C389S mutant of this construct (p&lt;10<sup>–4</sup>). Fusion of FKBP to the N-terminus of SAC1<sup>∆TMD</sup> produced better expression and more robust recruitment than the C-terminal fusion, and also a slightly more efficient depletion of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> (p=0.0008), demonstrating that fusion of FKBP to the N- or C-termini did not disrupt SAC1 activity. Note that with both ∆TMD fusions, the extent of depletion is most likely an underestimate, since the high avidity P4M × 2 construct translocated to other PtdIns4<italic>P</italic>-replete compartments, such as the Golgi and endosomes, after release form the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levin et al., 2017</xref>). Many of these compartments are visible in the evanescent field of flat COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), causing an underestimate in the depletion of PM PtdIns4<italic>P</italic>, which is measured from total fluorescence intensity in the evanescent field.</p><p>It has previously been reported that the ~70 amino acid region between the N-terminal catalytic domain and the TMD of SAC1 are essential for substrate recognition and catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2014</xref>).

We further hypothesized that increasing the length between the TMD and the cytosolic domain could overcome this deficit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

This is likely a poor representation of the physiologic state, wherein other proteins would mediate ER-PM MCS tethering and SAC1 would not be subject to such conformational constraints. To test for the propensity of SAC1 to act in ‘trans’ at ER-PM MCS under unconstrained conditions, we capitalized on the observation that extended synaptotagmins expand MCS when over-expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández-Busnadiego et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

These induced contact sites formed in under a minute at existing ER-PM MCS marked by GFP-E-Syt2 or GFP-ORP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In fact, as soon as they formed, the induced contact sites forced E-Syt2 and ORP5 to the periphery, indicating that the newly formed contacts were too narrow to accommodate native contact site proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This ‘squeezing out’ of the contact site markers was dependent on ER-PM bridging, since GFP-Sec61β, which is not constrained to the PM-facing side of the ER, was not pushed to the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>We next tested PM PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> abundance after inducing these ER-PM MCS in cells expressing either endogenous SAC1 (and mCherry as a control), or over-expressing mCherry-tagged SAC1, SAC1-HLx8 or SAC1<sup>C389S</sup>-HLx8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

We interpret these data to mean that SAC1 has robust ‘trans’ activity only when an extended helical linker is introduced between the TMD and catalytic regions; it follows that the native enzyme is unable to produce a conformation that orients the catalytic domain for efficient ‘trans’ catalysis at ER-PM MCS in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We undertook this study to answer the simple question: does the ER-resident SAC1 lipid phosphatase act in ‘cis’ or ‘trans’ in the cellular context? This question is important, since a ‘cis’ acting SAC1 spatially segregates PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> metabolism, allowing it to drive a PPInMF, whilst a ‘trans’ acting SAC1 could explain the control of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> biosynthesis that regulates other metabolic and trafficking functions of the lipid. We demonstrated that: (i) agents that acutely inhibit SAC1 activity in cells produce the accumulation of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> substrate in the ER; (ii) under either resting or MCS forming conditions, SAC1 fails to enrich at ER-PM MCS, the would-be sites of ‘trans’ activity; (iii) SAC1 has robust ‘cis’ activity but very poor ‘trans’ activity in living cells; (iv) for appreciable ‘trans’ activity, an additional ~6 nm linker between the ER localized TMD and the catalytic domain must be introduced. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the enzyme’s mode of activity inside a living, mammalian cell is in ‘cis’.</p><p>How can these data be reconciled with previous assertions of ‘trans’ activity? In vitro reconstitution approaches have yielded convincing evidence for both ‘cis’ and ‘trans’ activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stefan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>). However, these approaches are unlikely to faithfully recapitulate the cellular environment, with all of its constraints inherent to the complex molecular milieu. Therefore, a conclusive picture will only emerge from studies of intact cellular systems. ‘Trans’ activity of SAC1 was previously reported to be supported in yeast by the protein Osh3p at ER-PM MCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stefan et al., 2011</xref>), though this protein is now believed to facilitate PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> transfer, and so these data can equally be interpreted as supporting ‘cis’ activity of SAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wong et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, dynamic recruitment of SAC1 to ER-PM MCS was recently proposed to modulate PM inositol lipid synthesis as a feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dickson et al., 2016</xref>): it was shown that dynamic relocation of SAC1 from ER-PM MCS during PLC activation functioned as a rheostat, reducing PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> catabolism and hence supporting PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> re-synthesis. Although a ‘trans’ activity of SAC1 was suggested to be at work, we suggest that a ‘cis’ acting SAC1 is equally capable of supporting such a mechanism: notably, PLC activity after activation of highly expressed muscarinic receptors reduces both PM PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> and PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horowitz et al., 2005</xref>), which will disrupt attachment of the ER-PM tethering E-Syt2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>) as well as the PtdIns4<italic>P</italic>-transporting ORP5 and ORP8 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the dynamic relocation of SAC1 from ER-PM MCS is most likely coincidental to the loss of ER-PM MCS proteins that support PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> transport to a ‘cis’ acting ER SAC1.</p><p>Over-expression of full-length SAC1 was shown to both reduce steady-state PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> levels at the PM and Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hammond et al., 2014</xref>) and accelerate its rate of degradation from the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sohn et al., 2016</xref>). These data are most easily interpreted as being due to ‘trans’ activity. However, we believe these observations can be reconciled with a ‘cis’ acting SAC1. The yeast homologues of ORP5 and ORP8 that facilitate PM PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> transport, Osh6p and Osh7p, have a higher affinity for their inositol lipid ligand than for their cargo lipid, phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moser von Filseck et al., 2015a</xref>). Given that in mammalian cells, most of this cargo lipid is present in the lumenal leaflet of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fairn et al., 2011</xref>), its abundance will be low in the cytosolic leaflet. Since we now show that SAC1 appears not to be enriched at ER-PM MCS, it therefore seems likely that ORP5 and 8 (or Osh6p and Osh7p) may be able to back-traffic PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> before it is degraded by SAC1; that is, futile cycles of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> transfer from PM to ER and back can occur. SAC1 over-expression would therefore be expected to decrease such futile reactions and thus deplete PM PtdIns4<italic>P</italic>. A similar mechanism could be at work at other PtdIns4<italic>P</italic>-replete membranes.</p><p>Our data clearly demonstrate that SAC1 has ‘cis’ activity in mammalian cells. However, we also showed that the only way to stimulate ‘trans’ activity was to either artificially tether the protein to contact sites, which resulted in poor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), or to extend the linker between TMD and catalytic domain by ~6 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), yielding more robust activity. SAC1’s ‘reach’ in its native form was recently proposed to be no more than ~7 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gatta et al., 2017</xref>), whereas the dimensions of native ER-PM MCS vary from 15 to 25 nm in COS-7, depending on the tethers involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández-Busnadiego et al., 2015</xref>). We measured SAC1 recruitment at ER-PM MCS that were artificially induced and appear to have dimensions significantly shorter than this, yet the enzyme still did not produce robust ‘trans’ activity. It therefore seems clear that SAC1 would be unable to exhibit ‘trans’ activity at native ER-PM MCS.</p><p>What are the implications for an obligatory ‘cis’ acting SAC1? First and foremost, it meets a strict requirement for the enzyme’s role in generating a PPInMF that can drive non-vesicular lipid transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>). A SAC1 unable to dephosphorylate PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> in ‘trans’ at a MCS, but able to efficiently degrade ER PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> in ‘cis’ ensures the maintenance of a steep concentration gradient of the lipid between target membrane and the ER. The potential energy of this gradient can then be efficiently harnessed to drive vectorial transfer of other lipid cargos. In short, 1 mol of ATP (per mol PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> synthesized) is expended for each mol of lipid transferred with a ‘cis’ acting SAC1, whereas unconstrained ‘trans’ SAC1 activity would force the ratio of ATP expenditure to lipid transfer to increase.</p><p>Another important implication of an obligate ‘cis’ acting SAC1 is how the enzyme can participate in PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> homeostasis and function more generally. To fully appreciate the implications, it is necessary to consider the other SAC domain containing proteins executing PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> catabolism. These included SAC2, Synaptojanin (Synj) one and Synj2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakatsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khvotchev and Südhof, 1998</xref>). SAC2 has recently been identified as operating on early and recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakatsu et al., 2015</xref>), whereas Synj isoforms appear to participate in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perera et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rusk et al., 2003</xref>). Together with a ‘cis’ acting SAC1, it thus appears that PM PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> degradation occurs only when the lipid leaves the PM via vesicular (SAC2, Synjs) or non-vesicular traffic (SAC1). In effect, traffic is a key regulator of PM PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> metabolism.</p><p>A ‘cis’ acting SAC1 is easier to reconcile with respect to Golgi PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> metabolism. A PPInMF acting at the (TGN) has been implicated in sterol traffic from the ER into the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">von Filseck et al., 2015b</xref>), necessitating a lack of SAC1 activity in the TGN. However, PtdIns4<italic>P</italic>’s selective enrichment at the TGN has been shown to be controlled by the traffic of SAC1 to cis/medial Golgi membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheong et al., 2010</xref>), where it is activated by Vps74/GOLPH3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wood et al., 2012</xref>). A lack of proliferative signals stimulates traffic of SAC1 from ER to Golgi, causing reduction of TGN PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> pools and a block of secretory vesicular traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blagoveshchenskaya et al., 2008</xref>). Under these conditions, the resulting ablation of the TGN-associated PPInMF and shut down of sterol egress would make sense.</p><p>Turnover of LEL PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> may also be dependent on PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> transfer to ER-associated SAC1, since SAC2 and the Synj isoforms are not poised to operate at this compartment. Recently, the PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> transfer activity of LEL-localized ORP1L was shown to be critical for sterol transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhao and Ridgway, 2017</xref>); however, operation of a LEL PPInMF does not make sense in this context, since the sterol concentration in lysosomal membranes is expected to be high and flux into the ER would be down a concentration gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhao and Ridgway, 2017</xref>); lysosomal PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> would actually compete with sterol efflux. Instead, a reciprocal relationship between LEL sterol content and PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> synthesis is expected, which is not consistent with the activation of LEL-associated PI4KIIα by sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waugh et al., 2006</xref>). Clearly, the relationship between LEL PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> turnover and lipid traffic is incompletely understood at present.</p><p>To conclude, we present evidence that SAC1 is an obligate ‘cis’ acting enzyme, competent to degrade its PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> substrate only in its resident ER and Golgi membranes. When considered in the context of MCS-localized OSBP-related PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> transfer proteins, this ‘cis’-acting SAC1 can account for all of the currently assigned functions for this enzyme, including driving a PPInMF between recipient organelles and the ER, as well as controlling PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> abundance in different organelles. It does, however, implicate a role for non-vesicular transport of inositol lipids in their homeostasis and regulation of their downstream functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>COS-7 African Green monkey fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC (CRL-1651; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0224">CVCL_0224</ext-link>) and 293A cells (a HEK 293 subclone with flat morphology; R70507; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_6910">CVCL_6910</ext-link>) were obtained from ThermoFisher.

Cells were seeded onto 6-well plates and plasmid containing the GFP-1–10 sequence under a CAG promoter and flanked by the proper inverted terminal repeats (APX1-GFP-1–10) was transfected along with plasmid coding the PiggyBac Transposase (CDV-hyPBase) (0.7 µg and 0.3 µg, respectively) as described above. Following overnight transfection, media was replaced with fresh growth media and cells were propagated for 1 week to allow dilution of any free plasmid. Eight independent samples were split in limiting 1:2 dilutions across 12 columns of a 96-well plate. After growth, populations were chosen from the last four columns and a sample of each was screened using an mCherry-SACM1L-GFP-11 reporter plasmid to observe GFP-complementation and assess the efficiency of GFP-1–10 insertion. The polyclonal population of a single well that showed &gt;90% GFP complementation of visibly transfected cells was chosen and propagated for use in future gene-editing experiments (named here as 293A<sup>GFP-1-10</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Generation of endogenously tagged cell lines</title><p>Single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and homologous-directed repair (HDR) template design followed the method described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leonetti et al., 2016</xref>), utilizing the published sequences available for targeting <italic>SEC61B</italic> and <italic>SACM1L. ESYT1</italic> sgRNA design was informed by the published sequence used by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saheki et al., 2016</xref>). All HDR templates included 70 bp homology-arms and the following GFP-11 and flexible linker sequence for genomic insertion (CGTGACCACATGGTCCTTCATGAGTATGTAAATGCTGCTGGGATTACAGGTGGCGGC). Single-stranded HDR templates were ordered from IDT as ultramers. ssDNA primers to serve as templates for sgRNA production were ordered from ThermoFisher. Templates were made by annealing published primers ML611, T25 and BS7 with each site-specific primer following the procedure of Leonetti et al. Annealed products were column purified using the GeneJet Gel Extraction and DNA Cleanup Micro Kit (Thermo Scientific, #K0832). The GeneArt Precision gRNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A29377) was used for in vitro transcription of DNA templates to produce column-purified sgRNAs. Purity was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cas9 Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) formation and delivery followed the procedure outlined by New England BioLabs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.neb.com/protocols/2016/07/26/electroporation-of-cas9-rnp-ribonucleoprotein-into-adherent-cells-using-the-neon-electroporation">https://www.neb.com/protocols/2016/07/26/electroporation-of-cas9-rnp-ribonucleoprotein-into-adherent-cells-using-the-neon-electroporation</ext-link>). 2.1 µL of GeneArt Platinum Cas9 Nuclease (ThermoFisher, B25640) was incubated with 0.5 µL sgRNA (~10 µM) in Buffer R of the Neon Electroporation System (ThermoFisher, MPK1025) at room temperature for 20 min to form Cas9 RNP complexes. Meanwhile 293A<sup>GFP-1-10</sup> cells were prepared from 90% confluent T75 culture flasks to obtain 1−2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells suspended in 50 µL Buffer R. 2 µL of HDR template (100 mM) was then added to the incubating RNPs. 5 µL of the prepared cells were then added to the RNP incubation tubes, and 10 µL of this mixture was aspirated with the Neon pipette and electroporated (1500 V, 20 ms, one pulse). Contents of the Neon tip were then immediately transferred to a single well of a 6-well plate containing 2 mL of pre-warmed antibiotic-free complete DMEM and allowed to recover. After recovery and growth, electroporated cells were screened with confocal microscopy. Populations containing correctly edited cells were enriched by fluorescence-activated cells sorting using a Rheum Aria sorter (University of Pittsburgh Flow Cytometry Core). After sorting, genomic DNA was isolated using the PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (ThermoFisher K1820-01). A standard GFP-11 forward primer and gene-specific reverse primers were used to compare the presence of ~200 bp amplicons from each edited cell line to the non-edited 293A<sup>GFP-1-10</sup> cells. Additionally, using gene-specific primers ~ 75 bp upstream of the GFP-11 insertions, amplicons were produced and sequenced with the GFP-11 forward primer to ensure correct in-frame addition of the cassettes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescence microscopy</title><p>For imaging, cells were placed in complete imaging medium consisting of Fluorobrite DMEM (ThermoFisher, A1896702), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.1% chemically-defined lipid supplement, 2 mM Glutamax (ThermoFisher 35050061) and 25 mM NaHEPES, pH 7.4. Where indicated, cells were stained with 1 µg/ml CellMask deep red in this medium for 3 min before exchanging for fresh media. For experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, serum was omitted from the media. Cells were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse TiE inverted microscope using a 100x, plan apochromatic, 1.45 NA oil-immersion objective lens (Nikon). Excitation in either imaging mode was achieved using a dual fiber-coupled LUN-V 4-line laser launch with 405 nm (for TagBFP2), 488 nm (GFP), 561 nm (mCherry) or 640 nm (iRFP, CellMask Deep Red) laser lines. Cells were imaged in 2 ml imaging medium, or else 1.6 ml with the addition of 0.4 ml of imaging medium containing five-fold the final concentration of agonist or inhibitor during time-lapse acquisition, as indicated. A motorized stage (Nikon) was used to move between up to 16 consecutive positions in the dish for each time point with high precision. Acquisition was controlled using ‘Elements’ software (Nikon) and raw data including metadata were saved in ‘nd2’ format.</p><p>For confocal imaging, a Nikon A1R confocal scan head was used operating in resonant mode. 8 or 16 scans were integrated to improve signal to noise. To prevent cross-talk between channels, blue (425–475 nm) and yellow/orange (570–620 nm) fluorescence was acquired on a separate excitation scan to the green (500–550 nm) and far red (663–737 nm) channels. The confocal pinhole was set to 1.2x the size of the Airy disc of far-red fluors.</p><p>For TIRF imaging, a TIRF illuminator arm (Nikon) was used to deliver wide-field illumination at an acute angle. Emission for blue and yellow/orange (420–480 nm and 570–620 nm) along with green and far red/infrared (505–550 nm and 650–850 nm) was acquired using dual-pass filters (Chroma), mounted in adjacent positions in a Lamda 10–2 filter wheel (Sutter). Images were collected with a Zyla 5.5 sCMOS camera (Andor).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Images were imported into the open-access image analysis platform Fiji (Schindelin et al. 2012) for analysis. Quantitative image analysis of multiple positions on the dish was performed in parallel by first assembling the images from each position into a single montage, and then generating regions of interest (ROI) of each cell to be analyzed.</p><p>For analysis of fluorescence intensity changes at the ER or PM from confocal data, images of the ER (using expressed iRFP-Sec61β) or the PM (using CellMask deep red) were used to generate a binary mask through à trous wavelet decomposition (Olivo-Marin 2002) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hammond et al., 2014</xref>), using an automated custom-written ImageJ macro. Firstly, each image in the montage is normalized to the mean pixel intensity of the cell ROIs, to adjust for differences in expression level. A smoothing filter with a Gaussian approximation [1/16, 1/4, 3/8, 1/4, 1/16] is applied to the images to be used as the mask over three progressively larger length scales (s) generating four images: I<sub>0</sub> - I<sub>3</sub> (the original plus the three smoothed). These images I<sub>s</sub> are used to compute the wavelets of these images W<sub>s</sub> = I<sub>s</sub> – I<sub>s–1</sub>. After eliminating negative pixel values, these wavelet images W<sub>s</sub> are then multiplied together, resulting in a filtered image. A binary mask is then computed by thresholding at 3-fold the standard deviation of the filtered image. This mask is used to measure the fluorescence intensity in the ER or PM for the P4M-labelled images, after normalizing these to the mean pixel intensity of the cell ROIs (which again adjusts for differing expression levels between cells).</p><p>For analysis of the change in fluorescence intensity from TIRF data, images were background subtracted and then the mean fluorescence intensity was measured for total cell ROI throughout the time lapse. Images at time t were normalized to the mean ROI intensity pre-stimulation, that is <italic>F</italic><sub>t</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>pre</sub>.</p><p>To calculate the ‘MCS index’, images were recorded of each cell corresponding to expression of a GFP test protein, mCherry-MAPPER (as an MCS marker) and iRFP-Sec61β (as an ER marker). For each of these channels, pixel intensity was normalized to the maximum pixel intensity in a given cell ROI, giving a range from 0 to 1. This results in normalized images I<sub>MCS</sub>, I<sub>ER</sub> and I<sub>test</sub>. The differences between test protein and the markers is then computed, that is dev<sub>MCS</sub> = |I<sub>MCS</sub> – I<sub>test</sub>| and dev<sub>ER</sub> = |I<sub>ER</sub> – I<sub>test</sub>|. Finally, MCS index was computed as the difference between ER and MCS deviations, MCS index = dev<sub>ER</sub> – dev<sub>MCS</sub>. Therefore, for MCS-localized test proteins, the deviation from ER was large and the deviation from MCS small, so MCS index is larger and positive. For ER-localized test proteins, deviation from MCS is large and from ER is small, giving smaller and more negative values.</p><p>Data were exported into Prism 7 (Graphpad) for graphing and statistical analysis. Data were subject to D’Agostino and Pearson normality tests which showed significant deviation of the data from Guassian distributions for every data set. Therefore, we used the non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis test with appropriate post-hoc tests for multiple comparisons; for two-way ANOVA, data were transformed with the natural logarithm to approximate a normal distribution.</p><p>Representative images were selected on the basis of the cells having good signal to noise and a metric (such as MCS index or change in <italic>F</italic><sub>t</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>pre</sub>) close to the median. Linear adjustments to the displayed dynamic range were performed for clarity. For images showing <italic>F</italic><sub>t</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>pre</sub>, an average intensity projection of the pre-bleach frames was used to normalize the entire time-lapse; pixels outside the ROI were set to zero (since background was divided by background and has a signal ~1). All images are thus shown at the same intensity scale of 0.3–1.1 and are directly comparable.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jen Liou (UTSW), Pietro DeCamilli (Yale School of Medicine), Tom Rapoport (Harvard Medical School), Michael Davidson (Florida State University), Timothy Sanders (University of Pittsburgh) and Tamas Balla (NIH) for generously sharing plasmids.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;SAC1 Degrades PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> in the Endoplasmic Reticulum to Maintain a Steep Chemical Gradient with Donor Membranes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers commend you for your rigorous study of Sac1 localization and activity in vivo. However, the discussion between the reviewers led to the conclusion that the study essentially affirms the prevailing view of the field that Sac1 acts on substrate that is presented on ER (in &quot;cis&quot;). In addition, the reviewers concluded that the experiments do not formally exclude a mechanism where Sac1 acts on substrate in trans, perhaps in conditions not examined in your study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript by Zewe et al. describes a study of the mode by which the Sac1 PIP phosphatase functions. In 2011 (Stefan et al.), the Emr group proposed that Sac1 dephosphorylates its substrate in 'trans' where the Sac1 catalytic domain is tethered to the ER membrane and dephosphorylates PI4P in the plasma membrane, a view also suggested by Dickson et al., 2016. Contrary to this model, Mesmin et al., (2013) and Cai et al., (2014) suggested that Sac1 dephosphorylates PI4P in the same membrane, that is, in cis. This is an important distinction for understanding the chemical forces that are harnessed for trafficking lipids at organelle membrane contact sites.</p><p>Technically, this is a superb study. The potential for it lies in the claim that it has definitively settled the cis versus trans functional mode question. I note that the Mesmin et al., (2013) and Cai et al., (2014) papers strongly implied a cis mode for Sac1 and this view, it is fair to say, is currently well accepted by most in the field. It is possible that Sac1 can function in either a cis or trans mode in vivo. Thus, the main question is, does this study definitely settle the question once and for all. On this, the study falls short.</p><p>1) The authors suggest that an enrichment of Sac1 at contact sites is requisite for trans activity. I don't follow the logic. The trans mode requires that Sac1 localize to a contact site but does not require that it be enriched at these structures. The cis model only demands that Sac1 localize to the ER, which has been firmly established previously. The analysis clearly shows that Sac1 is not enriched at contact sites. I agree with the authors (subsection “5.3. “cis” and “trans” activity of SAC1 in cells”) that this observation does not definitively rule out or support either functional mode.</p><p>2) Using the FRB-FKBP system to artificially tether various portions of Sac1 to cellular membranes via the N- or C-terminus, and to artificially tether ER and PM to each other, the authors report that trans activity is only observed when the Sac1 tether is longer than that of the native enzyme. The results are consistent with the cis interpretation, but the extent to which contact sites generated in this manner relate to the native situation in cells is not established. More importantly, the approach imposes an entirely new set of constraints on Sac1 and the degree to which the study is informative for understanding native Sac1 is not firmly established.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This study provides a definitive mechanism on how PtdIns4P-phosphatase Sac1 works in a cellular context. This paper is clear and technically impressive. The evidence in the paper is based on pharmacological and genetic approaches that are convincing and often elegant. It demonstrates that Sac1 is not capable of acting in a &quot;trans&quot; configuration in living cells. There was still uncertainty about the protein activity mode, that is, in &quot;cis&quot; or &quot;trans&quot; configuration, as the best-established models for either mode of action were based primarily on in vitro observations. Nevertheless, a body of evidence suggested that Sac1 operates in &quot;cis&quot; because it is the only way to explain how a family of lipid transfer proteins (OSBPs) uses PtdIns4P by counter-exchange and hydrolysis in &quot;cis&quot; to actively transport other cargo lipids between membranes, against their concentration gradient. In other words, a &quot;phosphoinositide-motive force&quot; is at work because the membranes that synthesize PtdIns4P are different from those that degrade it. That is why an action of Sac1 in &quot;trans&quot; seemed unlikely. Now, this paper demonstrates this formally.</p><p>I have one suggestion that could reinforce the manuscript prior to its publication. Indeed, some papers still maintain that OSBPs' activity is independent of Sac1. Is it then possible to further verify/refute that? The authors could measure plasma membrane enrichment of phosphatidylserine, by using a specific probe, such as GFP-evt2-2XPH or LactC2 (as described in Chung et al., 2015) depending on the activity of Sac1. Does a Sac1 inhibitor, or Sac1-HLx8 overexpression, alter the PS flux into the plasma membrane? This control would be valuable given the controversies in the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this study, Zewe et al. showed that SAC1 is localized in the ER but is not enriched at ER-PM MCS in both resting and receptor-stimulated cells. In addition, they found that adding a long (&gt; 6 nm) helical linker near the transmembrane region enables SAC1 to efficiently dephosphorylate PI4P at the PM when SAC1 is recruited to ER-PM MCS. Interestingly, they found that only SAC1 with a long linker, but not the wildtype SAC1, confers the trans activity at artificially induced ER-PM MCS. Overall, their results showed that a significant trans activity of SAC1 can only be observed under manipulated conditions (i.e. with an inserted long linker plus forced recruitment to ER-PM MCS or induction of artificial ER-PM MCS), supporting previous structural studies that SAC1 is unlikely to act in trans at MCS (Cai et al., 2014). This is a nice study providing evidence derived from sophisticated studies in living cells which strongly suggests SAC1 mainly acts in cis. Nevertheless, there are several weaknesses which should be addressed before the publication.</p><p>1) Throughout this study, the authors relied on a single imaging probe P4M and its derivative P4Mx2 for their relative measurements of PI4P. The authors should use other imaging probes for PI4P, such as N-PH-ORP5, N-PH-ORP8L, and P4C_sidC (Chung et al., 2015 and Dong et al., 2016) to validate their results.</p><p>2) Subsection “5.1. Evidence for a “cis” acting SAC1” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: The authors stated that mammalian cells do not survive in the absence of SAC1. They neglected to cite a recent work of the De Camilli Group (Dong et al., 2016) which reported changes in PI4P in various subcellular compartments, monitored by 3 different imaging probes, in HeLa cells knockout of SAC1 by CRISPR/Cas9. Dong et al. observed a strong increase in PI4P at the PM and endosomes in SAC1 knockout cells, whereas the authors observed an increase in PI4P in the ER following SAC1 inhibition as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The authors should address these discrepancies and examine PI4P in the ER using SAC1 knockout cells.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and the first few lines of subsection “5.1. Evidence for a “cis” acting SAC1”: With the existence of lipid transfer proteins, acute inhibition of SAC1 should lead to increase in PI4P in both donor and acceptor membranes, but the kinetics of the increase may differ depending on whether SAC1 acts in cis or in trans. The authors should monitor the kinetics of PI4P increases at both the ER and the PM following acute inhibition of SAC1.

The reason we believed it important to detect the enrichment (or lack thereof) of SAC1 at MCS was because Dickson et al., (2016) proposed that modulating SAC1 localization at contact sites is an important mechanism of modulating “trans” activity.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that this is in fact not the case; “the limited and unchanging localization of SAC1 at MCS therefore appears co-incidental with its well-known distribution throughout the ER” (added to the end of this Results section).</p><p>“We also made the need to contrast with Dickson et al., 2016 more apparent in a new, more succinct opening paragraph of this section: “Dynamic recruitment of SAC1 to ER-PM MCS was recently proposed as a mechanism to modulate “trans” activity of the enzyme (Dickson et al., 2016). Although this is not inconsistent with the firmly established localization of SAC1 throughout the ER (Rohde et al., 2003; Nemoto et al., 2000), most proteins known to function at MCS are enriched at them too (Gatta and Levine, 2017). Therefore, a clue as to SAC1’s preferred mode of activity may be gleaned from a careful analysis of its enrichment (or not) at MCS.” (Subsection “SAC1 does not enrich at ER-PM MCS”.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Using the FRB-FKBP system to artificially tether various portions of Sac1 to cellular membranes via the N- or C-terminus, and to artificially tether ER and PM to each other, the authors report that trans activity is only observed when the Sac1 tether is longer than that of the native enzyme.

Here we show that our PM and ER-targeted proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) induce contact sites that have a narrower gap than those induced by native proteins, because these native proteins are squeezed out to the periphery of the induced MCS. It follows that since we report in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> that an extended linker is still required to confer “trans” activity at these narrow MCS, SAC1 could not possibly reach across the gap at native MCS.</p><p>We describe these new results as follows: “For a more acute interrogation of “trans” activity, we next induced dimerization between PM targeted FRB and an ER-localized FKBP (fused to the membrane anchor of cytochrome B5A; Komatsu et al., 2010) to generate new ER-PM MCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These induced contact sites formed in under a minute at existing ER-PM MCS marked by GFP-E-Syt2 or GFPORP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In fact, as soon as they formed, the induced contact sites forced E-Syt2 and ORP5 to the periphery, indicating that the newly formed contacts were too narrow to accommodate native contact site proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This “squeezing out” of the contact site markers was dependent on ER-PM bridging, since GFP-Sec61β, which is not constrained to the PM-facing side of the ER, was not pushed to the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).” (Subsection ““Cis” and “trans” activity of SAC1 in cells”.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More importantly, the approach imposes an entirely new set of constraints on Sac1 and the degree to which the study is informative for understanding native Sac1 is not firmly established.</p></disp-quote><p>The data in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> was included to address this crucial point. In this figure, SAC1 is overexpressed, but not directly conjugated to the dimerization system; MCS are instead induced by separate ER and PM-targeted halves of the FRB/FKBP system (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We have now strengthened this conclusion with the new data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, where we instead induced expanded MCS by over-expressing the native MCS protein E-Syt2:</p><p>“To test for the propensity of SAC1 to act in “trans” at ER-PM MCS under unconstrained conditions, we capitalized on the observation that extended synaptotagmins expand MCS when over-expressed (Giordano et al.; Fernández-Busnadiego et al., 2015; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These expanded contact sites would be expected to present more endogenous “trans” acting SAC1 to the plasma membrane, thus depleting PM PtdIns4P (Dickson et al., 2016). However, we found that expanded ER-PM MCS induced by E-Syt2 overexpression had no effect on PtdIns4P biosensor localization at the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, extensive depletion was observed after over-expression of ORP5, which is known to deplete PtdIns4P by transferring it back to the ER (Chung et al., 2015; Sohn et al., 2016).” (Subsection ““Cis” and “trans” activity of SAC1 in cells”.)</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] I have one suggestion that could reinforce the manuscript prior to its publication.

We attempted two experiments as suggested by the reviewer. Firstly, we followed the PM enrichment of the Lact-C2 PtdSer probe during peroxide treatment. This indeed led to a small but significant decrease in PM signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). We also attempted to observe increases in ER-localized Lact-C2 as evidence of “back-traffic” of PtdSer due to the now collapsed PtdIns4P gradient. This led to a significant accumulation of ER-signal, but only if we over-expressed ORP5 to accelerate PtdSer traffic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). In contrast, accumulation of P4M in these cells was unaffected by ORP5 over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). Collectively, the impact on the PtdSer biosensor was less dramatic than with the PtdIns4P biosensors. We believe the explanation likely stems from the fact that multiple OSBP-related proteins participate in the ER accumulation of PtdIns4P, but only ORP5 and ORP8 will contribute to PtdSer traffic from the PM. Hence the dramatic effects on PM PtdSer reported by Sohn et al. likely take much longer to develop.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35588.029</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of SAC1 inhibition (with 500 µM peroxide) on PtdSer probe Lact-C2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) COS-7 transfected with mCherry-Lact-C2 were treated with vehicle or 500 µM DMSO during imaging by TIRF microscopy.

We now cite this study in the opening paragraph of the Introduction, along with what we believe to be caveats to the interpretation of these data:</p><p>“Loss of SAC1 “trans” activity would cause accumulation of its substrate, PtdIns4P in membranes like the PM and Golgi where the lipid is synthesized, whereas loss of “cis” activity predicts accumulation of PtdIns4P in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> with deletions of their Sac1 gene show 6-10 fold increases in PtdIns4P mass (Rivas et al.; Hughes et al., 2000; Guo et al., 1999), with PtdIns4P reported at both the PM (Roy and Levine, 2004; Stefan et al., 2011) and the ER (Roy and Levine, 2004; Tahirovic et al., 2005; Cai et al., 2014), depending on the probe used. RNAi of SAC1 in mammalian causes 1-2 fold accumulation of PtdIns4P (Cheong et al., 2010; Dickson et al., 2016; Goto et al., 2016), with accumulation reported in the ER (Cheong et al., 2010; Blagoveshchenskaya et al., 2008). On the other hand, acute knock-out of SAC1 in HeLa cells with CRISPR/Cas9 was reported to induce PtdIns4P accumulation on the PM and endosomes (Dong et al., 2016). However, these experiments are hard to interpret, since the SAC1 gene is essential to the survival of single mammalian cells (Blomen et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2008). Phenotypes in RNAi and knock-out experiments are therefore observed during the rundown of SAC1 protein levels before the cells die. The phenotype observed may thus be exquisitely sensitive to the precise amount of SAC1 protein remaining in the cell at the time of the experiment.” (Subsection “Evidence for a “cis” acting SAC1”).</p><p>It is important to note here that the Dong et al. study did not generate a true knock-out cell line; rather, the study relied on a short (72-hour) expression of Cas9 with an exon 5-targeted guide RNA under a puromycin selection cassette, which achieved a marked knock-down (but not knock-out) of SAC1 expression. We repeated this experiment at the reviewer’s suggestion, following the published protocol (Dong et al., 2016). Western blot of lysates from control or CRISPR/Cas9-treated cells using the same antiserum used by Dong et al. (a kind gift from Pietro De Camilli) showed many bands, owing to the fact that this is not an affinity-purified serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3A</xref>). Nonetheless, we could see depletion of a band running slightly faster than the 70 kDa mark, consistent with 67 kDa SAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3A</xref>), similar to what was previously published (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3B</xref>; compare with Dong et al., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 H-M</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35588.031</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>CRISPR/Cas9mediated acute kick-out of SAC1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western Blot of duplicate lysates from CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid transfected cells (selected with puromycin) after 72 h of knock down were probes with both SAC1 antisera and monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody DM1A.

Whereas we did see a decreased PM accumulation of GFP-P4C that could be consistent with accumulated endosomal PtdIns4P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3C</xref>), we failed to observe the increased PM accumulation of GFP-ePH-ORP8, instead seeing a small decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3D</xref>). In addition, we noted that the localization of these probes in both control and “SAC1-KO” HeLa cells was quite variable. Using accumulation at the PM as a metric, and 1-25th percentile of P4C cells under either condition looked to have strong endosomal accumulation of probe (similar to KO in Dong et al), whereas the 75-100th percentile showed less endosomal accumulation and more PM signal (similar to control in Dong et al). Likewise, the lower quartile in ePH expressing cells showed very little PM localization (akin to control in Dong et al.), whereas the upper quartile showed strong PM localization (akin to SAC1 KO) under both conditions in our experiments.</p><p>In short, we were unable to reproduce a clear-cut difference between control and SAC1-KO cells. As we mention while discussing Dong et al. (see above), the discrepancy could be due to subtle differences in the timing of the experiments, leading to varying degrees of SAC1 protein rundown. It could also be due to differences in sampling between studies, in terms of which cells were imaged and measured. Either way, the amount of SAC1 protein present in a single cell used for these imaging studies cannot be known, even if knock down is effective across the population. Therefore, we conclude that these experiments are not informative as to SAC1’s preferred site of operation. Given this difficulty in interpretation, we prefer not to include these data in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and the first few lines of subsection “5.1. Evidence for a “cis” acting SAC1”: With the existence of lipid transfer proteins, acute inhibition of SAC1 should lead to increase in PI4P in both donor and acceptor membranes, but the kinetics of the increase may differ depending on whether SAC1 acts in cis or in trans. The authors should monitor the kinetics of PI4P increases at both the ER and the PM following acute inhibition of SAC1.

Whilst the reviewer is quite correct, PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> accumulation at the PM is possible even after loss of “cis” activity, we argue that the appearance of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> at the ER is cardinal for distinguishing “cis” vs “trans” activity. Changed levels at the PM in of itself is not a clear indicator of what mode the enzyme is acting in, without seeing ER accumulation (or lack thereof). Therefore, we feel that these experiments would be tangential to the study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
