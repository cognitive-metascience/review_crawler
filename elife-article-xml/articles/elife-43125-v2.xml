In principle, loss of gene function can be achieved through gene, mRNA or protein inactivation. While there are many techniques available to inactivate genes and mRNA globally, spatially and temporally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Housden et al., 2017</xref>), methods to reduce protein function in the same manner are more limited. One strategy to inactivate a specific protein is to fuse it to a degron, a protein domain that targets its fusion partner for degradation. Degrons are recognized by adapter proteins. These adapter proteins target the degron together with its fusion partner to the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex for degradation by the proteasome. By manipulating degrons with temperature, light, small molecules or another protein, protein-degron fusions can also be degraded in a controlled manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Natsume and Kanemaki, 2017</xref>). While different versions of these approaches have been adapted to zebrafish, it is mostly unclear whether they degrade the protein-degron efficiently enough to cause a phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daniel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neklesa et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>GFP-based fluorescent proteins (FPs) are convenient degrons because they are often used to tag proteins and their degradation can be easily monitored by light microscopy. deGradFP, a system developed in flies, depletes FP-tagged proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015</xref>). It relies on the expression of an anti-GFP nanobody/F-box fusion protein. This fusion protein recruits FP-tagged proteins to the SKP1- CUL1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to its ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation in 2-3 hr. Slight variations of this system have been used to deplete FP-tagged proteins in different tissues in nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brauchle et al., 2014</xref>) and in zebrafish nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we surveyed different degron systems in zebrafish and identified an anti-GFP nanobody/F-box fusion protein, which we named zGrad, that efficiently degrades FP-tagged proteins in zebrafish. We used this system to show that zGrad depletes FP-tagged proteins within 30 to 150 min depending on the subcellular localization and the nature of the tagged protein. We found that zGrad-mediated protein degradation recapitulates genetic loss-of-function phenotypes and can uncover severe maternal and maternal-zygotic phenotypes. When we induced zGrad from a heat-shock-inducible promoter, we found temporal degradation of FP-tagged proteins with acute and reversible loss-of-protein function phenotypes. Lastly, we expressed zGrad from a tissue-specific promoter and found degradation of FP-tagged proteins exposing a phenotype similar to but less severe than the genetic loss-of-function phenotype. These observations indicate that zGrad is a versatile tool to rapidly and reversibly deplete FP-tagged proteins with temporal or spatial control in zebrafish.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>zGrad efficiently degrades GFP-tagged proteins in zebrafish</title><p>To establish a method to reduce the activity of proteins in zebrafish, we tested several degron-based protein degradation systems. First, we tested the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Natsume et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gu et al., 2018</xref>). This system uses the plant F box transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) protein to recruit proteins tagged with the small AID degron to the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex in an auxin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We co-injected one-cell stage embryos with <italic>sfGFP-mAID</italic> mRNA and varying amounts of <italic>OsTIR1-mCherry</italic> mRNA and treated them for 3 hr with or without the auxin analog indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). We found that expression of OsTIR1-mCherry induced degradation of sfGFP-mAID in a dose-dependent manner irrespective of IAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also found that 50 pg/embryo or higher concentrations of <italic>OsTIR1-mCherry</italic> mRNA led to deformed and dying embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Thus, low levels of OsTIR1 induce degradation of AID-tagged proteins, higher levels of OsTIR1 are toxic and OsTIR degrades AID-tagged proteins in the absence of auxin, suggesting that, in its current form, the AID system is not suitable to degrade proteins in zebrafish.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43125.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>zGrad degrades GFP-tagged proteins in zebrafish.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of degron-based protein degradation systems. POI: protein of interest.

This system uses the <italic>C. elegans</italic> SOCS-box adaptor protein ZIF-1 which binds to the zinc-finger domain ZF1 to recruit ZF1-containing protein to the ECS (Elongin-C, Cul2, SOCS-box family) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex for proteasomal destruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armenti et al., 2014</xref>). We co-injected one-cell stage embryos with <italic>sfGFP-ZF1</italic> mRNA, <italic>zif-1</italic> mRNA and <italic>mScarlet-V5</italic> mRNA and assessed sfGFP-ZF1 degradation 9 hr later at the epiboly stage. The sequences of the ZF1 tag and ZIF-1 were codon optimized for zebrafish and mScarlet-V5 served as an internal standard. Using the ratio of sfGFP to mScarlet fluorescence intensity as a measure, we found that the ZIF-1/ZF1 tag degradation only reduced the levels of sfGFP-ZF1 by 17% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,H</xref>), indicating that the ZIF-1/ZF1 tag degradation system does not efficiently degrade ZF1-tagged proteins in zebrafish.</p><p>Third, we tested the Ab-SPOP/FP-tag degradation system. This system uses the CULLIN-binding domain from the human Speckle Type BTB/POZ Protein (SPOP) adaptor protein fused to the single domain anti-GFP nanobody vhhGFP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shin et al., 2015</xref>). The Ab-SPOP hybrid adaptor protein targets nuclear but not cytoplasmic FP-tagged proteins for degradation. We co-injected one-cell stage embryos with <italic>sfGFP-ZF1</italic> mRNA, <italic>Ab-SPOP</italic> mRNA or <italic>Abmut-SPOP</italic> mRNA and <italic>mScarlet-V5</italic> mRNA and assessed sfGFP-ZF1 degradation 9 hr later at the epiboly stage. Abmut-SPOP is a negative control and does not bind FPs because the GFP-binding domain in the nanobody is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shin et al., 2015</xref>). We assessed the degree of GFP degradation as the ratio of sfGFP to mScarlet fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Consistent with the initial description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shin et al., 2015</xref>), Ab-SPOP efficiently degraded nuclear sfGFP-ZF1 (70% reduction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) but not cytoplasmic sfGFP-ZF1 (13% reduction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Abmut-SPOP did not cause any detectable sfGFP-ZF1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shin et al., 2015</xref>), this confirms that the Ab-SPOP/FP-tag degradation system degrades nuclear proteins efficiently but is not suitable for the degradation of non-nuclear proteins in zebrafish.</p><p>Fourth, we tested the degrade Green Fluorescent Protein (deGradFP) system. This system uses the F-box domain from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Slimb adaptor protein fused to the anti-GFP nanobody vhhGFP4 to target FP-tagged proteins for degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>). We co-injected one-cell stage embryos with <italic>sfGFP-ZF1</italic> mRNA, <italic>deGradFP</italic> mRNA and <italic>mScarlet-V5</italic> mRNA and assessed sfGFP-ZF1 degradation 9 hr later at the epiboly stage. As above, mScarlet-V5 served as an internal standard and GFP degradation was assessed as the ratio of sfGFP to mScarlet fluorescence intensity. We found that deGradFP reduced sfGFP-ZF1 only slightly (19% reduction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Since the fusion of the anti-GFP nanobody to the Cullin-binding domain from SPOP resulted in efficient albeit only nuclear degradation of GFP, we reasoned that the anti-GFP nanobody recognizes GFP-tagged proteins but that the Slimb F-box domain is not efficiently recruited to the E3 ligase complex in zebrafish. We therefore replaced the Slimb F-box domain in deGradFP with the homologuous F-box domain from zebrafish, reasoning that this should result in more efficient GFP degradation in zebrafish. Based on sequence homology, we identified the zebrafish <italic>F-box and WD repeat domain containing 11b</italic> (<italic>fbxw11b)</italic> gene as the <italic>Drosophila slmb</italic> orthologue. We then replaced the <italic>Drosophila</italic> F-box domain from Slimb in deGradFP with the zebrafish F-box domain from Fbxw11b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). We named this hybrid adaptor protein zGrad for zebrafish deGradFP. To test whether zGrad degrades GFP-tagged proteins, we co-injected one-cell stage embryos with <italic>sfGFP-ZF1</italic> mRNA, <italic>zGrad</italic> mRNA and <italic>mScarlet-V5</italic> mRNA and assessed sfGFP-ZF1 degradation 9 hr later at the epiboly stage using the ratio of sfGFP to mScarlet fluorescence intensity. In contrast to deGradFP, which depleted 19% of sfGFP-ZF1, zGrad depleted sfGFP-ZF1 in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus by 89% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Importantly, we observed degradation of sfGFP-ZF1 by zGrad already at 2.5 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Together, this indicates that zGrad efficiently targets tagged GFP in the cytoplasm for degradation and should be suitable for assessing protein function in zebrafish.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>zGrad degrades nuclear, transmembrane and cytoplasmic FP-tagged proteins</title><p>Next, we asked whether zGrad degrades GFP-tagged proteins in different cellular compartments using a transgenic line that expresses zGrad from a heat-shock-inducible promoter in the embryo (<italic>hsp70l:zGrad</italic>).</p><p>First, we tested whether zGrad degrades the nuclear protein Histone 2A (H2A). We generated <italic>hsp70l:zGrad</italic> embryos that also expressed H2A-EGFP and H2A-mCherry from two identical 69 kb genomic fragments spanning the <italic>cxcr4b</italic> locus (<italic>cxcr4b:H2A-GFP; cxcr4b:H2A-mCherry</italic>). Among other tissues, the <italic>cxcr4b</italic> promoter drives expression in the somites and the posterior lateral line primordium (primordium) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chong et al., 2001</xref>). Such embryos were heat shocked at 30 hpf for 1 hr and imaged over 9.5 hr. Compared to control embryos that did not carry the <italic>hsp70l:zGrad</italic> transgene, H2A-EGFP degradation was discernible in zGrad-expressing embryos within 2-3 hr post heat shock in all tissues that expressed nuclear EGFP from the <italic>cxcr4b</italic> promoter (skin, pronephros, somites, neural tube and primordium, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—Video 1</xref>). We quantified H2A-EGFP levels in heat-shocked control embryos and heat-shocked <italic>hsp70l:zGrad</italic> embryos using the fluorescence intensity of H2A-mCherry as a reference. Since H2A-mCherry was expressed from the same promoter as H2A-EGFP and since H2A-mCherry is not recognized by the anti-GFP nanobody and should not be subjected to zGrad-mediated protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>), comparing the ratio of H2A-mCherry expression levels to H2A-EGFP should be a measure of H2A-EGFP in the absence of zGrad-mediated degradation. Further, we normalized the H2A-EGFP-to-H2A-mCherry fluorescence intensity ratios between zGrad-expressing and heat-shocked control embryos. In the somites, the levels of H2A-EGFP was decreased by 87% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), while in the primordium, the levels of H2A-EGFP was decreased by 22% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The more efficient degradation of H2A-EGFP in the somites than in the primordium is probably due to the lower levels of H2A-EGFP and the lack of H2A-EGFP production in the somites at the time of zGrad induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chong et al., 2001</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43125.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>zGrad degrades nuclear, transmembrane and cytoplasmic proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of strategy to assess zGrad-mediated H2A-EGFP degradation in the somites and the primordium. (<bold>B</bold>) Maximum-projected confocal images of nuclei in the somites in heat-shocked <italic>cxcr4b:H2A-EGFP; cxcr4b:H2A-mCherry</italic> embryos transgenic for <italic>hsp70l:zGrad</italic> (right) or not (left) at indicated time in min after the end of heat shock (29–30 hpf).

We generated two transgenes that express Cdh1-sfGFP and Cdh1-TagRFP from a 72 kb genomic fragment spanning the <italic>cdh1</italic> locus (<italic>cdh1:cdh1-sfGFP; cdh1:cdh1-TagRFP</italic>). These transgenes recapitulated the endogenous Cdh1 expression pattern and rescued the lethality of <italic>cdh1</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), indicating that Cdh1-sfGFP and Cdh1-TagRFP are functional. Using these lines, we generated <italic>hsp70l:zGrad; cdh1:cdh1-sfGFP; cdh1:cdh1-TagRFP</italic> embryos and <italic>cdh1:cdh1-sfGFP; cdh1:cdh1-TagRFP</italic> control embryos. These embryos were heat shocked at 31 hpf for 30 min and imaged for 4.8 hr. In zGrad-expressing embryos, Cdh1-sfGFP degradation was uniformly detected within 15 min post heat shock in the skin of the embryo (enveloping layer and epidermal basal layer) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—Video 2</xref>). As detailed above for the quantification of zGrad-mediated H2A-EGFP degradation, we used the fluorescence intensity of Cdh1-TagRFP as a reference to quantify the reduction of Cdh1-sfGFP. We divided the Cdh1-sfGFP fluorescence intensity by the Cdh1-TagRFP fluorescence intensity and normalized the ratio in the zGrad-expressing embryos to the ratio in the heat-shocked control embryos. This analysis showed that zGrad expression reduced the levels of Cdh1-sfGFP in the primordium by 79% with a degradation half-life of 24 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The time for onset of Cdh1-sfGFP degradation was 75 min (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Third, we tested whether zGrad degrades the cytoplasmic protein αE-Catenin (Ctnna). To address this, we used a gene-trap line that expresses αE-Catenin-Citrine (Ctnna-Citrine) from the <italic>ctnna</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Trinh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Žigman et al., 2011</xref>).

Homozygous <italic>ctnna:ctnna-Citrine</italic> fish are viable, indicating that Ctnna-Citrine is functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Trinh et al., 2011</xref>). We generated <italic>hsp70l:zGrad; ctnna:ctnna-Citrine/+</italic> embryos and <italic>ctnna:ctnna-Citrine/+</italic> control embryos and heat shocked these embryos at 31 hpf for 30 min and imaged the embryos for 8 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). In contrast to heat-shocked control embryos, Ctnna-Citrine was degraded in zGrad-expressing embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J,K</xref>). Since Ctnna tagged with a red fluorescent protein is not available, we could not perform a ratiometric analysis and instead quantified the total Ctnna-Citrine fluorescent intensity. This analysis showed that the time for onset of degradation of Ctnna-Citrine was 65 min and that Ctnna-Citrine was degraded by 58% with a half-life of 19 min in zGrad-expressing embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we tested whether zGrad degrades GFP targeted to the secretory pathway by a signal peptide. Using fish that express secreted EGFP and secreted mCherry from a heat shock promoter (<italic>hsp70l:sec-GFP; hsp70:sec-mCherry</italic>), we generated <italic>hsp70l:sec-GFP; hsp70:sec-mCherry; hsp70l:zGrad</italic> embryos and <italic>hsp70l:sec-GFP; hsp70:sec-mCherry</italic> control embryos.

We addressed this question in several ways. First, we tested whether zGrad degrades cytoplasmic Ctnna-Citrine to disrupt its function in cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kofron et al., 1997</xref>) using the <italic>ctnna:ctnna-Citrine</italic> gene trap line. We injected <italic>zGrad</italic> mRNA or <italic>sfGFP</italic> control mRNA into one-cell stage embryos that were maternal-zygotic Ctnna-Citrine (<italic>MZ ctnna:ctnna-Citrine</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), maternal Ctnna-Citrine (<italic>M ctnna:ctnna-Citrine</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) or zygotic Ctnna-Citrine (<italic>Z ctnna:ctnna-Citrine</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In <italic>zGrad</italic> mRNA-injected <italic>MZ ctnna:ctnna-Citrine</italic> and <italic>M ctnna:ctnna-Citrine</italic> embryos the cells started to become detached and partly shed from the embryo resulting in embryonic lethality around 3 to 5 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C,E,F</xref>). Control embryos injected with <italic>sfGFP</italic> mRNA developed normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C,E,F</xref>). Similarly but delayed by 20 hr, in <italic>zGrad</italic> mRNA-injected <italic>Z ctnna:ctnna-Citrine</italic> embryos, cells detached from the embryo by 24 hpf and about half of the embryos died (note, half the embryos were zygotically homozygous for <italic>ctnna:ctnna-Citrine</italic> since we crossed <italic>ctnna:ctnna-Citrine</italic>/<italic>ctnna:ctnna-Citrine</italic> males to <italic>ctnna:ctnna-Citrine</italic>/+ females, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H,I</xref>) while control injected embryos were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>).

Thus, zGrad depletes Ctnna-Citrine to levels too low to sustain cell-cell adhesion and embryonic development. Moreover, it suggests that maternally supplied Ctnna can sustain cell-cell adhesion and embryonic development for about 1 day before the embryo requires zygotic Ctnna.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43125.015</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>zGrad-mediated depletion of alpha-Catenin results in cell adhesion defects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Breeding strategy to assess zGrad-mediated degradation of maternally and zygotically provided Ctnna-Citrine on embryonic development. (<bold>B</bold>) Images of MZ <italic>ctnna:ctnna-Citrine</italic> embryos injected with <italic>sfGFP</italic> control mRNA (left) or <italic>zGrad</italic> mRNA (right).

In <italic>cxcr4b</italic> mutant control embryos that carried the rescuing <italic>cxcr4b:cxcr4b-EGFP-IRES-Kate2-CaaX-p1</italic> transgene but lacked the <italic>cxcr4b:zGrad</italic> transgene, the primordium completed its migration and deposited the same number of neuromasts with the same spacing as in wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, embryos with the <italic>cxcr4b:zGrad</italic> transgene migrated on average only 72.5% of the distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). Compared to primordia in <italic>cxcr4b</italic>-/- embryos, which showed little to no directed migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haas and Gilmour, 2006</xref>), primordia in <italic>cxcr4b</italic>-/-; <italic>cxcr4b:cxcr4b-EGFP-IRES-Kate2-CaaX-p1; cxcr4b:zGrad</italic> embryos migrated directionally but at reduced speed, did not fully complete their migration and failed to deposit the terminal neuromasts by 4 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).

This suggests that zGrad expression from the <italic>cxcr4b</italic> promoter efficiently degrades Cxcr4b-EGFP to levels low enough to slow primordium migration but not low enough to recapitulate the primordium migration defect observed in embryos with loss of Cxcr4b function, probably because the <italic>cxcr4b</italic> promoter does not express zGrad at high enough levels for complete degradation of Cxcr4b-EGFP driven from the same promoter.

We modified the anti-GFP nanobody-based deGradFP system from flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brauchle et al., 2014</xref>) and adapted it to zebrafish and named it zGrad. zGrad efficiently degrades GFP-tagged transmembrane, cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. It recognizes different GFP versions (EGFP, sfGFP and Citrine, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) and targets the tagged proteins for degradation. In contrast to other degron systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Natsume and Kanemaki, 2017</xref>) and similar to deGradFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>), zGrad degraded proteins tagged at the N-terminus, embedded within the protein and at the C-terminus in the examples reported here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). We found that zGrad rapidly degrades GFP-tagged proteins with half-lives of around 20 min for transmembrane and cytoplasmic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These kinetics are similar to the kinetics reported for other degron-based systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daniel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armenti et al., 2014</xref>). The degradation of H2A-EGFP was significantly slower displaying a half-life of about 2.5 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This could be due to the long life-time of histone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clift et al., 2017</xref>) and the possibility that protein degradation is less efficient in nuclei. Importantly, in our system zGrad expression needs to be induced. This delays the onset of degradation by 65 to 200 min for the proteins we investigated. Nevertheless, zGrad degrades proteins rapidly enough to assess the consequences of abrupt protein inactivation.</p><p>Recently, the AID system was combined with the deGradFP system by fusing AID to the vhhGFP4 anti-GFP nanobody and shown to degrade GFP-tagged proteins in an auxin-dependent manner in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daniel et al., 2018</xref>). This elegant approach adds temporal control to the spatial control provided by the deGradFP system. Also, the fusion of AID to the vhhGFP4 nanobody overcomes the leakiness that we observed with the AID system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daniel et al., 2018</xref>). However, compared to zGrad system, which requires the fusion of the protein of interest to GFP and the expression of zGrad, the mAID-nanobody system requires the expression of an additional component, the mAID-nanobody fusion protein – a feature that adds more versatility but also requires additional effort.</p><p>One simple use of zGrad is the study of the contribution of maternally supplied proteins in early development. Depletion of maternal proteins by expressing zGrad from injected mRNA or as purified protein should uncover early protein requirements and can circumvent the laborious process of generating maternal mutants for essential genes by germline replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ciruna et al., 2002</xref>). Our finding that the depletion of maternal Ctnna results in an early and severe cell-cell adhesion defect is consistent with this idea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Alternatively, a pulse of zGrad should allow one to dissect the temporal requirements of proteins. Depending on the protein function this could result in a reversible phenotype as observed when we transiently stalled the migration of the primordium by depleting Cxcr4b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) or to an irreversible phenotype if the function of the protein is continually required for viability as observed when we depleted Cdh1 and disrupted the integrity of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Another use of zGrad is to deplete proteins from certain tissues. By expressing zGrad from tissue-specific promoters, one can circumvent essential early requirements, assess later protein functions and disentangle the contribution of tissues to complex phenotypes. Our observation that depletion of Cxcr4b in the primordium by expressing zGrad from the <italic>cxcr4b</italic> promoter results in slowed migration supports this idea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>An important consideration is that zGrad needs to be expressed at high enough levels to deplete proteins to sufficiently low levels to fully disrupt protein function. One way to achieve high and tissue-specific zGrad expression is to amplify the production of zGrad through such systems as Gal4/UAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scheer and Campos-Ortega, 1999</xref>) or – to also add temporal control – inducible systems such as the Tet-On system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campbell et al., 2012</xref>). Such modifications combined with the increasing number of GFP-tagged transgenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Trinh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawakami et al., 2010</xref>) and knock-in lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoshijima et al., 2016</xref>) should render zGrad as a useful tool for the study of the consequences of acute loss-of-protein function in zebrafish, possibly also circumventing the problem of genetic compensation observed in studies of genetic mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rossi et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish strains</title><p>Embryos were staged as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kimmel et al., 1995</xref>).

Then, we tested whether the sample sets had the same standard deviation using the F-test. Based on the result of F-test, the two sample sets were compared by either the Welch’s t-test or the Student’s t-test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To analyze the fold-change curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, E, H and K</xref>, the curves were fitted to a one-exponential decay model (Y = Span*exp(-k*X)+Plateau) using Prism 7 (Graphpad). The values of T1/2 and the plateau, which we assumed to be the value of maximal degradation, were extracted from the fitted curves. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> (inset, 30 min to 240 min), two data sets were compared by paired-t test using Prism.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank S Lau for critical comments; D Kane, L Trinh and S Fraser for reagents, T Gerson for excellent fish care and Dorus Gadella (Addgene plasmid # 85042), Markus Affolter (Addgene plasmid # 35579), Masato Kanemaki (Addgene plasmid # 72835) and Byung Joon Hwang (Ab-SPOP and Abmut-SPOP) for plasmids.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Thomas F Schilling (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. There was broad agreement that your work would be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic> after the points raised below are addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript submitted by Holger Knaut and colleagues for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> describes a novel approach to study protein function in zebrafish, a model system that has made major contribution to a better understanding of vertebrate development due to its ease to do live imaging studies at cellular resolution.</p><p>Upon testing a number of different degradation systems, the authors adapted a previously described method to degrade GFP-fusion proteins with a nanobody recognizing GFP, fused itself to a F-box of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein Slmb, targeting the GFP-fusion protein to the proteasome. Since the authors found that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> F-box did not lead to efficient degradation, they exchanged the latter with the F-box of the corresponding gene from zebrafish, and then showed that this construct is capable to degrade nuclear, transmembrane and cytoplasmic FP-tagged proteins. Most importantly, using endogenously tagged FP proteins, the authors showed that zGrad was capable to generate loss of function phenotypes in the zebrafish, opening the door to degrade proteins in a time- and tissue-dependent manner in unprecedented fashion. More importantly, protein degradation allows removing maternal contribution of the protein of interest (if a FP tagged rescue or endogenous version is available); this is particularly important for cell biological studies, since many widely expressed proteins are also maternally contributed.</p><p>The study is done very carefully and in a quantitative manner. This study was only possible since the authors had functional FP constructs of their genes of interest.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this paper the authors report their development of a nanobody-based method for targeted protein degradation in zebrafish. They show that by adapting a deGradFP system used in <italic>Drosophila</italic> they can obtain efficient degradation of nuclear, cytoplasmic and transmembrane proteins in both a temporally- and spatially-controlled manner, while other similar degradation systems are less effective. They confirm that using this zGrad system they can obtain previously published loss-of-function phenotypes for E-cadherin, E-catenin and Cxcr4b. They then go beyond previous mutant studies of these factors to address temporal requirements – such as maternal versus zygotic functions of E-catenin, and Cxcr4b in collective migration of the lateral line primordium – as well as tissue-specific promoters to disrupt Cxcr4b in specific cell types. This is a major technical advance, as tools for conditional loss-of-function approaches in zebrafish are desperately needed. The experiments are well designed, rigorously analyzed and the results are convincing. It is somewhat less innovative conceptually given the fact that a similar system exists in flies and functions of all of the genes examined here have been studied before. In addition, there are some concerns about variability in the effectiveness of zGrad and its reproducibility.</p><p>1) The paper shows a wide variety of efficiencies in the reduction in levels as well as the timing of degradation for different zGrad target proteins. As proof of principle with sfGFP-ZF1 they co-inject one-cell stage embryos and assay protein levels 9 hours later (Figure 1). What are the results if assayed at 2-3 hpf? The authors argue that the system should work within that time frame. For H2A-EGFP the onset of degradation is estimated as 140-200 min while for Ctnna-Citrine it appears to be as early as 65 min. How do the authors account for these differences in onset?</p><p>2) Experiments with H2A-EGFP show widely varied reductions in protein levels in different tissues, which the authors argue reflects different levels of endogenous H2A production. This raises the question of how functional experiments with proteins for which function is unknown can deal with the potential differences in efficiency introduced by variation in the synthesis of new protein? Negative results obtained with zGrad will be extremely hard to interpret. For Figure 2D-E the authors should confirm the hypothesis that the difference in degradation efficiency between somites and lateral line primordia is due to different expression levels of H2A-GFP with in situs for eGFP and mCherry.</p><p>3) Variability in the effectiveness of zGrad for Cdh1 to cause cell adhesion defects is explained as being due to variability in zGrad levels. However again this complicates interpretation. Can zGrad levels be monitored and correlated with variability in phenotypic defects? The authors should genotype the embryos to identify those that are <italic>cadh+/-;cdh1:cd1-sfgfp;hsp70l:zGrad</italic> as the phenotype can only be visualized in these embryos.</p><p>4) Interpretation of the results also depends to a great extent on what is co-injected in a given experiment, in terms of amount, and how long it persists in the embryo. This is particularly a potential problem in experiments addressing maternal versus zygotic function.</p><p>5) The authors should compare the different deGradFP systems used in zebrafish more clearly either in the Introduction or Discussion section to help the reader appreciate the improvements in their system over the previous ones. Since the authors start with results from existing methods and show them in figure supplements, it would be helpful if they present their general experimental strategy including the model for the degron system in the first supplementary figure.</p><p>6) Clarify the choice of the Slimb system over the <italic>C. elegans</italic> system, considering that both had similar efficiency of knockdown (19% and 17%).</p><p>7) Clarify why the results shown in Figure 2—video 1 and Figure 5—video 1 are so similar – slight delays in lateral line migration in zGrad expression embryos, which recover over time – considering the difference in their backgrounds?</p><p>8) Figure 3. The <italic>ctnna</italic>-citrine strategy is unclear. Are the authors using <italic>ctnna</italic> heterozygotes for the cross? What is zGrad targeting in this cross, since the embryos appear to be expressing a citrine fusion protein? Does vhhGFP4 recognize citrine?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript &quot;zGrad is a nanobody-based degron system that inactivates proteins in zebrafish” Yamaguchi, Colak-Champollion and Knaut report the establishment of a nanobody-based tool to degrade GFP-tagged proteins in zebrafish. The authors developed a simple, efficient and spatially- and temporally inducible 1-component system that targets GFP-tagged proteins of interest with different subcellular localizations for degradation by the endogenous ubiquitin-based machinery. Degradation is sufficiently efficient to result in a) loss-of-function phenotypes after global induction of protein degradation, and b) hypomorphic and/or more restricted phenotypes for tissue/time-specific induction of protein degradation.</p><p>Compared to the recently published mAID nanobody based 2-component system for zebrafish by the Mansfeld/Norden labs (Daniel et al., 2018), which is most similar to the zGrad tool presented here, zGrad provides a valuable and potentially superior drug-independent 1-component alternative. The main difference of the two systems is the Auxin/TIR1-dependence (mAID) versus independence (zGrad) by using a different degradation-inducing fusion protein to the vhh-GFP4 nanobody: In the case of the published mAID system (Daniel et al., 2018), the nanobody vhh-GFP4 is fused to AID to link via the adaptor protein TIR1 and Auxin to the SCF degradation complex. Degradation in this system was reported to depend on the presence of Auxin. In case of zGrad, the nanobody vhh-GFP4 is fused to Fbxw11b, which binds directly in an Auxin-independent manner to the SCF-complex member Skp1 and thus does not need an additional adaptor to link to the SCF degradation complex. The authors show that the system is inducible by hs- or tissue-specific control of the nanobody fusion construct. Thus, no drugs are needed to induce degradation of GFP-tagged proteins of interest and the newly developed system presented here. Most importantly, the authors present convincing data that zGrad is efficient enough to cause protein-depletion at a level that results in loss-of-function phenotypes.</p><p>Overall, zGrad provides a very elegant, simple system to induce protein degradation without the need of drugs or additional adaptor proteins, which also circumvents the problem of potential leakiness of directly AID-tagged target proteins (degradation even in the absence of Auxin). zGrad presents a valuable contribution for functional studies in zebrafish, and will be an important, versatile alternative (and potentially superior, depending on the application) tool that nicely complements other available tools for protein degradation.</p><p>The data is of very high quality, and the experiments support the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>I have no major concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43125.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) The paper shows a wide variety of efficiencies in the reduction in levels as well as the timing of degradation for different zGrad target proteins.

One difference between these three proteins is their subcellular localization. H2A-GFP is nuclear while Cdh1-GFP is a transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic tail and Ctnna-Citrine resides fully in the cytoplasm. It is possible that nuclear proteins are less accessible to zGrad-mediated degradation than proteins which are partly of wholly residing in the cytoplasm. Also, the nature of the protein, the complex in which the protein resides and the number of potential ubiquitination sites in the protein will likely contribute to rate of zGrad-mediated degradation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Experiments with H2A-EGFP show widely varied reductions in protein levels in different tissues, which the authors argue reflects different levels of endogenous H2A production.

However, since the protein of interest will be tagged with a fluorescent protein (FP) it is possible to assess the degree of protein depletion in different tissues and use this information when drawing conclusions. Also, if this is a problem increasing the expression levels of zGrad is an option to increase the degree of FP-tagged protein degradation.</p><p>To confirm that the differences in H2A-EGFP degradation efficiencies are due to difference in H2A-EGFP expression levels in somites and the posterior lateral line primodium, we stained embryos for <italic>EGFP</italic> and <italic>mCherry</italic> mRNA at 13 hpf (8-somite stage) and at 33 hpf. Consistent with a previous study [1], we find that the <italic>cxcr4b</italic> promoter drives <italic>EGFP</italic> and <italic>mCherry</italic> mRNA expression in the somites at 13 hpf but not at 33 hpf anymore. In contrast, <italic>cxcr4b</italic> drives expression of <italic>EGFP</italic> and <italic>mCherry</italic> mRNA in the primordium at 33 hpf (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). This indicates that the expression of H2A-EGFP protein in the somites at around 30 hpf is due to H2A-EGFP protein perdurance from past <italic>cxcr4b</italic> promoter activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Variability in the effectiveness of zGrad for Cdh1 to cause cell adhesion defects is explained as being due to variability in zGrad levels. However again this complicates interpretation. Can zGrad levels be monitored and correlated with variability in phenotypic defects? The authors should genotype the embryos to identify those that are cadh+/-;cdh1:cd1-sfgfp;hsp70l:zGrad as the phenotype can only be visualized in these embryos.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and now included an experiment in which we genotyped the embryos for <italic>hsp70l:zGrad</italic> and <italic>cdh1</italic> using cDNA isolated from individual embryos which were phenotypically wild-type or displayed detaching skin cells. As shown in Figure 4, there is a perfect correlation between the heat-shocked embryos with a skin defect and the genotype (<italic>cdh1-/-; cdh1:cdh1-sfGFP; hsp70l:zGrad</italic>, n = 7) and heat-shocked embryos without a skin defect and the genotype (<italic>cdh1-/-; cdh1:cdh1-sfGFP</italic>, n = 1 and <italic>cdh1</italic>-/+ or <italic>cdh1</italic>+/+; <italic>cdh1:cdh1-sfGFP; hsp70l:zGrad</italic> n = 8). For genotyping, we could not use genomic DNA because the <italic>cdh1:cdh1-sfGFP</italic> transgene spans the <italic>cdh1</italic> locus and cannot be distinguished from the endogenous <italic>cdh1</italic> locus by PCR-based genotyping approaches. However, the mRNAs for <italic>cdh1</italic> and <italic>cdh1-sGFP</italic> can be distinguished by PCR based on the different amplicon sizes. We therefore developed a cDNA-based genotyping protocol that we included in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Interpretation of the results also depends to a great extent on what is co-injected in a given experiment, in terms of amount, and how long it persists in the embryo. This is particularly a potential problem in experiments addressing maternal versus zygotic function.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the levels and turnover of zGrad will greatly affect the depletion of the FP-tagged target protein. We would like to note, however, that the degree of target protein degradation can easily be monitored by following the fluorescence from the FP-tag. Experiments addressing the function of maternal versus zygotic proteins can be designed in such a way that only the maternal protein or only the zygotic protein is subject to zGrad-mediated degradation. By crossing females homozygous for the gene encoding the FP-tagged target protein to wild-type males homozygous for the untagged/wild-type gene, one can generate embryos in which only the maternal target protein will be degraded by zGrad. Conversely, by crossing females heterozygous for the gene encoding the FP-tagged target protein to males of the same genotype, one can generate embryos in which only the zygotic target protein will be degraded by zGrad. However, as noted by Reviewer 2, in both cases one caveat is that zGrad may not completely deplete the tagged target protein. Therefore, monitoring the fluorescence of the target protein will be essential to assess the degree of protein depletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should compare the different deGradFP systems used in zebrafish more clearly either in the Introduction or Discussion section to help the reader appreciate the improvements in their system over the previous ones. Since the authors start with results from existing methods and show them in Supplement Figures, it would be helpful if they present their general experimental strategy including the model for the degron system in the first Supplementary Figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and now included a discussion of the different degron-based protein depletion systems.

We chose the SOCS box from the zebrafish d-Asb11 protein because it has been shown that d-Asb11 associates with ECS (Elongin BC-Cul2/Cul5-SOCS-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex to degrade DeltaA in zebrafish [2]. However, this ZIF1-d-Asb11 fusion did not degrade GFP-ZF1 more efficiently than ZIF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).

We used these time lapse videos to assess the degradation efficiency and kinetics of H2A-EGFP in the nuclei of the primordium. The embryos are wild type and express <italic>cxcr4b</italic> from the endogenous locus, and we did not see any migration defects upon zGrad expression.</p><p>Figure 5—video 1 documents the consequences of transient Cxcr4b protein loss of function on primordium migration. We used time lapse videos to assess how the depletion of Cxcr4b-EGFP upon zGrad expression from a heat shock promoter in <italic>cxcr4b</italic> mutant embryos affects the migration of the primordium. Note that in <italic>cxcr4b</italic> mutant embryos that carry the <italic>cxcr4b:cxcr4b-EGFP-IRES-Kate2-CaaX</italic> transgene the migration of the primordium is restored [3]. We found that transient expression of zGrad efficiently depleted Cxcr4b-EGFP and resulted in primordium stalling. Once Cxcr4b-EGFP levels recovered the primordium resumed its migration. Thus, the two videos document two different aspects – zGrad-mediated depletion of H2A-EGFP and zGrad mediated Cxcr4b loss of protein function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 3. The ctnna-citrine strategy is unclear. Are the authors using ctnna heterozygotes for the cross? What is zGrad targeting in this cross, since the embryos appear to be expressing a citrine fusion protein? Does vhhGFP4 recognize citrine?</p></disp-quote><p>The <italic>Gt(ctnna-citrine)Ct3a</italic> allele is a gene-trap line, in which the coding sequence for the GFP-variant Citrine [4] hopped into the <italic>ctnna</italic> locus to generate a Ctnna-Citrine functional fusion protein. The gene-trap coding for <italic>citrine</italic> is inserted in the intron between exon 7 and exon 8 of <italic>ctnna</italic> [5]. We found that Ctnna-Citrine protein is degraded by zGrad (Figure 2I-K) indicating that zGrad recognizes Citrine. This is consistent with the observation that deGradFP recognizes and depletes EYFP-tagged Histone in flies [6].</p><p>We generated embryos in which only maternal Ctnna protein was tagged with Citrine, only zygotic Ctnna protein was tagged with Citrine or both maternal and zygotic Ctnna protein was tagged with Citrine. We injected such embryos with <italic>zGrad</italic> mRNA to assess whether zGrad depletes maternal, zygotic and maternal and zygotic proteins and induces loss of protein function phenotypes. For these genotypes our nomenclature might have been confusing. We indicated fish homozygous for <italic>ctnna:ctnna-citrine</italic> simply as <italic>ctnna:ctnna-citrine</italic> fish instead of <italic>ctnna:ctnna-citrine/ctnna:ctnna-citrine</italic> fish.
