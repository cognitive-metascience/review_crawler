Here, we show that, in human cells, cohesin loading onto chromosomes during early S phase requires the replicative helicase MCM2–7 and the kinase DDK. Cohesin and its loader SCC2/4 (NIPBL/MAU2 in humans) associate with DDK and phosphorylated MCM2–7. This binding does not require MCM2–7 activation by CDC45 and GINS, but its persistence on activated MCM2–7 requires fork-stabilizing replisome components. Inactivation of these replisome components impairs cohesin loading and causes interphase cohesion defects. Interfering with Okazaki fragment processing or nucleosome assembly does not impact cohesion. Therefore, MCM2–7-coupled cohesin loading promotes cohesion establishment, which occurs without Okazaki fragment maturation. We propose that the cohesin–loader complex bound to MCM2–7 is mobilized upon helicase activation, transiently held by the replisome, and deposited behind the replication fork to encircle sister chromatids and establish cohesion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>Sister-chromatid cohesion</kwd><kwd>cohesin</kwd><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>pre-replication complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Hongtao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Hongtao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP120717-P2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Hongtao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP160667-P2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Hongtao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Systematic analyses of DNA replication machinery components in human cells reveal a requirement of MCM-dependent de novo loading or mobilization of cohesin at replication forks in establishing sister-chromatid cohesion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sister-chromatid cohesion is essential for proper chromosome segregation and faithful transmission of the genome during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morales and Losada, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uhlmann, 2016</xref>). Failure to establish or resolve cohesion in a timely manner leads to genomic instability and aneuploidy. Sister-chromatid cohesion is mediated by cohesin, a ring-shaped ATPase machine that consists of SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, and either STAG1 or STAG2 in human somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haarhuis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Losada and Hirano, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nasmyth and Haering, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Onn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peters et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zheng and Yu, 2015</xref>). Cohesin rings topologically entrap DNA to generate physical linkages between sister chromatids and enable cohesion. Cohesin regulates other chromosome-based processes, such as DNA repair, transcription, and chromosome folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Merkenschlager and Odom, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu and Yu, 2012</xref>). These other functions of cohesin likely also involve the topological entrapment of chromosomes or possibly the extrusion of DNA loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrington et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haarhuis et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Cohesin is loaded onto chromosomes in telophase and G1 by the SCC2/4 complex (NIPBL/MAU2 in humans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gillespie and Hirano, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Takahashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tonkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watrin et al., 2006</xref>). Before DNA replication, the chromosome-bound cohesin is dynamic and is actively removed from chromosomes by the cohesin-releasing factor WAPL with the help of the scaffolding protein PDS5A or PDS5B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kueng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lopez-Serra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ouyang and Yu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ouyang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ouyang et al., 2016</xref>). During DNA replication in S phase, a pool of cohesin is converted to the cohesive form, which stably associates with chromosomes and mediates sister-chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kueng et al., 2006</xref>). In human cells, cohesion establishment requires the acetylation of SMC3 by the acetyltransferases ESCO1 and ESCO2 and subsequent recruitment of sororin, which antagonizes WAPL to stabilize cohesin on chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alomer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hou and Zou, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nishiyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ouyang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rankin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rowland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Unal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2008a</xref>).</p><p>The replicative helicase MCM2–7 is loaded on chromosomes in telophase with the help of the origin recognition complex (ORC), CDC6, and CDT1, and exists as dormant double hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Riera et al., 2017</xref>). At the G1/S transition, phosphorylation of MCM2–7 by the DBF4-dependent kinase (DDK) and CDKs promotes the formation of the active CDC45–MCM–GINS (CMG) helicase capable of unwinding DNA. DNA polymerases and additional replication factors are further recruited to replication forks to assemble the replisome and initiate DNA replication. Down-regulation of a subset of replisome components, such as Ctf4, Tof1, Csm3, or Chl1 in yeast and their corresponding orthologs WDHD1, TIMELESS, TIPIN, or DDX11 in metazoans, permits DNA replication, but produces cohesion defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Errico et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lengronne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parish et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rudra and Skibbens, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Samora et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sherwood et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tanaka et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, cohesion establishment is tightly coupled to DNA replication, but the mechanism of this coupling is incompletely understood.</p><p>Initial experiments in yeast showed that inactivation of the Scc2/4 complex in cells enriched in early S phase by hydroxyurea did not reduce cell viability or cause overt cohesion defect, suggesting that cohesion establishment might not require de novo cohesin loading in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lengronne et al., 2006</xref>). This result led to the hypothesis that cohesion establishment involves the entire replication machinery passing through the cohesin rings pre-loaded on DNA in G1. Consistent with this hypothesis, in WAPL-deficient human cells, cohesin loaded in G1 remains associated with chromatin throughout S phase and is not displaced by the replication machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rhodes et al., 2017b</xref>). Recent evidence in yeast, however, indicates that the Scc2/4 complex is still needed in S phase for cohesion establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murayama et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nasmyth, 2017</xref>). In vitro reconstitution experiments further suggest that, with the help of Scc2/4, cohesin loaded on DNA can further capture a second DNA molecule, which has to be single-stranded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murayama et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggest that de novo loading of cohesin at the replication fork, where single-stranded DNA is present, might promote cohesion establishment.</p><p>In <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, Scc2/4-dependent cohesin loading onto chromosomes requires MCM2–7 and DDK, which physically interact with Scc2/4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gillespie and Hirano, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takahashi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Takahashi et al., 2004</xref>). Activation of the MCM2–7 helicase and initiation of DNA replication are not required for cohesin loading or Scc2/4 interaction with MCM and DDK, indicating that Scc2/4 and cohesin interact with the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). Although the functional consequence of this interaction in cohesion establishment was not directly examined, these findings suggested an attractive mechanism that couples cohesin loading to the DNA replication machinery. On the other hand, a subsequent study showed that MCM2–7 might be dispensable for cohesin loading in human cells, although the MCM–cohesin interaction could be detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guillou et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, Cdc6 and, by inference, the pre-RC are not required for cohesin loading in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Uhlmann and Nasmyth, 1998</xref>). These results casted doubts on the conservation of MCM-dependent cohesin loading in organisms other than <italic>Xenopus</italic>.</p><p>To gain insight into cohesion establishment during DNA replication, we investigated the requirements of various replication factors in cohesin loading and interphase cohesion in human cells. Our results show that MCM2–7 and DDK physically interact with NIPBL/MAU2 and cohesin, and are required for cohesin loading in human cells during early S phase. Depletion of replisome components causes cohesion defects in interphase and reduces the MCM–NIPBL–cohesin interaction. Thus, binding of NIPBL/MAU2 and cohesin to MCM persists at active replication forks, requires additional replisome components for maintenance, and is critical for cohesion establishment. We propose that cohesin and NIPBL/MAU2 loaded at replication origins remain associated with MCM2–7 and DDK, and are mobilized upon replication initiation, held transiently by replisome components, and deposited behind the replication fork to establish sister-chromatid cohesion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cohesin loading requires MCM2–7 in human cells during early S phase</title><p>Using RNA interference (RNAi), we depleted MCM2–7 components from HeLa Tet-On cells stably expressing RAD21-Myc and examined the level of chromatin-bound RAD21-Myc with immunostaining. RAD21-Myc is functional, as it could rescue cohesion defects caused by depletion of the endogenous RAD21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). In cells arrested in early S phase with thymidine treatment, the intensity of RAD21-Myc on chromatin was greatly reduced when MCM2 or NIPBL was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The depletion of MCM2 was very efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The RAD21-Myc signal on chromatin was restored when RNAi-resistant MCM2 was ectopically expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In fact, MCM2 overexpression elevated the RAD21-Myc intensity on chromatin to a level higher than that in control RNAi cells. We thus checked whether other MCM subunits were required for cohesin loading. The RAD21-Myc intensity in early S phase cells was similarly reduced by the depletion of MCM3 or MCM5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We next examined the level of MCM5 on chromatin when MCM2 was overexpressed. MCM2 overexpression elevated MCM5 levels on chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Thus, MCM2 overexpression likely increases the amount of the MCM2–7 complex on chromatin, resulting in hyperactive cohesin loading. These results suggest that the MCM2–7 complex is required for cohesin loading in human cells during early S phase.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33920.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The MCM2–7 complex is required for cohesin loading during early S phase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DAPI (blue), anti-Myc (red), and anti-MCM2 (green) staining of HeLa cells that stably expressed RAD21-Myc.

Depletion of NIPBL greatly reduced chromatin-bound RAD21-Myc in both cell cycle stages. MCM2 depletion also reduced the association of endogenous STAG2 with chromatin in thymidine-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), but only slightly reduced chromatin-bound STAG2 in telophase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, MCM2–7 is more critical for NIPBL/MAU2-dependent cohesin loading during early S phase.</p><p>We next examined the interactions among MCM2–7, cohesin, and NIPBL/MAU2 at different cell cycle stages. MCM2 associated with both NIPBL/MAU2 and cohesin in log-phase and thymidine-arrested, early S phase cells, but this interaction was much weaker in G2 or mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To narrow down the time window of this MCM–NIPBL–cohesin interaction, we collected cells that were released from thymidine arrest at different time points and performed MCM2 immunoprecipitation. The MCM–NIPBL–cohesin interaction reached peak levels when cells were enriched in mid-S phase at 2 hr after thymidine release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Importantly, all lysates used for immunoprecipitation were treated with Turbo nuclease. The observed MCM–NIPBL–cohesin interaction was unlikely to be bridged by chromatin. The cohesion-stabilizing factor sororin was also detected in the MCM2 IP, indicating that at least a pool of MCM-bound cohesin was capable of establishing cohesion.</p><p>We tested whether NIPBL/MAU2 binding to MCM2–7 was dependent on cohesin and vice versa. Depletion of NIPBL/MAU2 inhibited the association of cohesin with MCM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When SMC3 was depleted from cells, the interaction between MCM2 and NIPBL/MAU2 was no longer detectable. Thus, NIPBL/MAU2 binding and cohesin binding to MCM2–7 are mutually dependent. NIPBL/MAU2 and cohesin may bind cooperatively to MCM2–7. Alternatively, although this interaction can exist without chromatin, it may only be established on chromatin, following NIPBL/MAU2-dependent cohesin loading.

Moreover, control cells replicated their DNA and slowly progressed through S phase during prolonged thymidine treatment for 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This highly inefficient S phase progression was inhibited when NIPBL was depleted. In cases of DDK, CDC45, or GINS1 depletion, the impaired replication was expected, because of the known roles of these proteins in establishing the active CMG helicase. The requirement for NIPBL in DNA replication was not entirely expected. We do not know whether this requirement was due to a perturbation of the transcription function of cohesin in G1 or direct roles of NIPBL/MAU2 and cohesin in DNA replication and repair. Regardless, our results suggest that the strict requirement for these factors in DNA replication might explain the lack of strong cohesion defects in cells depleted of these factors.

Thus, not all replication factors are required for interphase cohesion in human cells. Our results further suggest that cohesion establishment occurs prior to or independently of the processing and ligation of Okazaki fragment and histone deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results are in agreement with a previous report in the budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borges et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A recent in vitro reconstitution study with the fission yeast cohesin revealed that, in the presence of Scc2/4, the DNA-bound cohesin could topologically capture a second DNA molecule, which has to be single stranded DNA (ssDNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murayama et al., 2018</xref>). Conversion of the captured ssDNA to dsDNA leads to a more stable cohesin-mediated DNA–DNA linkage. That study suggests that sister-chromatid cohesion is established at replication forks before lagging strand synthesis is completed, a finding in general agreement with ours.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Replisome components are required for cohesin loading and MCM–NIPBL–cohesin interaction</title><p>We synchronized HeLa cells at different cell cycle stages with a nocodazole-arrest-release protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), isolated the chromatin fraction from these cells, and blotted the total lysates and chromatin fractions with antibodies against pre-RC, replisome, and cohesin components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

MCM2–7 and DDK physically interact with NIPBL/MAU2 and cohesin. This interaction is regulated during the cell cycle and requires the kinase activity of DDK. Therefore, the function of MCM2–7 and DDK in cohesin loading is conserved in vertebrates. We propose that MCM2–7 and DDK interact with SCC2/4 and cohesin at the G1/S boundary and load cohesin to chromatin in the vicinity of the pre-RC. The loaded cohesin remains physically associated with SCC2/4 and MCM2–7 on chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

In thymidine-arrested cells, a large fraction of these early-replicating origins has fired. Continued binding of cohesin and SCC2/4 at these origins requires replisome components in these early S phase cells. During S phase progression, DDK is mobilized and binds to other MCM complexes.

Depletion of the CDT1 ortholog in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, however, did not cause overt cohesin loading defects, arguing against that possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MacAlpine et al., 2010</xref>). It remains to be tested whether inactivation of the pre-RC selectively affects cohesin loading in early S phase in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract is a cell-free system that recapitulates the embryonic cell cycle, which lacks the G1 phase. Furthermore, there is no active transcription in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract. These differences provide possible explanations for the MCM2–7-dependent cohesin loading mechanism being predominant in that system. It will be interesting to test whether the mechanism of cohesin loading during telophase and G1 in human somatic cells involves loop extrusion and requires active transcription.</p><p>A further implication of our findings is that the MCM2–7-independent cohesin loading mechanism is attenuated in S phase. It is unclear how this is accomplished. An early study showed that the basal transcriptional activity is low in S phase, compared to early G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yonaha et al., 1995</xref>). It is conceivable that transcription is globally attenuated during S phase to avoid collisions between the replication and transcription machineries. This attenuation leads to less efficient cohesin loading through the transcription-dependent G1 pathway. MCM-dependent cohesin loading then becomes the dominant pathway during early S phase. Future studies are needed to test this possibility.</p><p>In the budding yeast, the association of cohesin with chromatin throughout the cell cycle is not affected when the pre-RC assembly is inhibited by Cdc6 inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Uhlmann and Nasmyth, 1998</xref>). The pre-RC is thus unlikely to be required for cohesin loading in yeast. Interestingly, the recruitment of Scc2/4 to yeast centromeres is dependent on the kinase activity of DDK during the G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinshaw et al., 2017</xref>). Scc2/4 interacts directly with the Ctf19 kinetochore protein phosphorylated by DDK, and this DDK-dependent interaction is required for centromeric cohesion in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinshaw et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, DDK-dependent cohesin loading might be conserved in all eukaryotes. Because Ctf19 is not conserved in vertebrates, SCC2/4 likely interacts with other DDK-mediated phospho-peptide motifs in MCM2–7 or DDK itself. Future studies are needed to define the detailed mechanisms of DDK-dependent recruitment of SCC2/4 and cohesin to MCM2–7.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mobilization of pre-loaded cohesin by SCC2/4 and replisome components</title><p>Our results and previously published reports clearly establish that the assembly of the active CMG helicase and the initiation of DNA replication are not required for MCM2–7-dependent cohesin loading at early S phase. Surprisingly, however, depletion of well-established replisome components, including WHDH1, TIMELESS, DDX11, and RPA, reduces the MCM–SCC2/4–cohesin interaction in thymidine-arrested early S phase cells. Preventing MCM2–7 activation by co-depletion of CDC45 partially alleviates the requirement for these replisome components in maintaining the MCM–SCC2/4–cohesin interaction.</p><p>It is widely accepted that there is an excess amount of MCM complexes loaded on chromosomes. Only a small pool of MCM complexes is activated to initiate and sustain DNA replication. DDK plays an important role in MCM activation. Using quantitative immunoblotting, we have determined that the molar ratio of total CDC7 (the catalytic subunit of DDK) to MCM2 is about 1:30 in HeLa cells. Thus, only 1 out of 30 MCM complexes can be bound by DDK at a given time. Our results suggest that only DDK-bound, potentiated MCM is capable of interacting with SCC2/4 and cohesin and supporting cohesin loading. This potentiated pool of MCM marked by DDK may be destined to fire first, converting the associated cohesin complexes into cohesive ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). After cohesin mobilization, DDK dissociates from these early origins and associates with MCM complexes at late-replicating origins. The processes of cohesin loading and mobilization then repeat at those origins. A large fraction of the pre-RC at early-replicating origins might have been activated to become active CMG in thymidine-arrested cells. SCC2/4 and cohesin remain associated with the active CMG, but this association now requires the actions of various replisome components. This additional requirement suggests that SCC2/4, cohesin, and DDK might interact with MCM2–7 in a different mode at active replication forks.</p><p>In WAPL-depleted human cells with little cohesin turnover, cohesin loaded prior to DNA replication can persist on chromatin throughout S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rhodes et al., 2017b</xref>), suggesting that the DNA replication machinery does not necessarily displace cohesin already bound to un-replicated DNA. Although the diameter of the fully stretched cohesin ring is about 40 nm, the functional pore size of DNA-bound cohesin is less than 19.5 nm, and cohesin can be pushed along DNA by a motor protein with a diameter of 13 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stigler et al., 2016</xref>). Being only a part of the DNA replication machinery, the CMG helicase has a cross-section of 11 nm in width and 17 nm in length, when viewed along the axis of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Georgescu et al., 2017</xref>). It is challenging for the entire replication machinery to pass through the cohesin ring without the stretching or transient opening of the ring. Indeed, cohesin can be pushed along DNA by the replication machinery in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kanke et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The simplest model to explain our results and the published reports is that cohesin loaded on un-replicated DNA and associated with the dormant MCM2–7 is mobilized upon MCM2-7 activation and transiently held at the active replication fork by SCC2/4, DDK, and other replisome components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Human MCM2 has been suggested to capture parental histones H3-H4 evicted by the replication fork and re-deposit them on the replicated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). Our proposed cohesin mobilization by MCM2–7 is conceptually similar to the mechanism of histone recycling by MCM2. This mobilization may involve the stretching of the cohesin ring or the opening and re-closure of the ring at one of its subunit interfaces.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cohesion establishment at the replication fork</title><p>Depletion of several replisome components reduces MCM2–7-dependent cohesin loading and the MCM–SCC2/4–cohesin interaction in cells arrested at early S phase, and causes interphase cohesion defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).

SCC2/4 then promotes the capture of a second DNA molecule by the fork-bound cohesin, thus establishing sister-chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Components required for Okazaki fragment maturation and ligation and histone deposition are dispensable for cohesion establishment, suggesting that cohesion establishment can occur prior to these events. Because RPA, the heterotrimeric single-stranded DNA-binding protein, is required for cohesion establishment, the capture of the second DNA molecule might involve single-stranded DNA and occur before the completion of lagging strand synthesis. This hypothesis is consistent with the recent in vitro study that demonstrates the Scc2/4-dependent capture of a second single-stranded DNA molecule by cohesin already bound to double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murayama et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Replisome components, including RPA, are required for proper DNA replication. Obviously, partial depletion of these components still permits DNA replication, minimally of the specific loci examined by FISH, thus revealing cohesion defect. On the other hand, we cannot exclude the possibility that aberrant DNA replication in cells deficient for these replisome components indirectly causes cohesion defects. Identification of separation-of-function mutants of replisome components that selectively disrupt cohesion establishment without perturbing DNA replication is needed to eliminate this caveat. Importantly, perturbation of DNA replication in and of itself is insufficient to trigger cohesion defect, as depletion of FEN1, LIG1, or CHAF1A interferes with DNA replication, but does not produce cohesion defect.</p><p>Depletion of WAPL rescues the cohesion defect caused by depletion of replisome components, suggesting that the replisome promotes cohesion establishment at least in part through antagonizing the anti-establishment activity of WAPL in human cells. WAPL needs to engage the scaffolding protein PDS5 to release cohesin from chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ouyang and Yu, 2017</xref>). SCC2/4 and PDS5 compete for cohesin binding and cannot simultaneously bind to cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kikuchi et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, cohesin bound to MCM–SCC2/4 is expected to be refractory to WAPL-dependent release. If replication-coupled, SCC2/4-dependent cohesin mobilization and deposition indeed allows the capture of the second DNA molecule, subsequent ESCO2-mediated SMC3 acetylation (also at the replication fork) may release SCC2/4 from cohesin, promote the binding of PDS5 and sororin to cohesin, and further stabilize sister-chromatid cohesion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have established MCM2–7-dependent cohesin loading as a conserved mechanism in vertebrates and possibly other multicellular organisms. Cohesin and its loader SCC2/4 (NIPBL/MAU2 in humans) remain physically associated with the activated MCM2–7 in a process that requires the kinase activity of DDK and replisome components. We propose cohesin loading at the pre-RC and subsequent SCC2/4-dependent cohesin mobilization at replication forks promote the establishment of sister-chromatid cohesion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mammalian cell culture, transfection, and synchronization</title><p>HeLa Tet-On cells were initially purchased from Clontech- (now Takara Bio USA, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and had been recently authenticated with STR profiling at ATCC (Manassas, VA). The cells were routinely monitored to make sure that they were free of mycoplasma contamination. HeLa Tet-On cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine. When cells reached a confluency of 50%, plasmid transfection was performed using the Effectene reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. All mammalian expression plasmids used in this study were derived from modified pCS2 vectors. The human MCM2, WDHD1, TIMELESS, and RPA2 cDNAs that contained silent mutations in the siRNA-targeted regions were inserted into these vectors that introduced HA or Myc tags at the N-terminus of the coded proteins. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The HeLa Tet-On cell line stably expressing RAD21-Myc was made as described previously (Wu et al., 2012). RAD21-Myc expression was induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline. For siRNA transfection, cells at 20–40% confluency were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocols, and analyzed at 24–48 hr after transfection. The siRNAs were transfected at a final concentration of 5 nM. The siRNAs used in this study were listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>For synchronization of cells at early S phase, cells were treated with 2 mM thymidine for 16–18 hr. For synchronization of cells at G2, cells were treated with the CDK1 inhibitor RO3306 at a final concentration of 10 µM for 18 hr. For immunofluorescence staining of cells in telophase, cells were treated with 2 mM thymidine for 16–18 hr and released into fresh medium containing 300 nM nocodazole (Sigma, Burlington, MA) for 12 hr to block cells at mitosis. Cells were then washed with PBS for three times and released into fresh medium for 4 hr.

FISH probes were labeled with 5-Fluorescein dUTP (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) using the Nick Translation Kit (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL). Probes were precipitated with human cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen) and salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen), and then resuspended in the hybridization solution (Cytocell, Tarrytown, NY). HeLa Tet-on cells were transfected with siRNAs, synchronized with 2 mM thymidine for 16–18 hr and then released into fresh medium for 4 hr.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrea Musacchio as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript centers on the role of the replisome in establishing sister chromatid cohesion during DNA replication. In a human cell line, the authors demonstrate that the replisomal factors MCM2-7 and DDK are critical in loading cohesin on the DNA during early S phase and a number of replisome-associated proteins are involved in retention of cohesion to DNA. The work reconciles a number of previous observation and establishes a detailed model for cohesion establishment in metazoans.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Subsection “Cohesin loading requires MCM2–7 in human cells during early S phase”, fourth paragraph, Figure 2B, C. The authors claimed that they determined the genome-wide distribution of MCM2, SCC2 and SCC1. However, the reviewer was not able to find data regarding the ChIP-seq of MCM2. In addition, the authors found that most of the SCC1 peaks were co-occupied by CTCF. Again, no data was reported on this and it was not clear whether they performed the genome-wide distribution of CTFC as well or if they used published data. Finally, was NGS data deposited in a public database?</p><p>Subsection “Replisome components promote the establishment of sister-chromatid cohesion”, first paragraph, Figure 4A. In order to examine cohesion status, the authors performed a FISH assay using a probe that specifically recognized a locus on chromosome 3. No information was provided on the replication status of that locus. In fact, it is well-known that almost 50% of genome is replicated early in S phase and the remaining 50% is replicated late. FISH experiments should be performed using two different probes (replicated early and late) at least in both unsynchronized and synchronized cells.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>1). The Introduction provides a succinct overview of a fast moving field. It is therefore important to cite current reviews of the field, several have recently been published, rather than ones that date back as far as 2002.</p><p>2) The Introduction surveys how cohesin is stabilized on DNA against unloading by WAPL. Three references from the authors' own lab are included, Ouyang et al., 2013, 2016 and 2017. While Ouyang et al., 2013 reported the structure of WAPL together with a proposal how WAPL opens the cohesin ring, Lopez-Serra et al. in the same year provided the first direct evidence for cohesin stabilization from WAPL by acetylation, which could be cited alongside.</p><p>3) 'Initial experiments in yeast showed that inactivation of the Scc2/4 complex in cells enriched in early S phase by hydroxyurea did not cause cohesion defect,… (Lengronne 2006).' That study was concerned with cell viability rather than a specific cohesion defect. Scc2 is not required to retain cell viability during S phase, though based on recent results from the Nasmyth and Uhlmann labs, it seems clear that cells develop a cohesion defect if Scc2 lacks in S phase that is compatible with viability. This could be rephrased.</p><p>4) Figure 1 shows MCM-depleted cells, arrested in early S phase by thymidine treatment. How is this possible? S phase arrest requires that replication initiates at least at some origins, so as to trigger the replication checkpoint. Following MCM depletion, the replication checkpoint would be inactive and cell cycle arrest no longer possible. Have potential cell cycle differences in this experiment been taken into account?</p><p>5) An important implication from this work is that cohesin maintenance on chromosomes in telophase and G1 is MCM-independent, but that it turns MCM-dependent during S phase. For cohesin to be lost from DNA during S phase, the telophase-G1 loading pathway must switch off. What might the basis for this be? Can the authors explore this in their Discussion?</p><p>6) Lower MCM levels during S phase lead to cohesin loss during DNA replication. However, the replisome must contain an MCM helicase for replication to proceed. Are the authors suggesting that MCM levels on top and above those required for DNA replication contribute to cohesin retention? This is a rather different interpretation of these results and this should be discussed.</p><p>7) 'We next determined the genome wide distribution of MCM2, SCC2/4 and cohesin…' This could be the beginning of a new paragraph.</p><p>8) The presentation of the ChIP experiment in Figure 2C could be improved. Is all the data centred on the Scc2 peaks? In this case, why is the average Scc2 peak, shown on top, off centre? How many Scc2 peaks are presented in both panels?</p><p>9) The Scc2 binding pattern in higher eukaryotes is still incompletely understood. The authors note that 'The majority of these SCC2 peaks were co-occupied by cohesin in two separate experiments, consistent with the notion that SCC2 remained bound to cohesin on chromatin'. Alternatively, Scc2 could demarcate cohesin loading sites to which cohesin is transiently recruited. It has been suggested that Scc2 occupies promoters (Kagey 2010, Lopez-Serra 2014, Zuin et al., 2014). Can the authors confirm or refute this based on their dataset? Can they say more about the detected Scc2 peaks?</p><p>10) Tittel-Elmer et al., 2012 found cohesin to colocalise with advancing DNA replication forks. If a similar assay is not possible to perform in human cells, this study could be cited.</p><p>11) Figure 3 and especially Figure 3—figure supplement 2B reports that phosphorylated MCM2 interacts with Scc2. This is based on the interaction with the faster migrating MCM2 form. This faster migration behaviour occurs rarely in case of phosphorylated proteins, so it would be good to confirm the band identities by phosphatase treatment.</p><p>12) Figure 3—figure supplement 4. The observation that GINS depletion does not affect cohesin loading is interesting. These are negative results. If the authors have a western blot or other functional confirmation for CDC45 or GINS depletion, this would be a suitable addition to this Figure.</p><p>13) The epistasis analysis of cohesion establishment factors in Figure 4B is confounded by potentially partial protein depletion by RNAi. Note that Scc2 depletion gives a relatively modest cohesion defect, which would be expected to result in no cohesion at all. RNAi of multiple components often results in further reduced depletion efficiency. Any conclusions about synthetic interactions, or lack thereof, should therefore be made cautiously. This also applies to the rescue of cohesion defects by WAPL depletion (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>14) The interesting observation that FEN1 and nucleosome assembly components have no detectable role in sister chromatid cohesion establishment is in line with results in budding yeast (Borges et al., 2013), which could be mentioned.</p><p>15) The authors suggest that RPA and other replisome components contribute to the MCM-SCC2/4-cohesin interaction indirectly through regulating DDK. This is an interesting result that goes towards the mechanism of cohesin-replisome interactions. To substantiate this point, it would be interesting to quantitatively compare CDC7 loss from MCM2 with cohesin loss from chromosomes and sister chromatid cohesion defects following depletion of different replisome components. Do these measures correlate and follow a quantitatively similar pattern?</p><p>16) Recently, it has been shown that MCM complex and cohesin co-IPed and shared a number of sites in both unsynchronized and synchronized cells. Furthermore, they are enriched at replication origins (Cucco et al., 2017 Nucleic Acids Res. Nov 20. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkx1172). These data should be discussed.</p><p>17) Figure 2. Inputs of CDC7 and MCM2 are lacking.</p><p>18) Figures 3B and 3F are confusing. They show the same data (with the exception of XL413). Can the authors arrange them into a single figure?</p><p>19) Figure 3F. Inputs of ESCO, SA2, SCC4, pMCM2 and MCM5 are lacking.</p><p>20) Since somatic cells were used, SMC1 should be SMC1A.</p><p>21) Gene nomenclature should be referred as human.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33920.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Subsection “Cohesin loading requires MCM2–7 in human cells during early S phase”, fourth paragraph, Figure 2B, C.

We did not observe many MCM2 peaks using MACS2, perhaps due to the rather broad localization of the MCM complex in early S phase cells. In the revised manuscript, we used a clustering approach called SICER to identify of MCM2 enriched domains. We could identify many such MCM2-enriched domains. When NIPBL (SCC2) peaks were used as the reference, these MCM2 domains and SCC1 peaks were found to co-localize with 1,041 NIPBL peaks. We did not perform ChIP-seq on CTCF. Homer de novo motif analysis revealed that the CTCF motif was the top DNA consensus sequence for RAD21 (SCC1) binding, with scores of 0.915 and 0.914 in two independent experiments. In addition, we can readily observe co-localization of RAD21 with CTCF in the human genome using the CTCF ChIP-seq data in the ENCODE database. These findings confirm that cohesin is enriched at CTCF sites. Because CTCF does not impair sister-chromatid cohesion, we reason that the pool of cohesin enriched at CTCF sites might be different from the pool that associates with NIPBL and MCM. These new analyses are included in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. The ChIP-seq data have been deposited into GEO (<underline>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112028</underline>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Replisome components promote the establishment of sister-chromatid cohesion”, first paragraph, Figure 4A.

Our 466L19 FISH probe included in the original submission recognizes the genomic region of Chr3, p24.3, 19050203-19251993. We have now included another 465K16 FISH probe that binds to the genomic region of Chr8, p11.21, 40659701-40853404. We first performed FISH assays with these probes in cells that were released from thymidine arrest at different times (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A). As cells progress through S phase, the percentage of cells with one or more pairs of FISH dots increases, even though the replication of the homologues is not completely synchronous in our assay. In HeLa cells with fully replicated loci, two pairs of dots could be detected with the 466L19 FISH probe, and three pairs of dots could be detected with the 465K16 probe. (Note that HeLa cells are aneuploid. They presumably contain three copies of the genomic locus on chromosome 8 recognized by the 465K16 probe.) Based on this assay, the genomic locus recognized by the 466L19 probe was replicated earlier as compared to that recognized by the 465K16 probe.</p><p>We observed similar cohesion defects in G2 cells depleted of Sororin,</p><p>WDHD1/TIMELESS, or RPA2 with the 465K16 probe that detects the late-replicating locus (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B, C). Likewise, depletion of FEN1 or LIG1 did not impair cohesion at the late-replicating locus recognized by the 465K16 probe. Additionally, we performed FISH experiments in asynchronized cells with both probes (Figure 6—figure supplement 3). We observed an increased number of cells that had completed replication in both genomic loci when Sororin, WDHD1/TIMELESS, or RPA2 was depleted in the absence of thymidine synchronization, consistent with the notion that depletion of these replication factors causes DNA damage and G2 delay under these conditions. For the 466L19 probe, only the cells with two pairs of FISH dots were analyzed, and the distances between paired FISH dots were quantified. For the 465K16 probe, only cells with two or three pairs of FISH dots were analyzed, and the distances between paired FISH dots were quantified. As expected, we observed cohesion defects in cells depleted of Sororin, WDHD1/TIMELESS, or RPA2, but not in cells depleted of FEN1 or LIG1 using both FISH probes. These new data with an additional FISH probe and in cells without synchronization are entirely consistent with and greatly strengthen our original conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>1).

While Ouyang et al., 2013 reported the structure of WAPL together with a proposal how WAPL opens the cohesin ring, Lopez-Serra et al. in the same year provided the first direct evidence for cohesin stabilization from WAPL by acetylation, which could be cited alongside.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight. The Lopez-Serra et al. study has now been referenced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) 'Initial experiments in yeast showed that inactivation of the Scc2/4 complex in cells enriched in early S phase by hydroxyurea did not cause cohesion defect,… (Lengronne 2006).' That study was concerned with cell viability rather than a specific cohesion defect. Scc2 is not required to retain cell viability during S phase, though based on recent results from the Nasmyth and Uhlmann labs, it seems clear that cells develop a cohesion defect if Scc2 lacks in S phase that is compatible with viability. This could be rephrased.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased this statement to more accurately describe the findings of the Lengronne study. We note, however, that the Lengronne study did specifically examine cohesion status. In that paper (on p789), the authors stated that “We further confirmed that sister chromatid cohesion was intact in scc2-4 cells that traversed S phase at restrictive temperature (8% cells with separated GFP-marked URA3 loci in G2/M, compared to 7% after release at permissive temperature).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1 shows MCM-depleted cells, arrested in early S phase by thymidine treatment. How is this possible? S phase arrest requires that replication initiates at least at some origins, so as to trigger the replication checkpoint. Following MCM depletion, the replication checkpoint would be inactive and cell cycle arrest no longer possible. Have potential cell cycle differences in this experiment been taken into account?</p></disp-quote><p>Depletion of the MCM complex in human cells did not apparently affect the early S phase arrest exerted by thymidine. As shown in Figure 5A, cells depleted of MCM2 treated with thymidine had a very similar cell cycle profile as compared to control depleted cells treated with thymidine. In the absence of thymidine, cells depleted of MCM2 for 48 hours ultimately arrested at G2. Thus, the depletion of MCM2 is partial, and does not completely block DNA replication. As we discussed, this partial depletion allows DNA replication to proceed (albeit less efficiently), thus revealing cohesion defects at the improperly replicated loci. To minimize complications from cell cycle differences, we performed cohesin immunostaining and immunoprecipitation under thymidine treatment conditions, which arrested cells depleted of various replication factors in early S phase (see Figure 5A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) An important implication from this work is that cohesin maintenance on chromosomes in telophase and G1 is MCM-independent, but that it turns MCM-dependent during S phase. For cohesin to be lost from DNA during S phase, the telophase-G1 loading pathway must switch off. What might the basis for this be? Can the authors explore this in their Discussion?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion. We do not know the nature of the telophase/G1 pathway of cohesin loading and the mechanism by which this pathway is inactivated during S phase. One possibility is that general transcription facilitates cohesin loading onto chromosomes in telophase and early G1, possibly through loop extrusion. An early study showed that the basal transcription activity was low in S phase, compared to early G1 (Yonaha et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1995). It is conceivable that transcription is globally attenuated during S phase to avoid collisions between the replication and transcription machineries. This attenuation leads to less efficient cohesin loading through the transcription-dependent pathway. MCM-dependent cohesin loading then becomes the dominant pathway during early S phase. Future studies are needed to test these possibilities. We have discussed this point in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Lower MCM levels during S phase lead to cohesin loss during DNA replication. However, the replisome must contain an MCM helicase for replication to proceed. Are the authors suggesting that MCM levels on top and above those required for DNA replication contribute to cohesin retention? This is a rather different interpretation of these results and this should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>It is widely accepted that there is an excess amount of MCM complexes loaded on chromosomes. Only a small pool of MCM complexes is activated to initiate and sustain DNA replication. DDK plays an important role in MCM activation. Using quantitative immunoblotting, we have determined that the molar ratio of total CDC7 (the catalytic subunit of DDK) to MCM2 is about 1:30 in HeLa cells. Thus, only 1 out of 30 MCM complexes can be bound by DDK at a given time. Our results suggest that only DDK-bound, potentiated MCM is capable of interacting with NIPBL and cohesin and supporting cohesin loading. This potentiated pool of MCM marked by DDK may be destined to fire first, converting the associated cohesin complexes into cohesive ones. DDK then associates with other MCM complexes at late-replicating origins. The processes of cohesin loading and mobilization then repeat at those origins. We have added a figure (Figure 7—figure supplement 1) and discussion to further clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) 'We next determined the genome wide distribution of MCM2, SCC2/4 and cohesin…' This could be the beginning of a new paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion. We have modified the text as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The presentation of the ChIP experiment in Figure 2C could be improved. Is all the data centred on the Scc2 peaks? In this case, why is the average Scc2 peak, shown on top, off centre? How many Scc2 peaks are presented in both panels?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this error. The figures in the original submission were actually made with the start of the SCC2 peaks aligned. We have now revised the figure with the center of the SCC2 peaks aligned. All SCC2 peaks (1,041 in Experiment 1 and 632 in Experiment 2) are included in the analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The Scc2 binding pattern in higher eukaryotes is still incompletely understood. The authors note that 'The majority of these SCC2 peaks were co-occupied by cohesin in two separate experiments, consistent with the notion that SCC2 remained bound to cohesin on chromatin'. Alternatively, Scc2 could demarcate cohesin loading sites to which cohesin is transiently recruited. It has been suggested that Scc2 occupies promoters (Kagey 2010, Lopez-Serra 2014, Zuin et al., 2014). Can the authors confirm or refute this based on their dataset? Can they say more about the detected Scc2 peaks?</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed the ChIP-seq data on NIPBL and annotated the genome-wide location of the NIPBL peaks in terms of genomic features. In both experiments, over 50% of NIPBL peaks were found at promoter regions. Our findings are thus in general agreement with the previous reports. We have included these data in Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Tittel-Elmer et al., 2012 found cohesin to colocalise with advancing DNA replication forks. If a similar assay is not possible to perform in human cells, this study could be cited.</p></disp-quote><p>We have cited and discussed the Tittel-Elmer study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 3 and especially Figure 3—figure supplement 2B reports that phosphorylated MCM2 interacts with Scc2. This is based on the interaction with the faster migrating MCM2 form. This faster migration behaviour occurs rarely in case of phosphorylated proteins, so it would be good to confirm the band identities by phosphatase treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>To confirm the faster migrating band is the phosphorylated MCM2, we treated the HeLa cell lysates with λPPase in vitro. The faster migrating band disappeared after λPPase treatment, confirming that the faster migrating band indeed belonged to phosphorylated MCM2. These results are now included in Figure 3C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 3—figure supplement 4. The observation that GINS depletion does not affect cohesin loading is interesting. These are negative results. If the authors have a western blot or other functional confirmation for CDC45 or GINS depletion, this would be a suitable addition to this Figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed immunoblotting to confirm that CDC45 or GINS1 protein levels were greatly reduced after depletion. Additionally, we observed an increased number of cells accumulated in S phase when either CDC45 or GINS1 was depleted, as revealed by the BrdU incorporation assay in asynchronized cells. The cells in S phase did not incorporate BrdU as efficiently as the control cells. These results indicate that depletion of CDC45 or GINS1 is efficient enough to slow S phase progression. We have added these data to this figure. Obviously, the depletion is still incomplete, as complete depletion is expected to complete block S phase progression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The epistasis analysis of cohesion establishment factors in Figure 4B is confounded by potentially partial protein depletion by RNAi. Note that Scc2 depletion gives a relatively modest cohesion defect, which would be expected to result in no cohesion at all. RNAi of multiple components often results in further reduced depletion efficiency. Any conclusions about synthetic interactions, or lack thereof, should therefore be made cautiously. This also applies to the rescue of cohesion defects by WAPL depletion (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree entirely with the reviewer about this point. We have toned down our conclusions about synthetic interactions and epistasis, and mentioned the caveat of partial depletions of various replisome components and WAPL.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The interesting observation that FEN1 and nucleosome assembly components have no detectable role in sister chromatid cohesion establishment is in line with results in budding yeast (Borges et al., 2013), which could be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now cited the Borges et al. study and mentioned the budding yeast data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) The authors suggest that RPA and other replisome components contribute to the MCM-SCC2/4-cohesin interaction indirectly through regulating DDK. This is an interesting result that goes towards the mechanism of cohesin-replisome interactions. To substantiate this point, it would be interesting to quantitatively compare CDC7 loss from MCM2 with cohesin loss from chromosomes and sister chromatid cohesion defects following depletion of different replisome components. Do these measures correlate and follow a quantitatively similar pattern?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. Inactivation of different replisome components led to reduced MCM2 phosphorylation at S53, impaired cohesin loading and cohesion defects to varying degrees. However, the MCM2 S53 phosphorylation levels did not appear to quantitatively correlate with the degrees of cohesion defects. It is possible that DDK sites other than S53 are functionally important. Alternatively, RPA and other replisome components directly contribute to NIPBL-cohesin binding. We have discussed this point more thoroughly in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Recently, it has been shown that MCM complex and cohesin co-IPed and shared a number of sites in both unsynchronized and synchronized cells. Furthermore, they are enriched at replication origins (Cucco et al., 2017 Nucleic Acids Res. Nov 20. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkx1172). These data should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have cited and discussed this recent study in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Figure 2. Inputs of CDC7 and MCM2 are lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>Because we had to blot many cohesin and replication components in many experiments, not all inputs are blotted in each experiment to save reagents. We hope that the reviewer will understand. Importantly, depletion of NIPBL, MAU2, or cohesin does not affect the total levels of CDC7 or MCM2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) Figures 3B and 3F are confusing. They show the same data (with the exception of XL413). Can the authors arrange them into a single figure?</p></disp-quote><p>These experiments were performed at different times. Not all blots are identical between these experiments. It will be difficult to combine them together into the same figure without splicing the gels. We wish to keep them separate and hope that the reviewer will understand. Certain repetition of data presentation might be beneficial to the readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) Figure 3F. Inputs of ESCO, SA2, SCC4, pMCM2 and MCM5 are lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the input lanes to this figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) Since somatic cells were used, SMC1 should be SMC1A.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have changed SMC1 to SMC1A in the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) Gene nomenclature should be referred as human.</p></disp-quote><p>We have used the proper human gene and protein nomenclature throughout the text and figures, with the exception of the Discussion and the model figures.
