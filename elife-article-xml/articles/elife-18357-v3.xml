proteasome dysfunction, mammalian cells upregulate proteasome gene expression by activating Nrf1. Nrf1 is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident transcription factor that is continually retrotranslocated and degraded by the proteasome. Upon proteasome inhibition, Nrf1 escapes degradation and is cleaved to become active. However, the processing enzyme for Nrf1 remains obscure. Here we show that the aspartyl protease DNA-damage inducible 1 homolog 2 (DDI2) is required to cleave and activate Nrf1. Deletion of DDI2 reduced the cleaved form of Nrf1 and increased the full-length cytosolic form of Nrf1, resulting in poor upregulation of proteasomes in response to proteasome inhibition. These defects were restored by adding back wild-type DDI2 but not protease-defective DDI2. Our results provide a clue for blocking compensatory proteasome synthesis to improve cancer therapies targeting proteasomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18357.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18357.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18357.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The proteasome is a machine that destroys unnecessary or damaged proteins inside cells. This role of the proteasome is essential for cell survival, and so when the proteasome is inhibited, cells produce new proteasomes to compensate. Upon proteasome inhibition, a protein called Nrf1 is activated and executes this “bounce-back” response. Some cancer treatments aim to kill cancer cells by inhibiting proteasomes, but these treatments may be unsuccessful if the bounce-back response is not also prevented. Therefore, understanding how Nrf1 is activated is an important issue.</p><p>Nrf1 is produced at a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum in cells and is continually destroyed by the proteasome. On the other hand, when proteasomes are inhibited, Nrf1 accumulates and is cleaved into an active form, which moves to the cell nucleus to start producing proteasomes. However, it was not known which molecule cleaves Nrf1.</p><p>Koizumi et al. set out to discover this molecule by screening the genetic material of human cells, and identified a gene that encodes a protease (an enzyme that cleaves other proteins) called DDI2. The loss of DDI2 from cells prevented Nrf1 from being cleaved and entering the nucleus, resulting in low levels of proteasome production. Further experiments showed that a mutant form of DDI2 that lacked protease activity was unable to cleave Nrf1, confirming DDI2’s role in activating Nrf1.</p><p>Deleting DDI2 from cells does not completely prevent the cleavage of Nrf1, and so some other cleaving enzyme might exist; the identity of this enzyme remains to be discovered. Future work is also needed to establish exactly how DDI2 cleaves Nrf1. This could help to develop a DDI2 inhibitor for cancer treatment that could be used in combination with existing proteasome inhibitors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18357.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18357.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>proteasome</kwd><kwd>Nrf1</kwd><kwd>protease</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25221102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murata</surname><given-names>Shigeo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26000014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murata</surname><given-names>Shigeo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murata</surname><given-names>Shigeo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Peptidase activity of DDI2 is required to activate Nrf1 in order to enable proteasome recovery in response to proteasome inhibition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteasome inhibition elicits a response to restore proteasome activity, or a 'bounce-back response,' where Nrf1 is the responsible transcription factor that upregulates expression of all proteasome subunit genes in a concerted manner in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Radhakrishnan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Steffen et al., 2010</xref>). Proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib and carfilzomib have been in clinical use for treatment of cancers, especially multiple myeloma, but this bounce-back response attenuates the ability of proteasome inhibitors to kill cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Radhakrishnan et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, genes regulating Nrf1 activation could be useful drug targets for increasing efficacy of proteasome inhibition in cancer treatment.</p><p>When Nrf1 is produced, the bulk of the polypeptide is inserted into the ER lumen and glycosylated, with a short cytosolic N-terminus followed by a single transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). The luminal region of Nrf1 is continually retrotranslocated to the cytosol by the p97/VCP ATPase complex, accompanied by deglycosylation and ubiquitination. Under normal circumstances, Nrf1 is promptly degraded by the proteasome. In contrast, when proteasome activity is compromised, Nrf1 escapes degradation and is proteolytically cleaved to the active form which enters the nucleus and enhances expression of target genes including proteasome subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Sha and Goldberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Steffen et al., 2010</xref>).

Our approach used the well-characterized subcellular localization of Nrf1 accumulation in the nucleus in response to proteasome inhibition. HEK293A cells were transfected with pooled siRNA (a pool of 4 unique siRNAs per gene) and then treated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib to induce accumulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Steffen et al., 2010</xref>). Cells were then fixed and stained with anti-Nrf1 antibody. The ratio of the nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescent intensities was assessed by high-content microscopy and automated image analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). p97 siRNA treatment served as a positive control, which abolished Nrf1 translocation following bortezomib treatment while increasing cytoplasmic Nrf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</xref>). We observed a high degree of assay robustness (Z’-factor &gt; 0.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) in the primary screen. The initial candidate genes with B score &lt; –3.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or which were picked up by visual inspection of the raw image data were further tested using four individual siRNAs in two different cell lines (HEK293A and HT1080 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Consequently, we obtained 14 candidate genes that may impair activation of Nrf1 in response to bortezomib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

In negative and positive (p97 siRNA) control cells treated with bortezomib, the majority of Nrf1 is localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). DDI2 knockdown partially inhibited nuclear translocation of Nrf1, accompanied by an increase in cytoplasmic Nrf1. To determine if there is a defect in Nrf1 processing by DDI2 knockdown, we examined which Nrf1 species were observed in each knockdown. In negative control cells, Nrf1 was hardly detected in the absence of bortezomib, but bortezomib treatment increased the processed, active form of Nrf1 as well as the full-length, cytosolic form that is retrotranslocated into the cytosol by p97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</xref>). In p97 knockdown cells, the luminal ER form of Nrf1 that is N-glycosylated accumulated while the processed form almost disappeared both in the presence and absence of bortezomib. In DDI2 knockdown cells, Nrf1 was not detected in the absence of bortezomib, similar to control cells. However, in the presence of bortezomib, the full-length, cytosolic form of Nrf1 markedly accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results indicate that DDI2 is involved in conversion of full-length, cytosolic Nrf1 to the processed, active form.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18357.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>DDI2 is involved in Nrf1 processing and translocation to the nucleus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of Nrf1 localization.

N-glycosylated Nrf1 accumulated in p97 knockdown cells was sensitive to endoglycosidase H (Endo H) treatment and the deglycosylated form migrated faster in SDS-PAGE, consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the full-length form of Nrf1 that is significantly accumulated in DDI2 knockdown cells was not sensitive to Endo H treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Note that bortezomib treatment alone causes some accumulation of Endo H-sensitive N-glycosylated Nrf1 and that the deglycosylated species was detected at almost the same molecular weight as the processed, active form of Nrf1 observed in cells treated with bortezomib alone, similar to previously reported observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</xref>). These results demonstrate that the form of Nrf1 accumulated in DDI2-depleted cells is not N-glycosylated, further supporting the role of DDI2 in the processing of Nrf1 rather than in deglycosylation or retrotranslocation.</p><p>The X-ray crystal structure analysis of the retroviral aspartyl protease (RVP) domain of budding yeast Ddi1p has revealed that it is a dimer with a similar fold to that of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease, with identical geometry of the double D[S/T]GA motif of the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Sirkis et al., 2006</xref>). The HIV-1 protease typically cleaves substrates between two hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Konvalinka et al., 2015</xref>). Nrf1 has been shown to be cleaved between Trp103 and Leu104 to become active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</xref>), which conforms with the cleavage motif by retroviral aspartyl proteases. Accordingly, we asked whether the protease activity of DDI2 is required for Nrf1 processing. DDI2 has a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) at the N-terminus and a RVP domain near the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Bortezomib treatment increased the processed form of Nrf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Knockdown of DDI2 reduced the processed form and increased full-length Nrf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This effect was rescued by introducing siRNA-resistant wild-type DDI2 but not a protease-dead DDI2 in which the active site aspartic acid 252 was replaced with asparagine (D252N). We also found that a DDI2 mutant lacking the UBL domain only partially restored the effect of DDI2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

In DDI2 knockout cells and DDI2 D252N knock-in cells, the full-length form of Nrf1 was accumulated upon bortezomib treatment, whereas the processed form was accumulated in wild-type DDI2 knock-in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results further support the requirement of DDI2 protease activity for Nrf1 activation.</p><p>We then examined whether a lack of the catalytic activity of DDI2 abolishes the 'bounce-back' response after proteasome inhibition. In parental HCT116 cells, bortezomib treatment caused an increase in mRNA levels of the proteasome subunit genes <italic>PSMA3</italic> and <italic>PSMB5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Knockout of DDI2 strongly suppressed this response, further supporting the importance of DDI2 in Nrf1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, the basal expression of proteasome subunits was also decreased in DDI2-deficient cells. In wild-type DDI2 knock-in cells, mRNA levels of the proteasome subunits were upregulated in response to bortezomib, similar to the parental cells. In contrast, DDI2 D252N knock-in cells did not undergo such a response, similar to DDI2 knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results suggest that the processing of Nrf1 by the aspartyl protease activity of DDI2 is required for upregulation of proteasome gene expression mediated by Nrf1 in response to proteasome inhibition.</p><p>Nrf1 has also been found to regulate basal expression of proteasome subunits, the extent of which varies between cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Lee et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2011</xref>). We observed that knockout and D252N DDI2 knock-in cells had significantly lower proteasome activity compared to wild-type DDI2 knock-in cells, suggesting that DDI2 is also involved in basal expression of proteasomes through its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we identified DDI2 as a protease that is required for Nrf1 processing and the bounce-back response induced by proteasome inhibition. However, there remain several questions to be answered. How can the involvement of DDI2 be reconciled with a previous report that demonstrated a defect in Nrf1 processing by strong inhibition of the proteasome, leading to the conclusion that the proteasome is the processing enzyme for Nrf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Sha and Goldberg, 2014</xref>)? In terms of substrate specificity, the cleavage site of Nrf1 (P1: W, P1’: L) does not seem to be a sequence preferred by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Toes et al., 2001</xref>); rather it conforms to a cleavage motif of RVP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Konvalinka et al., 2015</xref>). It could be that the proteasome activity is required for function of DDI2 or some other factors that is involved in Nrf1 processing. Related to this, the mechanism by which DDI2 acts as a Nrf1 processing protease remains unclear. DDI2 is not induced by bortezomib at either protein or mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, the subcellular localization of DDI2 seems to be unaffected by bortezomib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Since DDI2 is suggested to be active even when the proteasome activity is not compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>), a specific activation mechanism under proteasome impairment may not exist. An intriguing finding is that the UBL domain of DDI2 plays some role in Nrf1 processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). It has been shown that the UBL domain of Ddi1p is an atypical UBL that binds ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Nowicka et al., 2015</xref>). Binding of DDI2 with ubiquitinated proteins, possibly Nrf1 itself, would be promoted by proteasome inhibition and may facilitate Nrf1 processing by DDI2. Lastly, whether DDI2 directly cleaves Nrf1 remains unknown. We have tested a recombinant fragment of Nrf1 encompassing the processing site as a substrate for recombinant DDI2, but failed to detect its cleavage. Other factors might be required for in vitro reconstitution of Nrf1 processing by DDI2, such as substrate unfolding, co-activators of DDI2, and a set of specific experimental conditions. Understanding the mechanism by which DDI2 cleaves Nrf1 and establishing an in vitro assay for the enzymatic activity of DDI2 should provide useful information for developing a DDI2 inhibitor that would block compensatory proteasome synthesis to improve cancer therapies targeting proteasomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Genome-wide siRNA screening</title><p>In the primary screen, Dharmacon siGENOME SMARTpool siRNA library (GE Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) was used.

For each well, a mixture of 10 μL DMEM and 0.1 μL Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added. After 40 min incubation, 2000 cells/well of HEK293A cells were seeded. After 48 hr culture, bortezomib was added into each well to a final concentration of 10 nM. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA after 12 hr bortezomib treatment. Cells were then stained with Nrf1 antibody (sc-13031; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) and DAPI, and the fluorescent images were acquired and analyzed by CellInsight High Content Screening Platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The fluorescence signal ratio of the nucleus to the cytoplasm was used as a raw measured value. The value was fitted in a two-way median polish method to exclude positional effects in the 384-well plate, and then the B score was calculated on a per-plate basis using the following formula.<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">B</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>In the secondary screen, four individual siRNAs contained in the library were purchased from Dharmacon and used.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ivan Dikic as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Raymond J Deshaies (Reviewer #1) and Anne Bertolotti (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Koizumi et al. identifies DDI2 as a candidate enzyme that mediates the cleavage and activation of the transcription factor Nrf1 (NFE2L1). The manuscript starts with an unbiased genome-wide siRNA screen aimed at identifying genes important for Nrf1 activation. This yielded 14 candidate genes, including DDI2, which is known to have an aspartyl protease domain homologous to that of the HIV protease. Subsequent experiments demonstrated diminished nuclear localization and processing of Nrf1, and diminished induction of proteasome genes, in DDI2-deficient cells treated with proteasome inhibitor. It was also shown that the active site of DDI2 is required to promote processing of Nrf1 and bortezomib-induced expression of proteasome genes. The authors also showed that DDI2 can be targeted by inhibitors of HIV protease and that these inhibitors improve the efficacy of Bortezomib.</p><p>The findings presented in this manuscript are technically convincing and targeting the bounce-back response upon proteasome inhibition is indeed of importance at several levels: to improve our knowledge on the regulation of proteasome upregulation and to improve cancer therapies based on proteasome inhibition.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Did the authors attempt a protease protection experiment to examine the disposition of Nrf1 in DDI2-depleted cells? Based on the data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the authors conclude that Nrf1 has been retrotranslocated and deglycosylated in DDI2-depleted cells, but this is not formally proven. It is possible that DDI2 regulates Nrf1 in some other manner that is upstream of the processing step (e.g. retrotranslocation), and the MW shift occurs for some other reason other than deglycosylation. While this may be unlikely, it is certainly possible and should be commented.</p><p>2) Figure 4 is weak, and all reviewers felt that needs to be significantly improved or removed. This is not a point that is strictly necessary for the central finding of the paper that DDI2 is required for processing. The real question is whether it can be improved by additional data (see below) or should be removed from the current manuscript. For example, the effects in panel A are weak and would benefit from a titration to higher concentrations. Panel B is even weaker. Other groups have reported that there is some synthetic effect of combining proteasome inhibitors with HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. the Kraus and Driessen papers cited in the Results and Discussion). So, what is new about this figure? The big question is, what is the underlying mechanism? Is it really due to inhibition of DDI2? A couple of questions related to this experiment immediately come to mind. Are DDI2∆ cells, like NRF1∆ cells, more sensitive to bortezomib? Is the synthetic effect of combining bortezomib and NFV or LPV still observed in DDI2∆ cells? Is it observed in NRF1∆ cells? So we recommend to the authors to decide one of these two options related to Figure 4.</p><p>3) The authors have established DDI2 knock-out cells (DDI2 KO) and DDI2 KO cells in which the WT or protease-dead mutant DDI2 cDNA was knock-in to the DDI2 locus. It would be useful to analyse the processing of Nrf1 in these cell lines upon proteasome inhibition to complement the siRNA knocked down experiments.</p><p>4) The authors should discuss why both forms (FL and P) of Nrf1 are decreasing after co-treatment with bortezomib and lopinavir. Could it be due to cell death or off-target effect of this drug? Is lopinavir treatment alone also decreasing the levels of Nrf1?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18357.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) Did the authors attempt a protease protection experiment to examine the disposition of Nrf1 in DDI2-depleted cells?

While this may be unlikely, it is certainly possible and should be commented.</italic> </p><p>We examined whether the Nrf1 species accumulated in DDI2-depleted cells is deglycosylated using endoglycosidase H (Endo H), which removes N-linked glycosylation. In p97-depleted cells, the accumulated Nrf1 band was sensitive to Endo H treatment, consistent with the previous studies and indicating that the two bands correspond to glycosylated “G” and deglycosylated “DeG” forms of Nrf1. In contrast, the Nrf1 form “FL” accumulated in DDI2-depleted cells is not sensitive to Endo H treatment, indicating that this form is not glycosylated and that the “FL” form is a product after retrotranslocation. Curiously, the migration of “DeG” and “FL” does not correspond to each other. This phenomenon was also observed in a previous report, though the precise reason is yet unknown (Radhakrishnan et al. 2014). These results are newly added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and described in the third paragraph of the Results and Discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We also performed protease protection experiments to examine whether Nrf1 retrotranslocation was inhibited, but we were unable to obtain clear results. However, DDI2-depleted cells show accumulation of deglycosylated Nrf1, in contrast to p97-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). As deglycosylation of ER-associated degradation substrates are generally completed in the cytoplasm after retrotranslocation from the ER, this result suggests that Nrf1 is retrotranslocated in DDI2-depleted cells.</p><p> <italic>2) Figure 4 is weak, and all reviewers felt that needs to be significantly improved or removed.

So we recommend to the authors to decide one of these two options related to Figure 4.</italic> </p><p>We decided to remove Figure 4 from this manuscript after performing some experiments related to this figure. We examined bortezomib sensitivity of DDI2 knock-in and knock-out cells as well as Nrf1 knock-out cells. Although DDI2 knock-out cells tended to be more sensitive to bortezomib than DDI2 wild-type knock-in cells, the effect was not significant. Also, at least in our hands, Nrf1 knock-out, which has been shown to increase bortezomib sensitivity, did not confer significant sensitivity to bortezomib in HCT116 cells. As it is known that contribution of Nrf1 on proteasome expression depends on cell types, the results might not be generalized. We also examined whether a synergistic effect of bortezomib and LPV or NFV was observed in DDI2 knock-out or Nrf1 knock-out cells. The synergistic effect was slightly decreased but still observed in both cell lines. Thus, the HIV protease inhibitor could inhibit Nrf1 processing via DDI2 as suggested in our previous Figure 4B. However, since the decrease in the synergistic effect was so modest that we cannot conclude that synergistic cytotoxicity in combination treatment with bortezomib is mainly caused by Nrf1 or DDI2. Accordingly, we deleted sentences regarding Figure 4 in the revised manuscript.</p><p> <italic>3) The authors have established DDI2 knock-out cells (DDI2 KO) and DDI2 KO cells in which the WT or protease-dead mutant DDI2 cDNA was knock-in to the DDI2 locus. It would be useful to analyse the processing of Nrf1 in these cell lines upon proteasome inhibition to complement the siRNA knocked down experiments.</italic> </p><p>We examined Nrf1 processing in DDI2 knockout, DDI2 WT knock-in, and DDI2 D252N knock-in cells, and the result is newly inserted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. Defect of Nrf1 cleavage is observed in DDI2 knockout cells and DDI2 D252N knock-in cells as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, in which the cells were treated with DDI2 siRNA and transfected with D252N cDNA. This results support the idea that DDI2 is a processing enzyme of Nrf1.</p><p> <italic>4) The authors should discuss why both forms (FL and P) of Nrf1 are decreasing after co-treatment with bortezomib and lopinavir. Could it be due to cell death or off-target effect of this drug? Is lopinavir treatment alone also decreasing the levels of Nrf1?</italic></p><p>The decrease of Nrf1 after co-treatment with bortezomib and lopinavir is reproducible, but the reason is not clear. Cell death contributed to this result to some extent because co-treatment with bortezomib and 10 μM lopinavir caused cell death. However, Nrf1 was also decreased in combination treatment with bortezomib and 1 μM lopinavir, though cell death was not induced in this condition. This effect was not observed in co-treatment with bortezomib and nelfinavir, suggesting that this was an off-target effect of lopinavir. It is possible that lopiavir itself could decrease the amount of Nrf1. However, it was not confirmed because Nrf1 was hardly detected without proteasome inhibitor. As we decided to delete Figure 4, we did not include discussion regarding this point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
