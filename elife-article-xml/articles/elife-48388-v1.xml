The cellular morphology of trypanosomes is central to their motility, adaptation to the host’s environments and pathogenesis. However, visualizing the behaviour of trypanosomes resident in a live vertebrate host has remained unexplored. In this study, we describe an infection model of zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) with <italic>Trypanosoma carassii</italic>. By combining high spatio-temporal resolution microscopy with the transparency of live zebrafish, we describe in detail the swimming behaviour of trypanosomes in blood and tissues of a vertebrate host. Besides the conventional tumbling and directional swimming, <italic>T. carassii</italic> can change direction through a ‘whip-like’ motion or by swimming backward. Further, the posterior end can act as an anchoring site in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a vertebrate infection model that allows detailed imaging of trypanosome swimming behaviour in vivo in a natural host environment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48388.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Trypanosomes are one-celled parasites that cause the disease trypanosomiasis, which is also known as sleeping sickness. Trypanosomiasis is transmitted to humans and animals by a type of fly, known as tse-tse, which is commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa. A bite from the tse-tse fly transfers the trypanosome cells into the host’s bloodstream, where they spread from the blood to the internal organs and brain. This leads to a long-term illness, which can sometimes result in a coma and eventually death.</p><p>Once in the blood trypanosomes move around using a structure similar to an underwater propeller called the flagellum. How the trypanosomes move and behave in the blood determines how the infection will progress. Until now it has only been possible to observe trypanosomes in plastic dishes or in blood drawn from infected patients. However, neither of these settings mimic the conditions of the bloodstream, and it is currently impossible to look inside human hosts to watch how trypanosomes move.</p><p>To overcome this hurdle, Doro et al. infected zebrafish with <italic>Trypanosoma carassii</italic>, a close relative of the sub-Saharan trypanosomes that specifically infects fish. Zebrafish are transparent when young, making it possible to observe the parasite in the blood and tissues of live fish using a microscope.</p><p>Doro et al. noticed that <italic>Trypanosoma carassii</italic> cells adapt to different environments in the host by using different swimming techniques. For example, in small capillaries trypanosomes were dragged along with the blood flow, whilst in larger vessels, when blood flow was slow or there were fewer red blood cells, trypanosomes actively swam against the current. The parasites were also able to change direction by using their flagella in a ‘whip-like’ motion. Lastly, it was discovered that <italic>Trypanosoma carassii</italic> could rapidly attach to blood vessel walls using one end of its cell body, even when blood flow was strong. This behaviour may help the parasites escape from the bloodstream into the surrounding tissues, making the infection more dangerous.</p><p>Studying how trypanosomes infect zebrafish at this high level of detail provides new insights into how these parasites move and behave inside a host. An important question that remains to be answered, is how exactly the trypanosomes leave the bloodstream. A better understanding of the whole infection process may hint at new ways of fighting these deadly infections in future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Trypanosoma carassii</kwd><kwd>host-pathogen interaction</kwd><kwd>swimming behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PITN-GA-2011-289209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dóró</surname><given-names>Éva</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiegertjes</surname><given-names>Geert F</given-names></name><name><surname>Forlenza</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>022.004.005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacobs</surname><given-names>Sem H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transparent zebrafish reveals the reality of trypanosomes swimming in a vertebrate host, and their adaptations to an extremely heterogenic environment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Trypanosoma</italic> is a genus of flagellated protozoa, and most species proliferate in the blood and tissue fluids of their host. The best-known and most commonly studied trypanosomes are those that cause human diseases: Human African Trypanosomiasis caused by <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> and American Trypanosomiasis caused by <italic>T. cruzi.</italic> However, trypanosomes infect animals from all vertebrate classes, including warm-blooded mammals and birds as well as cold-blooded amphibians, reptiles and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simpson et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>African trypanosomes, such as <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, are exclusively extracellular and are continuously exposed to the innate, humoral and cellular immune systems. <italic>T. brucei</italic> has become a textbook example of antigenic variation based on low frequency switches of the expressed variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) that dominates the cell surface and allows the population to escape the host adaptive immune system. In addition, individual cell survival is favoured by a process that cleans the cell surface of low levels of bound immunoglobulins through endocytosis and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engstler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forlenza et al., 2009</xref>). Trypanosome motility is an integral part of this process as the hydrodynamic drag on antibody-VSG complexes, caused by the forward swimming motion of the cell, results in accumulation of the complexes at the posterior pole, close to the flagellar pocket, where endocytosis occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engstler et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, motility is essential for successful cell division, immune evasion and development in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Broadhead et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griffiths et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ralston et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimogawa et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In vitro studies using African trypanosomes have focused on the characterization of qualitative and quantitative parameters of trypanosome morphology and motility and emphasized the ability of trypanosome species to adapt to the various environments of their mammalian hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alizadehrad et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargul et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heddergott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krüger and Engstler, 2015</xref>). Thus far, detailed analysis of swimming behaviour, morphology and trypanosome-host cell interaction has been restricted to ex vivo, using conditions that best mimic the host environment, for example in blood taken from naïve or infected animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargul et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beattie and Gull, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engstler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heddergott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hemphill and Ross, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimogawa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skalický et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sunter and Gull, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wakid and Bates, 2004</xref>). It has not been feasible to recreate complex in vivo microenvironments, which, in the case of the vertebrate host, includes the streaming of the blood, vessels with heterogeneous size and endothelium composition, as well as changes occurring during the course of an infection, for example from the onset of anaemia. It still remains a challenge to mimic in vitro the dynamic conditions of the crowded and fast-moving bloodstream in which trypanosomes live. Given the importance of motility for trypanosome survival, analysis of trypanosome swimming behaviour in vivo, in a vertebrate host environment, is important to fully understand trypanosome biology and pathogenesis.</p><p>Quantitative and qualitative approaches in vivo are hindered by the lack of transparency of mammalian vertebrate hosts. Nevertheless, using transgenic trypanosomes expressing a luciferase reporter protein it has been possible to monitor overall trypanosome distribution and to quantify total trypanosome load in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burrell-Saward et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Capewell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goyard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McLatchie et al., 2013</xref>). Fluorescent trypanosomes have been used in vivo to visualize their presence in mouse skin, a possible reservoir of trypanosomes in the late phase of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Capewell et al., 2016</xref>). Although the sensitivity of both systems allows for indirect visualization of trypanosome location or distribution, low spatio-temporal resolution and the lack of transparency of deep tissues limits the possibility for qualitative and quantitative analysis of trypanosome swimming behaviour in vivo. Finally, using a combination of multicolour light sheet fluorescence microscopy and high-speed fluorescence microscopy it has been possible to analyse the infection process and swimming behaviour of <italic>T. brucei</italic> ex vivo, in dissected tissues of the partially transparent tsetse fly vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibson and Peacock, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schuster et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang and Belosevic, 1994</xref>). Nevertheless, to date, no method is available to study with sufficient resolution trypanosome swimming behaviour in vivo in a vertebrate host environment.</p><p>In the current study, we have used <italic>Trypanosoma carassii</italic> infection of zebrafish, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, to visualize trypanosome movement in the bloodstream and tissues of a vertebrate host. <italic>T. carassii</italic> infects a broad range of cyprinid fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Overath et al., 1998</xref>), is transmitted by blood-sucking leeches (i.e., <italic>Hemiclepsis marginata</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lom and Dyková, 1992</xref>), and lives extracellularly in the blood and tissue fluids of the fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haag et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lom and Dyková, 1992</xref>). <italic>T. carassii</italic> can establish a long-term infection characterized by polyclonal B cell activation and recurrent waves of parasitaemia, without expression of a uniform VSG-like surface coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agüero et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joerink et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Overath et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Overath et al., 1999</xref>). Phylogenetically, <italic>T. carassii</italic> belongs to the aquatic clade of Trypanosoma, a sister group that diverged from the Trypanosomatid lineage prior to the divergence of the Stercorarian and Salivarian trypanosomes that infect mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simpson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stevens, 2008</xref>). Morphologically, <italic>T. carassii</italic> isolated from fish has a single flagellum that emerges from the flagellar pocket at the cell posterior, is attached to the cell body and extends free at the anterior end, defining the anterior-posterior axis.</p><p>Zebrafish have been used as a model for developmental biology, as well as biomedical and neurobiology research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asnani and Peterson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blackburn and Langenau, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cronan and Tobin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goessling and North, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miyares et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nguyen-Chi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Phillips and Westerfield, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Renshaw and Trede, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schartl, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Torraca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Veinotte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zon and Cagan, 2014</xref>), and are a fresh water cyprinid fish closely related to many of the natural hosts of <italic>T. carassii.</italic> The great advantage of zebrafish is the transparency of the larvae, and of some juvenile and adult stages.

In this study, by combining <italic>T. carassii</italic> infection of transparent zebrafish with high-speed microscopy, we provide the first description of trypanosome swimming behaviour in vivo in a vertebrate host. Our observations reveal that trypanosomes can rapidly adapt their swimming behaviour to the heterogeneous host environments. It was not possible to assign one preferred swimming behaviour to trypanosomes in either the bloodstream, tissues or other body fluids. Conditions such as the presence or absence of the blood flow or of red blood cells, the speed of the flow, the size of the blood vessel, the type of endothelium or epithelium lining the vessels or the tissues, as well as the compactness of the tissues, all influenced the swimming behaviour. Furthermore, we show that trypanosomes can change direction through backwards swimming and through a ‘whip-like’ motion. Finally, we were able to capture a novel mechanism through which trypanosomes attach to host cells or tissues. These observations greatly expand our knowledge on trypanosome swimming behaviour and show that trypanosomes can rapidly adapt to match the host environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>elongation factor-1α (ef1a)</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>ZDB-GENE-990415–52</td><td>template for primers for RQ-PCR analysis</td></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Trypanosoma carassii</italic>)</td><td><italic>heat-shock protein-70</italic> (<italic>hsp70</italic>)</td><td>NA</td><td>GeneBank-FJ970030.1</td><td>template for primers for RQ-PCR analysis</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>)</td><td>Wild type common carp, R3xR8 strain</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.03.037">doi:10.1016/0044-8486(95)91961 T</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td>Wild type zebrafish, AB strain</td><td>European Zebrafish <break/>Resource Center (EZRC)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ezrc.kit.edu/index.php">https://www.ezrc.kit.edu/index.php</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td>casper strain</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">White et al.

Trypanosomes in blood were imaged immediately or blood was kept at 4°C overnight in siliconized tubes. The following morning, trypanosomes were enriched at the interface between the red blood cells and plasma, and this buffy coat was recovered and centrifuged at 600xg for 8 min at room temperature. Trypanosomes were resuspended in RPMI without L-glutamine and phenol red (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium). To separate trypanosomes from red blood cells, the suspension was loaded on top of a 100% Ficoll-Paque layer (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and centrifuged at room temperature for 20 min, at 800xg. Cells at the interphase were transferred to a new 50 mL tube and washed with RPMI. Trypanosomes were then resuspended at a density of 5 × 10<sup>5</sup>–1×10<sup>6</sup>/mL and cultured in 75 or 165 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks in complete medium: 22.5% MEM with L-glutamine and phenol red (Gibco), 22.5% Leibovitz’s L-15 medium without L-glutamine, with phenol red (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium), 45% Hanks’ Balanced Salt solution (HBSS) with phenol red (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium), 10% sterile water, completed with 10% pooled carp serum, 2% 200 mM L-glutamine (Fisher Scientific) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (10.000:10.000, Fisher Scientific).

PVP was used to increase the viscosity of the medium to ensure a homogenous trypanosome solution throughout the injection period. Trypanosome number in 1–2 nL drop size varied depending on the intended dose and was monitored at the beginning and after 50 injections using a Bürker counting chamber. Prior to injection, 5 dpf zebrafish larvae were anaesthetized with 0.017% ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate (MS-222, Tricaine, Sigma-Aldrich) in egg water, and injected intravenously.

Injected larvae were directly transferred into pre-warmed egg water and kept in the incubator at 27°C. Viability was monitored daily. During the course of the optimization of the infection model, we noticed that some fish displayed lethargic behaviour and no escape reflex to a pipette, such fish usually had a high parasitaemia leading to death. These clinical signs were therefore used to monitor morbidity and the progression of infection.

Remarkably, despite the strong blood flow, attachment (anchoring) could last for several seconds (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>, 0 - 01:11 min) and involved a small area of the posterior end of the trypanosome, leaving the cell body and the flagellum free to move (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>, 01:11 - 01:59 min).

By combining the transparency of zebrafish larvae with high spatio-temporal resolution microscopy, we were able to describe in detail the in vivo swimming behaviour of <italic>T. carassii</italic> in blood, tissues and tissue fluids of a vertebrate host. In addition to non-directional tumbling and directional forward swimming, we also describe how in vivo trypanosomes can reverse direction through a ‘whip-like’ motion or by swimming backwards. Finally, we report a novel observation that the posterior end of <italic>T. carassii</italic>, possibly coinciding with the flagellum base or flagellar pocket’s neck, can act as an anchoring site. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the swimming behaviour of trypanosomes in vivo in a vertebrate host environment.</p><p>Knowledge of trypanosome-host cell interaction, movement, and tropism in vertebrate hosts is important to understand trypanosome biology and pathology. To date, detailed analysis of trypanosome swimming behaviour and interaction with vertebrate host cells has only been possible using isolated blood or conditions that best mimic those of the host blood or tissues. Although the current in vitro approaches have brought a wealth of information on the quantitative aspects of trypanosome motility and potential immune evasion strategies, they could not fully reproduce the streaming nature of the blood, the heterogeneity of the bloodstream between and within vessels, the different sizes of blood vessels between which trypanosomes regularly alternate, the different types of endothelium lining arteries and veins and, finally, the changes that occur in the blood caused by the infection itself.</p><p>In this study, we first investigated the motion of <italic>T. carassii</italic> in infected carp blood. Based on previously proposed descriptions of the swimming behaviour of salivarian trypanosomes in mouse blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargul et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimogawa et al., 2018</xref>), clearly more than 90% of <italic>T. carassii</italic> could be classified as tumblers, and this was independent of whether they were in whole blood, diluted in serum or culture medium. Our observations are in agreement with a previous study reporting that directional persistent swimming was not a prominent feature of <italic>T. brucei</italic> in whole blood from an immunocompetent infected mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimogawa et al., 2018</xref>), but are in contrast to the study by Bargul and colleagues in which up to 30% persistent swimmers and 45% intermediate swimmers could be observed in blood films from immunosuppressed infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargul et al., 2016</xref>). Differences in <italic>T. brucei</italic> strains, host immune status as well as the use of whole blood or blood films may account for the observed discrepancies. Nevertheless, both studies could not reproduce the streaming of the blood and, thus, the observations were made under static conditions.</p><p>Our initial in vitro observations led to the suggestion that the tumbling behaviour might be an intrinsic property of <italic>T. carassii</italic> in the bloodstream. However, our subsequent in vivo observations showed that this applies only to trypanosomes swimming in fluids with highly reduced or absent flow, for example the peritoneal fluid or blood in vessels in which the flow was slow or absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>). In contrast, analysis of the swimming behaviour of <italic>T. carassii</italic> in the zebrafish bloodstream revealed that it is not possible to assign a single or predominant swimming behaviour. In vessels with a normal blood flow and in the presence of red blood cells, trypanosomes were dragged passively by the flow along with red blood cells. In the centre of large vessels, such as the cardinal artery or cardinal vein, the velocity of the flow does not allow either tumbling or directional swimming against or faster than the flow. Similarly, in narrow iISCs, trypanosomes are forced to move forward because of streaming of the blood or the presence of colliding red blood cells. Under these conditions, trypanosomes were never seen swimming faster than the passive movement of red blood cells as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heddergott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langousis and Hill, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, because trypanosomes are carried along with red blood cells by the flow, it is difficult to envisage how the red blood cells could represent anything more than very occasional obstacles or surfaces for mechanical interactions that would favour forward swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargul et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heddergott et al., 2012</xref>). At the periphery of the cardinal vein, there is a cell-free layer where the number of red blood cells and the speed of the blood flow is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagchi, 2007</xref>). Here, trypanosomes could clearly slow themselves down by crawling, rolling or by temporarily anchoring themselves to the dorsal endothelium (further discussed below). However, in arteries or small capillaries, adherence to the epithelium was never observed, even when the flow was reduced or completely absent. This suggests that not only the velocity of the flow but also the type of endothelium influences trypanosome swimming behaviour.</p><p>Physiological changes occur as the infection progresses that modify conditions within blood vessels. The flow is strongly reduced or interrupted and the density of red blood cells is reduced by obstruction of blood vessels or anaemia. In these conditions, directional swimmers were observed that swam faster than the flow and others that swam against the flow, or that repeatedly changed direction within blood vessels (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Taken together, our observations show that it is not possible to generalize the swimming behaviour of trypanosomes in blood as they can rapidly adopt different swimming behaviours: tumbling, directional swimming or anchoring. These behaviours are all largely influenced by the size and type of vessel, the speed of the flow, the presence, or not, of red blood cells as well as the highly dynamic microenvironment within a vessel, for example the centre compared to the periphery, and the type of endothelium.</p><p>Outside of the blood, it has been suggested that the directionality of swimming is influenced by the density or compactness of the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargul et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wheeler et al., 2013</xref>). Our observation of swimming behaviour in various tissues revealed that it is the size of the interstitial space through which the trypanosome has to swim that largely determines whether it will swim directionally, tumble or both. For example, within the compact tissue of the fins, where the space below epithelial cells is very narrow (mesenchyme) and the basement membrane is not deformable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mateus et al., 2012</xref>), the vast majority of trypanosomes swim directionally. This observation is in agreement with the swimming behaviour described for procyclic forms of <italic>T. brucei</italic> swimming through microfluidic devices smaller than their maximum cell diameter, mimicking potential size-limiting environments within host tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). In zebrafish fins, the space can be so restrictive that to invert direction the trypanosome is obliged to swim backwards (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). Backward swimming was previously observed in vitro or ex vivo for <italic>T. brucei</italic> motility mutants or for wild type trypanosomes swimming in high-density medium or in whole blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargul et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baron et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Branche et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engstler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heddergott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimogawa et al., 2018</xref>), and ex vivo for procyclic and mesocyclic stages of <italic>T. brucei</italic> parasites swimming in confined spaces within the midgut of the tsetse fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schuster et al., 2017</xref>). The observation of <italic>T. carassii</italic> swimming in zebrafish tissues is the first report of backward swimming in a vertebrate host environment.</p><p>In the less compact areas of the fins or in the tissue lining the blood vessels, in addition to directional swimmers (forward or backwards), tumblers and trypanosomes that repeatedly inverted direction through a whip-like motion were observed (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>). When directional swimmers reached dead ends, the persistent forward swimming translated into either a drilling movement similar to the movement described for <italic>T. brucei</italic> in dead-end spaces within the midgut of the tsetse fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schuster et al., 2017</xref>), or backwards swimming as observed in the fins. Altogether, these observations indicate that trypanosomes can adopt several swimming behaviours and that these are largely influenced by the compactness and confinement offered by the tissue.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most interesting observations is the discovery that trypanosomes can anchor themselves to the vein endothelium by their posterior end, leaving the flagellum and the entire cell body free to move. Anchoring was observed as soon as 30 min to 1 h after <italic>T. carassii</italic> injection into zebrafish larvae, and by 1 dpi extravasation was observed. Under the current conditions, it was not possible to ascertain whether this adhesion mechanism favours or is even required for extravasation. So far, we have been unable to capture the exact moment of extravasation.</p><p>The anchoring site on the posterior of the trypanosome leaves the cell body and flagellum free to move (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>), so it seems likely that the adhesion on the trypanosome occurs via the flagellum base or the neck of the flagellar pocket itself. The presence of specific adhesion molecules would at least partly explain how <italic>T. carassii</italic> can very rapidly anchor themselves, upon sudden collision with the endothelium, and remain in position for more than 15 s despite the very rapid blood flow and collisions with blood cells. Anchoring was only observed in the cardinal vein but trypanosomes were seen crawling on vein endothelium (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>) through dynamic interactions that involved the cell membrane, not just the flagellum membrane, suggesting that the molecules required for whole-cell adherence might be different from those required for anchoring through the posterior end. This is reminiscent of leukocyte rolling, which also occurs only in veins and not in arteries. Altogether, the possibility to observe <italic>T. carassii</italic> behaviour both in vitro and in vivo, in the presence or absence of a strong hydrodynamic flow, and at various locations within the vertebrate host, demonstrated how the environmental conditions, especially the presence or absence of a flow, strongly influence the ability of the trypanosome to attach and the duration of the attachment.</p><p><italic>T. carassii</italic> anchors to zebrafish cells in a manner clearly distinct from that described for other trypanosomes. The major difference being the lack of extensive interaction between the trypanosome’s flagellum membrane and the host cell or artificial surface. Stable interaction involving large portions of the flagellum membrane has been described among others for haptomonads stages (surface-attached) of <italic>Paratrypanosoma confusum</italic>, or <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skalický et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wakid and Bates, 2004</xref>). In these liberform parasites (flagellum not laterally attached to the cell), adhesion occurs through an attachment pad forming from the bulge at the base of the flagellum. At least in vitro, the formation of the pad takes approximately 1 h, causing extensive remodelling of the flagellum itself, and effectively anchors the parasites to the surface, and in the case of <italic>P. confusum</italic>, also favours their division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skalický et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, <italic>T. brucei</italic> epimastigotes divide while attached to the brush border of the salivary gland epithelium through extensive outgrowths of the non-cell-attached anterior part of the flagellum membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beattie and Gull, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langousis and Hill, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schuster et al., 2017</xref>). Such an adhesion mechanism was only recently captured ex vivo through high-speed videography of dissected tsetse fly salivary glands; however, the exact moment of attachment and the time required to establish the stable interaction in vivo were not reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schuster et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>T. congolense</italic> was reported to adhere in vitro to bovine aorta endothelial (BAE) cell monolayers via extensive membrane protrusions (filopodia) of the membrane-attached flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beattie and Gull, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hemphill and Ross, 1995</xref>), an interaction that was shown to involve sialic acid residues on BAE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hemphill et al., 1994</xref>). Although adhesion was observed already at 1 h, the filopodia increased in size over a period of 24–48 h. Whether such a type of interaction occurs with similar kinetics also in vivo, in vessels with an intact blood flow, is yet to be confirmed.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48388.026</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Schematic drawing depicting the attachment of various trypanosome species.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Haptomonads stages of <italic>Paratrypanosoma confusum</italic>: adhesion occurs through an attachment pad forming from the bulge at the base of the flagellum involving extensive remodelling of the flagellum membrane (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skalický et al., 2017</xref>).

They all involve extensive modifications of the flagellum membrane that occur over time to increase the contact area between the (para)trypanosomes and the surface. Most of these interactions, however, were observed in vitro for (para)trypanosomes cultivated on glass or plastic surfaces or endothelial cell monolayers and studied by means of scanning or transmission electron microscopy, as well as in vitro binding assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beattie and Gull, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hemphill and Ross, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hemphill et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skalický et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vickerman, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wakid and Bates, 2004</xref>). Therefore, to what extent the kinetics of interaction and the size of the contact area described also apply to the more dynamic in vivo environment is yet to be ascertained. The interactions between <italic>T. carassii</italic> and zebrafish cells were limited to the tip of the posterior end of the trypanosome body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>), leaving the entire flagellum and trypanosome cell body free to rapidly move (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Despite the small surface involved, anchoring occurred very rapidly, suggesting a very strong, yet dynamic, type of interaction, the duration of which was influenced by the presence or absence of a strong hydrodynamic flow as well as colliding red blood cells. Given the in vivo dynamic conditions within a blood vessel, it seems unlikely that <italic>T. carassii</italic> would establish stable interactions that involve large portions of the trypanosome cell surface, as for example described in vitro for <italic>T. congolense</italic>. We were unable to determine whether the anchoring area of <italic>T. carassii</italic> corresponds to the flagellum base, flagellar pocket neck or to the cell body membrane. Nevertheless, because <italic>T. carassii</italic> adherence to red blood cells and to glass surfaces was also observed in vitro, it will be possible to investigate the adhesion mechanism at high resolution in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, we describe here for the first time the swimming behaviour of a trypanosome in vivo in the natural environment of a vertebrate host. We report the complex and heterogeneous environment in which the trypanosomes reside and how this highly influences the swimming behaviour. We describe how it is not possible to assign specific behaviours to trypanosomes swimming in any of the host compartments, as the trypanosomes were extremely effective in rapidly adapting their motion to the highly dynamic host environment. We describe backward swimming and whip-like movements that allowed trypanosomes to invert direction as well as identifiedying the posterior end as a novel anchoring site that allows the cell to adhere to host cells in a manner different from those described to date for other trypanosomes. Altogether, establishment of the <italic>T. carassii</italic> zebrafish infection model in combination with the genetic tractability of the zebrafish and of trypanosomes, represent a unique possibility to address questions related to: 1) trypanosome swimming behaviour in vivo in the natural environment of a vertebrate host, 2) host-pathogen interaction, 3) trypanosome biology, 4) the effect of specific immune factors on the progression of the infection, 5) the effect of drugs on both the trypanosome and the host, and 6) immune evasion strategies of trypanosomes that do not present antigenic variation. For all these reasons, the <italic>T. carassii</italic>-zebrafish model holds the promise to become a valuable complementary model to those currently available, to study the complex biology of trypanosomes and their interaction with the vertebrate host.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank the CARUS-ARF Aquatic Research Facility of Wageningen University for fish rearing and husbandry.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: All animals were handled in accordance with good animal practice as defined by the European Union guidelines for handling of laboratory animals (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ chemicals/lab_animals/home_en.htm).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Visualising trypanosomes in a vertebrate host reveals novel swimming behaviours, adaptations and attachment mechanisms&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this is a very interesting paper that for the first time describes trypanosome movements within a vertebrate host. One reviewer said &quot;It addresses an important problem, is innovative, rigorous, and produces important and foundational results. The text is well-written and results mostly well-supported&quot;. Another said &quot;The word &quot;descriptive&quot; is often used in a pejorative sense by reviewers to kill a manuscript. This manuscript is almost purely descriptive; nevertheless it serves as a timely reminder that precise observation and description can be of great value.&quot;</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– Introduction section: The authors cite several papers as having studied trypanosomes in blood from an infected animal. Many of these however, use blood, but not from infected animals. Text could be corrected by saying blood &quot;…from naive or infected animal…&quot;. Also, a recent paper (Shimogawa et al., 2018 – cited elsewhere in the manuscript) should be included here, as this work does study parasite movement in blood from an infected animal.</p><p>– Subsection “Characterization of trypanosome swimming behaviour in vitro” –, regarding classification of &quot;swimming behavior&quot;. The term &quot;tumbling swimmers&quot; does not fit the data/description, because &quot;non-directional movement&quot; doesn't involve 'swimming'. Also, many video captions use the term &quot;tumbler&quot; (see e.g. Video 1, title). Finally, based on the data and descriptions provided (e.g. multiple videos, and elsewhere), it seems that the cells are either swimming (directional movement), tumbling (non-directional movement), or alternating between these two states. Therefore, I would recommend &quot;persistent swimmers&quot;; &quot;persistent tumblers&quot; (or simply &quot;tumblers&quot;); and &quot;intermediate swimmers&quot;</p><p>– Cell morphology is not an appropriate aspect to be used in assigning swimming classification. Two reasons: 1) the classification is about swimming, not morphology; 2) Tumblers can be seen to have a &quot;stretched-out&quot; cell body form, e.g. one can see frames within Video 1 of &quot;tumbling&quot; cells showing a stretched out form. (bottom right cell in 'tumbler' section at 0:00:20 of Video 1; middle/left cell in 'tumbler' section at 0:00:25 of Video 1).</p><p>– This is a bit of a nuance, but please also distinguish shape (e.g. circle or square) vs form/morphology (e.g. sphere or cube), in description of cell appearance.</p><p>– Figure 1 and various places in text: I don't think it is accurate or appropriate to ascribe a &quot;speed&quot; to tumbling cells. In Video 1 for example, the tumblers shown may exhibit displacement of one point of the cell over time, but ascribing 'speed' to this is not analogous to 'speed' ascribed to movement of the cell as a whole in persistent swimmers.</p><p>– Discussion second paragraph: should keep this to “vertebrate” host, because description in vivo with tsetse fly cells has been described.</p><p>– Discussion third paragraph: Recent work, Shimogawa et al., 2018, should be cited also, as that is distinguished by using infected blood from immunocompetent mice, and thus is distinguished from the also important Bargul work. Furthermore, the shimogawa studies find that, as in the current study, persistent swimmers are relatively rare.</p><p>– Given the extended attention given to the observation that parasite movement is impacted by movement on tissue surfaces, e.g. fin and tail, some reference to studies examining parasite motility on surfaces should be provided.</p><p>– Subsection “Characterization of trypanosome swimming behaviour in vitro”: The statement that trypanosomes move backward &quot;without using the propelling motion of the flagellum.&quot; is not supported. In the video referred to, the backward movement is almost certainly due to the propelling motion of the flagellum, i.e. a base-to-tip beat that drives cell movement with the base of the flagellum leading. A similar 'backward' motility has been described on numerous occasions for T. brucei.</p><p>– &quot;whip-like&quot; movement. This is described as something novel but appears to be very similar to rapid flagellum tip movements described previously, e.g. Rodriguez et al., 2009. The impression that this is a novel movement, in the first paragraph of the Discussion, should omitted.</p><p>– Backward motility. The implication that backward motility is something not describe previously, e.g. in the first paragraph of the Discussion, should be omitted. Likewise, related in paragraph four, please note that backward motility has been reported not just for mutants, but also for WT cells ex vivo, e.g. Bargul et al., 2012; Shimogawa et al., 2018.</p><p>– One reviewer requested that the authors to put some gallery of images of selected time frames in addition to the videos. This could ideally guide the reader's eye while reading.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48388.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– Introduction section: The authors cite several papers as having studied trypanosomes in blood from an infected animal.

In Video 1 for example, the tumblers shown may exhibit displacement of one point of the cell over time, but ascribing 'speed' to this is not analogous to 'speed' ascribed to movement of the cell as a whole in persistent swimmers.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that indeed speed is not analogous for the two types of cell, nevertheless, we wanted to describe that tumblers are very mobile cells and looked for a way to quantify such motility. Speed of tumblers was reported previously in at least two papers (Heddergott et al., 2012; Bargul et al., 2016), and given the availability of high-speed videos that allowed us to accurately follow the displacement of the posterior end of <italic>T. carassii</italic> in space and time, we would like to keep the description of speed to reflect their mobility.</p><p>Nevertheless, to clarify to the reader the difference between the speed of tumblers and that of directional swimmers, we have revised the main text and the legend of Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Discussion second paragraph: should keep this to “vertebrate” host, because description in vivo with tsetse fly cells has been described.</p></disp-quote><p>The text has been revised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Discussion third paragraph: Recent work, Shimogawa et al., 2018, should be cited also, as that is distinguished by using infected blood from immunocompetent mice, and thus is distinguished from the also important Bargul work. Furthermore, the shimogawa studies find that, as in the current study, persistent swimmers are relatively rare.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion, indeed we missed this important observation in the study. The reference has been added and further elaborated upon in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Given the extended attention given to the observation that parasite movement is impacted by movement on tissue surfaces, e.g. fin and tail, some reference to studies examining parasite motility on surfaces should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of any study specifically studying or visualizing trypanosome swimming behaviour on surfaces mimicking the conditions present in the tissue of its host. We refer however to the study by Schuster et al., 2017 studying swimming behaviour of <italic>T. brucei</italic> in various compartments of the Tsetse fly.</p><p>Two additional studies used micropillars and microfluidic assays to investigates how bloodstream forms (Bargul et al., 2016) or procyclic forms (Sun et al., 2018) of trypanosomes would swim between obstacles or through orifices smaller than their maximum diameter. Although the study by Bargul used pillars to simulate the distance between red blood cells, RBC are not static objects and thus the pillars system mimics better the situation in a tissue than in the blood. The study by Sun uses insect procyclic stages and indeed predicted very well the ability of trypanosomes to penetrate very compact tissues and to swim directionally.</p><p>Last but not least we also referred already to the in vitro study reporting adherence of <italic>T. congolense</italic> to bovine aorta endothelial cells (Hemphill at al., 1995).</p><p>All above mentioned studies are now better integrated in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “Characterization of trypanosome swimming behaviour in vitro”: The statement that trypanosomes move backward &quot;without using the propelling motion of the flagellum.&quot; is not supported. In the video referred to, the backward movement is almost certainly due to the propelling motion of the flagellum, i.e. a base-to-tip beat that drives cell movement with the base of the flagellum leading. A similar 'backward' motility has been described on numerous occasions for T. brucei.</p></disp-quote><p>The sentence &quot;without using the propelling motion of the flagellum&quot; has been removed from Video 2 and the corresponding main body text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;whip-like&quot; movement. This is described as something novel but appears to be very similar to rapid flagellum tip movements described previously, e.g. Rodriguez et al., 2009. The impression that this is a novel movement, in the first paragraph of the Discussion, should omitted.</p></disp-quote><p>Supplementary movie 6 in the study by Rodriguez describes how bloodstream forms exhibit frequent and rapid swings of the flagellar tip and emphasizes the flexibility of the cell body. In our opinion, such movement is very similar to that of tumblers captured in Video 1 in our study, where trypanosomes can be seen ‘swinging’ very rapidly the flagellum and frequently ‘making contact’ with neighbouring RBC, although we think such contact mostly occurs randomly.</p><p>The ‘whip-like’ movement we describe is distinct from the above mentioned one since the ‘whip-like’ movement is used by trypanosomes in vivo to pin themselves, turn in a 3D motion and invert direction. The 3D motion combines the swing of the flagellum along one plane (similar to the one observed for tumblers on a glass surface in our study or the Rodriguez study), accompanied by a 180° rotation of the cell body along a 3<sup>rd</sup> axis. This is indeed possible only in vivo where the cylindrical form of a capillary or interstitial space within a tissue, allow the parasite to move in three dimensions. In fact, we never observed a ‘whip-like’ movement during our in vitro observations, possibly due to the 2-D constraints of the surface.</p><p>To further clarify this to the reader we have amended the text as well as modified Figure 8C (previously 7C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Backward motility. The implication that backward motility is something not describe previously, e.g. in the first paragraph of the Discussion, should be omitted. Likewise, related in paragraph four, please note that backward motility has been reported not just for mutants, but also for WT cells ex vivo, e.g. Bargul et al., 2012; Shimogawa et al., 2018.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion, we wanted to emphasize that backward swimming was not described previously in vivo in a vertebrate host. The studies describing backwards movement in vitro or ex vivo have been referred to and we clarified that our statement strictly refers to our in vivo observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One reviewer requested that the authors to put some gallery of images of selected time frames in addition to the videos. This could ideally guide the reader's eye while reading.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>–</italic> We have followed up on this suggestion and included a completely new Figure 2 showing selected frames from Video 2 capturing parasites attached to red blood cells and glass surfaces; We have split Figure 6, now Figure 7 and 8, and added selected frames from Video 6 and Video 7 showing trypanosomes swimming in the peritoneal cavity and in fins.</p></body></sub-article></article>
