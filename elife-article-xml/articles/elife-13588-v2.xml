decide whether to update the current choice strategy. Magnocellular mediodorsal thalamus (MDmc) supports adaptive decision-making, but its causal contribution is not well understood. Monkeys with excitotoxic MDmc damage were tested on probabilistic three-choice decision-making tasks. They could learn and track the changing values in object-reward associations, but they were severely impaired at updating choices after reversals in reward contingencies or when there were multiple options associated with reward. These deficits were not caused by perseveration or insensitivity to negative feedback though. Instead, monkeys with MDmc lesions exhibited an inability to use reward to promote choice repetition after switching to an alternative option due to a diminished influence of recent past choices and the last outcome to guide future behavior. Together, these data suggest MDmc allows for the rapid discovery and persistence with rewarding options, particularly in uncertain or changing environments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13588.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13588.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13588.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A small structure deep inside the brain, called the mediodorsal thalamus, is a critical part of a brain network that is important for learning new information and making decisions. However, the exact role of this brain area is still not understood, and there is little evidence showing that this area is actually needed to make the best choices.</p><p>To explore the role of this area further, Chakraborty et al. trained macaque monkeys to choose between three colorful objects displayed on a touchscreen that was controlled by a computer. Some of their choices resulted in the monkeys getting a tasty food pellet as a reward. However the probability of receiving a reward changed during testing, and in some cases, reversed, meaning that the highest rewarded object was no longer rewarded when chosen and vice versa. While at first the monkeys did not know which choice was the right one, they quickly learned and changed their choices during the test according to which option resulted in them receiving the most reward.</p><p>Next, the mediodorsal thalamus in each monkey was damaged and the tests were repeated. Previous research had suggested that such damage might result in animals repeatedly choosing the same option, even though it is clearly the wrong choice. However, Chakraborty et al. showed that it is not as simple as that. Instead monkeys with damage to the mediodorsal thalamus could make different choices but they struggled to use information from their most recent choices to best guide their future behavior. Specifically, the pattern of the monkeys’ choices suggests that the mediodorsal thalamus helps to quickly link recent choices that resulted in a reward in order to allow an individual to choose the best option as their next choice.</p><p>Further studies are now needed to understand the messages that are relayed between the mediodorsal thalamus and interconnected areas during this rapid linking of recent choices, rewards and upcoming decisions. This will help reveal how these brain areas support normal thought processes and how these processes might be altered in mental health disorders involving learning information and making decisions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13588.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13588.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>object-reward association</kwd><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>reward guided learning</kwd><kwd>reversals</kwd><kwd>explore-exploit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Rhesus Macaque</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0800329</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>Anna S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT090051MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walton</surname><given-names>Mark E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a Medical Research Council UK Career Development Fellowship (G0800329) to ASM.

However, for such exploratory decisions to be of any use for future choice strategies, it is critical that the identity of selected options during 'search' choices are appropriately maintained; without this, the outcomes of such choices can not inform subsequent decisions about whether to continue to sample other alternatives or to terminate the search and instead persist with this chosen option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quilodran et al., 2008</xref>). Converging evidence suggests that the integrity of orbital and medial parts of prefrontal cortex supports the ability to use feedback to allow rapid regulation of choice behavior and to shift from search to persist modes of responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khamassi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2011</xref>). However, it is not yet clear how all the relevant information is efficiently integrated across these cortical networks for this to occur.</p><p>One subcortical structure interconnected to these neural networks and therefore in a prime position to help coordinate the rapid integration of choices and outcomes is the mediodorsal thalamus (MD). The MD is heavily interconnected with the prefrontal cortex, and also receives inputs from the amygdala and ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton and Mishkin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McFarland and Haber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ray and Price, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russchen et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Timbie and Barbas, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xiao et al., 2009</xref>). Causal evidence from animal models indicates that MD provides a critical contribution in many reward-guided learning and decision-making tasks, particularly those requiring rapid adaptive updating of stimulus values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chudasama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corbit et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchell and Dalrymple-Alford, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mitchell et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mitchell and Gaffan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ostlund and Balleine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parnaudeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, implementation of pre-learned strategies and memory retention remains intact after selective damage to the magnocellular subdivision of MD (MDmc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitchell et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mitchell and Gaffan, 2008</xref>). Yet the precise role of MDmc in facilitating such rapid learning and adaptive choice behavior remains to be determined.</p><p>One potential clue comes from the fact that the functional dissociations occurring after MDmc damage are reminiscent of those observed following lesions to parts of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baxter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izquierdo et al., 2004</xref>), to which the MDmc subdivision is reciprocally connected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ray and Price, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Timbie and Barbas, 2015</xref>). Moreover, intact communication between MDmc and OFC (as well between MDmc and amygdala) is critical for rapid updating of reward-guided choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Izquierdo and Murray, 2010</xref>). Lesions to both MD and OFC have been shown to cause deficits on discriminative reversal learning tasks, a finding frequently accompanied by perserveration of choice to the previously rewarded stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chudasama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clarke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Floresco et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hunt and Aggleton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ouhaz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parnaudeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chudasama and Robbins, 2003</xref>). This suggests that the main role for MDmc is to promote flexibility by supporting OFC in inhibiting responding to the previously highest value stimulus and/or learning from negative feedback. However, recent functional imaging, electrophysiology and lesion studies have refined theories of OFC function, suggesting it might play an important role in contingent value assignment or in determining the state space to allow such learning to be appropriately credited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jocham et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, a second possibility is that the MD plays a key role in adaptive decision making by facilitating the rapid contingent learning performed by OFC-centered networks.</p><p>However, it is important to keep in mind that causal animal evidence indicates that damage to the MDmc does not simply replicate the deficits observed after selective lesions to interconnected prefrontal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baxter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitchell et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mitchell and Gaffan, 2008</xref>), suggesting that the functional role of MDmc may be distinct from any individual cortical target. Indeed, in addition to the OFC, the MDmc also has connections to several other parts of rostral, ventral and medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McFarland and Haber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ray and Price, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xiao et al., 2009</xref>). These regions are known to be important not just for value learning, but also for aspects of value-guided decision making such as computing the evidence for persisting with a current default option or to switch to an alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boorman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noonan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolling et al., 2014</xref>). Based on this evidence, we predicted that the role of MDmc might go beyond simply enabling OFC-dependent contingent learning and might also directly regulate decisions about when to shift from a search strategy (sampling the alternatives to build up a representation of their long-term value) to a persist strategy (repeating a particular stimulus choice).</p><p>To determine the precise role of MDmc in facilitating trial-by-trial learning and adaptive decision-making, we tested macaque monkeys before and after bilateral neurotoxic lesions to MDmc, and matched unoperated control monkeys, on a series of probabilistic, multiple option reward-guided learning tasks that are sensitive to OFC damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walton et al., 2010</xref>). To perform adaptively, the monkeys had to learn about, and track, the values associated with 3 novel stimuli through trial-and-error sampling and use this information to decide whether or not to persist with that option. In some task conditions (referred to as ‘Stable’ or ‘Variable’ schedules: see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the reward probabilities linked to each stimulus would change dynamically and the identity of the highest value would reverse half way through each session; in others, the probabilistic reward assignments remained fixed throughout the session. If the MDmc is critical for inhibiting responses to a previously rewarded stimulus, then the monkeys with MDmc damage will <italic>only</italic> be impaired post-reversal and will display perseverative patterns of response selection. If, on the other hand, the MDmc supported contingent learning, these lesioned monkeys would show impairments akin to those observed in monkeys with OFC damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walton et al., 2010</xref>). That is, MDmc-lesioned monkeys would not only be slower to update their choices post-reversal or, in Fixed situations where they had to integrate across multiple trials to determine which option was best, they would also exhibit aberrant patterns of stimulus choices such that a particular reward would be assigned based on the history of all past choices rather than to its causal antecedent choice. Alternatively and finally, if the MDmc is required to regulate adaptive choice behavior, then the lesioned animals would also have a deficit post-reversal or in any Fixed schedules when multiple options are rewarding, but this would be characterized by an impairment in determining when to shift from search to persist modes of responding.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13588.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of a single trial.

Instead, the monkeys with MDmc damage were strikingly deficient at re-selecting a sampled alternative after a search choice that yielded a reward – i.e., they were more likely to select a different stimulus to that chosen on the previous trial. Further analyses suggested this was caused by the MDmc-lesioned monkeys exhibiting less influence of associations based on their most recent stimulus choices coupled with an intact representation of longer term choice trends, which impaired their ability to update their stimulus choices rapidly in situations when they had a varied choice history. Together, these findings support a novel, key contribution of MDmc in regulating adaptive responding.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of ten male rhesus macaque monkeys were trained on a stimulus-guided 3-armed (object) bandit task described in detail in the Procedures and previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walton et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, each of the three stimuli was associated with a particular probability of reward according to two predefined schedules (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These particular 'varying' outcome schedules were constructed such that the values of the three stimuli fluctuated continuously throughout the session. However, each schedule was designed to incorporate two properties, namely an initial learning period where one stimulus had an objectively higher value than the other two (here referred to as stimulus 'V1'; note that the only differences between the Stable and Variable schedules was the V1 reward probability in this initial learning period (i.e. during the 1<sup>st</sup> 150 trials), and a fixed reversal point, after 150 trials, where the identity of V1 changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Trial-by-trial reward probabilities were therefore pre-determined and identical for each animal in each comparable session regardless of their choices. The stimuli used in every session were novel, meaning that the monkeys were compelled to learn and track the stimulus values anew through trial-and-error sampling in each test session. The positions of the 3 stimuli on the screen changed on each trial meaning that choices were driven by stimulus identity and not target or spatial location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Following training and testing on these pre-determined varying outcome schedules, three monkeys then received bilateral neurotoxic (NMDA/ibotenic acid) lesions to MDmc (see Surgery for details) and the other seven remained as unoperated controls. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows coronal sections of the intended and actual bilateral damage to the MDmc with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> showing additional coronal sections of the MDmc lesions. All three monkeys (MD1, MD2 and MD3) had bilateral damage to MDmc as intended. Neuronal damage of the MDmc extended throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the nucleus. There was also slight damage to the paraventricular nucleus of the epithalamus positioned directly above the MDmc only in all cases. There was some slight encroachment of the lesion into the parvocellular section of MD3 on the left (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In MD1 and MD2 the parvocellular section remained relatively intact. The more lateral sections of the mediodorsal thalamus remained intact in all three animals. All monkeys also had sagittal section of the splenium of the corpus callosum dorsal to the posterior thalamus. This removal of splenium does not affect performance on other object-reward associative learning tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parker and Gaffan, 1997</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13588.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Histological reconstruction of the MDmc lesions.</title><p>Coronal sections (right) corresponding to the schematic diagram (left) with lesion detailed (dotted outline) for the bilateral magnocellular mediodorsal thalamic neurotoxic lesions (MDmc) for the three monkeys, MD1, MD2 and MD3.

A repeated measures ANOVA, with group as a between-subjects factor and both schedule and surgery (pre-MD surgery or post-MD surgery) as within-subjects factors, showed a selective significant interaction of lesion group x surgery for the V1<sub>sch</sub> (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,8</sub> = 5.537, p=0.046).

Post-hoc tests indicated that the MDmc group showed a significant decrement in choice performance after surgery, with the lesioned monkeys choosing the highest valued stimulus less frequently than the control monkeys (all p’s&lt;0.05). This change was also accompanied by a marked speeding of choice latencies on all trials.

To examine whether our selective MDmc lesion caused a particular problem when needing to switch away from the initial highest valued stimulus (V1<sub>sch</sub>), we separately re-analyzed choice performance during the 1<sup>st</sup> 150 trials, where the identity of V1<sub>sch</sub> is fixed, and during the 2<sup>nd</sup> 150 trials, after the reversal in reward contingencies for V1<sub>sch</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), again including schedule as a within-subjects factor. While the lesion had no consistent effect during the initial learning phase (V1<sub>sch</sub> 1<sup>st</sup> half: lesion group x surgery: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,8</sub> = 0.659, p=0.440), there was a significant change in choices post-reversal (V1<sub>sch</sub> 2<sup>nd</sup> half: lesion group x surgery interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,8</sub> = 5.990, p=0.040). Post-hoc tests showed that after surgery the MDmc-lesioned monkeys were selectively worse at choosing the V1<sub>sch</sub> than controls (p=0.031). These data suggest that the monkeys with damage to the MDmc could not flexibly update their choice behavior in a comparable manner to control monkeys following the reversal in identity of the highest value stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MDmc, perseveration and feedback sensitivity</title><p>One common explanation for a deficit in behavioral flexibility is that animals with lesions inappropriately continue to choose the previously highest valued stimulus ('perseveration'), potentially because they fail to learn from negative feedback. Such an effect has been observed during reversal learning in rodents following disruption of the MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Floresco et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hunt and Aggleton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ouhaz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parnaudeau et al., 2013</xref>). However, despite deficits in reversal learning, our monkeys with MDmc damage displayed no evidence of either perseveration, or a failure to learn from negative feedback.</p><p>First, in the 50 trials after reversal, the MDmc lesion group and the control group had a similar likelihood of choosing what had been the highest valued stimulus pre-reversal (ex-V1<sub>sch</sub>) (proportion of ex-V1<sub>sch</sub> choices: Controls: Pre-surgery: Stable, 39.9% ± 5.6, Variable, 39.3% ± 3.1, Post-surgery: Stable, 46.7% ± 3.3, Variable, 45.8% ± 6.0; MDmc: Pre-surgery: Stable, 35.3% ± 7.0, Variable, 41.22% ± 2.0, Post-surgery: Stable, 47.1% ± 3.3, Variable, 52.11% ± 1.3; interactions between group x surgery or group x surgery x schedule: both <italic>F</italic><sub>1,8</sub> &lt; 0.6, p&gt;0.45).

An analysis of the proportion of times the monkeys explored an alternative option after just receiving a reward (positive feedback) or reward being omitted (negative feedback) showed a significant lesion group x surgery x previous outcome interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,8</sub> = 15.01, p=0.005). There was also a strong trend towards a 4-way interaction between lesion group, surgery, previous outcome and pre- or post-reversal (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,8</sub> = 5.12, p=0.054); switch rates selectively increased in the MDmc group after surgery and this was particularly pronounced after a reward (average post-surgery increase in switch probability: after reward 0.15 ± 0.07, post-hoc tests: p=0.051; after no reward: 0.08 ± 0.06, p=0.23).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13588.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Switching behavior in the control and MDmc lesioned monkeys.</title><p>Mean likelihood of switching to a different stimulus in the two groups both pre- and post-operatively (<bold>a</bold>) throughout each schedule (mean ± S.E.M.) or (<bold>b</bold>) divided up into switches (SW) following a choice leading to a reward (CORRECT–SW) or to no reward (ERROR–SW) (dots = individual monkey’s switching probabilities).

While there were no significant interactions with lesion group x surgery in the pre-reversal period (all <italic>F</italic><sub>1,8</sub> &lt; 2.5, p&gt;0.15), there was a significant lesion group x surgery x previous outcome post-reversal (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,8</sub> &lt; 10.9, p=0.011). Further post-hoc tests showed that this effect was mainly driven by a selective increase for the MDmc group to show a tendency to switch to choosing a different stimulus just after having received a reward (increase in switching probability from pre- to post-MD surgery: 0.21 ± 0.07, p=0.056), an effect less evident after no reward (0.06 ± 0.08, p=0.47) or in the control animals after either outcome (reward: –0.04 ± 0.06, p=0.56; no reward 0.02 ± 0.05 p=0.74). This change in switching behavior highlights that, in addition to the absence of evidence for a reduction in sensitivity to negative feedback after an MDmc lesion, there was a change in how positive feedback influenced future choices, particularly in the post-reversal period. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, this change meant that in the post-reversal phase, monkeys with MDmc damage became no more likely to stay with a current choice after reward delivery than reward omission. In other words, when the identity of the highest value stimulus changed, the MDmc group, postoperatively, was severely impaired at using the receipt of reward as evidence to continue persisting with that particular previously chosen stimulus.</p><p>This maladaptive pattern of switching was also reflected in the monkeys’ choice latencies. The control monkeys, and MDmc group pre-surgery, all responded slower on trials where they changed their stimulus choice (i.e., choice on current trial ‘n’ ≠ choice on previous trial ‘n-1’) compared to trials where they continued to select the same option (choice on trial n = choice on trial n-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). However, after surgery, the MDmc group failed to exhibit this post-exploration response slowing on exploration trials (group x surgery x switch-stay: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,8</sub> = 5.77, p=0.043) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MDmc, contingent learning and the representation of recent choices</title><p>MDmc has connections with all parts of the OFC, although they are particularly densest with the lateral OFC, a region that has been implicated in guiding flexible learning and choice behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murray and Wise, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wallis and Kennerley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walton et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that impaired contingent value learning, observed after lesions to this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walton et al., 2010</xref>), might also underlie the change in performance observed in the MDmc lesioned group.</p><p>One characteristic of the lateral OFC lesion is that, while the monkeys were unable to correctly credit a reward outcome with a particular choice, they still possessed non-contingent learning mechanisms allowing them to approximate value learning based on the weighted history of all recent choices and rewards, irrespective of the precise relationship between these choices and rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walton et al., 2010</xref>). This meant that, after a long history of choosing one stimulus (e.g., option A), a new choice (e.g., option B) would be <italic>less likely</italic> to be reselected on the following trial after positive than negative feedback and the previously chosen stimulus A would be <italic>more likely</italic> to be reselected.</p><p>To determine whether the MDmc lesioned monkeys also approximated associations based on choice history rather than contingent choice-outcome pairs, we ran a series of analyses to establish the specificity of learning as a function of recent reinforcement and choices. In a first analysis, we looked for the effect described above: whether an outcome – reward or no reward – received for choosing any particular option (‘B’) might be mis-assigned to proximal choices of another option (‘A’) as a function of how often ‘A’ had been chosen in the recent past ('choice history') (note, there were no changes in the ‘B’ reward likelihood as a function of lesion group, surgery or choice history: all <italic>F</italic>’s &lt; 1.54, p’s&gt;0.23). For this analysis, we collapsed across Stable and Variable conditions. As can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, pre-operatively both groups were more likely to re-select the previous ‘B’ option after a reward than no reward across all choice histories. In contrast, post-operatively, the influence of the positive outcome significantly reduced in the MDmc group only (lesion group x surgery interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,8</sub> = 6.32, p=0.036). Further, the number of recent ‘A’ choices made by the MDmc lesion group did <italic>not</italic> affect the likelihood of re-selecting option ‘B’; the MDmc group post-operatively were no less likely to re-select that option after a reward whether they had a short or long choice history on option ‘A’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Moreover, it was not the case that the influence of the recent outcome was being selectively mis-assigned to option ‘A’ based on recent choices, as was observed in the lateral OFC animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Instead, the MDmc group showed no overall significant change in their likelihood of reversing back to option ‘A’ again on the next trial, but rather showed a small increase in the likelihood of switching to the 3<sup>rd</sup> alternative, ‘C’ (A choice: group x surgery interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,8</sub> = 2.75, p=0.14; C choice: group x surgery interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,8</sub> = 7.33, p=0.027) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). In other words, after a recent switch, the MDmc lesion group was unable to use the past reward as evidence to reselect either their previous choice or even the option chosen most frequently over recent trials.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13588.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Influence of recent choice history over subsequent choices.</title><p>(<bold>a–c</bold>) Differential likelihood (mean ± S.E.M. across monkeys) of repeating a ‘B’ choice (<bold>a</bold>), switching back to option ‘A’ (<bold>b</bold>) or switching away to option ‘C’ (<bold>c</bold>) after a ‘B’ choice made on trial n-1 either was rewarded or was not rewarded.

To test this difference formally, we directly compared the groups by re-running the ANOVAs now including the lateral OFC group. The analysis of the likelihood of re-selecting ‘B’ option again revealed a lesion group x surgery interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>2,10</sub> = 7.08, p=0.012) but importantly, also now a lesion group x surgery x choice history interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>6,30</sub> = 2.51, p=0.044). Post-hoc tests showed that, while both the MDmc and lateral OFC groups were on average significantly different to the controls (both p&lt;0.05), the influence of the choice history on the two groups was distinct: only the lateral OFC group post-surgery, but not the MDmc group or controls, exhibited a significant reduction in repetitions of ‘B’ choices after increasing numbers of previous ‘A’ choices (p=0.007). Moreover, while the ‘B’ repetition likelihood was reduced in the MDmc group compared to controls post-surgery, this only occurred when the history of previous ‘A’ choices was p&lt;0.05 for A<sub>1</sub>B and A<sub>3</sub>B, p=0.08 for A<sub>2</sub>B). In contrast, the lateral OFC group were only different to controls after <italic>3 or more</italic> previous ‘A’ choices (p&lt;0.05 for A<sub>3</sub>B and A<sub>4-7</sub>B). Similarly, analysis of the likelihood of returning to option ‘A’ now revealed a lesion group x surgery interaction, driven by a significant overall increase in ‘A’ choices in the lateral OFC group that was not present in either the controls or MDmc lesioned animals. Therefore, unlike the lateral OFC lesion group, which displayed less precise and potentially maladaptive <italic>learning</italic> based on associating a past outcome with the history of recent choices, the behavior of the MDmc group was instead characterized by a reduced likelihood of repeating a rewarded choice after just having switched to that option.</p><p>Importantly, it was not the case that the MDmc lesioned monkeys were never able to use reward to promote persistence with a chosen option. In a novel companion analysis, we again probed the influence on subsequent behavior of the past choice and outcome, but now investigated how this was influenced by the frequency with which that particular option had been chosen in the previous 5 trials ('choice frequency') (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Before surgery, both groups of monkeys were always more likely to persist with an option after being rewarded for that choice than if not rewarded, and this was not significantly influenced by choice frequency. However, post-operatively, although the MDmc lesioned monkeys again were no more likely to re-select the previous choice after reward than after no reward when that option had a low recent choice frequency, this impairment went away in situations when the monkeys had selected that same option on the majority of recent trials. This behavior resulted in a significant surgery x group x choice history interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>2,16</sub> = 3.80, p=0.045). Therefore, the MDmc lesioned monkeys were just as proficient as controls at weighing the influence of positive over negative feedback in situations where they had a long choice history on the just chosen option, but not if they had seldom chosen that option in the recent past.</p><p>To further investigate the influence of recent choices and outcomes on future behavior, in a third analysis we ran an identical multiple linear regression analysis used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walton et al., 2010</xref>) focusing on all possible combinations of the past 5 stimulus choices and past 5 outcomes as regressors (all 25 combinations are shown graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). This analysis allowed us to look not only at how recent specific choice-outcome pairs might guide future behavior (red crosses on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), characteristic of contingent learning known to depend on the lateral OFC, but also to tease out the influence of false associations between recent choices and unrelated past outcomes (blue area / crosses, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) or recent outcomes and unrelated past choices (green area / crosses, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) known not to require an intact lateral OFC.

In other words, they displayed appropriate contingent value learning. Moreover, as had been observed previously, there was also evidence for non-contingent learning mechanisms as demonstrated by a positive influence of the interaction between (i) the most recent choice and unrelated past outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,d</xref>) and (ii) the most recent outcome and unrelated past choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,e</xref>), which also was usually larger for choices / outcomes more proximal to the current trial.</p><p>Postoperatively, in the MDmc group, although there was a reduction in the influence of the most recent choice-outcome association, the overall past influence of these specific pairs looking back over a 5 trial history was no different after the lesion to pre-surgery levels (surgery x group interactions: <italic>F</italic>’s &lt; 1.35, p’s&gt;0.27) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). This lack of effect suggests that stimulus-outcome contingent learning mechanisms do not necessarily depend on the integrity of MDmc.

This result further demonstrates that the MDmc-lesioned animals have intact representations of past outcomes, which can become associated with subsequent choices via 'false' spread-of-effect associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thorndike, 1933</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, there was a change in the influence of associations based on interactions between each received outcome and the recent history of choices in the MDmc lesioned monkeys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>), which resulted in a significant surgery x group x past choice interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>4,32</sub> = 3.13, p=0.028).

This analysis revealed a surgery x group x choice recency interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,8</sub> = 9.83, p=0.014). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons demonstrated that the MDmc group, post-surgery, had a significantly diminished influence from associations made between the previous outcome and the most recent contingent and non-contingent choices (p&lt;0.05) although not with more distant non-contingent choices (p&gt;0.2). The interaction remained significant even if the analysis was re-run with recent trials restricted to non-contingent choices on trials n-2 and n-3 to avoid the potential confound that the weight assigned to trial n-1 could result from either correct contingent learning and non-contingent spread-of-effect (surgery x group x choice recency interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,8</sub> = 5.99, p=0.040).</p><p>Together this significant interaction suggests that the MDmc monkeys do not simply have a primary deficit in contingent value learning. Instead, MDmc monkeys more generally have a degraded representation of their recent – but not more distant – choices, which prevents each outcome from reinforcing the choices made in the past few trials. Without such a mechanism, monkeys will be poor at re-selecting any recently rewarded choices unless they happen to have an extended history of choosing that particular option.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Performance in fixed reward schedules</title><p>Analysis of overall performance on the varying reward schedules (Stable or Variable) highlighted a particular decision making deficit in the MDmc lesioned monkeys that was most prominent when the identity of the best option reversed. However, the problem these monkeys were displaying—a selective failure to persist with a rewarded stimulus choice after having just switched to choosing that stimulus—suggests that the MDmc group may not have a problem with reversals per se but instead in any uncertain situations where they need to use reward to determine which choices should be repeated. This deficit may be particularly pronounced in situations when (a) choice histories are not uniform (e.g., following a reversal or if the value difference between the available options is small) and/or (b) all potential alternatives are associated with some level of reward.</p><p>To investigate this idea, we therefore tested the groups post-operatively on additional 3-armed bandit schedules where the reward probability associated with each stimulus was fixed across a session and so there were no reversals of the reward contingencies. In these 'Fixed' schedules (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>), the reward ratio of the three options remained the same, but the absolute reward yield changed across the schedules (the yield of the second schedule was 0.75 times the first schedule, the third was 0.5 times the first). For all schedules, monkeys have to sample the three stimulus options and use receipt of reward to determine which stimulus to persist with.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13588.011</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Fixed schedule performance.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>–<bold>b</bold>) Schematic of Fixed schedules (upper panels, <bold>a</bold>) and average proportion of choices ( ± S.E.M.) of the V1<sub>sch</sub> in the control and MDmc groups in each schedule (lower panels, <bold>b</bold>).

By contrast, even without a reversal, the MDmc lesions affected the rate of learning and likelihood of persisting with V1<sub>sch</sub>, with the MDmc group taking 55.0 ± 2.2 trials on average to reach the same criterion. Moreover, as can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, the impairment appeared present not just at the start of the session when the animals were initially learning the values, but also persisted throughout the schedule. Therefore, we performed a repeated measures ANOVA comparing performance across Fixed 1–3 ('schedule') on the first and last half of the schedule ('start-end period'). This analysis again revealed a main effect of group (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,7</sub> = 6.59, p=0.037), as the MDmc group overall made significantly fewer choices of the best option. Importantly, there was also a significant quadratic interaction between schedule x group x start-end period (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,7</sub> = 7.01, p=0.033). Post-hoc tests showed that while the control monkeys made significantly more choices of V1<sub>sch</sub> in the second half of the period for all three schedules (all <italic>F</italic>’s<sub>1,7</sub> &gt; 6.59, p’s&lt;0.05), the MDmc group failed to do this on two out of the three schedules. In other words, across sessions using the three different reward schedules, the MDmc group were consistently impaired at rapidly finding and persisting with the best option in situations when all options had some probability of reward.</p><p>Given the results from the varying schedules, we hypothesized that the MDmc lesion should most affect the ability of the monkeys to use reward as evidence to persist with the best option when it had a mixed choice history. Specifically, if the lesioned animals started by mainly sampling the mid and worst options during the initial trials, they should subsequently be less likely to find and persist with the best option; by contrast, if they built up a choice history on the best option in the initial trials, they should then often be just as able as controls to persist with the best option.</p><p>To investigate this hypothesis, we examined average proportion of V1<sub>sch</sub> choices at the start of the session (1<sup>st</sup> 20 trials) and compared that against performance at the end (last 20 trials) of each of the 5 sessions that the animals completed on the three Fixed schedules. As we had predicted, it was not the case that the MDmc animals never managed to find and persistently select V1<sub>sch</sub> (defined as choosing V1<sub>sch</sub> on ≥65% of the last 20 trials); this ability occurred on 40% of sessions in the MDmc group (compared to 78% of Fixed sessions in control animals) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Crucially, however, this ability almost never occurred in sessions where they had failed to choose this option on the initial trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c,d</xref>). To quantify this difference, we contrasted performance at the end of sessions where the animals had either chosen V1<sub>sch</sub> on ≤25% ('EARLY LOW') or ≥75% ('EARLY HIGH') of the first 20 trials. As can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>, there was a marked difference between the median proportion of V1<sub>sch</sub> choices at the end of EARLY LOW sessions in the two groups (0.18 V1<sub>sch</sub> choices for the MDmc group compared to 0.75 for controls; p&lt;0.05, Independent Samples Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, treating each session as an independent sample) but was overlapping in EARLY HIGH sessions (median V1<sub>sch</sub> choices: 0.95 MDmc group compared to 1.0 for controls; p&gt;0.05).</p><p>Together, this result demonstrates that the MDmc is not simply required to appropriately update behavior after a reversal, but instead in any situations that require the rapid integration of a reward with a recently sampled alternative to provide evidence for which of several probabilistically rewarded options to persist with.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The current study sought to determine the influence of MDmc when learning and tracking probabilistic reward associations in stochastic reward environments. In the first set of experiments assessing learning and decision-making on the varying reward schedules, we found that the integrity of the MDmc is critical to allow monkeys to update their behavior efficiently following a reversal in the identity of the highest value stimulus. Similar deficits have been previously reported in studies using rats with complete MD lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Block et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chudasama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parnaudeau et al., 2013</xref>), an impairment often attributed to failure to prevent perseveration to a previously rewarded option or strategy, though see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>). However, such an explanation cannot account for the patterns of choices observed in the current study, as the monkeys with MDmc lesions were no more likely to persevere with the previously highest rewarded option post reversal than controls. In fact, what was most markedly altered in the post-reversal period in the MDmc group was the ability to reselect an option after a rewarded choice of that option. Without this faculty, the lesioned monkeys continued to show maladaptive switching between all three alternatives throughout the post-reversal period and never learned to persist with the new best option (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>It is not the case, however, that MDmc is simply required whenever there is a need to learn from positive outcomes or to respond on the basis of stimulus identity. The lesioned monkeys were not reliably different from controls in the initial acquisition stage of the varying schedules, despite the use of stochastic reward associations and novel stimuli for each testing session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In other studies, similar results of no deficits during acquisition have also been observed. For example, in rodents, complete removal of MD leaves acquisition of serial 2-object visual discrimination learning or 2-choice conditional learning intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chudasama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cross et al., 2012</xref>). Further, in other studies, monkeys with MD or MDmc lesions could acquire concurrent object discriminations when presented across sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggleton and Mishkin, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mitchell et al., 2007b</xref>) and could implement a learned decision strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitchell et al., 2007a</xref>). Equally, however, it was not that the MDmc is only required to perform appropriately when contingencies reverse. For example, during the Fixed schedules in the current study, the MDmc lesioned monkeys also had a reduced ability to find and persevere with the best option compared to the control monkeys in spite of the fact that the identity of the stimulus associated with the highest reward probability never changed in a session. In the Fixed schedule sessions, the value difference between the options is not substantial and selection of any of the three options could be rewarded, probabilistically.</p><p>At first glance, the pattern of results looks very similar to those reported following lesions of the OFC in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walton et al., 2010</xref>), a region heavily interconnected with the MDmc. In that study, the OFC-lesioned monkeys also were initially able to learn and track the value of the best option, but were severely impaired when updating their responses after the identity of the highest value option reversed. OFC-lesioned monkeys also showed deficits on certain fixed schedules. Such a finding might be expected given that the MDmc is the part of MD with major reciprocal connections to the OFC. Indeed, recent behavioral evidence in rodents and monkeys has highlighted that the MD thalamus and cortex work as active partners in cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cross et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parnaudeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2015</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, our analyses suggest that the two regions play dissociable, though complementary, roles during value-guided learning and adaptive decision-making. The OFC impairment resulted from the loss of an ability to favor associations based on each choice and its contingent outcome, rather than ones based on non-contingent associations between recent history of all choices and all outcomes. This caused a paradoxical pattern of choice behavior such that the OFC-lesioned monkeys became <italic>more</italic> likely to reselect an option that had been chosen often in the past even if they had just received a reward for selecting an alternative. By contrast, there was no choice history effect in the MDmc lesioned monkeys. In fact, after a recent switch, these monkeys showed no bias towards either the just rewarded option <italic>or</italic> the alternative that had been chosen in the recent past, and instead were more likely to sample the 3<sup>rd</sup> option on the subsequent trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–c</xref>).</p><p>This difference in patterns of responding between monkeys with OFC or MDmc damage was also evident in the logistic regression analysis looking at the conjoint influence of the past 5 choices and rewards. Monkeys without an OFC had a selective reduction in the influence of past choice-outcome pairings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walton et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, the MDmc group had a particular loss in the weight assigned to the <italic>most recent past choices</italic> (n-1 to n-3) and the last outcome, but no statistically reliable change across the past trials of precise paired associations between each choice and each outcome. This selective impairment meant that once the monkeys with MDmc damage had an extended choice history on one option (for instance, as occurred on certain sessions at the start of the Fixed schedules: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>), they were just as able as control monkeys to use the outcomes gained from their choices to guide their future behavior. This ability could be seen when examining the monkeys’ likelihood of reselecting a stimulus as a function of the number of times that option had been chosen in the past 5 trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). While the controls and MDmc monkeys before surgery exhibited the expected bias to repeat a rewarded choice irrespective of recent history, post surgery the MDmc group only displayed this pattern if they had selected that option on multiple occasions within the recent past. This selective impairment in attributing reward to recent choices, accompanied by the sparing of a faculty to approximate associations based on histories of choices and rewards, is consistent with theories that emphasize the importance of MDmc (and OFC) in goal-directed learning, which requires acquisition of specific future reward predictions of a choice, but not habit learning that relies on longer term trends in choices and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ostlund and Balleine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradfield et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parnaudeau et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, this study implies that a primary function of MDmc is to support the representation of recent stimulus choices to facilitate rapid reward-guided learning and adaptive choice behavior. This function would play a similar role to an eligibility trace in reinforcement learning models, which is essentially a temporary record of recent events used to facilitate learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sutton and Barto, 1998</xref>). Several studies have suggested that MD might be particularly important during rapid task acquisition rather than performance based on previously acquired associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitchell et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mitchell and Gaffan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mitchell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ostlund and Balleine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ouhaz et al., 2015</xref>). Such a role is also consistent with the electrophysiology finding that some cells in monkey MDmc, as well as in more lateral parvocellular MD, are modulated both when making cue-guided actions and when receiving feedback post-response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watanabe and Funahashi, 2004</xref>). The ability to keep track of recent stimulus choices, and their predicted values, is of particular importance when monkeys are sampling alternatives in order to determine the values associated with different objects. At such times, an online representation, or 'hypothesis', of what alternatives <italic>might</italic> be worth sampling would allow rapid updating if their selection leads to a beneficial outcome. Therefore, the MDmc might be described as being critical to facilitate an appropriate balance between exploration and exploitation. However, rather than computing when and what to explore in order to gain valuable new information, functions ascribed to areas such as frontopolar and anterior cingulate cortex and their projecting neuromodulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boorman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donahue et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank et al., 2009</xref>), the role of the MDmc might instead be to help facilitate re-selection and persistence with a beneficial option once it has been found.</p><p>In line with this idea, it was notable that one striking effect of the MDmc lesions was that, on top of a general speeding in response latencies, the lesioned monkeys also no longer exhibited a characteristic retardation in latencies on trials where they switch to an alternative compared to when they persisted with the same choice. Taken together with the MDmc lesioned monkeys’ increased tendency to sample all three options during exploration, this evidence implies that MDmc is required to exert rapid regulation of stimulus-based choices, particularly when needing to decide when to stop searching and instead persist with a recently sampled optimal option.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were ten rhesus monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>; all males) aged between 4 and 10 years.

On each testing session, monkeys were presented with three novel colorful stimuli, (650 x 650 mm), which they had never previously encountered, assigned to one of the three options (A–C). Stimuli could be presented in one of four spatial configurations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and each stimulus could occupy any of the three positions specified by the configuration. Configuration and stimulus position was determined randomly on each trial meaning that monkeys were required to use stimulus <italic>identity</italic> rather than action- or spatial-based values to guide their choices. A task programme using Turbo Pascal controlled stimulus presentation, experimental contingencies, and reward delivery.</p><p>Reward was delivered stochastically on each option according to predefined schedules. Data are reported from two varying schedules (‘Stable’ and ‘Variable’) and three Fixed schedules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7a</xref>). The monkeys were also tested on several additional varying 3-option schedules, the data from which are not reported here. The likelihood of reward for any option, and for V1<sub>sch</sub> (the <italic>objectively</italic> highest value stimulus available) and V1<sub>RL</sub> (the <italic>subjectively</italic> highest value stimulus given the monkeys’ choices as derived using a standard Rescola-Wagner learning model with a Boltzmann action selection rule) was calculated using a moving 20 trial window (±10 trials). Whether reward was or was not delivered for selecting one option was entirely independent of the other two alternatives. Available rewards on unchosen alternatives were not held over for subsequent trials. Each animal completed five sessions under each schedule, tested on different days with novel stimuli each time. For the two varying schedules, the sessions were interleaved and data were collected both pre- and postoperatively. For the fixed conditions, the three schedules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>) were run as consecutive sessions, starting with the five sessions of Fixed 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, left panel), then five sessions of Fixed 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, middle panel), and finally five sessions of Fixed 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, right panel). In all cases for the reported Fixed schedules, only postoperative data were collected and data acquisition occurred after completion of testing on the varying schedules (note, the animals had performed some other Fixed schedules pre-surgery so had experience of sessions without stimulus reversals). One control monkey was unable to be run on these fixed schedules. The varying schedules comprised of 300 trials per session and the fixed schedules of 150 trials per session.</p><p>The data from the varying schedules were analyzed both as a function of V1<sub>sch</sub> and of V1<sub>RL</sub>.

In brief, to establish the contribution of choices recently made and rewards recently received on subsequent choices, we performed three separate logistic regression analyses, one for each potential stimulus (A, B, C). For each individual regression, the stimulus in question (e.g., ‘A’) would take the value of 1 whenever chosen and 0 whenever one of the other two stimuli (e.g., ‘B’ or ‘C’) was chosen. We then formed explanatory variables (EVs) based on all possible combinations of recent past choices and recent past rewards (trials n-1, n-2, …, n-6). Each EV took the value of 1 when, for the particular choice-outcome interaction, the monkey chosen A and was rewarded, –1 when the monkey chose B or C and was rewarded, and the 0 when there was no reward. We then fit a standard logistic regression with these 36 EVs (25 EVs of interest and 11 additional confound regressors describing combinations of choice / outcome n-6).

Steroids (methylprednisolone, 20 mg/kg) were given the night before surgery intramuscularly (i.m.), and 4 doses were given 4–6 hr apart (intravenously [i.v.] or i.m.) on the day of surgery to protect against intraoperative edema and postoperative inflammation. Each monkey was sedated on the morning of surgery with both ketamine (10 mg/kg) and xylazine (0.25–0.5 mg/kg, i.m.). Once sedated, the monkey was given atropine (0.05 mg/kg, i.m.) to reduce secretion, antibiotic (amoxicillin, 8.75 mg/kg) as prophylaxis against infection, opioid (buprenorphine 0.01 mg/kg, repeated twice at 4- to 6-hr intervals on the day of surgery, i.v. or i.m.) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (meloxicam, 0.2 mg/kg, i.v.) agents for analgesia, and an H2 receptor antagonist (ranitidine, 1 mg/kg, i.v.) to protect against gastric ulceration as a side effect of the combination of steroid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment. The head was shaved and an intravenous cannula put in place for intraoperative delivery of fluids (warmed sterile saline drip, 5 ml/h/kg). The monkey was moved into the operating theatre, intubated, placed on sevoflurane anesthesia (1–4%, to effect, in 100% oxygen), and then mechanically ventilated. A hot air blower (Bair Hugger) allowed maintenance of normal body temperature during surgery. Heart rate, oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, mean arterial blood pressure, and tidal CO2, body temperature, and respiration rate were monitored continuously throughout the surgery.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>MDmc lesions</title><p>The monkey was placed in a stereotaxic head holder and the head cleaned with alternating antimicrobial scrub and alcohol and draped to allow a midline incision. After opening the skin and underlying galea in layers, a large D-shaped bone flap was created in the cranium over the area of the operation and the dura over the posterior part of the hemisphere was cut and retracted to the midline. Veins draining into the sagittal sinus were cauterized and cut. The hemisphere was retracted with a brain spoon and the splenium of the corpus callosum was cut in the midline with a glass aspirator. The tela choroidea was cauterized at the midline, posterior and dorsal to the thalamus using a metal aspirator that was insulated to the tip. The posterior commissure, the third ventricle posterior to the thalamus and the most posterior 5 mm of the midline thalamus were exposed.</p><p>Stereotaxic coordinates were set from the posterior commissure at the midline using the third ventricle as a guide by positioning a stereotaxic manipulator holding a blunt tipped 26-gauge needle of a 10 μl Hamilton syringe above this site. The monkey brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky, 1987</xref>) was used to calculate the coordinates of the intended lesion site. Neurotoxic bilateral injections to the intended dorsal thalamic nuclei in subjects MD1, MD2 and MD3 were produced by 10 × 1 μl injections of a mixture of ibotenic acid (10 mg/ml; Biosearch Technologies, Novato, CA) and NMDA (10 mg/ml; Tocris, Bristol, UK) dissolved in sterile 0.1 mM PBS. This mixture of ibotenic acid and NMDA targets NMDA receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors has previously produced excellent mediodorsal thalamic lesions in rhesus macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitchell et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mitchell and Gaffan, 2008</xref>). The needle was positioned for the first set of coordinates: anteroposterior (AP), +5.2 mm anterior to the posterior commissure; mediolateral (ML), ± 1.2 mm lateral to the third ventricle; dorsoventral (DV), −4.0 mm (to compensate for the hole positioned 1 mm above the tip of the needle) ventral to the surface of the thalamus directly above the intended lesion site. Each injection was made slowly over 4 min and the needle was left in place for 4 min before being moved to the next site. The needle was then repositioned for the second set of coordinates: AP, +4.2 mm; ML, ±1.5 mm; DV, −5.0 mm. The third, fourth and fifth sets of coordinates were AP, +4.2 mm, ML, ±1.5 mm, and DV, −3.0 mm; AP, +3.4 mm, ML, ±1.7 mm and DV, −4.0 mm; and AP, +3.4 mm, ML, ±1.7 mm and DV, −3.0 mm, respectively. In each case, the DV coordinate was relative to the surface of the thalamus at the injection site.</p><p>When the lesion was complete, the dura was repositioned but not sewn, the bone flap was replaced and held with loose sutures, and the galea and skin were closed with sutures in layers. To reduce cerebral edema, mannitol (20%; a sugar alcohol solution; 1 mg/kg, i.v.) was administered slowly for 30 min while the monkey was still anaesthetized. Then the monkey was removed from the head-holder and anesthesia discontinued. The monkey was extubated when a swallowing reflex was observed, placed in the recovery position in a cage within a quiet, darkened room, and monitored continuously. Normal posture was regained upon waking (waking times varied between 10 and 40 min after the discontinuation of the anesthesia); all monkeys were kept warm with blankets during this time. The morning after surgery, the monkey was moved to a separate cage within their homeroom enclosure. Operated monkeys re-joined their socially housed environment as soon as practical after surgery, usually within 3 days of the operation.</p><p>After all neurosurgery, each monkey was monitored continuously for at least 48 hr. Postoperative medication continued in consultation with veterinary staff, including steroids (dexamethasone, 1 mg/kg, i.m.) once every 12 hr for four days, then once every 24 hr for three days; analgesia (buprenorphine, 0.01 mg/kg, i.m.) for 48 hr; and antibiotic treatment (amoxicillin, 8.75 mg/kg, oral) for five days. Gastric ulcer protection (omeprazole, 5 mg/kg, oral and antepsin, 500 mg/kg, oral) commenced two days prior to surgery and continued postoperatively for the duration of other prescribed medications, up to 7 days.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histology</title><p>After completion of all behavioral testing, each monkey was sedated with ketamine (10 mg/kg), deeply anesthetized with intravenous barbiturate and transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline followed by 10% formalin. The brains were extracted and cryoprotected in formalin-sucrose and then sectioned coronally on a freezing microtome at 50 μm thickness. A 1-in-10 series of sections was collected throughout the cerebrum that was expanded to a 1-in-5 series throughout the thalamus. All sections were mounted on gelatin-coated glass microscope slides and stained with cresyl violet.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a Medical Research Council Career Development Fellowship (G0800329) to ASM.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by David Van Essen (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study examined the effects of excitotoxic lesions of the mediodorsal (MD) thalamus on adaptive decision-making in rhesus monkeys performing a battery of probabilistic 3-choice tasks. The experiment follows up on an earlier line of lesion experiments in the OFC that used the same task set. This makes the results of this experiment particularly interesting, because MD provides major thalamic input into OFC, and the behavioral effects of lesion in both areas can be directly compared. In general, lesions of MD and OFC have somewhat similar effects on performance, in both cases degrading the ability to track the best option after a probability reversal. However, the MD-lesioned monkeys appeared to treat recent choice history differently, leading the authors to conclude that the MD group does &quot;not have a primary deficit&quot; in contingency learning but instead has a &quot;degraded representation&quot; of recent choices and recent outcomes.</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that the study addresses an interesting and timely topic, was well designed and executed, and produced interesting results. They also all agree on the high value of this kind of combined lesion/behavior study in monkeys to help identify causal contributions of particular brain areas to complex behavior.</p><p>However, they also raised a number of serious concerns that will require extensive revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript, as written, does not provide a clear and compelling description of the specific function that MD plays in this kind of decision-making behavior. Among the different descriptions are: i) &quot;facilitate optimal choice stability, particularly in uncertain or changing environments&quot; (stability in what regard – consistent choices? How does this function lead to no effect pre-reversal in the variable and stable conditions?); ii) &quot;allow deliberative control over stimulus-based choices, particularly when in an exploratory mode of responding&quot; (how does more deliberation imply more stability? Shouldn't an effect on deliberation also affect contingency learning?); and iii) &quot;relaying information about current choices to allow frontal-temporal-striatal networks to rapidly integrate and update task relevant strategies on a trial-by-trial basis&quot; (What kind of information? Which &quot;strategies&quot;?). In general, it is not clear how these different claims should be translated into specific predictions about patterns of behavioral deficits that should arise that are specific to the proposed function(s) of MD. The manuscript would be much more compelling if both the specific, hypothesized function of MD, and distinguishable, alternative hypotheses (e.g., behavior becomes more random after an abrupt reversal in reward associations), are described at the beginning, along with their specific predictions. Then the results can be described much more clearly in terms of how well they support or oppose the particular hypotheses.</p><p>2) A specific example of this lack of clarity is the description of MD's function in terms of &quot;exploratory&quot; choices. It is not clear how to precisely identify an exploratory choice in the context of the tasks used. It is also not clear why a specific deficit following exploratory choices should lead to the apparently large effects in the fixed condition but none on pre-reversal choices in the stable and variable conditions, since performance in those conditions were described as including &quot;an initial learning period&quot; that presumably includes exploratory choices that, like in the fixed condition, were needed to learn which options were best. After MDmc surgery, were the fixed schedules run before or after the stable/variable schedules? If fixed schedules were run as the first task after surgery, then perhaps the poor performance on fixed relative to first half of stable/variable is due, at least in part, to monkeys learning or relearning to track the best option in conditions with a relatively high yield.</p><p>3) The paper's impact depends strongly on the MD lesion results being different from the previously reported OFC lesion results. However, these analyses raise several questions that should be addressed. For example, a key reported difference was the lack of effect of the MD lesion on contingency learning. However, the MD group appeared to have relatively poor contingency learning even before the lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that these animals might not allow such an effect to be identified. Can the authors rule out this possibility? Moreover, the trial-by-trial analyses presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which are also interpreted as reflecting a &quot;pattern of choice history [that] is in marked contrast to monkeys with lateral OFC lesions,&quot; are not the exact same analyses presented in the OFC studies (Noonan et al., 2010, Walton et al., 2010). In addition, for any of these kinds of trial-by-trial choice analyses, were there any differences in the frequency with which the various patterns of choices (e.g., &quot;AB&quot;, &quot;AAB&quot;, etc., or number of &quot;B&quot; choices in past 5 trials) were rewarded for the different conditions tested (e.g., in control versus lesioned monkeys, who had different patterns of choices and therefore could have, in principle, had &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; choices for these analyses that were associated with different reward probabilities)? Do any of these choice patterns reflect perseveration with respect to spatial location, not just object identity? In general, it would be useful to directly compare OFC and MD groups on the exact same set of analyses.</p><p>4) More task details would be useful to help interpret the behavioral data. For example, in the varying schedules, was the difference between the &quot;stable&quot; and &quot;variable&quot; schedules only in the V1 probability before the reversal point, as seems to be the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>? Moreover, when did the reversal point occur (and was it predictable)? What governed the trial-by-trial fluctuations in reward probability in these conditions? Were these fluctuations exactly the same for each experiment? If not, then why did the averaged behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, bottom) look so similar to the pattern of reward probability for the schedule shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>? If so, then how much did learning across sessions play a role in behavior, both for controls and the lesioned animals? Did the same amount of time elapse between &quot;pre-op&quot; and &quot;post-op&quot; conditions for controls and lesioned animals?</p><p>5) The main statistical tests also should be described better and in some cases interpreted more clearly. For example, the figures show data separate by reward schedule (e.g., &quot;stable&quot; versus &quot;variable&quot;), but the text tends to report p values without reference to the specific schedule (e.g., line 144-45: &quot;post-operatively as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, there was a marked change in choice performance in the MDmc group[…]“). Were data simply combined across schedules? Was schedule type a factor in the ANOVAs? In general, the authors should more clearly explain what they mean by their terms for the factors in their ANOVA. For example, what is the difference between 'surgery' and 'condition'? Moreover, in the Results section it states that &quot;This highlights that, while there was no evidence of a reduction in sensitivity to negative feedback after an MDmc lesion, there was a specific change in how positive feedback influenced future choices in the post-reversal period.&quot; However, the statistical test presented just prior to this statement showed that the interaction term including pre- and post-reversal was not significant.</p><p>Finally, the regression described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> should be described better. What exactly are the &quot;averages&quot; shown in the grids in panel a? across monkeys? Does each square correspond to a single coefficient (if so, how?) or several (this is my guess – one for each pairing of three choices and two outcomes for the given n, correct?)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13588.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The manuscript, as written, does not provide a clear and compelling description of the specific function that MD plays in this kind of decision-making behavior.

Then the results can be described much more clearly in terms of how well they support or oppose the particular hypotheses.</italic></p><p>Thank you for these thoughtful comments. We understand that we were not sufficiently clear in the original manuscript in (a) describing our hypotheses, (b) whether these hypotheses were or were not confirmed by the data, and (c) our functional interpretation of the overall pattern of deficits following the MDmc damage. We have substantially revised the entire manuscript to address these issues. Specifically:</p><p>In the Introduction, we have set out 3 potential functions of MDmc during adaptive learning and decision making, namely, (i) updating choices after a reversal through inhibition of responses to a previously rewarded stimulus (and/or through learning from negative outcomes; (ii) enabling OFC-dependent contingent learning mechanisms; (iii) facilitating adaptive shifts from a “search” strategy (i.e., sampling the available options to build up a representation of their long-term value) to a “persist” strategy (repeating a particular stimulus choice).</p><p>We next set out what patterns of deficits we might expect to see after the MDmc lesion according to each theory:</p><p>“If the MDmc is critical for inhibiting responses to a previously rewarded stimulus, then the monkeys with MDmc damage will <italic>only</italic> be impaired post-reversal and will display perseverative patterns of response selection. […] Alternatively, and finally, if the MDmc is required to regulate adaptive choice behavior, then the lesioned animals would also have a deficit post-reversal or in any Fixed schedules when multiple options are rewarding, but this would be characterized by an impairment in determining when to shift from search to persist modes of responding.”</p><p>We have gone through the manuscript to ensure the terminology we use to describe the patterns of impairment are consistent throughout. For instance, we have cut reference to “optimal choice stability” and “deliberative control”. Instead, we focus on (a) the impairment in repeating a rewarded choice following a recent switch in stimulus choices (what we term moving from “search” to a “persist” strategy) and (b) the specific reduction in influence of associations made between the previous outcome and stimuli chosen on the most recent trials (n-1 – n-3) but not more distant choices (trial n-4 – n-5), which reflects a degraded representation of the most recent stimulus choices.</p><p>Together, this implies a critical role for MDmc in using reward in uncertain, multi-option environments to bias choices towards choice repetition and away from constant sampling of the different alternatives when searching for the best option available.</p><p><italic>2) A specific example of this lack of clarity is the description of MD's function in terms of &quot;exploratory&quot; choices. It is not clear how to precisely identify an exploratory choice in the context of the tasks used. It is also not clear why a specific deficit following exploratory choices should lead to the apparently large effects in the fixed condition but none on pre-reversal choices in the stable and variable conditions, since performance in those conditions were described as including &quot;an initial learning period&quot; that presumably includes exploratory choices that, like in the fixed condition, were needed to learn which options were best. After MDmc surgery, were the fixed schedules run before or after the stable/variable schedules? If fixed schedules were run as the first task after surgery, then perhaps the poor performance on fixed relative to first half of stable/variable is due, at least in part, to monkeys learning or relearning to track the best option in conditions with a relatively high yield.</italic></p><p>We apologise for the lack of clarity with our terminology. We had originally chosen the term “exploratory” – now changed to “search” or simply “switch” in the revised manuscript – as the deficit in the MDmc-lesioned animals is specifically characterised by a reduced ability to persist with a rewarded choice on trial N+1 if a new stimulus choice had been made on trial <italic>N</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). In other words, following a switch choice, the MDmc-lesioned animals were impaired at using reward as evidence to repeat that choice. However, the lesion spared several important abilities. First, there was no change post-operatively in the likelihood of switching after an unrewarded choice. Second, the lesioned animals were able to persist with a rewarded stimulus choice so long as they had an extended recent history of choosing that option (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>The reviewer therefore raises the key question about what it is that defines a task situation where MDmc lesioned animals were deficient. We can rule out that the difference in between the Fixed schedules and initial learning parts of Stable / Variable resulted from any relearning of a strategy as the Fixed schedules were run <underline>after</underline> the Stable/Variable schedules. We have stated this in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Instead, we believe the pattern of deficits depends strongly on two interrelated factors: (a) the reward probabilities of the available options and (b) the animals’ particular history of choices. Given the lesioned animals’ problem in re-selecting a stimulus after a reward when that stimulus has just been switched to, MDmc impairments should be most prominent in conditions that promote exploration – i.e., following a reversal or where the stimulus values are close together and/or low (the latter situations characterise the Fixed schedules). However, in conditions where only one option is frequently rewarded, the best option will likely be chosen more frequently and therefore MDmc group performance should be relatively unaffected. This is the case in the initial period of the Stable and Variable schedules.</p><p>To demonstrate this effect, we re-analysed performance on the Fixed schedules, examining performance at the end of each individual session as a function of best option choices at the start of the session (defined as the proportion of best option choices in the 1<sup>st</sup> 20 trials). Even though the MDmc group were impaired <italic>on average</italic> at finding and persisting with the best option, we hypothesised that performance in each session would depend strongly on performance in the initial trials. Specifically, if the lesioned animals mainly sampled the mid and worst options during the initial trials, they should subsequently be less likely to find and persist with the best option; by contrast, if they built up a choice history on the best option in the initial trials, they would then perform similarly as controls at persisting with the best option.</p><p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D</xref> in the revised manuscript, this is exactly what we found. The MDmc animals did manage to find and persistently select the best option (defined as choosing V1<sub>sch</sub> on ≥65% of the last 20 trials) in 40% of all Fixed sessions (compared to 78% of Fixed sessions in control animals). However, this almost never occurred in sessions where they had failed to choose this option on the initial trials (panel A). This is even clearer when examining performance at the end of sessions divided up into those where the animals chose the best option on either ≤25% (“EARLY LOW”) or ≥75% (“EARLY HIGH”) of the first 20 trials (panel B). As can be observed, there was a marked difference between the median proportion of V1<sub>sch</sub> choices at the end of EARLY LOW sessions in the two groups (0.18 V1<sub>sch</sub> choices for the MDmc group compared to 0.75 for controls; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) but was overlapping in EARLY HIGH sessions (median V1<sub>sch</sub> choices: 0.95 MDmc group compared to 1.0 for controls; <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).</p><p>In fact, we did run one Fixed condition, not included in the original manuscript, that had a similar spread of reward probabilities as the initial learning period of Stable (reward probabilities for V1-V3: 0.6: 0.2: 0 for Fixed v 0.61: 0.21: 0 for Stable; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref> panel A) As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>, post-operative Fixed choice performance in the MDmc group align with performance in the 1<sup>st</sup> half of the Stable condition and overlap with the control group. We chose not to include these data as the performance of one MDmc animal was very different to its performance in all previous sessions associated with the Fixed schedules and also to the other two lesioned animals, which obscures the main finding. However, if the reviewer thinks this would be helpful to have included, we are happy to do so.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13588.012</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison between choice performance during initial learning period of Stable with an equivalent “Fixed” condition.</title><p>Reward probabilities for choosing each option during the 1<sup>st</sup> 150 trials of Stable (<bold>A</bold>) and an equivalent Fixed schedule (<bold>B</bold>) and individual animals’ average proportion of V1<sub>sch</sub> choices in these schedules (Stable, C; Fixed, D).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13588.012">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13588.012</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13588-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>We hope that the inclusion of some of the above analyses, as well as the extensive revisions to the Introduction and Results have now clarified these issues.</p><p><italic>3) The paper's impact depends strongly on the MD lesion results being different from the previously reported OFC lesion results.

Can the authors rule out this possibility?</p><p>We are confident that this is not an issue. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>, which depicts the contingent learning regression weights for each animal before the lesion, the apparent reduction in the influence of contingent pairings that the reviewer noticed in the MD group pre-surgery was driven by 1 of the 3 animals; the other two animals assigned to the MDmc group exhibited an influence of past choice x outcome pairs equivalent to most other animals in the task. Moreover, <italic>all</italic> monkeys during pre-surgery testing showed a significant positive influence of recent choice x reward pairings that was greatest on trial n-1.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13588.013</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Influence of contingent recent choice – outcome pairs on the current choice.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13588.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13588.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13588-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>Out of the group of 10 monkeys trained on the task, two of them consistently performed slightly worse pre-operatively than the group average (though still above our behavioural criteria for inclusion). To ensure these individuals did not bias the results in either direction, one of these was assigned to the control group and the other to get an MD lesion.</p><p><italic>Moreover, the trial-by-trial analyses presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which are also interpreted as reflecting a &quot;pattern of choice history [that] is in marked contrast to monkeys with lateral OFC lesions,&quot; are not the exact same analyses presented in the OFC studies (Noonan et al., 2010, Walton et al., 2010).</italic></p><p>While the reviewer is factually correct that the analyses are not the exact same ones as presented in the main figures of the two mentioned papers, it is important to appreciate they are essentially analogous: they examine how the immediate past reinforcement influences the next choice as a function of the recent pattern of choices. The main difference is that instead of presenting the likelihood of switching back to an ‘A’ choice after a ‘B’ choice, we instead presented the likelihood of persisting with that ‘B’ choice on the next trial. Given that we had already observed a tendency to fail to persist following positive feedback, we felt that this was potentially the most informative analysis. These analyses are also slightly different in that data from additional testing schedules were included in the Walton/Noonan 2010 papers.</p><p>Nonetheless, we understand the reviewer’s fundamental point and in the revised manuscript have:</p><p>A) Presented complementary figures depicting the likelihood of (i) switching back to ‘A’ or (ii) switching to novel option ‘C’ depending on recent choice history and reinforcement on the previous trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>).</p><p>B) Included the equivalent data from the “lateral OFC” lesion group from Walton et al. 2010 as insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-C</xref>.</p><p>C) Performed novel analyses including the lateral OFC group in the ANOVA to determine the separate influence of the MDmc and lateral OFC lesion on how the past reward influences subsequent stimulus choices as a function of the recent choice history.</p><p>As now can be directly observed, while the lateral OFC lesioned animals’ choices were strongly influenced by the recent choice history, causing them to be more likely to switch <italic>away</italic> from ‘B’ and back to ‘A’ after a reward on option ‘B’ if they had chosen option A on many trials in the recent past, there was no such influence on the MDmc group’s choices. Instead, these animals exhibited no consistent bias towards repeating a rewarded choice and were also just as likely to switch to option ‘C’ as to return to option ‘A’. In other words, while the lateral OFC lesion group were displaying less precise and potentially maladaptive <italic>learning</italic>, the MDmc lesion group were impaired at exploiting a rewarded choice after just having switched to that option.</p><p><italic>In addition, for any of these kinds of trial-by-trial choice analyses, were there any differences in the frequency with which the various patterns of choices (e.g., &quot;AB&quot;, &quot;AAB&quot;, etc., or number of &quot;B&quot; choices in past 5 trials) were rewarded for the different conditions tested (e.g., in control versus lesioned monkeys, who had different patterns of choices and therefore could have, in principle, had &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; choices for these analyses that were associated with different reward probabilities)?</italic></p><p>No, the likelihood of receiving a reward for a particular ‘B’ choice was unaffected by the recent choice history or by the lesion group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3</xref>). An analysis of these data comparing reward likelihood after each sequence in the two groups pre- and post-MD surgery found no differences on any measure (all F &lt; 1.54, p &gt; 0.23). We have described this in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“(note, there were no changes in the ‘B’ reward likelihood as a function of lesion group, surgery or choice history: all <italic>F</italic>’s &lt; 1.54, <italic>p</italic>’s &gt; 0.23)”<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13588.014</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Probability of reward on the ‘B?’ trial as a function of recent reward history.</title><p>There were no differences between the groups (all F &lt; 1.54, p &gt; 0.23).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13588.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13588.014</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13588-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>4) More task details would be useful to help interpret the behavioral data. For example, in the varying schedules, was the difference between the &quot;stable&quot; and &quot;variable&quot; schedules only in the V1 probability before the reversal point, as seems to be the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>? Moreover, when did the reversal point occur (and was it predictable)? What governed the trial-by-trial fluctuations in reward probability in these conditions? Were these fluctuations exactly the same for each experiment? If not, then why did the averaged behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, bottom) look so similar to the pattern of reward probability for the schedule shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>? If so, then how much did learning across sessions play a role in behavior, both for controls and the lesioned animals? Did the same amount of time elapse between &quot;pre-op&quot; and &quot;post-op&quot; conditions for controls and lesioned animals?</italic></p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have included more details about the task to clarify exactly how the reward schedules were implemented. In order of above:</p><p>Yes, the only difference between Stable and Variable pre-reversal was the reward probability of V1.</p><p>The reversal point always occurred in these conditions in the same fixed place, irrespective of performance. Note, however, that both pre- and post-surgery, prior to being tested on Stable / Variable, the animals were tested using three separate 3-armed bandit schedules where reversals happened at different points in the session. They had also performed some Fixed schedules pre-surgery (i.e., schedules without a reversal). Therefore, while the animals may have had an expectation of some change in reward probabilities, it is very unlikely that they would have built up a prior expectation of when this would occur.</p><p>Trial-by-trial reward schedules were predetermined and fixed across sessions. The schematic of the reward probabilities is based on a 20-trial running average of the reward rate for each option.</p><p>Sessions with the Stable and Variable schedules were interleaved over 10 testing sessions. As mentioned above, pre-operative Stable and Variable sessions occurred <italic>after</italic> the animals had experienced 15 sessions of testing on three separate 3-armed bandit schedules, each with distinct reward schedules. All animals only moved onto pre-operative testing following extensive training on (a) simpler probabilistic reversal schedules and (b) having achieved a behavioural criterion on a different 3-armed bandit schedule. Therefore, as far as we could ascertain, there were no consistent changes in performance across sessions in either the controls or lesioned animals (i.e., a significant main effect or interaction with testing session in the analyses driven by a progressive change across sessions).</p><p><italic>5) The main statistical tests also should be described better and in some cases interpreted more clearly.</italic></p><p>We apologise for this lack of clarity about our analyses. We have revised the manuscript thoroughly to ensure that all tests are described in detail and terminology is standardised. Again, we will deal with each point raised in turn.</p><p><italic>For example, the figures show data separate by reward schedule (e.g., &quot;stable&quot; versus &quot;variable&quot;), but the text tends to report p values without reference to the specific schedule (e.g., line 144-45: &quot;post-operatively as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, there was a marked change in choice performance in the MDmc group[…]“). Were data simply combined across schedules? Was schedule type a factor in the ANOVAs? In general, the authors should more clearly explain what they mean by their terms for the factors in their ANOVA. For example, what is the difference between 'surgery' and 'condition'?</italic></p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have endeavoured to detail precisely the factors in each ANOVA. For example:</p><p>“Comparison of the rates of selection of the best option, either calculated objectively based on the programmed schedules (V1<sub>sch</sub>), or as subjectively defined by the monkeys’ experienced reward probabilities based on a Rescorla-Wagner learning algorithm (V1<sub>RL</sub>), using a repeated measures ANOVA with lesion group (control or MDmc) as a between-subjects factor and schedule (Stable or Variable) as a within-subjects factor showed no overall difference between the two groups (main effect of group: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,8</sub> &lt; 0.7, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.4).”</p><p>“A repeated measures ANOVA, with group as a between-subjects factor and both schedule and surgery (pre-MD surgery or post-MD surgery) as within-subjects factors, showed a selective significant interaction of lesion group x surgery for the V1<sub>sch</sub> (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,8</sub> = 5.537, <italic>p</italic> = 0.046).”</p><p>“Schedule” was a factor in all of the ANOVAs, except for the more fine-grained ‘choice history’ and regression analyses where we pooled across schedules to increase power. In fact, part of the reviewer’s confusion stemmed from the fact that we accidentally sometimes referred to Schedule as “Condition” in the presentation of the ANOVAs in the original submission; “Condition has been changed to “Schedule” throughout in the revised manuscript. In practice, we found virtually no meaningful interactions between the testing schedule in the varying conditions (i.e., Stable v. Variable) and our effects of interest (i.e., lesion group and surgery); any that did reach significance are now explicitly stated in the text.</p><p><italic>Moreover, in the Results section it states that &quot;This highlights that, while there was no evidence of a reduction in sensitivity to negative feedback after an MDmc lesion, there was a specific change in how positive feedback influenced future choices in the post-reversal period.&quot; However, the statistical test presented just prior to this statement showed that the interaction term including pre- and post-reversal was not significant.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is quite right to point this out and we’re sorry that we were not clearer here. While it is correct that the interaction term with pre- and post-reversal was not significant, there was a strong trend to significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.054). Given the effects on overall choice behaviour pre- and post-reversal, we therefore performed separate repeated measures ANOVAs on the pre-reversal and post-reversal data, which revealed a significant lesion group x surgery x previous outcome interaction in the post-reversal period. In the revised manuscript, we have outlined our analysis steps more clearly.</p><p>“In fact, as can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the rate of switching post-reversal actually <italic>increased</italic> in the MDmc group after surgery.</p><p>[…]</p><p>Further post-hoc tests showed that this effect was mainly driven by a selective increase in the MDmc group in a tendency to switch to choosing a different stimulus just after having received a reward (increase in switching probability from pre- to post-MD surgery: 0.21 ± 0.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.056), an effect less evident after no reward (0.06 ± 0.08, <italic>p</italic> = 0.47) or in the control animals after either outcome (reward: –0.04 ± 0.06, <italic>p</italic> = 0.56; no reward 0.02 ± 0.05 <italic>p</italic> = 0.74).”</p><p>We have also qualified the statements describing these effects. Therefore, rather than saying there was a “specific change in how positive feedback influenced future choices in the post-reversal period”, we now state:</p><p>“This change in switching behaviour highlights that, in addition to the absence of evidence for a reduction in sensitivity to negative feedback after an MDmc lesion, there was a change in how positive feedback influenced future choices, particularly in the post-reversal period. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, this meant that in the post-reversal phase, monkeys with MDmc damage became no more likely to stay with a current choice after reward delivery than reward omission.”</p><p><italic>Finally, the regression described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> should be described better. What exactly are the &quot;averages&quot; shown in the grids in panel a? across monkeys? Does each square correspond to a single coefficient (if so, how?) or several (this is my guess – one for each pairing of three choices and two outcomes for the given n, correct?)?</italic></p><p>We are not quite sure that we fully understand all of the questions the reviewer has posed here, but will try to clarify our approach below in the hope that this will address all of his/her concerns.</p><p>The logistic regression examined the influence on the subsequent choice of all possible combinations of the past 6 choices and past 6 rewards in each monkey, both pre- and post-MD surgery (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> left panel – the regressors associated with the combinations of the 6<sup>th</sup> choice / reward were omitted from the figures and analyses as the purpose of these regressors was to pick up longer term choice/reward trends rather than to capture recent learning). If the animals were just using the correct contingent learning mechanism – associating each choice with its contingent outcome – all the weight of influence should lie on the diagonal, marked with red crosses. However, we had previously observed that even normal monkeys also display influences of combinations of (i) choices and non-contingent rewards received in the past (e.g., choice on trial n-2 x outcome of trial n-1: green area on the matrix) and (ii) past rewards and non-contingent choices made in subsequent trials (e.g., choice on trial n-1 x outcome of trial n-2: blue area on the matrix).</p><p>To calculate the regression weights, in each animal we performed 3 separate logistic regression analyses for each of the 3 potential stimuli (A, B, C). For each individual regression, the stimulus in question (e.g., ‘A’) would take the value of 1 whenever chosen and 0 whenever one of the other two stimuli (e.g., ‘B’ or ‘C’) was chosen. We then formed explanatory variables (EVs) based on all possible combinations of recent past choices and recent past rewards (trials n-1, n-2, …, n-6). Each EV took the value of 1 when, for the particular choice-outcome interaction, the monkey chosen A and was rewarded, –1 when the monkey chose B or C and was rewarded, and the 0 when there was no reward. We then fit a standard logistic regression with these 36 EVs (25 EVs of interest and 11 additional confound regressors describing combinations of choice / outcome n-6).
