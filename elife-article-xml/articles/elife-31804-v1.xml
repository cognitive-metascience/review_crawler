However Arabidopsis has lost a PIN clade sister to AtPIN1, Sister-of-PIN1 (SoPIN1), which is conserved in flowering plants. We previously proposed that the AtPIN1 organ initiation and vein patterning functions are split between the SoPIN1 and PIN1 clades in grasses. Here we show that in the grass Brachypodium <italic>sopin1</italic> mutants have organ initiation defects similar to Arabidopsis <italic>atpin1</italic>, while loss of <italic>PIN1</italic> function in Brachypodium has little effect on organ initiation but alters stem growth. Heterologous expression of Brachypodium SoPIN1 and PIN1b in Arabidopsis provides further evidence of functional specificity. SoPIN1 but not PIN1b can mediate flower formation in null <italic>atpin1</italic> mutants, although both can complement a missense allele. The behavior of SoPIN1 and PIN1b in Arabidopsis illustrates how membrane and tissue-level accumulation, transport activity, and interaction contribute to PIN functional specificity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auxin</kwd><kwd>Brachypodium</kwd><kwd>evo-devo</kwd><kwd>organ initiation</kwd><kwd>polarity</kwd><kwd>patterning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt;</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000324</institution-id><institution>Gatsby Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Connor</surname><given-names>Devin Lee</given-names></name><name><surname>Elton</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name><name><surname>Ticchiarelli</surname><given-names>Fabrizio</given-names></name><name><surname>Leyser</surname><given-names>Ottoline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>US Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AI02-07ER64452</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hsia</surname><given-names>Mon Mandy</given-names></name><name><surname>Vogel</surname><given-names>John P.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comparative genetics between distant plant species shows that for the PIN auxin transport proteins differential membrane and tissue-level accumulation, transport activity, and interaction result in different functional properties in the shoot post transcription.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The plant hormone auxin is an essential mobile signal controlling growth and patterning throughout plant development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leyser, 2010</xref>). Auxin can passively enter cells triggering a vast array of downstream signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang and Estelle, 2014</xref>), but it cannot easily exit the cell without active transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raven, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rubery and Sheldrake, 1974</xref>). As a result, directional efflux mediated by the polar-localized PIN-FORMED (PIN) efflux carriers can organize auxin flows and accumulation patterns, creating concentration maxima and paths of transport that regulate growth, position organs and pattern tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adamowski and Friml, 2015</xref>). Because auxin itself feeds back to regulate PIN-mediated transport both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leyser, 2006</xref>), the transport system shows remarkable robustness and plasticity. For example compensatory changes in PIN abundance between PIN family members can mitigate PIN loss-of-function mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blilou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Paponov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vieten et al., 2005</xref>), environmental inputs can trigger tissue-level changes in PIN abundance and polarity leading to altered plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Habets and Offringa, 2014</xref>), and auxin transport paths can be reorganized in response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sauer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2006</xref>) or spontaneously in tissue culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gordon et al., 2007</xref>). The self-organizing properties of the auxin transport system gives this patterning mechanism extraordinary versatility and allows it to coordinate both local and long-range communication in plants.</p><p>The correct initiation and positioning of organs (leaves, flowers, stems) in the growing tip, or shoot apical meristem, of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Arabidopsis) plants requires the action of the PIN-FORMED1 (AtPIN1) auxin efflux carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Okada et al., 1991</xref>). AtPIN1 is targeted to the plasma membrane and polarized in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gälweiler et al., 1998</xref>). In the meristem epidermis polarization of AtPIN1 in neighboring cells converges around the initiation sites of new organs, suggesting that polarized AtPIN1 concentrates auxin into local maxima causing organ initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benková et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reinhardt et al., 2003</xref>). Accordingly in <italic>atpin1</italic> loss-of-function mutants or if auxin transport is pharmacologically inhibited, organ initiation is aborted but it can be rescued with local auxin application to the meristem flank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reinhardt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reinhardt et al., 2000</xref>). Organ initiation in <italic>atpin1</italic> mutants can also be rescued with epidermal-specific AtPIN1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bilsborough et al., 2011</xref>) and reducing AtPIN1 function specifically in the epidermis compromises organ positioning and initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kierzkowski et al., 2013</xref>), demonstrating the importance of convergent AtPIN1 polarization in the epidermis during organ formation.</p><p>The recurrent formation of AtPIN1 convergence points surrounding auxin maxima in the meristem epidermis has been the focus of several computational models that attempt to explain how auxin feeds back on its own transport via AtPIN1 to concentrate auxin and control organ spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bhatia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heisler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jönsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stoma et al., 2008</xref>). However AtPIN1 is also expressed during the patterning of the vascular strands formed coincident with organ positioning, and in these sub-epidermal cells AtPIN1 is polarized rootward away from the presumed auxin maxima, suggesting that AtPIN1 polarity with respect to auxin concentration may vary across tissues or over developmental time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayer et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Indeed AtPIN1 has several functions post organ initiation that are not necessarily associated with convergent polarization patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gälweiler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scarpella et al., 2006</xref>). AtPIN1 is not required for organ formation during the vegetative phase. Mutants lacking AtPIN1 form leaves but they are misplaced and have severe morphological and vascular defects similar to those observed upon pharmacological inhibition of auxin transport, suggesting an important role for AtPIN1 in post-initiation morphogenesis and vein patterning in leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guenot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sawchuk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Verna et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore in mature tissues AtPIN1 is polarized rootward in vascular-associated cells and is required for efficient long distance transport of auxin down the shoot in the polar auxin transport stream and this has been proposed to play an important role in the regulation of shoot branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bennett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gälweiler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shinohara et al., 2013</xref>). Mutations in other PIN family members in combination with <italic>atpin1</italic> mutants suggest further functions in embryo development, root development and during plant growth responses to light and gravity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leyser, 2005</xref>). Unfortunately the myriad roles for AtPIN1 during inflorescence development are genetically obscured by the severity of <italic>atpin1</italic> organ initiation defects.</p><p>We previously showed that all sampled flowering plants outside of the Brassicacea family have a clade of PIN proteins phylogenetically sister to the PIN1 clade (The Sister-of-PIN1 or SoPIN1 clade), while Arabidopsis and other Brassicacea species have lost this clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Connor et al., 2014</xref>). During initiation of the lemma, a leaf-like floral organ in the grass <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> (Brachypodium), which has both PIN1 and SoPIN1 clades, SoPIN1 is highly expressed in the epidermis, polarizes towards presumed auxin maxima, and forms convergent polarization patterns, suggesting a role in creating the auxin maxima required for organ initiation in the shoot. In contrast, the duplicate Brachypodium PIN1 clade members, PIN1a and PIN1b, are not highly expressed in the epidermis, orient away from presumed auxin maxima and are primarily expressed during patterning in the sub-epidermal tissues. Thus the combined expression domains and polarization behaviors of SoPIN1, PIN1a, and PIN1b in Brachypodium largely recapitulate those observed for AtPIN1 alone in Arabidopsis.</p><p>The dynamic localization and polarization patterns of the Brachypodium SoPIN1 and PIN1 clades can be modeled with two different polarization modes with respect to auxin. PIN behaviors can be captured by a model in which SoPIN1 polarizes ‘up-the-gradient’ towards the neighboring cell with the highest auxin concentration, while PIN1a and PIN1b polarize ‘with-the-flux’ accumulating in the membrane with the highest net auxin efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Connor et al., 2014</xref>). Both polarization modes were previously applied to AtPIN1 in order to capture the switch in polarity observed during organ initiation and vein patterning, first orienting toward the auxin maximum during convergence point formation, then orienting away from the maximum below the epidermis during vein patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayer et al., 2009</xref>). These localization and modeling results suggest that in most angiosperm species the organ placement and vascular patterning functions attributed to AtPIN1 in Arabidopsis are split between the PIN1 and SoPIN1 clades and that these two clades have different polarization properties with respect to auxin.</p><p>Exploring this hypothesis, here we present the functional analysis of both the SoPIN1 and PIN1 protein clades in Brachypodium, a species with the canonical two-clade family structure. We show that SoPIN1 and the PIN1 clade members PIN1a and PIN1b have different functions during Brachypodium development, with SoPIN1 being required for organ initiation during the flowering phase, and PIN1a and PIN1b regulating stem growth. Using heterologous expression in Arabidopsis we show that the SoPIN1 and PIN1b proteins have different accumulation, polarization, and transport behaviors that result in different functional properties independent of transcriptional context. In addition to elucidating several ways in which PIN family members can be functionally distinct, these results suggest that the Arabidopsis AtPIN1 protein represents an example of an evolutionary phenomenon the opposite of subfunctionalisation in which protein functions are amalgamated into a single protein rather than diversified amongst paralogs. AtPIN1 has a repertoire of roles and associated polarization behaviors that are distributed among several clades of PIN proteins in most flowering plants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The SoPIN1 and PIN1 clades have different functions in Brachypodium</title><p>We targeted Brachypodium <italic>SoPIN1</italic>, <italic>PIN1a</italic> and <italic>PIN1b</italic> with gene-specific Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and for all three genes recovered independent single base-pair lesions causing frame shifts and premature stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The wild-type Brachypodium inflorescence meristem normally makes several lateral spikelet meristems (lsm) before producing a terminal spikelet meristem (tsm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Derbyshire and Byrne, 2013</xref>). Both lateral and terminal spikelet meristems are consumed in the production of florets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>). The <italic>sopin1-1</italic> inflorescence meristems had severe organ and spikelet branch initiation defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which resulted in reduced total whole-plant spikelet number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). When spikelets did form, <italic>sopin1-1</italic> spikelet meristems were often devoid of new organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and very few recognizable florets were produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).

PIN1b fails to accumulate in epidermal tissues where AtPIN1 and SoPIN1 remain high, whereas SoPIN1 accumulates in the mature cortex and pith tissue where AtPIN1 and PIN1b do not.

The lack of complementation mediated by PIN1b was not caused by silencing or low expression level because abundant PIN1b signal was observed in <italic>pin1-613</italic> meristems (23 of 26 <italic>pin1-613</italic> meristems from 7 events). In contrast to the wild-type background, most PIN1b expressing <italic>pin1-613</italic> samples had abundant epidermal expression forming a ring-shaped domain around the meristem apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref> arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) (14 of 19 meristems from 6 events). Also unlike the wild-type background, PIN1b in the epidermis of <italic>pin1-613</italic> meristems was more consistently targeted to the membrane and was often polar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). However even with this elevated polar expression in the meristem epidermis, PIN1b was unable to mediate organ initiation in <italic>pin1-613</italic> mutants. Below the apex PIN1b was polarized rootward in <italic>pin1-613</italic> meristems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), forming defined traces associated with the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and L</xref>). In the basal stem of <italic>pin1-613</italic> mutants PIN1b accumulated in a pattern similar to wild-type, although the arrangement of vascular bundles was irregular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Remarkably, despite clear polar PIN1b expression in <italic>pin1-613</italic> mutant stems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>), PIN1b was unable to rescue bulk auxin transport in this tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Because PIN1b seemed to form more defined sub-epidermal traces than SoPIN1 (Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> panels B and C, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I and L</xref>) we thought PIN1b combined with SoPIN1 may improve the partial SoPIN1-mediated complementation of <italic>pin1-613</italic>.

We wanted to test specifically the ability of SoPIN1 and PIN1b to perform this epidermal function. In order to drive increased PIN1b expression in the epidermis and to help reduce transgene position-effect variation of expression level, we utilized a two-component expression system in the Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> (L<italic>er</italic>) background to drive SoPIN1 and PIN1b under the control of the epidermis-enriched Arabidopsis ML1 promoter (Hereafter designated <italic>proAtML1</italic>&gt;&gt;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lenhard and Laux, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sessions et al., 1999</xref>). Under the control of <italic>proAtML1</italic> we achieved consistently high epidermal accumulation of both SoPIN1 and PIN1b, but similar to the <italic>proAtPIN1</italic> driven expression described above, only SoPIN1 showed clear convergent polarization patterns around the sites of organ initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>) (11 of 11 meristems from 2 events). Despite consistently high epidermal expression with this system, PIN1b polarity remained difficult to determine and in many cells the abundance of protein on the membrane remained low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) (13 of 13 meristems from 2 events). Instead PIN1b accumulated in intracellular bodies, especially in the cells of the apical dome and the central domain of initiating organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> panels A-D).

In contrast, SoPIN1 is abundant in the meristem epidermis and accumulates in the mature cortex and pith tissues where AtPIN1 and PIN1b do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> arrows). Because we observed clear AtPIN1 accumulation in the immature pith (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> panel D), this suggests that <italic>proAtPIN1</italic> is at least initially active in pith tissue and that the PIN1 clade members AtPIN1 and PIN1b are removed later in development, while SoPIN1 is not. Laser capture micro-dissection and RNAseq of mature stem tissue has detected abundant <italic>AtPIN1</italic> transcription in the mature pith (T. Greb, personal communication, February 2017) suggesting that even at maturity AtPIN1, and probably PIN1b, are actively cleared post-transcriptionally from this tissue. Our results suggest that the AtPIN1 expression domain is far broader than is indicated by the protein accumulation pattern and further highlight the importance of PIN post-transcriptional regulation for controlling PIN tissue-level abundance.</p><p>In Arabidopsis endogenous PIN family members show a degree of cross-regulation where loss-of-function mutations in one PIN family member result in tissue-level accumulation of a different PIN in a compensatory pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blilou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Paponov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vieten et al., 2005</xref>).

This sensitivity of SoPIN1 and PIN1b to the presence of AtPIN1, even while under the <italic>AtPIN1</italic> promoter, suggests that wild-type AtPIN1 is able to compete with SoPIN1 and PIN1b post-transcriptionally for residency at the membrane.

Alternatively, the lack of increased SoPIN1 and PIN1b accumulation in the <italic>pin1-4</italic> mutant background may be because the AtPIN1 protein produced in <italic>pin1-4</italic> is still able to compete with the other expressed PINs.

PIN1b interaction with <italic>pin1-4</italic> in the outer cortex of the stem may also explain the ability of PIN1b to rescue bulk transport in the basal internodes of <italic>pin1-4</italic> mutants while it cannot in the null <italic>pin1-613</italic> allele. Partial <italic>pin1-4</italic> function is further supported by the result that SoPIN1 complementation of the null <italic>pin1-613</italic> allele is incomplete and because of flower defects the plants are sterile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), while SoPIN1-mediated complementation of <italic>pin1-4</italic> is complete and flowers are phenotypically normal and set seed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Accordingly SoPIN1 convergent polarization patterns are more evident in the presence of <italic>pin1-4</italic> than they are during complementation of the null <italic>pin1-613</italic> allele (Compare 5A and 6E), further evidence that residual <italic>pin1-4</italic> function augments SoPIN1 during <italic>pin1-4</italic> complementation.

In the model, SoPIN1 orients toward the adjacent cell with the highest auxin concentration thus transporting auxin up the concentration gradient and providing a positive feedback to concentrate auxin into local maxima. In contrast, in the model PIN1a and PIN1b proteins are allocated in proportion to net auxin flux thus providing a positive feedback in which flux through the tissue is amplified by the allocation of PIN1a/b in the direction of that flux. The assignment of two different polarization modes was previously used to describe the behavior of AtPIN1 during organ placement and vein patterning using an auxin-concentration based switching mechanism between the up-the-gradient (UTG) and with-the-flux (WTF) polarization modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayer et al., 2009</xref>).

The <italic>sopin1, pin1a</italic> and <italic>pin1b</italic> phenotypes in Brachypodium are consistent with different polarization modes. SoPIN1 is required for organ initiation and the formation of auxin maxima in Brachypodium, which is primarily modeled using UTG polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jönsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2006</xref>).

More specifically, perhaps an UTG mechanism dominates the epidermis while a WTF mechanism is utilized in the internal tissues and different PINs interact equally with these context-dependent mechanisms. Our heterologous expression studies do not exclusively support context-dependent or protein-dependent mechanisms for SoPIN1 and PIN1 polarization. It is clear that alone only SoPIN1 and AtPIN1 show the convergent polarization patterns associated with UTG polarization, and alone only SoPIN1 and AtPIN1 are thus able to mediate organ initiation, while PIN1b cannot. On the other hand, all three PINs are capable of rootward polarization in the basal internode tissue and PIN1b can be co-opted to convergent polarization at the meristem epidermis in the presence of <italic>pin1-4</italic>. The results presented here do not demonstrate whether within a single cell SoPIN1 and PIN1b would orient differently with respect to auxin as might be expected for the dual polarization model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Connor et al., 2014</xref>). However such context-independent polarization behavior was previously observed for PIN1 and PIN2 in the root where both PINs can polarize in opposing directions within a single cell type when expressed in the PIN2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wisniewska et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Outlook</title><p>In total our Brachypodium mutant phenotypes and heterologous expression results point to multiple levels at which PIN family members can be functionally distinct. Differential membrane targeting, tissuelevel accumulation, transport activity, indirect or direct interaction and the resultant polarity may all contribute to the dynamics of PIN action during plant development. In most flowering plants two PIN clades, SoPIN1 and PIN1, with differing functions and differing transcriptional and post-transcriptional properties mediate auxin transport in the shoot, but these properties are seemingly combined into AtPIN1 in Arabidopsis and other Brassicaceae species. Because PIN1b alone is unable to mediate organ initiation while AtPIN1 can, and these two PINs are both members of the same clade, AtPIN1 may have gained the ability to form convergent polarization patterns and mediate organ initiation after or coincident with the loss of the SoPIN1 clade. Indeed when comparing Brassicaceae PIN1 proteins against a broad sampling of other angiosperm PIN1 proteins, the Brassicaceae PIN1 proteins have several divergent protein domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting possible neofunctionalization within the Brassicacea family. Alternatively an expansion of the PIN3,4,7 clade is also characteristic of Brassicaceae species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bennett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Connor et al., 2014</xref>), making it possible duplicated members of this clade buffered the loss of SoPIN1. However there is no indication that PIN3,4,7 have a role in organ initiation in the inflorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guenot et al., 2012</xref>). Regardless, we believe the combination of SoPIN1 and PIN1 characteristics into AtPIN1 coincident with the loss of the SoPIN1 clade represents a form of reverse-subfunctionalization, the combination of functions originally split between homologs into a single protein after gene loss. It is not surprising that PINs may be particularly amenable to this kind of functional evolution because, as described above, there are several post-transcriptional regulatory steps that ultimately combine to control PIN function in plants. The output of auxin transport is the sum of an extensive network of post-transcriptional interactions that all act to regulate auxin transport itself, and this gives the system plasticity during development and perhaps also over evolutionary time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>sopin1-1</italic>, <italic>pin1a-1,</italic> and <italic>pin1b-1</italic> creation with CRISPR</title><p>SoPIN1 (Bradi4g26300), PIN1a (Bradi1g45020) and PIN1b (Bradi3g59520) were targeted with CRISPR using vectors developed for rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miao et al., 2013</xref>).

One fascinating, but confusing element of PIN1 polarization and auxin transport is that they are sometimes acting in &quot;with the flux&quot; way, and sometime &quot;up the gradient&quot;. Making the critical observation that the Brassicas are unusual in having lost the sister of PIN1 (SoPIN1) clade, but that this is retained in grasses, O'Conner and colleagues test whether these two functions ascribed to Arabidopsis PIN1 might be separable in another species. This work is a nice follow up from modeling papers by the same authors and introduce what is potentially a powerful system for future studies. I liked where this was going, but found there were several areas where the conclusion outstripped the data and that different experiments could give them much more power to address the interesting questions. Major issues 1-4 are listed below.</p><p>1) Choice of Arabidopsis rather than native context has some limitations. To address the question of differential functions/duplications, this is obviously the right choice. However, when it comes time to discuss what these Brachy proteins do, interpretations must be more cautious. Given the capacity shown by this group and others to make transgenics and CRISPRs, more analysis in Brachypodium should be possible and would enable the authors to be able to say much more about the divergence in function between the Brachy proteins.</p><p>2) The AtPIN1pro-driven expression of the Brachy proteins showed clear differences between them, but the relationship between these patterns and AtPIN1pro was unclear. Is the broad expression of soPIN1 because the AtPIN1 promoter is actually expressed here and AtPIN1 is regulated at the protein level to be less? Or are there sequences in soPIN1 (genomic?) that are influencing expression in the heterologous system?</p><p>3) The relevance of the non-polar localization of <italic>Pin1b</italic> is not clear; is it aggregating or endosomal (i.e., does this represent a regulated difference)? The images are not clear enough to tell. In general, given the imaging capacities at SLCU and the fact that these studies were done in Arabidopsis, the image quality in close-ups should be higher.</p><p>4) The portion about differences in rescuing <italic>pin1-613</italic> vs. <italic>pin1-4</italic> is potentially interesting, but it is critical to ensure that it is the specific allele of <italic>pin1</italic>, not the absence of ERECTA that is responsible for difference in behavior. Second, does PIN1-4-GFP actually behave as predicted in the model? Can it be differentially recruited?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>O'Connor et al. describe a thorough analysis of the differences in function between two Brachypodium PIN proteins: SoPIN1 and PIN1b. Most research on PIn proteins has been performed in Arabidopsis, that O'Conner et al. previous showed to lack a specific subclade of PIN proteins, named SoPIN1. It was also previously shown that SoPIN1 and PIN1b have different localization patterns in Brachypodium, but it remained an open question whether there was a functional difference between the two proteins. Here, the authors generate CRISPR/Cas9 mutants in the SoPIN1 and PIN1b genes and show that SoPIN1 appears to represent the functional ortholog of Arabidopsis PIN1, while PIN1b plays a different, and more subtle role in development. Next, by using Arabidopsis wild-type and two different <italic>pin1</italic> mutant alleles as a model, the authors show that the two proteins also behave differently when heterologously expressed. Again, SoPIN1 behaves more like AtPIN1, while BdPIN1b has different properties. This is in line with the finding that SoPIN1 is more effective at complementing a null allele of AtPIN1 than PIN1b is. The authors present several speculations on the basis for these differences.</p><p>All in all, the work is sound and provides an important perspective on diversification of PIN1-related proteins, as well as the evolutionary paths of this function. There are several issues that need to be clarified or elaborated upon:</p><p>1) The comparison of SoPIN1 and PIN1B in Brachypodium could have been developed further. Is the difference based on protein properties or does the pattern and level of expression contribute to different function? The authors raise this question, which can in fact be addressed in Brachyposium, but move to Arabidopsis to address it. The <italic>pin1-4</italic> complementation assay in Arabidopsis suggests that both proteins can perform the same function in at least this context. It would be helpful if the authors complemented the <italic>sopin1</italic> mutant with PIN1B driven by the SoPIN1 regulatory sequences.</p><p>2) The differential accumulation of SoPIN1 and PIN1b in Arabidopsis requires more explanation. First, the statements about subcellular localization could be better supported by high-magnification images. Second, the accumulation of SoPIN1 in the pith tissue is remarkable. Is the AtPIN1 promoter expressed there? Is this due to differential protein stability or are there cis-elements for expression regulation in the SoPIN1 coding sequence (as was shown for MP in Marcus Heisler's lab; Bhatia et al., Curr. Biol. 2016)?</p><p>3) The authors convincingly show that the two Brachypodium PIN proteins behave differently in Arabidopsis when expressed from the same promoter, but is somewhat unsatisfying that there are no indications as to the nature of these differences. Given that genetic materials are readily available, it would be good if the authors tested whether the different localization patterns are associated with altered trafficking or degradation. For both these properties, standardized drug treatments (BFA, wortmannin, MG132, etc.) are established, and even roots could be used since the proteins are expressed from the AtPIN1 promoter.</p><p>4) The interpretation of the complementation experiment in the <italic>pin1-4</italic> background is somewhat problematic. It is presented as a distinction between a null allele (the Col T-DNA insertion; <italic>pin1-613</italic>) and a missense allele (<italic>pin1-4</italic>). However, since the <italic>pin1-4</italic> allele is in a Landsberg background, an alternative explanation is that there are ecotype-specific modifiers that affect that ability of the different PIN1 homologues to act in Arabidopsis. This should at least be discussed as an alternative explanation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by O'Connor and colleagues explores the functionality of proteins from two clades of PIN1-related transporters present in Brachypodium, PIN1 and SoPIN1, to deepen our understanding of PIN polarization processes and PIN-regulated patterning at the shoot apical meristem. SoPIN1 has been lost in Brassicacea and some of the authors (including the first authors) previously proposed that proteins form the two clades had different properties in their capacity to polarize in brachypodium while the unique PIN1 from Brassicacea would have evolved to have all the range of properties and/or functions shown by the two ancestral proteins. The manuscript includes a significant amount of work describing mutants in PIN1b and SoPIN1 in Brachypodium and the polarization patterns and phenotypes obtained upon heterologous expression in Arabidopsis. From the different phenotypes of the Brachypodium mutants and from the different capacities of the proteins to complement Arabidopsis <italic>pin1</italic> mutants, the authors conclude that 1) the two types of PIN1-related proteins have different functions and 2) there might be functional differences although their Discussion clearly highlights the fact that their data are far from being conclusive on this aspect of the work.</p><p>There are in my view two major problems in this work:</p><p>1) As SoPIN1 and PIN1a and b have different patterns of expression, it is not such of a surprise that they would have different functions but showing it properly using mutant of Brachypodium would clearly be a strength of the manuscript. However only mutants for PIN1b have been obtained and the authors justify this by saying that PIN1a &quot;accumulates at the site of vein formation after the organs begins to grow&quot;. Not only is this a limited justification for an absence of redundancy between these two close homologs of PIN1 but this statement surprisingly misrepresents published data from some of the authors showing that PINa is likely co-expressed with PINb in the vein before any sign of organ outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref> in O'Connor et al. PLoS Comp Biol 2014 and corresponding text stating that PINa and PIN1b are expressed starting from i1). Thus, the authors cannot conclude from the single <italic>pin1b</italic> mutant that &quot;PIN1b is expendable for organ initiation&quot; and this weakens the rest of the study.</p><p>2) The heterologous expression of PIN1b and SoPIN1 in Arabidopsis is an interesting strategy but also a dangerous one as little is known on the mechanisms of polarity in Arabidopsis and it is also not known whether any of the knowledge from Arabidopsis is valid in other species. The authors use translational version of the proteins with Citrine and nothing is said about the site of Citrine insertion. The site of insertion of a fluorescent protein is known to have the capacity to affect polarity of PINs (Wisniewska et al. Science 2006) and nothing tells us that the polarization capacities of PIN1b and SoPIN1 translational fusions are not affected by the insertion. Proving it would require proof that they polarize normally in Brachypodium and/or that they complement the phenotype. Along the same line, overexpression of PIN1 can affect its polarity (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> of Benkova et al. Cell 2003). This could explain some of the results observed with loss of polarity of PIN1b and SoPIN1. It could perhaps also explain why PIN1b is less polar – and also seen in what could be vacuoles – (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) only when the endogenous PIN1 is also present. This and also the absence of knowledge on the stability of the proteins are some of the reasons that make the results presented very difficult to analyze. There are a few other reasons such as the number of transgenics that is somehow low (e.g. 7 lines expressing PIN1b under AtPIN1 promoter is not sufficient to conclude that it cannot complement <italic>pin1-6</italic>, especially when it can complement <italic>pin1-4</italic>). At the end and despite the amount of works it represents, the manuscript does not really bring new knowledge to the very complex problem of how PINs get polarized. Going beyond the simplest conclusion that is that PINb and SoPIN1 might have different activities and cellular properties seem difficult with the data presented. And even this conclusion is not entirely convincing when one consider the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> that show very nice polarization patterns towards flower initia with both PIN1b and SoPIN1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31804.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) Choice of Arabidopsis rather than native context has some limitations. To address the question of differential functions/duplications, this is obviously the right choice. However, when it comes time to discuss what these Brachy proteins do, interpretations must be more cautious. Given the capacity shown by this group and others to make transgenics and CRISPRs, more analysis in Brachypodium should be possible and would enable the authors to be able to say much more about the divergence in function between the Brachy proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that more can be done in Brachypodium. We added <italic>pin1a</italic> single and <italic>pin1a/b</italic> double mutant analyses, which provide a more complete genetic dissection of the SoPIN1 and PIN1 clades in Brachypodium. Along with these additional mutant genotypes we have provided SEMs of meristem defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-E</xref>) and improved quantification of mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H-I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We have also added Brachypodium complementation experiments that show the previously published native reporters can complement the single-mutant phenotypes of <italic>sopin1</italic> and <italic>pin1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Combined we believe these experiments provide a greatly improved analysis of the native Brachypodium protein functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The AtPIN1pro-driven expression of the Brachy proteins showed clear differences between them, but the relationship between these patterns and AtPIN1pro was unclear. Is the broad expression of soPIN1 because the AtPIN1 promoter is actually expressed here and AtPIN1 is regulated at the protein level to be less? Or are there sequences in soPIN1 (genomic?) that are influencing expression in the heterologous system?</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided additional imaging of the native AtPIN1 reporter that shows early protein accumulation in pith tissue, suggesting that <italic>proAtPIN1</italic> is at least initially active in the pith (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Laser-capture micro-dissection and RNAseq performed in the lab of Thomas Greb has also detected abundant AtPIN1 transcription in the mature pith. These data suggest that <italic>proAtPIN1</italic> does indeed drive expression in the pith tissue, and that AtPIN1 and PIN1b, but not SoPIN1, are cleared post-transcription.</p><p>If there are additional regulatory sequences within the SoPIN1 coding region, which indeed includes introns and part of the 5’ and 3’ UTRs, we might expect these to drive SoPIN1 in the pith while under the <italic>proAtML1</italic> two-component system, which we do not see. In addition, when we cloned the SoPIN1 and PIN1b coding regions we designed the primers to not include 5’ and 3’ conserved non-coding sequences, which might contain regulatory information. Despite this, we cannot completely exclude the genomic regions as sources of transcriptional information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The relevance of the non-polar localization of Pin1b is not clear; is it aggregating or endosomal (i.e., does this represent a regulated difference)? The images are not clear enough to tell. In general, given the imaging capacities at SLCU and the fact that these studies were done in Arabidopsis, the image quality in close-ups should be higher.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional high-resolution close-ups of PIN1b subcellular localization in wild-type and <italic>pin1-4</italic> meristems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). While these images don’t necessarily provide a clear indication of where PIN1b is accumulating, they are at least consistent with PIN1b accumulation in either the vacuole or golgi, which may indicate a regulated response as has been shown for PIN2 in the Arabidopsis root.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The portion about differences in rescuing pin1-613 vs. pin1-4 is potentially interesting, but it is critical to ensure that it is the specific allele of pin1, not the absence of ERECTA that is responsible for difference in behavior. Second, does PIN1-4-GFP actually behave as predicted in the model? Can it be differentially recruited?</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided immuno-localizations showing that AtPIN1 protein accumulates in the <italic>pin1-4</italic> allele, but not in the null <italic>pin1-613</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). While the presence of protein in <italic>pin1-4</italic> does not directly address the background effects between Col and L<italic>er,</italic> it does provide a clear indication that the two <italic>atpin1</italic> alleles are different, and thus could explain the difference in PIN1b complementation. We maintain that the dramatic difference in PIN1b localization between wild-typeand <italic>pin1-4</italic> within the L<italic>er</italic> background further suggests that the <italic>atpin1</italic> mutant allele is the most likely explanation for the differential complementation. That said, we cannot completely discount background effects, including <italic>erecta,</italic> which has known effects on PIN1 localization. We have added an expanded discussion of the potential for background effects to the Discussion section (subsection “Transport activity”, last paragraph and subsection “Interaction”, first paragraph). In addition, we have begun several new experiments to directly address background effect, and <italic>erecta,</italic> but these will take a significant amount of additional time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] There are several issues that need to be clarified or elaborated upon:</p><p>1) The comparison of SoPIN1 and PIN1B in Brachypodium could have been developed further. Is the difference based on protein properties or does the pattern and level of expression contribute to different function? The authors raise this question, which can in fact be addressed in Brachyposium, but move to Arabidopsis to address it. The pin1-4 complementation assay in Arabidopsis suggests that both proteins can perform the same function in at least this context. It would be helpful if the authors complemented the sopin1 mutant with PIN1B driven by the SoPIN1 regulatory sequences.</p></disp-quote><p>While Brachypodium is indeed more experimentally tractable than other grass models, especially in regards to transgenics, it is far more cumbersome than Arabidopsis. We intend to continue to use both models in the future, and certainly additional experiments in Brachypodium are necessary, including cross-complementation between the clades as the reviewer suggests. The complementation of the <italic>sopin1</italic> and <italic>pin1b</italic> mutantsby their respective native reporters, which has been added to the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) provides important groundwork for these future experiments as it shows that the fusion proteins are at least functional in their native contexts. In the present manuscript, we felt additional genetic analysis with <italic>pin1a</italic> mutants was far more important, especially considering likely genetic redundancy in the PIN1 clade. We hope to be able to report more results in Brachypodium in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The differential accumulation of SoPIN1 and PIN1b in Arabidopsis requires more explanation. First, the statements about subcellular localization could be better supported by high-magnification images. Second, the accumulation of SoPIN1 in the pith tissue is remarkable. Is the AtPIN1 promoter expressed there? Is this due to differential protein stability or are there cis-elements for expression regulation in the SoPIN1 coding sequence (as was shown for MP in Marcus Heisler's lab; Bhatia et al., Curr. Biol. 2016)?</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, we have provided high-magnification images of PIN1b subcellular localization in both wild-type and <italic>pin1-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We have also provided imaging evidence that AtPIN1 is indeed initially expressed in the pith tissues, suggesting that AtPIN1 and PIN1b are cleared post-transcriptionally while SoPIN1 is not. At this time, we cannot address the nature of what features account for this differential accumulation, but this will be an important avenue for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors convincingly show that the two Brachypodium PIN proteins behave differently in Arabidopsis when expressed from the same promoter, but is somewhat unsatisfying that there are no indications as to the nature of these differences. Given that genetic materials are readily available, it would be good if the authors tested whether the different localization patterns are associated with altered trafficking or degradation. For both these properties, standardized drug treatments (BFA, wortmannin, MG132, etc.) are established, and even roots could be used since the proteins are expressed from the AtPIN1 promoter.</p></disp-quote><p>Most drug treatments are indeed standardized for analysis in the root. Unfortunately, we have found that the concentrations of drugs that are effective in the root are not necessarily effective in the shoot (BFA for example), making use of these drugs in the shoot context problematic. Roots could be used for these experiments as the reviewer suggests, but it would be hard to relate results from the root to the functional assays we present here which are focused on the shoot. It is indeed a limitation of the present paper that we cannot explain the nature of the differential behaviors, however, the functional analyses established in the present work will provide ample material to address these differences in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The interpretation of the complementation experiment in the pin1-4 background is somewhat problematic. It is presented as a distinction between a null allele (the Col T-DNA insertion; pin1-613) and a missense allele (pin1-4). However, since the pin1-4 allele is in a Landsberg background, an alternative explanation is that there are ecotype-specific modifiers that affect that ability of the different PIN1 homologues to act in Arabidopsis. This should at least be discussed as an alternative explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the role of genetic background cannot be completely discounted. We added an expanded discussion of possible background effects to the Discussion section (subsection “Transport activity”, last paragraph and subsection “Interaction”, first paragraph). However, as outlined in the Discussion we believe that the dramatic change in PIN1b localization within the L<italic>er</italic> background suggests differences in the <italic>pin1</italic> mutant allele as the most likely explanation for the differential complementation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] There are in my view two major problems in this work:</p><p>1) As SoPIN1 and PIN1a and b have different patterns of expression, it is not such of a surprise that they would have different functions but showing it properly using mutant of Brachypodium would clearly be a strength of the manuscript. However only mutants for PIN1b have been obtained and the authors justify this by saying that PIN1a &quot;accumulates at the site of vein formation after the organs begins to grow&quot;. Not only is this a limited justification for an absence of redundancy between these two close homologs of PIN1 but this statement surprisingly misrepresents published data from some of the authors showing that PINa is likely co-expressed with PINb in the vein before any sign of organ outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref> in O'Connor et al.
