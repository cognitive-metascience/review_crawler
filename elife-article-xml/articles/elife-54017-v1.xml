initiator of type 2 immune responses. We previously characterised the HpARI protein secreted by the model intestinal nematode <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic>, which binds and blocks IL-33. Here, we identify <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> Binds Alarmin Receptor and Inhibits (HpBARI) and HpBARI_Hom2, both of which consist of complement control protein (CCP) domains, similarly to the immunomodulatory HpARI and Hp-TGM proteins. HpBARI binds murine ST2, inhibiting cell surface detection of ST2, preventing IL-33-ST2 interactions, and inhibiting IL-33 responses in vitro and in an in vivo mouse model of asthma. In <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> infection, ST2 detection is abrogated in the peritoneal cavity and lung, consistent with systemic effects of HpBARI. HpBARI_Hom2 also binds human ST2 with high affinity, and effectively blocks human PBMC responses to IL-33. Thus, we show that <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> blocks the IL-33 pathway via both HpARI which blocks the cytokine, and also HpBARI which blocks the receptor.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>allergy</kwd><kwd>asthma</kwd><kwd>Helminth</kwd><kwd>parasite</kwd><kwd>IL-33</kwd><kwd>ST2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Longfonds | Accelerate</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The AWWA project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chauché</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name><name><surname>McSorley</surname><given-names>Henry J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/S000593/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vacca</surname><given-names>Francesco</given-names></name><name><surname>Ogunkanbi</surname><given-names>Adefunke</given-names></name><name><surname>McSorley</surname><given-names>Henry J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>HpBARI is a protein secreted by a parasitic helminth, which binds to and blocks the IL-33 receptor, suppressing IL-33-dependent type 2 immune responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intestinal nematodes such as human hookworms are highly successful parasites, infecting almost 500 million people worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Loukas et al., 2016</xref>). They are associated with immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bethony et al., 2006</xref>), which in turn may reduce the prevalence of immune-mediated diseases such as asthma. Epidemiological studies indicate that hookworm-infected populations tend to have a lower prevalence of diseases such as allergy and asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leonardi-Bee et al., 2006</xref>), although analysis of these studies is complicated by readouts of allergic disease, timing, dose and species of parasitic infection, and non-infectious socioeconomic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McSorley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Santiago and Nutman, 2016</xref>). Studies in animal models of parasitic infection support this association, with suppression of allergic pathology seen after parasitic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chenery et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Obieglo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smits et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>). Suppression of allergic responsiveness or tolerization of the host to parasite and bystander allergens has been hypothesised to be through the release of immunomodulatory secretions from the parasite, which has been supported by numerous studies in mouse models of asthma showing the immunosuppressive capacity of parasite secretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ebner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Finlay et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McSorley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McSorley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trujillo-Vargas et al., 2007</xref>). However, until recently, the specific molecules and mechanisms by which parasites achieve this have remained elusive.</p><p>The IL-33 pathway has critical importance in type two immune responses both in allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bønnelykke et al., 2014</xref>) and helminth parasite ejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coakley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hung et al., 2013</xref>), thus it could be a central factor in parasite immunomodulation and the prevention of asthma. IL-33 is an alarmin cytokine, released from epithelial, endothelial and stromal cells on necrotic cell death caused by noxious stimuli, such as allergen or pollutant inhalation, infections and mechanical damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johansson and McSorley, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mahlakõiv et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spallanzani et al., 2019</xref>). Recent studies also show that mast cells can also be an important source of IL-33 in <italic>H. polygyus</italic> infection, secreting the cytokine in response to damage signals from epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shimokawa et al., 2017</xref>). Extracellular IL-33 binds to its receptor complex, consisting of ST2 (<italic>Il1rl1</italic>) and the IL-1 Receptor Accessory Protein (IL1RAcP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Günther et al., 2017</xref>). IL-33 receptor signalling induces IL-5 and IL-13 production by type two innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), IL-6 from mast cells and IFNγ from NK and γδT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cayrol and Girard, 2018</xref>).</p><p>From studies of the murine model intestinal nematode <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic>, we recently identified the <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> Alarmin Release Inhibitor (HpARI), a protein secreted by a murine intestinal nematode which binds to DNA and IL-33 in necrotic host cells, tethering the cytokine in the nucleus, preventing its release while simultaneously directly blocking binding to its receptor ST2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osbourn et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p><italic>H. polygyrus</italic> also secretes Hp-TGM, a mimic of host TGF-β which induces regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnston et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, both HpARI and Hp-TGM consist of a string of consecutive atypical Complement Control Protein domains (CCP/Sushi/SCR domains, Interpro IPR000436). As proteins containing CCP domains are greatly expanded in <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maizels et al., 2018</xref>), and many of these CCP domain-containing proteins are secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hewitson et al., 2013</xref>) we hypothesised that the CCP domain-containing family represents an immunomodulatory family of proteins.</p><p>Here, we identify the <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> Binds Alarmin Receptor and Inhibits (HpBARI), a protein secreted by the parasite which consists of two atypical CCP domains. HpBARI binds and blocks ST2, inhibiting IL-33 responses in a murine model of asthma. During <italic>H.</italic> polygyrus infection, ST2 detection on peritoneal lavage and lung cells was abrogated, which is consistent with the blocking effects of HpBARI. We furthermore identified a close homologue of HpBARI (HpBARI_Hom2) which is able to bind and inhibit the human form of the IL-33 receptor. This study highlights the importance of IL-33 modulation to <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>, expands the family of CCP domain containing protein immunomodulators from the parasite, and identifies a novel agent with potential for treatment of human IL-33-mediated disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>H. polygyrus</italic> products suppress ST2 detection on immune cells</title><p>HpARI and HES were compared for their ability to block <italic>Alternaria</italic> allergen responses in vivo. While both HES and HpARI could suppress eosinophilia and ILC2 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McSorley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osbourn et al., 2017</xref>), we found significant differences in ST2 detection on lung ILC2s. <italic>Alternaria</italic> allergen administration induced increased expression of ST2, and while HpARI reduced levels of ST2 to that of the PBS control (presumably due to blockade of IL-33 signalling) we found that HES suppressed detection of ST2 on ILC2s to levels far below baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). We therefore hypothesised that a HES constituent distinct from HpARI was able to block ST2 directly. An in vitro assay was set up to further test this, using naïve murine lung cells, cultured for 24 hr with HES. Detection of ST2 on lung ILC2s was reduced in a dose-dependent fashion when HES was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HES contains a factor, distinct from HpARI, which suppresses detection of ST2.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) HpARI (5 μg) or HES (10 μg) were coadministered with 25 μg of <italic>Alternaria</italic> allergen by the intranasal route, and lung cell ST2 staining assessed 24 hr later.

As both HpARI and Hp-TGM consist of atypical CCP domains, these CCP domain-containing candidates were of particular interest. Unlike previous studies where multiple candidate proteins were tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnston et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osbourn et al., 2017</xref>), only Hp_I25642_IG17586_L548 was selected for further testing, due to its identification as a CCP domain-containing protein, and as it had previously been gene synthesized, expressed and tested for HpARI-like IL-33 binding activity (for which it was negative). A codon-optimised sequence encoding the Hp_I25642_IG17586_L548 protein was cloned into an expression vector with an N-terminal 6-His and myc tag and expressed in Expi293F mammalian cells. The expressed protein was predicted to have a molecular weight of 23 kDa, and ran on an SDS-PAGE gel at around 30 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Purified recombinant Hp_I25642_IG17586_L548 showed a dose-dependent ability to suppress ST2 detection on lung ILC2s in vitro, acting at ~100 fold lower concentration than total HES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

SPR experiments confirmed that HpBARI_Hom2 bound more strongly to human ST2 (k<sub>+</sub>=4.8 μM<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, k<sub>–</sub>=2.98×10<sup>−4</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, K<sub>d</sub> = 0.062 nM) than to mouse ST2 (k<sub>+</sub>=7.18 μM<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, k<sub>–</sub>=9.56×10<sup>−4</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, K<sub>d</sub> = 0.138 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>As with HpBARI and mouse ST2, HpBARI_Hom2 blocked interaction of human IL-33 with human ST2. In a SPR assay, the signal seen when human IL-33 was allowed to bind to a human ST2-coated chip was ablated when HpBARI_Hom2 was injected first (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Furthermore, when an oxidation-resistant form of human IL-33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>) was coated onto an ELISA plate and probed with human ST2, HpBARI_Hom2 showed a significantly increased ability to block human IL-33-ST2 interaction compared to HpBARI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Finally, in order to test the effects of HpBARI_Hom2 on human cells, we utilized a robust in vitro IL-33 bioassay where PBMCs are stimulated with IL-12 and IL-33, which synergise to induce IFN-γ production from NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smithgall et al., 2008</xref>). HpBARI_Hom2 blocked IL-33-induced IFN-γ production from human PBMCs (average IC50 of 16 nM or 480 ng/ml, measured by ELISA), while HpBARI had far lower activity (IC50 of &gt;1000 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>)). Therefore, HpBARI_Hom2 is a high-affinity binder of human ST2, and a functional suppressor of human IL-33 responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>IL-33 receptor activation is a potent inducer of type two immune responses which mediate the ejection of helminth parasites (as well as inducing allergic disease), and so the IL-33 pathway represents a central target for parasite immunomodulation. Here, we identify HpBARI, a protein secreted by the intestinal nematode <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>, which binds and blocks ST2, abrogating IL-33 responses. HpBARI prevents IL-33-dependent responses to intranasal <italic>Alternaria</italic> allergen, and abrogated detection (but not transcription) of ST2 in lung cells. HpBARI binds strongly to ST2, preventing IL-33 ligation of the receptor. HpBARI is present in HES, and during <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> infection ST2 detection is abrogated on peritoneal and lung cells, indicating systemic effects of parasite immunomodulation. Furthermore, we identified HpBARI_Hom2, a related protein from <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> which is capable of suppressing human IL-33 responses through the same mechanism.</p><p>HpBARI joins the suite of immunomodulatory activities of <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>, many of which are directed against the IL-33 pathway. We previously identified HpARI from <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> products, a protein which binds IL-33 and genomic DNA, preventing the release of the alarmin cytokine by necrotic host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osbourn et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> also releases miRNA-containing extracellular vesicles which downregulate the transcription of ST2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buck et al., 2014</xref>) and an unknown factor which induces IL-1β release, counter-regulating IL-33 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zaiss et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the IL-33 pathway, and its modulation, appears to be of crucial importance to this parasite.</p><p>During <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> infection, we found abrogated detection of ST2 on ST2-expressing cells such as ILC2s in the peritoneal lavage and lung. Recent papers have noted that ST2 is expressed at a far lower level on ILC2s in the intestine compared to those from the lung, fat or bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ricardo-Gonzalez et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore it may be that <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> acts on immune cells outside of the intestine, rendering them unresponsive to IL-33, and suppressing their activity prior to their recruitment to the site of infection. Interestingly, extracellular vesicles secreted by <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> have also been shown to reduce pulmonary ST2 expression when delivered directly to the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buck et al., 2014</xref>), but our data are the first to suggest systemic reduction in ST2 detection during intestinal helminth infection.</p><p>Our ELISA, immunoprecipitation, SPR and flow cytometry data show that HpBARI can bind effectively to both membrane-bound and soluble forms of ST2. During <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> infection, HpBARI may therefore bind soluble ST2 in circulation, abrogating the effects of the parasite immunomodulator. Blockade of soluble ST2 (rather than membrane-bound ST2) by anti-ST2 antibodies in graft-versus host disease has been suggested to enhance the effects of IL-33, by removing an endogenous inhibitor of IL-33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), but it is still unclear whether these effects seen are due to enhancement or blockade of IL-33 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scott et al., 2016</xref>). Our data suggest that HpBARI suppresses, rather than enhances, IL-33 responses.</p><p>On release, IL-33 is processed by endogenous and exogenous proteases from the full-length protein, stored in the nucleus, to a series of smaller processed forms with increased activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cayrol et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scott et al., 2018</xref>). Full-length IL-33 is presumed to have a lower affinity for ST2 than processed forms, however these measurements have not to date been directly made. HpBARI can outcompete the highest-affinity mature form of IL-33 for binding to ST2, therefore we conclude that HpBARI could abrogate signals from all forms of IL-33.</p><p>The advantage of targeting ST2 rather than IL-33 is that ST2 is constitutively expressed on the surface of many cell types, and therefore could be blocked prior to damage and IL-33 release. IL-33, while constitutively expressed in the nucleus of epithelial cells, is released transiently on damage, and has a very short-lived active form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, HpBARI could prevent the responsiveness of ST2-positive cells to IL-33 before the cytokine has been released.</p><p>Intriguingly, HpBARI and HpBARI_Hom2 are CCP domain proteins, sharing sequence motifs with the previously-identified <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> immunomodulators HpARI and the Hp-TGM family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnston et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osbourn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smyth et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the identification of HpBARI as a suppressor of ST2 signalling cements <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> CCP domain-containing proteins as an immunomodulatory group of secreted proteins. The <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> genome contains &gt;80 CCP domain-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maizels et al., 2018</xref>), many of which can be detected in the parasite’s secretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hewitson et al., 2013</xref>). We now extend the functions of the CCP domain-containing family: HpBARI is a cytokine receptor antagonist, in contrast to Hp-TGM, a suppressive cytokine receptor agonist, and HpARI, a cytokine antagonist. The remainder of this large secreted family of proteins remains to be characterized, and we hypothesise that other modulators of cytokine/cytokine receptor interactions are contained therein.</p><p>As parasite genomes and secretions are becoming better understood, the interactions between parasite proteins and the immune system is becoming further characterized. Recently, an IL-13-binding protein from the intestinal parasite <italic>Trichuris muris</italic> was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bancroft et al., 2019</xref>), indicating that direct binding interactions with molecules of the host immune system are not unique to <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>.</p><p>We found that a homologue of HpBARI is also expressed by <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>, and that this homologue (HpBARI_Hom2) had considerably higher affinity for human ST2. As <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> is not human-infective, it is unlikely that HpBARI_Hom2 evolved to bind human ST2, however this selectivity of binding may be due to the host range of the parasite. Strains of <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> infect wood mice (<italic>Apodemus sylvaticus</italic>), groove-toothed harvest mice (<italic>Reithrodontomys</italic> spp.) and reed voles (<italic>Microtus</italic> spp) as well as <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forrester, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), host species which have a common ancestor 15–20 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steppan and Schenk, 2017</xref>). Thus <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> may have developed subfamilies of its immunomodulators, which have been selected for peak efficacy in each host species.</p><p>In conclusion, we here define HpBARI and HpBARI_Hom2, novel immunomodulatory proteins secreted by the murine intestinal nematode <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>. HpBARI and HpBARI_Hom2 bind directly to ST2, blocking interaction of IL-33 with its receptor, and preventing IL-33-mediated responses. We hypothesise that HpBARI inhibits the initiation of type two immune responses during damage-induced IL-33 release in nematode infection. This study extends the knowledge of parasite immunomodulation, and the interaction between parasite proteins and allergic sensitization. By learning how model parasitic nematodes modulate the host immune response, we may be able to design better vaccines targeted at removing parasite-derived immunosuppression, allowing host ejection of the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McNeilly and Nisbet, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, by learning from these ‘masters of regulation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maizels et al., 2004</xref>), we may be able to develop new treatments for human allergic disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Briefly, a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column was used for size fractionation, to give 25 × 1 ml fractions from approximately 1 mg of starting material. A MonoQ 5/50 GL 1 ml column was used for charge fractionation, with a 40 column-volume gradient from 20 mM TrisHCl pH 8 to a maximum of 30% elution buffer (20 mM TrisHCl + 1 M NaCl pH 8) to obtain 1 ml charge fractions. All HES size and charge fractions were trypsinised and analysed on an on-line LC MS/MS system consisting of a capillary-pump Agilent 1200 HPLC (Agilent, UK) and an Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), and analysed using Mascot (v2.4, Matrix Science).</p><p>Each HES fraction was added to suspensions of murine lung cells (1 μl of fraction in a 200 μl culture volume) and cultured for 24 hr prior to analysis of surface ST2 by flow cytometry. Fractions showing significant suppression of ST2 detection were correlated with abundance of each protein (estimated by emPAI (exponentially modified protein abundance index)) to identify candidates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Helminth-derived recombinant protein and protein biotinylation</title><p>The HpBARI, HpBARI_Hom2 and HpAChE (Accession No. JF439067) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hewitson et al., 2011</xref>) genes were codon-optimised for <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and gene synthesised (GeneArt, Thermo Fisher). HpBARI was synthesised with either sequences encoding 5’ 6-His and c-myc tags, a TEV cleavage site and a 3’ stop codon (HpBARI_N), or 3’ tags (HpBARI_C). HpBARI_Hom2 was gene synthesised with N-terminal tags, while HpACHE was synthesised with C-terminal tags. Each construct was cloned into a pSecTAG2A expression vector (Thermo Fisher) and transfected into Expi293F cells using manufacturer’s instructions for the Expi293F Expression System (Gibco). Protein in supernatants was collected 7 days after transfection, and purified using a HisTrap excel column (GE Healthcare) and 500 mM imidazole used to elute the bound protein. Fractions containing protein of interest were pooled, dialysed to PBS, and repurified on a HiTRAP chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) charged with 0.1 M NiSO<sub>4</sub>.

ST2 primers were purchased from Life Technologies and amplification reaction was carried out in a 25 μl volume made up of 1.25 μl of pre-made primer probe mix, 12.5 μl TaqMan mastermix; 7.5 μl H20; 1.25 μl housekeeping primer; 2.5 μl DNA template. Amplification was carried out using StepOne 48-well plate (Applied Biosystems). PCR data were analysed using the 2<sup>-ΔΔCT</sup> method. In brief, relative gene expression between different samples was calculated using the threshold cycles (CTs) generated by StepOne 48-well plate machine and software. ΔCT for each sample was calculated subtracting CT of the housekeeping gene (RPL37) from the CT of the gene of interest. To obtain the relative gene expression between control group and treatment, ΔΔCTs were then obtained subtracting the average of the control group ΔCTs (e.g. PBS) from the ΔCT of the sample.

The on- (<italic>k</italic><sub>+</sub>) and off-rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>–</sub>) constants and the equilibrium dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) were calculated by global fitting all three surfaces simultaneously to a 1:1 interaction model, with mass transport considerations, to the double reference corrected sensorgrams, using analysis software (v.2.01, GE Healthcare) provided with the BIAcore T200 instrument. Both interactions were extremely well fit by a simple 1:1 interaction model (Chi<sup>2</sup> values of ≤0.1) and showed no evidence of mass transport issues.</p><p>Affinity measurements for HpBARI_Hom2 were performed using multicycle kinetics in PBST buffer (PBS + 0.01% Tween20). Approximately 200 RU of human or mouse ST2-Fc were captured on a Protein A/G chip. HpBARI_Hom2 was reconstituted in PBST buffer at multiple two-fold dilutions (7.5 nM to 0.05 nM) and each was injected at 60 μl/minute for 240 s, with a 300 s dissociation time. The sensor surface was regenerated with 10 mM Glycine pH 1.8 between each cycle. Sensorgrams were fitted to a specific one-site binding model to derive on- and off-rates and the K<sub>d</sub> values. For competition binding assays, approximately 200 RU of human ST2-Fc was immobilized to Protein A/G chip. HpBARI_Hom2 (15 nM) was injected at a flow rate of 60 μl/min. After 100 s, human IL-33 (15 nM) was flowed over HpBARI_Hom2, held onto the chip surface by immobilized human ST2-Fc.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Elia Tait Wojno (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript by Vacca et al., the authors identify a protein found in <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> excretory secretory products (HpBAR1) that binds to murine ST2 and blocks signaling. They also find a similar protein that binds human ST2. While the reviewers were generally enthusiastic about the work, there were questions about the physiological relevance of this protein both during allergic and helminth-specific responses in vivo. In light of the fact that <italic>eLife</italic> expects revisions to be completed within two months, the reviewers consulted and narrowed down the minimal amount of work required for publication. These essential revisions are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data do not establish that HpBARI suppresses Alternaria-induced allergic responses in vivo by binding ST2. To assess this, the authors could treat Alternaria-exposed mice with the C-terminal tagged HpBARI that does not bind ST2 or suppress IL-33-mediated responses efficiently, and then compare the effects of the sub-par protein with that of normal HpBARI. This or a similar experiment would reveal whether the ability of HpBARI to bind ST2 normally impacts it's suppressive effects during Alternaria exposure.</p><p>2) To make this finding more relevant, additional in vivo data would be helpful: They could perform a standard <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> infection followed by staining of ST2 on ILC2s and compare the levels to those in uninfected mice. It might be hard to detect in the small intestine, where ILC2s predominantly express the IL-25R, not ST2. However, it is possible that HpBARI also acts systemically and blocks ST2 on ILC2s at distant sites, i.e. in the lung, adipose, etc.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Vacca, et al. identifies a protein found in <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic> excretory secretory products (HpBARI) that binds to murine ST2, blocks IL-33 binding to ST2, and decreases severity of allergic airway inflammation in mice. They also identify a similar protein that binds to human ST2. The manuscript is well written and clear. These studies fall into the growing field interested in helminth product-based modulation of allergic type 2 inflammation and are of broad interest.</p><p>To fully support the authors' conclusions, there are 3 areas that require additional clarification or data collection.</p><p>1) The data do not establish that HpBARI suppresses Alternaria-induced allergic responses in vivo by binding ST2. The authors could treat Alternaria-exposed mice with the C-terminal tagged HpBARI that does not bind ST2 or suppress IL-33-mediated responses efficiently, and then compare the effects of the sub-par protein with that of normal HpBARI. This or a similar experiment would reveal whether the ability of HpBARI to bind ST2 normally impacts it's suppressive effects during Alternaria exposure.</p><p>2) The authors show a few readouts of Alternaria-induced type 2 inflammation that are impacted by HpBARI treatment, with a focus on effects on ILC2 responses (which is reasonable). However, an expanded analysis of ILC2s and other parameters in the Alternaria model would be helpful to fully understand effects of HpBARI, particularly because recent literature has shown that IL-33 can mediate specific context-dependent effects in ILC2s as regards ability to produce IL-5 vs. IL-13 (Schneider et al., 2019; Ricardo-Gonzalez et al., 2018). The authors can clarify by:</p><p>a) Showing IL-5 ICS from ILC2s in Figure 3 (this helps to compare with previous data published on the effects of HpARI as well from Osbourn et al., 2017)</p><p>b) Showing IL-33 levels in the lung homogenate in Figure 3 or Figure 5 and Figure 4</p><p>c) Showing histopathology of the lung in Figure 3 or Figure 5 and/or Figure 4.</p><p>3) The IFNγ assay in Figure 7F needs to be explained better. If the authors are proposing that HpBARI_Hom2 could be leveraged to develop new therapies for human allergy, it is unclear why they chose to test suppressive effects of HpBARI-Hom2 on human cells using an IL-33-elicited IFNγ production assay. The authors should justify this choice in the text. The authors also need to show data from control conditions in the assay without IL-33 to establish that the effects of HpBARI were mediated via IL-33 and not IL-12.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The capacity of the model helminth <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> and its excretory-secretory (HES) products to modulate host immune responses is well established, but the mechanisms that underlie this suppression are less clear. Previous studies reported various ways, including interfering with the IL-33 signaling pathway. Here, Vacca et al. describe a new <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> protein, HpBARI, which is a constituent of HES. Their data convincingly demonstrate that HpBARI can bind to the mouse IL-33 receptor chain, ST2, thereby blocking the engagement of the receptor by the ligand IL-33 and the downstream activation of type 2 responses. They tested this using a series of biochemical, in vitro and in vivo assays, with all the relevant controls (ST2-/-, competition, etc). Overall, the study is well conducted and clearly written. It represents a solid biochemical characterization of this previously unknown <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>-derived protein. I do not have any major technical criticism.</p><p>However, the relevance of their finding for <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>-mediated suppression of type 2 immunity is completely unclear. Although they demonstrate the potential of this protein to act as suppressor of IL-33-dependent type 2 response, their experiments do not address at all whether this matters in a physiological setting when mice are infected with this helminth (see below for suggestions how to possibly do this). Notably, HES are produced in vitro by culturing adult worms in serum-free cell culture media. This environment is relatively artificial, and the extent to which composition of in vitro-produced HES resembles that of HES produced in their natural niche (lumen of the small intestine), is unclear. Is HpBARI expressed at all under natural conditions, and if so, does it cross the epithelial barrier to block ST2 locally or even systemically to inhibit type 2 responses? Given that HES contains many worm-derived immunosuppressants, it would at some point be necessary to address their relevance. Is there any redundancy or does one of these factors dominate? These studies are very challenging and clearly not the scope of this study. However, without knowing if HpBARI is actually produced in vivo and whether it binds ST2 under those conditions, the relevance of their finding is unclear to me. Although this paper on a technical level clearly fulfills the requirements for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, I am unconvinced that it provides sufficient advance that would make it interesting for a wider scientific community beyond the field of parasitology, particularly given that it is not the first report to demonstrate <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>' interference with the IL-33 signalling pathway.</p><p>1) Rigorous assessment of the relevance of this inhibitory mechanism in a physiological setting would require worm transgenesis, which, to my knowledge, has not been done successfully. However, an alternative way may be to target and neutralize these worm-derived secreted proteins using antibodies or nanobodies. Perhaps the authors have access to such tools? These could also be helpful for the detection of the HpBARI protein in vivo and to assess the degree of binding to ILC2s under physiological conditions by performing an ex vivo staining for ILC2-bound HpBARI following conventional infection with <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>.</p><p>2) To make this finding more relevant, additional in vivo data would be helpful: They could perform a standard <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> infection followed by staining of ST2 on ILC2s and compare the levels to those in uninfected mice. It might be hard to detect in the small intestine, where ILC2s predominantly express the IL-25R, not ST2. However, it is possible that HpBARI also acts systemically and blocks ST2 on ILC2s at distant sites, i.e. in the lung, adipose, etc.</p><p>Currently, this sentence in the Abstract is entirely speculative: &quot;Thus, via HpBARI and HpARI, <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> inhibits both the IL-33 cytokine and its receptor, highlighting the importance of the IL-33 pathway in parasitic infection, the centrality of the CCP domain family to <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> immunomodulation,…&quot;.</p><p>3) The mechanism of blockade is not studied. Is the ST2 protein still on the surface, or is the loss of detection caused by receptor internalization? The authors could stain for intracellular ST2. Also, did the authors test other anti-ST2 antibody clones, which could differ between epitope blocking and loss of surface protein? Does the interaction between ST2-Fc and HpBARI block the binding of the anti-ST2 antibody to ST2 in their ELISA assay?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54017.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data do not establish that HpBARI suppresses Alternaria-induced allergic responses in vivo by binding ST2.

In in vitro assays this limited binding activity could not replicate the suppression of IL-33 responses seen with N-terminal-tagged HpBARI at the concentrations used. However, in vivo some activity was still present, albeit much reduced compared to N-terminal tagged HpBARI. We found that while C-terminal tagged HpBARI tended to reduce eosinophilia, ILC2 responses and ST2 detection in vivo, none of these effects were as profound as those achieved by the N-terminal tagged version of the construct.

These data are very compelling, and will lead to further studies on the kinetics, systemic effects and outcomes of ST2 suppression during <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> infection.</p><p>Unfortunately, these data are presented as the results from a single experiment. We had begun a repeat of this infection, but the government-imposed lockdown in response to the Covid19 outbreak meant that these mice had to be culled prematurely, with no data collected. We have accurately stated the number of replicate mice from the single experiment performed in the legend to Figure 6.</p><p>Our data show that in <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>-infected mice, ST2 detection was potently reduced on peritoneal lavage and lung ILC2s. We also observed a stark ablation of ST2 signal on a highly granular lineage-negative peritoneal population (most likely mast cells). As the reviewer correctly points out, ST2 is very poorly expressed in the intestinal environment, and no change in ST2 signal was detected in ILCs from the mesenteric lymph nodes (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-C).</p><p>Of note, <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> miRNA-containing extracellular vesicles have also been suggested to suppress ST2 transcription, when delivered directly to the lungs (Buck et al., 2014).

In response to the specific suggestions:</p><p>a) As in our previous studies (Osbourn et al., 2017; and McSorley et al, 2014) we found that IL-33 blockade suppressed both IL-5 and IL-13 from ILC2s, but that this effect was more profound on IL-13 production, as even ILC2s from naïve mice produced a strong background IL-5 signal after PMA/Ionomycin/brefeldinA restimulation ex vivo. We have now added further data to address this point, with IL-5 production by ILC2s (and suppression by HpBARI) shown in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1. The context-dependence of IL-33 responses in vivo is clear, with low ST2 expression in the intestinal milieu (see new Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-C), however our data from <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> infection (new Figure 6) implies that HpBARI’s effects may be systemic.</p><p>b) Unfortunately, we could not carry out IL-33 ELISAs on lung homogenates prior to covid-19-related shutdown of our laboratory. We had planned to carry out a batch of these ELISAs on all in vivo samples (including those from new data shown in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1), but could not complete these measurements.</p><p>c) Finally, we have not taken samples for histopathology of the lung from the Alternaria experiments shown. At 24h after Alternaria administration, our previous data has not shown major histological changes in the lung, therefore it is difficult to score for suppression of these responses. In the 17-day Alternaria-OVA model we see major inflammation by histology, which is reduced on suppression of the IL-33 pathway (McSorley et al., 2014 and Osbourn et al., 2017), however this scoring was not repeated in the study presented here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The IFNγ assay in Figure 7F needs to be explained better.

We have now clarified this in the text. This assay is a very robust bioassay for human cell responses to IL-33. It depends upon IL-12 stimulation upregulating expression of ST2 on PBMCs, which, when stimulated with IL-33, then produce large amounts of IFN-γ. As the focus of this manuscript is to show effective blockade of IL-33 signalling, we felt that this bioassay was best suited to give a good titration of HpBARI activity on human cells. We have now added control conditions as requested, in new Figure 8—figure supplement 3, showing that both IL-33 and IL-12 are required for significant IFN-γ release, as has been previously published (Smithgall et al., 2008).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The capacity of the model helminth H. polygyrus and its excretory-secretory (HES) products to modulate host immune responses is well established, but the mechanisms that underlie this suppression are less clear.

They tested this using a series of biochemical, in vitro and in vivo assays, with all the relevant controls (ST2-/-, competition, etc). Overall, the study is well conducted and clearly written. It represents a solid biochemical characterization of this previously unknown H. polygyrus-derived protein. I do not have any major technical criticism.</p><p>However, the relevance of their finding for H. polygyrus-mediated suppression of type 2 immunity is completely unclear. Although they demonstrate the potential of this protein to act as suppressor of IL-33-dependent type 2 response, their experiments do not address at all whether this matters in a physiological setting when mice are infected with this helminth (see below for suggestions how to possibly do this). Notably, HES are produced in vitro by culturing adult worms in serum-free cell culture media. This environment is relatively artificial, and the extent to which composition of in vitro-produced HES resembles that of HES produced in their natural niche (lumen of the small intestine), is unclear. Is HpBARI expressed at all under natural conditions, and if so, does it cross the epithelial barrier to block ST2 locally or even systemically to inhibit type 2 responses? Given that HES contains many worm-derived immunosuppressants, it would at some point be necessary to address their relevance. Is there any redundancy or does one of these factors dominate? These studies are very challenging and clearly not the scope of this study. However, without knowing if HpBARI is actually produced in vivo and whether it binds ST2 under those conditions, the relevance of their finding is unclear to me. Although this paper on a technical level clearly fulfills the requirements for publication in eLife, I am unconvinced that it provides sufficient advance that would make it interesting for a wider scientific community beyond the field of parasitology, particularly given that it is not the first report to demonstrate H. polygyrus' interference with the IL-33 signalling pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their incisive and well-informed comments on this study. We agree that a focus on the role of HpBARI on the parasitic infection would be extremely interesting, and something which will be a subject of future studies. This study, however, was designed to identify novel immunomodulators from parasite secretions, and assess their potential for human use. We further address the reviewer’s specific comments on the role of HpBARI in <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> infection, below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Rigorous assessment of the relevance of this inhibitory mechanism in a physiological setting would require worm transgenesis, which, to my knowledge, has not been done successfully. However, an alternative way may be to target and neutralize these worm-derived secreted proteins using antibodies or nanobodies. Perhaps the authors have access to such tools? These could also be helpful for the detection of the HpBARI protein in vivo and to assess the degree of binding to ILC2s under physiological conditions by performing an ex vivo staining for ILC2-bound HpBARI following conventional infection with H. polygyrus.</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree with the reviewer, both that these would be fascinating studies, and, sadly, that the lack of transgenesis in parasitic nematodes is a continuing stumbling block to this type of research. The reviewer is correct that no transgenesis has yet been achieved in <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>. We agree that another route for assessment of the role of HpBARI would be the use of antibodies against the protein. We have produced polyclonal anti-HpBARI rat IgG, which effectively binds to recombinant HpBARI and a protein within HES (see new data in Figure 8—figure supplement 1). However, despite repeated attempts at optimisation, we could not achieve robust staining by using this reagent as a flow cytometry antibody. We are therefore planning to develop monoclonal antibodies against HpBARI, which could be used for in vivo blocking studies and flow cytometry staining, as the reviewer suggests. These experiments are part of our future plans, but the generation and selection of high affinity monoclonal antibodies can take up to 6 months, and so could not be completed within the timeframe of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To make this finding more relevant, additional in vivo data would be helpful: They could perform a standard H. polygyrus infection followed by staining of ST2 on ILC2s and compare the levels to those in uninfected mice. It might be hard to detect in the small intestine, where ILC2s predominantly express the IL-25R, not ST2. However, it is possible that HpBARI also acts systemically and blocks ST2 on ILC2s at distant sites, i.e. in the lung, adipose, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>See response above to essential revisions.</p><p>Furthermore, we agree with the reviewer that these studies are important, but that the suppression of ST2 in vivo could only be definitive if combined with staining for HpBARI on the surface of cells (see reviewer’s previous point above). This dual stain would allow the identification of those cells which had been affected by HpBARI, and those which express low levels of ST2. In the absence of useable antibodies for HpBARI, we have presented staining for ST2 alone during <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> infection (New Figure 6), and have discussed the strengths and limitations of these data in our Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Currently, this sentence in the Abstract is entirely speculative: &quot;Thus, via HpBARI and HpARI, H. polygyrus inhibits both the IL-33 cytokine and its receptor, highlighting the importance of the IL-33 pathway in parasitic infection, the centrality of the CCP domain family to H. polygyrus immunomodulation,…&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now reworded this part of the Abstract and a similar section in the Introduction to remove the speculative statements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The mechanism of blockade is not studied. Is the ST2 protein still on the surface, or is the loss of detection caused by receptor internalization? The authors could stain for intracellular ST2. Also, did the authors test other anti-ST2 antibody clones, which could differ between epitope blocking and loss of surface protein? Does the interaction between ST2-Fc and HpBARI block the binding of the anti-ST2 antibody to ST2 in their ELISA assay?</p></disp-quote><p>These are very relevant questions, which we have attempted to address. We tried 2 different anti-ST2-APC clones, the first from ThermoFisher (clone RM-ST2-2 – used throughout the manuscript) and the second from Biolegend (clone DIH9) and found that binding of both was ablated. This is now shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1B.</p><p>Unfortunately, our attempts at staining for intracellular ST2 were unsuccessful: fixation and permeabilisation appeared to ablate anti-ST2 antibody binding. We believe the simplest and most likely mechanism is that which is presented here, that HpBARI binds and blocks ST2, preventing ligation of the receptor by the cytokine.</p></body></sub-article></article>
