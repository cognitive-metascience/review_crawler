To examine signal transmission through sub-cellular compartments and its effect on transcription levels in individual cells within a population, we used the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as a model system. Wnt signaling orchestrates a response through nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in the cell population. However, quantitative live-cell measurements in individual cells showed variability in nuclear β-catenin accumulation, which could occur in two waves, followed by slow clearance. Nuclear accumulation dynamics were initially rapid, cell cycle independent and differed substantially from LiCl stimulation, presumed to mimic Wnt signaling. β-catenin levels increased simultaneously at adherens junctions and the centrosome, and a membrane-centrosome transport system was revealed. Correlating β-catenin nuclear dynamics to <italic>cyclin D1</italic> transcriptional activation showed that the nuclear accumulation rate of change of the signaling factor, and not actual protein levels, correlated with the transcriptional output of the pathway.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16748.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16748.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16748.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells in an animal’s body must communicate with one another to coordinate many processes that are essential to life. One way that cells do this is by releasing molecules that bind to receptors located on the surface of others cells; this binding then triggers a signaling pathway in the receiving cell that passes information from the surface of the cell to its interior. The last stage of these pathways typically involves specific genes being activated, which changes the cell’s overall activity.</p><p>Wnt is one protein that animal cells release to control how nearby cells grow and divide. One arm of the Wnt signaling pathway involves a protein called β-catenin. In the absence of a Wnt signal, there is little β-catenin in the cell. When Wnt binds to its receptor, β-catenin accumulates and enters the cell’s nucleus to activate its target genes. One of these genes, called <italic>cyclin D1</italic>, controls cell division. However it was not understood how β-catenin builds up in response to a Wnt signal and influences the activity of genes.</p><p>Using microscopy, Kafri et al. have now examined how the activities of β-catenin and the <italic>cyclin D1</italic> gene change in living human cells. These analyses were initially performed in a population of cells, and confirmed that β-catenin rapidly accumulates after a Wnt signal and that the <italic>cyclin D1</italic> gene becomes activated.</p><p>Individual cells in a population can respond differently to signaling events. To assess whether human cells differ in their responses to Wnt, Kafri et al. examined the dynamics of β-catenin in single cells in real time. In most cells, β-catenin accumulated after Wnt activation. However, the time taken to accumulate β-catenin, and this protein’s levels, varied between individual cells. Most cells showed the “average” response, with one major wave of accumulation that peaked about two hours after the Wnt signal. Notably, in some cells, β-catenin accumulated in the cell’s nucleus in two waves; in other words, the levels in this compartment of the cell increased, dropped slightly and then increased again.</p><p>So how does β-catenin in the nucleus activate target genes? Kafri et al. saw that the absolute number of β-catenin molecules in the nucleus did not affect the activity of <italic>cyclin D1</italic>. Instead, cells appeared to sense how quickly the amount of β-catenin in the nucleus changes over time, and this rate influences the activation of <italic>cyclin D1</italic>.</p><p>Importantly, problems with Wnt signaling have been linked to diseases in humans; and different components of the Wnt signaling pathway are mutated in many cancers. An important next challenge will be to uncover how the dynamics of this pathway change during disease. Furthermore, a better understanding of Wnt signaling may in future help efforts to develop new drugs that can target the altered pathway in cancer cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16748.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16748.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>signalling</kwd><kwd>transcription factor dynamics</kwd><kwd>live-cell imaging</kwd><kwd>transcriptional kinetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shav-Tal</surname><given-names>Yaron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001698</institution-id><institution>Israel Cancer Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shav-Tal</surname><given-names>Yaron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Imaging of single cells within a cell population shows the correlation between subcellular accumulation of β-catenin and the transcriptional activation of a target gene.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Imaging of gene expression in individual cells using quantitative microscopy has become a central experimental approach for unraveling the dynamic aspects of mRNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darzacq et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coulon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hager et al., 2009</xref>), and for examining various events of gene expression in real time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Darzacq et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huranová et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brody et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>).

Studies of transcription factor dynamics in single cells in response to signaling have revealed dynamic aspects of transcription factor nuclear translocation and modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kalo and Shav-Tal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yissachar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lahav et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Loewer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vartiainen et al., 2007</xref>). This study centers on the dynamics of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and its control of <italic>cyclin D1</italic> gene expression, as a model system for examining the dissemination of a signal in the cell and the transcriptional response it elicits.</p><p>The Wnt/β-catenin canonical signaling pathway is activated by the binding of the Wnt ligand to plasma membrane receptors, thereby triggering downstream events that culminate in the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and its translocation into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krieghoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jamieson et al., 2011</xref>). The interaction of β-catenin with transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family in the nucleus modifies gene expression of crucial genes, thus leading to changes in key cellular pathways, such as proliferation, migration and cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cadigan and Waterman, 2012</xref>). Mechanistically, in the absence of Wnt, cytoplasmic β-catenin protein is constantly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stamos and Weis, 2013</xref>) via the ‘destruction complex’ and proteosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberle et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Salomon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Orford et al., 1997</xref>), thus preventing β-catenin nuclear targeting. In many pathological cases β-catenin is not degraded but accumulates in the nucleus and activates genes, some of which are associated with cell proliferation, such as <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>cyclin D1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shtutman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tetsu and McCormick, 1999</xref>).

While the endpoint of β-catenin protein stabilization by Wnt signaling has been well studied biochemically, the kinetic aspects of this signaling pathway in living cells, for the β-catenin protein and the target mRNA, remain under-studied. To address this topic we used a cell system for the in vivo visualization and analysis of the mammalian mRNA transcriptional kinetics of single alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yunger et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">2013</xref>). Whereas, we had previously followed transcription from a single <italic>cyclin D1</italic> (<italic>CCND1)</italic> gene in living human cells, we now set out to examine the real-time behavior of β-catenin during active signaling in a population of living cells, and the effect of signaling on the activity pattern of the target gene.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>System for studying Wnt/β-catenin signaling and gene activation in single living cells</title><p>We previously generated a cell system in which a <italic>CCND1</italic> gene was integrated as a single copy allele into human HEK293 cells using Flp-In recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yunger et al., 2010</xref>). Transcription kinetics on this gene were visualized and quantified using RNA FISH and live-cell imaging techniques. RNA tagging was achieved using a series of MS2 sequence repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertrand et al., 1998</xref>) inserted into the long 3’UTR of <italic>CCND1</italic>. The MS2 repeats form stem-loop structures in the transcribed mRNA. By co-expressing a fluorescent coat protein termed MS2-CP-GFP that binds to the MS2 stem-loops, we obtained fluorescent tagging of the mRNAs produced from this gene, designated <italic>CCND1-MS2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yunger et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">2013</xref>). This <italic>CCND1-MS2</italic> allele is under the regulation of the endogenous <italic>cyclin D1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albanese et al., 1995</xref>) and therefore serves as a candidate gene for activation by Wnt/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fu et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Studying individual living cells, we found that the <italic>CCND1-MS2</italic> gene transits between transcriptionally active and non-active states under steady-state conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yunger et al., 2010</xref>). At steady state, only around 40–50% of the cells were actively transcribing <italic>CCND1-MS2</italic>.

In summary, this cell system enables the measurement of <italic>CCND1</italic> transcription activation kinetics in single cells following Wnt signaling.</p><p>To mimic endogenous β-catenin distribution using YFP-β-catenin, we generated a HEK293 <italic>CCND1-MS2</italic> cell clone that stably expressed YFP-β-catenin. Since high overexpression conditions of YFP-β-catenin typically result in increased subcellular distribution and high accumulation in the nucleus prior to any signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>), which is in stark contrast to the endogenous β-catenin protein that is observed mainly at the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), we screened and identified a clone that stably expressed low levels of YFP-β-catenin. The clone phenotypically resembled endogenous protein localization and distribution, namely, membrane localization in the non-induced state, and enhanced nuclear localization following Wnt stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Characterization of endogenous β-catenin and YFP-β-catenin accumulation levels by Western blotting showed that YFP-β-catenin expression levels were ~80% of the endogenous β-catenin, thus doubling β-catenin levels in the cell, and that the accumulation dynamics of both proteins were identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). The time-scale of β-catenin induction is in agreement with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hernández et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lustig et al., 2002</xref>).

Subsequently, the rate of change turned negative, meaning that β-catenin levels were declining, probably due to degradation. In control cells, the rate of change in β-catenin remained unaltered.</p><p>To examine whether the dynamics of nuclear entry of β-catenin were modified during Wnt activation and how they compared to β-catenin shuttling out of the nucleus, we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Nuclei of cells showing nuclear β-catenin, either after 2 hr of Wnt3a activation or transiently overexpressing β-catenin, were photobleached, and nuclear import of β-catenin was monitored over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref> top). The dynamics were relatively slow, however, the import rate under Wnt3a conditions was more rapid than transient overexpression, showing the advantage of measurements performed at low expression conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). The incomplete recovery of YFP-β-catenin during the FRAP time-course meant that a significant population of β-catenin molecules had already accumulated and had been retained in the nucleus prior to photobleaching. Next, we photobleached the cytoplasm and found that the rate of β-catenin shuttling out from the nucleus was slower than the import rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref> bottom, c, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). Similarly, fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP), either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm, showed that β-catenin shuttling out of the nucleus was slower than its nuclear entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). Altogether, the data suggest that Wnt signaling causes a transient shift in the dynamic interplay between β-catenin stabilization and degradation processes, towards protein stabilization and accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Individual cells in the population present a variable response of β-catenin dynamics</title><p>The averaged population data obtained from living cells presented above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) are in agreement with biochemical data as seen by Western blotting of protein extracts from large cell populations, showing the accumulation of β-catenin beginning from around 30 min after Wnt and peaking at 3 hrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hernández et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2012</xref>). However, the averaged behavior of a population does not necessarily represent the actual dynamics in individual cells. Examining the dynamic behavior of β-catenin accumulation in the nucleus and cytoplasm of individual cells after Wnt3a showed that although an increase in β-catenin levels was initiated in most cells, the subsequent dynamics were variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). For instance, comparing cells 1,2 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) showed a major and rapid wave of β-catenin nuclear accumulation in cell 1 (30–165 min) that subsided and then mildly rose again (465–585 min); a similar range of events occurred in cell 2 but the two waves were less intense and the second wave occurred earlier compared to cell 1 (first wave 30–150 min, second wave 330–435 min); in contrast, cell four showed a longer accumulation period (30–240 min). Cells 3 and 6 showed slow nuclear accumulation, peaking late only after 825 min and 525 min, respectively, from Wnt3a stimulation. This analysis showed that the dynamic behavior of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and the nucleus was highly similar within the same cell, but that the time-frames of accumulation could be quite different between individual cells, some showing two cycles of nuclear accumulation. In these cases, the first cycle of accumulation lasted 360 min on average and the second cycle 180 min on average.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16748.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Variability of β-catenin accumulation dynamics following Wnt3a activation in individual cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Frames from time-lapse <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref> showing YFP-β-catenin accumulation in a population of cells.

To test this, we added lithium chloride (LiCl, 20 mM), a glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) inhibitor that mimics Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Klein and Melton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hedgepeth et al., 1997</xref>). Indeed, LiCl caused β-catenin nuclear and cytoplasmic accumulation, but the dynamics were completely different than Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). β-catenin accumulation occurred synchronously and continuously throughout 10–11 hr in all cells, and only then did the accumulation cease. The increasing accumulation rate of change (ΔI/Δt) in the nucleus and cytoplasm continued for 10 hr, compared to 3 hr, in response to Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>). The levels of β-catenin were 4-fold higher in LiCl treated cells compared to Wnt3a. Since LiCl prevents β-catenin degradation, we hypothesized that Wnt3a treatment together with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which stabilizes β-catenin, but not through GSK3β phosphorylation, should have a similar effect on β-catenin dynamics. Indeed, accumulation dynamics under Wnt3a+MG132 were similar to LiCl treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Treatment with MG132 without Wnt3a showed the same dynamics (data not shown). When the curve describing the dynamics of β-catenin in response to Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) was fitted with a two-phase exponential fit that describes production and degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>), we found linear accumulation in the first phase, showing that degradation was very low, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hernández et al., 2012</xref>). β-catenin production rates did not change significantly during the accumulation and clearance phases, whereas, the degradation rate became predominant during the clearance phase. β-catenin degradation had a characteristic time of 2.75 hr. These data exemplify the difference between a signaling molecule and a chemical that target the same signaling pathway. While drug action is less influenced by endogenous molecules, a signaling molecule will relay a transient signaling effect, depending on the level of other signaling molecules that are present in the cell at the time of induction.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-16748-media4.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16748.013</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>YFP-β-catenin dynamics in response to LiCl.</title><p>HEK293 CCND1-MS2 cells stably expressing YFP-β-catenin were treated with LiCl and increased accumulation of the protein was observed.

However, centrosomal levels were significantly higher, five-fold higher compared to the initial state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). The rates of change were the highest and most rapid of all measured cell compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). LiCl also led to β-catenin localization at the centrosome, but here too with very different dynamics from Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1f</xref>). To obtain a more general outlook of the changes in β-catenin levels in all four compartments, we performed a correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c,e</xref>). As was seen in individual cells, the highest correlation in accumulation dynamics following Wnt3a, was observed between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, whereas the lowest correlation was between the centrosome and the membrane.</p><p>Interestingly, in some cells we observed β-catenin puncta detaching from the membrane and traveling in the cell (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Videos 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">11</xref>). When these structures were tracked during movement in the cell, they usually ended up at the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This phenomenon was frequently seen in cells treated with Wnt3a, LiCl and MG132, and less frequently in unactivated cells. We did not observe a correlation with the timing of Wnt addition, and perhaps detection was easier after Wnt due to the increase of β-catenin at the membrane following stimulation. Tracking of the detached β-catenin puncta showed that they reached the centrosome between 30 to 90 min after detachment. To examine whether the residence times of β-catenin molecules at the centrosome resembled the membrane region, we performed FRAP analysis, which showed very rapid recovery kinetics at the centrosome, in comparison to all other cell regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This implied that β-catenin duration at the centrosome is short-lived, with a half-time of fluorescence recovery (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of 1.9 s, similar to other centrosomal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hames et al., 2005</xref>). Altogether, this suggests that the molecular interactions of β-catenin at the membrane in adherens junctions are significantly more stable than at the centrosome, where the exchange of β-catenin molecules is highly rapid.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media10" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-16748-media10.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16748.026</object-id><label>Video 10.</label><caption><title>YFP-β-catenin puncta move from the membrane to the centrosome.</title><p>HEK293 CCND1-MS2 cells stably expressing YFP-β-catenin were treated with Wnt3a.

These dynamics have been characterized using microscopy studies performed in single cells. Biochemical examination of these dynamics can give a true sense of the time-scales of the accumulation as seen by studying protein levels in Western blots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hernández et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lustig et al., 2002</xref>). However, such approaches cannot provide an accurate temporal dynamic profile of the response as it unfolds within the cell, since they represent an average picture of the behavior of the whole cell population from which the proteins were extracted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Levsky and Singer, 2003</xref>). By characterizing β-catenin accumulation dynamics in several subcellular compartments within individual living cells, we could examine how varying responses in individual cells translate into a well-timed response of the cell population.</p><p>Using a cell system we previously generated to follow CCND1 transcription in real-time on the single gene level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yunger et al., 2010</xref>), we now measured β-catenin sub-cellular dynamics, as well as characterized the transcriptional response of <italic>CCND1</italic> to Wnt. Even though Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been highly studied, the basic propagation dynamics of this signal in single living cells have not been characterized. This is due to the lack of an appropriate system that would allow analysis of the behavior of a fluorescent β-catenin protein that resembles the endogenous protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies using transiently overexpressed β-catenin and photobleaching methods were important in establishing the characteristics of its intra-cellular mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krieghoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jamieson et al., 2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">011</xref>). However, the subcellular distribution of transiently overexpressed fluorescent β-catenin is different than the endogenous protein, since the overexpressed protein is found throughout the whole cell including the nucleus (even without a signal), membrane staining is lacking, and cytoskeletal organization is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krieghoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jamieson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ligon et al., 2001</xref>). Even the use of nanobodies targeting endogenous β-catenin in living cells did not mimic the membrane localization of non-induced cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Traenkle et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, using our cell system in which YFP-β-catenin was stably expressed at relatively low levels (80% over the endogenous protein) and was distributed similarly to the endogenous protein, we were able to follow the subcellular dynamics of β-catenin in real-time.</p><p>Upon Wnt activation, β-catenin levels in the cell population portrayed a relatively rapid increase in the cells. The general time-scale of hours of β-catenin accumulation concurred with Western blotting experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hernández et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lustig et al., 2002</xref>), and altogether portrayed an orchestrated response of the cell population to the Wnt signal. However, examination of the accumulation profiles in single cells showed response patterns deviating from the average behavior in at least 20% of the population; accumulation rates and levels varied, and in some cells additional but less intense waves of β-catenin nuclear accumulation were observed. We suggest that the balance between accumulation and degradation affects the outcome in β-catenin build-up in each cell. The Kirschner group has shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hernández et al., 2012</xref>) that Wnt does not completely abolish the activity of the destruction complex. We therefore suggest that if the total levels of accumulation are similar in most cells (e.g. integral analysis), then the level of inhibition of the destruction complex is expected to vary in each cell and to determine the response.</p><p>However, the fact that <italic>CCND1</italic> transcriptional activation occurs within the same time frame as the main initial phase of β-catenin nuclear accumulation means that in most cells in the population, the <italic>CCND1</italic> gene will become activated shortly after Wnt activation. Possibly, later phases of β-catenin nuclear accumulation could have an influence on prolonging <italic>CCND1</italic> activity (steady state activity levels return after 6 hr). Indeed, measurements of <italic>CCND1</italic> activity in living cells following Wnt activation showed a positive change in several parameters relating to gene activation; not only did the frequency of <italic>CCND1</italic> activation in the cell population rise and the time to activate <italic>CCND1</italic> shorten, but the levels of <italic>CCND1</italic> transcriptional output increased, the timeframe of gene activity became substantially longer, and gene resting periods were shortened. Overall, this means that Wnt signaling increases the number of CCND1 mRNAs generated, by increasing the frequency of RNA polymerase II recruitment to the promoter and by lengthening the time of promoter responsiveness. Interestingly, even when an already active <italic>CCND1</italic> gene received the Wnt signal, the levels of gene activity increased.</p><p>Although we were unable to examine YFP-β-catenin dynamics and CCND1-MS2 transcription activity simultaneously in living cells, by integrating the measurements of <italic>CCND1</italic> transcriptional activity with the measured dynamics of β-catenin nuclear accumulation from the separate experiments, we found that the rate of change of nuclear β-catenin correlated well with transcription induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>), specifically during the first rapid phase of nuclear β-catenin accumulation. This fits in well with a previous study demonstrating that the fold change in β-catenin nuclear levels is the element affecting target gene activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goentoro and Kirschner, 2009</xref>), and that the transcriptional machinery is capable of computing the fold change in β-catenin, thereby determining the transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goentoro and Kirschner, 2009</xref>). Similar behavior was observed for the ERK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen-Saidon et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, it is not the absolute number of β-catenin molecules in the nucleus that correlates with transcription rates, but the rate of change of β-catenin levels over time, and particularly the rapid change during the first phase of induction that elicits the transcriptional effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>). The advantage of such a sensing mechanism would be its ability to buffer out cellular noise and variability in the cell population.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16748.033</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Comparing the kinetics of CCND1 transcriptional activation to the dynamics of β-catenin nuclear accumulation rate of change following Wnt signaling in living cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Plots of the average transcriptional activation kinetics of CCND1-MS2 (red) following Wnt3a activation, compared to the plot of rate of change in β-catenin nuclear accumulation (green).

Top - from left to right: Levels of β-catenin (yellow) in the nucleus are normally low but after the addition of Wnt3a to the medium a significant and rapid increase in the nucleus is observed, peaking after 2–3 hr. β-catenin levels later decline in the nucleus and cytoplasm due to degradation. While this is the average behavior in the population (e.g. cells 1 and 2), when examining individual cells, different dynamics such as multiple pulsations (e.g. cell 3) and rapid initial accumulation (e.g. cell 4) are observed. β-catenin levels increase simultaneously at the membrane and at the centrosome. Bottom- β-catenin induces cyclin D1 transcriptional activity (green dot), and modulation of the transcriptional reaction can be observed as the gene reaches higher levels of activity, for longer periods of time.

Generally, while the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin has been the focus of Wnt signaling studies, the membrane region has not been considered a major target of the response. However, one study has shown localization of unphosphorylated β-catenin to the membrane upon Wnt activation within 30 min, in cells lacking E-cadherin, although the function was unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hendriksen et al., 2008</xref>). We found increased β-catenin levels in the membrane following Wnt activation. The punctate membranal pattern persisted during activation, suggesting that Wnt increases the recruitment of β-catenin to existing adherens junctions. Indeed, β-catenin dynamics in the membrane showed a relatively slow exchange both before and after Wnt activation, similar to a study conducted in LiCl induced cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>). This implies long residence times of β-catenin in the membrane and that potential binding sites for β-catenin molecules at adherens junctions exist constantly, and only when the protein becomes abundant, do they fill up.</p><p>Centrosomal localization of β-catenin is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaplan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hadjihannas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bahmanyar et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mbom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vora and Phillips, 2015</xref>). The exact function is not clear and it probably plays a role in regulation of cell separation. It has been suggested that Wnt signaling abolishes the phosphorylation of β-catenin and leads to centrosome splitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hadjihannas et al., 2010</xref>). Our study shows for the first time, the highly rapid accumulation rates of β-catenin at the centrosome in real-time, following Wnt signaling. β-catenin at the centrosome is highly mobile as seen in our FRAP study and in another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bahmanyar et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, we identified a connection between the membranal and centrosomal β-catenin fractions. Puncta of membranal β-catenin were detected moving relatively slowly from the membrane region and ending up at the centrosome, sometimes several in parallel in the same cell. Since unphosphorylated β-catenin is found in the membrane after Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hendriksen et al., 2008</xref>), we can postulate that the β-catenin fraction moving to the centrosome is unphosporylated, and may be involved in driving cell division.</p><p>Notably, our study also provides a temporal view of β-catenin dynamics in single cells under conditions of LiCl activation. Although LiCl is considered a chemical that mimics Wnt activation and increases β-catenin levels in the nucleus, it is obvious that the dynamics, build-up rates and levels of β-catenin in all subcellular compartments were dramatically exaggerated and unregulated in comparison to Wnt activation. This should be taken into account when inferring information regarding Wnt signaling and β-catenin from LiCl treatment.</p><p>The Wnt pathway has been implicated in cell cycle regulation, and levels of phosporylated β-catenin oscillate and increase towards mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson and Niehrs, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hadjihannas et al., 2012</xref>). Examining cells that had undergone mitosis after Wnt activation, did not show a pattern of β-catenin levels in daughter cells, nor did Fucci labeling uncover a cell cycle pattern of β-catenin accumulation following Wnt. This suggests that Wnt-induced nuclear accumulation is not cell cycle dependent.</p><p>The propagation of a signal from a membrane receptor to the gene promoter can follow different types of kinetics. Single-cell analysis revealed significant variability in the dynamics of β-catenin nuclear buildup, but also that most cells did finally accumulate the same total level of β-catenin over time. This behavior is quite different than the serum activation pathway that activates β-actin via MAL shuttling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kalo et al., 2015</xref>). β-actin transcriptional activation begins less than 5 min after serum addition, and β-actin alleles respond in the same manner and same time-frame; i.e. variability of the response in single cells is low. Hence, some signaling cascades must relay the information rapidly and tightly since this will lead to the translation of a highly required protein, e.g. β-actin, to generate a protein that is required for cell motility in response to environmental sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kislauskis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Latham et al., 1994</xref>). Other pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin may also signal to activate gene expression, but their response emerges much later, probably since the required biological outcomes, such as cell proliferation, require more regulation points. The changes in β-catenin levels in response to Wnt, in several subcellular compartments, indicate that the signaling pathway does not only activate gene expression but is involved in additional processes. Further studies should reveal the exact roles of these subpopulations of β-catenin in response to signal transduction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and transfections</title><p>HEK293 Flp-in CCND1-MS2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yunger et al., 2010</xref>) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Biological Industries, Israel) containing 10% FBS (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and hygromycin selection (100 µg/ml; Sigma, Israel).

This step was performed twice for each infection. After mCherry-hCdt1 infection, mCherry positive cells were collected by FACS and maintained in medium containing puromycin (1 μg/ml; Invivogen). Cells were then transfected with the pBABE ecotropic receptor plasmid and 24 hr post-transfection, the cells infected with AmCyan-hGeminin. Positive cells were collected by FACS and maintained in medium containing neomycin (500 μg/ml) and puromycin (1 μg/ml). For infections, HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and used to package the Fucci retroviruses, which were collected over a period of three days before infecting the ecotropic HEK293 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Western blotting</title><p>SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aizer et al., 2008</xref>).

The 3D stacks were deconvolved and the specific signals of mRNAs were identified (Imaris, Bitplane). mRNA identification was performed in comparison to deconvolved stacks from cells not containing the MS2 integration, which therefore served as background levels of nonspecific fluorescence. No mRNAs were identified in control cells. The sum of intensity for each mRNA particle and active alleles was measured in the same cells using Imaris, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yunger et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">2013</xref>). The single mRNA intensities were pooled and the frequent value was calculated. The sum of intensity at the transcription site was divided by the frequent value of a single mRNA. This ratio provided the number of mRNAs associated with the transcription unit from the point of the MS2-region and onwards. As mRNAs should be associated with a polymerase, this number should reflect the maximum number of polymerases engaged with this region. Quantification and counting experiments were applied to experiments performed on different days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fluorescence microscopy, live-cell imaging and data analysis</title><p>Wide-field fluorescence images were obtained using the Cell^R system based on an Olympus IX81 fully motorized inverted microscope (60X PlanApo objective, 1.42 NA) fitted with an Orca-AG CCD camera (Hamamatsu) driven by the Cell^R software. Live-cell imaging was carried out using the Cell^R system with rapid wavelength switching. For time-lapse imaging, cells were plated on glass-bottomed tissue culture plates (MatTek, Ashland, MA) coated by Cell-Tak (BD Biosciences) in medium containing 10% FBS at 37°C. The microscope is equipped with an incubator that includes temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> control (Life Imaging Services, Reinach, Switzerland). For long-term imaging, several cell positions were chosen and recorded by a motorized stage (Scan IM, Märzhäuser, Wetzlar-Steindorf, Germany). In these experiments, HEK293 Flp-in CCND1-MS2 expressing MS2-GFP cells were imaged in 3D (26 planes per time point) every 15 min, at 0.26 µm steps for 6 hr. HEK293 Flp-in CCND1-MS2 cells expressing YFP-β-catenin were imaged in 3D (15 planes per time point) at 0.7 µm steps, every 15 min, up to 18 hr. For presentation of the movies, the 4D image sequences were transformed into a time sequence using the maximum or sum projection options or manually selecting the in-focus plane using the ImageJ software. Time-lapse data were collected from single cells in several fields and on several days until reaching an appropriate sample size, and then all single-cell data were pooled and either averaged and presented as plots, or presented as single cell data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Tracking and data analysis</title><p>The intensity of the active transcription sites labeled with MS2-GFP fluorescence in time-lapse movies was corrected for photobleaching using ImageJ, and the 3D movies were transformed to 2D by choosing the in-focus plane in which the intensity of the transcription site is the highest.

Both aspects are studied in individual live cells, using a YFP‐tagged version of the protein and an MS2-GFP labeled version of the RNA. Mapping the &quot;signaling-to-gene-induction dynamics&quot; (as promised in the title) is indeed an important goal. I was therefore excited about reading the paper. Unfortunately, I ended up rather disappointed, since I felt that the promise was not fulfilled:</p><p>1) Most conspicuously, the authors never actually combine the two reporter systems in the same cell. Thus, there is no single-cell measurement of how β-catenin dynamics and transcription are related, which a-priori seemed like the whole premise of the paper. Even in the Discussion, the authors still state that their approach &quot;combines the real‐time measurements of the signaling protein factor together with gene activity readout in individual living cells&quot;. How so?</p><p>2) There are other instances where the data doesn't match up to the verbal statements. For example, the authors repeatedly mention &quot;the kinetics of nuclear clearance&quot;, &quot;shuttling in and out of the nucleus&quot;, or the &quot;very slow egress&quot; of the protein, but the kinetics of nuclear import/export are never quantified, e.g. by measuring the rate of change in nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio (or difference). Why is that?</p><p>3) The manuscript is also overly long. The Introduction, for example, reads like part of a review article-it broadly surveys the field rather than leading the narrative to the specific questions that will be addressed in the work. Elsewhere, there are multiple occurrences of ambiguous statements. Even the title, to me, is ambiguous unless some hyphens and commas are added. Thus, significant re-writing should be done if the manuscript is accepted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>1) The title needs to be simplified and it should better reflect the main findings of the manuscript.</p><p>2) The manuscript would benefit from simplification. It contains too much data that will prevent the general reader from following the flow of the results and their importance. For example is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> absolutely necessary?</p><p>3) The authors aim is to understand by which mechanism a signalling pathway acting at the cell population level is creating variability in responses at the single cell level. However, this question is not fully answered in this manuscript (see also comment 7).</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>: The authors carry out experiments to verify whether the YFP-β-catenin behaves and is localised similarly to the endogenous protein. Their assays seem to indicate that the addition of Wnt3a has the same effect on the expression of YFP-β-catenin as it has on the endogenous β-catenin. In contrast, the addition of LiCl seems to induce a higher expression of YFP-β-catenin than that of the endogenous β-catenin. (The error bars in the quantification histogram of the LiCl WB are quite big, are these significant?). Following these experiments the authors conclude that the exogenously expressed YFP-β-catenin can be used in the further experiments as it behaves similarly to the endogenous protein. Nevertheless, in these YFP-β-catenin cells the total amount of β-catenin is the double than that in wild type cells and this β-catenin overexpression could lead to misinterpretations.</p><p>5) Along the same lines the authors write, &quot;YFP-catenin is equal to endogenous levels&quot;. As mentioned above, this means that there is a 2x fold increase in the total amount of β-catenin protein that can influence the results obtained with YFP-β-catenin and especially by those studying the target gene activation. At present the authors give the impression that the study is performed in a system in which the total β-catenin is at endogenous levels. It would be better to use a cell line in which the FP tag is knocked in to the wild type β-catenin locus. At minimum, the two-fold total amount of β-catenin in the cells has to be clearly stated.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>: Normalized fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm should be plotted for the same period as for the recovery time in the nucleus. If there is no import, it should be a flat line.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>: In this last figure the authors present a model that is supposed to summarize their findings. While in a cell population they can show that CCND1 transcription is lasting longer than YFP-β-catenin accumulation in the nuclei of the cells, they fail to demonstrate at the single cell level whether in a YFP-β-catenin accumulating cell nucleus an increased CCND1 transcription can be observed at the same time and to same extent. This is a potential weakness of the manuscript that is also reflected in the model, where one does not know in which β-catenin-containing/expressing nucleus the CCND1 transcription is increased, when comparing the cells drawn in the upper row and in the lower row. Would it be possible to quantify the CCND1 transcription in the YFP-β-catenin containing nuclei and correlate the CCND1 expression with the YFP-β-catenin signal in a single cell based measurement series?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Quantifying β-catenin subcellular dynamics and gene expression kinetics during Wnt signaling in single living cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While both reviewers agree that the manuscript is improved, in the ensuing discussion they both also agree that the two reporters in the same cell is a requirement not met. One raises the possibility to modify your conclusions to accommodate this omitted data, the other feels that it is necessary but would agree to oversee a modified manuscript that does not depend on this experiment.</p><p>We all feel the manuscript would be much stronger with the experiment than without, but it's up to you how you want to handle this revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>I do not think that the authors have improved the paper sufficiently to warrant publication. Specifically:</p><p>1) The main request, to &quot;combine the two reporter systems in the same cell&quot;, was not fully met. What the authors did was simultaneously measure β-catenin (protein) and CCND1 (RNA) in FIXED cells. While this measurement can potentially provide useful information, it falls short of the goal of detecting, and correlating, both species in real-time in live cells.</p><p>The way the authors analyze the protein/RNA data also seems strange. They count the total number of CCND1-MS2 RNA molecules per cell and correlate it with the nuclear level of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E, F, G</xref>). However, the total cellular count represents the accumulation of RNA over the lifetime of RNA molecules, which could be hours. To probe the regulatory relation between protein concentration and transcriptional activity, the authors should have instead examined the probability of active transcription, or the amount of nascent RNA, just as they did earlier in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>2) The text needs to be edited and proofread. Proofreading by an English speaker would have helped in some instances (single/plural, misuse of verbs, etc.), but in other instances this is a matter of ambiguous and confusing statements. The editorial team will have to address this problem if the manuscript is chosen for publication. To give just one example, the title, &quot;Quantifying β-catenin subcellular dynamics and gene expression kinetics&quot; implies that both the subcellular dynamics and the gene expression kinetics are those of β-catenin, but this is not actually the case.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors answered (more or less) my comments and made most of the suggested improvements. The manuscript is considerably improved.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16748.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Combine the two reporter systems in the same cell.

This now appears in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> (after reviewer 2 suggested we remove the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Furthermore regarding what is driving the differences between the response in different cells, we have fit the curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> that describes the accumulation and reduction dynamics of YFP-β-catenin in the cell population, and modeled the data. Using this we can now better describe the accumulation phase that does not include degradation, as well as the clearance phase in which degradation kicks in.</p><p>We therefore suggest that the balance between accumulation and degradation is going to affect the outcome in each cell. The Kirschner group has shown (Science 2012) that Wnt does not completely abolish the activity of destruction complex. So we suggest that if the total levels of accumulation are similar in most cells (integral analysis) then is should be the level of inhibition of the destruction complex that varies in each cell and that determines the response.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>I do not think that the authors have improved the paper sufficiently to warrant publication. Specifically:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The main request, to &quot;combine the two reporter systems in the same cell&quot;, was not fully met. What the authors did was simultaneously measure β-catenin (protein) and CCND1 (RNA) in FIXED cells. While this measurement can potentially provide useful information, it falls short of the goal of detecting, and correlating, both species in real-time in live cells.</italic> </p><p><italic>The way the authors analyze the protein/RNA data also seems strange. They count the total number of CCND1-MS2 RNA molecules per cell and correlate it with the nuclear level of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E, F, G</xref>). However, the total cellular count represents the accumulation of RNA over the lifetime of RNA molecules, which could be hours. To probe the regulatory relation between protein concentration and transcriptional activity, the authors should have instead examined the probability of active transcription, or the amount of nascent RNA, just as they did earlier in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</italic> </p><p>The issue raised in both revisions was the request to demonstrate β-catenin dynamics and cyclin D1 transcription in the same cell, preferably in a living cell. Obviously, we have tried repeatedly over the years to get this to work in living cells in two colors, but to no avail. We attempted different approaches, and decided to remain with the cell clone expressing the YFP-β-catenin protein so not to begin characterizing another cell clone, but this meant that we could not co-express the GFP-MS2 protein in this clone together with YFP-β-catenin due to the GFP/YFP overlap. Following the request during the first revision, we increased our efforts and began purchasing many types of transfection reagents, and started cloning new versions of either CFP or mCherry MS2-CP, in order to obtain a stable clone with two colors. However, we did not obtain any stable clones by the end of the first revision. Transient transfections did not produce any useful data either because of inefficiency of transfection under these conditions and typical overexpression of the MS2-CP, which masked the transcription site of the single gene. Therefore, to obtain reliable and comparable data we required a stable clone. We have continued trying to generate stable clones with additional types of transfection reagents we purchased during then second revision cycle. We also obtained other MS2-CP plasmids, but all these efforts have been unsuccessful. Perhaps the cells are not very receptacle to the stable integration of additional constructs, because they have already been grown with 3 types of antibiotics. The bottom line is that despite many efforts and financial investment, we have not been able to establish this analysis in two colors in living cells.</p><p>But we have performed the analysis of β-catenin and CCND1 mRNA together in fixed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and feel that this provides the basic data expected in accordance with the separate live-cell experiments, even though not measured simultaneously in living cells as we would have liked to show. Following the criticism by reviewer 1 in the last revision cycle, we have added to the quantification also the number of nascent mRNAs in each cell. The original logic for presenting the cellular mRNAs was that we thought this quantification presents the accumulative response to Wnt over several hours that can be extracted from a static picture, whereas looking at the levels of gene activity (nascent mRNAs) in some cases might not always give the right impression because the gene might have turned off exactly when the image was acquired. Still, we agree that quantifying the nascent mRNAs in parallel to β-catenin levels gives a complete picture of all parameters that are responding to the Wnt signal, and now present all the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p>Finally, we have made sure not to imply in the manuscript that the two color analysis was performed in living cells, and have: a) not mentioned β-catenin in the part that describes cyclin D1 transcription in living cells, as not give the wrong impression; b) mentioned explicitly that the RNA quantification in correlation to β-catenin accumulation was done in fixed cells; and c) added a sentence in the Discussion that says it outright: “Although we were unable to examine YFP-β-catenin dynamics and CCND1-MS2 transcription activity simultaneously in living cells, by integrating the measurements of CCND1 transcriptional activity with the measured dynamics of β-catenin nuclear accumulation from the separate experiments, we found that…”.</p><p><italic>2) The text needs to be edited and proofread. Proofreading by an English speaker would have helped in some instances (single/plural, misuse of verbs, etc.), but in other instances this is a matter of ambiguous and confusing statements. The editorial team will have to address this problem if the manuscript is chosen for publication. To give just one example, the title, &quot;Quantifying β-catenin subcellular dynamics and gene expression kinetics&quot; implies that both the subcellular dynamics and the gene expression kinetics are those of β-catenin, but this is not actually the case.</italic></p><p>Grammar – the text has been reviewed and corrected by an academic.</p><p>Our revised manuscript is now titled “Quantifying β-catenin subcellular dynamics and cyclin D1 mRNA transcription during Wnt signaling in single living cells”, following reviewer 1’s comments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
