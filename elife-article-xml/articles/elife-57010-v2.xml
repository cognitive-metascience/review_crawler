However, certain boundary conditions limit the parameters under which memories can be made plastic. Strong memories do not destabilize, for instance, although why they are resilient is mostly unknown. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that specific modulatory signals shape memory formation into a state that is reconsolidation-resistant. We find that the activation of the noradrenaline-locus coeruleus system (NOR-LC) during strong fear memory encoding increases molecular mechanisms of stability at the expense of lability in the amygdala of rats. Preventing the NOR-LC from modulating strong fear encoding results in the formation of memories that can undergo reconsolidation within the amygdala and thus are vulnerable to post-reactivation interference. Thus, the memory strength boundary condition on reconsolidation is set at the time of encoding by the action of the NOR-LC.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>New memories must go through a period of consolidation to become stable and long-lasting in the brain. Recalling memories can make them unstable again, so that they need reconsolidating. Treatments in which the reconsolidation process is interrupted have been used to help weaken traumatic fear memories. However, memories of severe trauma, such as in post-traumatic stress disorder, are particularly resistant to reconsolidation treatments.</p><p>Haubrich et al. used rats to study how trauma shapes memory formation and what biological mechanisms are involved in preventing the destabilization/reconsolidation cycle. The rats were exposed to a sound at the same time as receiving a mild electric shock. Half of the rats experienced the shock once, creating a ‘weak’ memory. The other half experienced it ten times, creating a ‘strong’ memory. The rats’ memory of the electric shock was measured by seeing how they responded when they heard the sound again without the shock.</p><p>Some of the rats were given the drug anisomycin, an antibiotic that stops cells from making new proteins and is known for producing amnesia, to block reconsolidation of the memory after hearing the sound again. Treatment with the drug reduced future responses in the rats that had experienced the shock once, but had no effect on the rats that had experienced it ten times, demonstrating that the stronger memories were resistant to reconsolidation therapy. The rats with the strong memories also had lower levels of proteins in the brain that are involved in plasticity – the ability of the brain to change and adapt.</p><p>Haubrich et al. hypothesized that the stability of the strong memories could be caused by signaling from the locus coeruleus, a region of the brainstem involved in the response to stress. When the signaling from the locus coeruleus was blocked in the strong-memory rats, they became responsive to reconsolidation therapy with anisomycin.</p><p>These results help to better understand how traumatic memories become engrained, potentially leading to new treatment options for people with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>locus coeruleus</kwd><kwd>reconsolidation</kwd><kwd>noradrenaline</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>203523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nader</surname><given-names>Karim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>238757</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nader</surname><given-names>Karim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The overactivation of noradrenergic inputs to the amygdala during severe fear learning increases memory stability at the expense of lability, rendering the trace resistant to memory destabilization and reconsolidation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>New memories do not form instantly at the moment of an experience, but rather undergo a stabilization period during which they are gradually consolidated into a stable, long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asok et al., 2019</xref>). Later, recall may cause the memory to return to an unstable state (i.e. destabilized) where it can be modified. Importantly, the memory must undergo a re-stabilization process called reconsolidation in order to persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haubrich and Nader, 2016</xref>). This process of destabilization-reconsolidation allows memories to adaptively change. Importantly, manipulations targeting the reconsolidation process can permanently alter a memory trace, by enhancing, impairing or modifying it, offering great treatment potential to clinicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beckers and Kindt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nader et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Phelps and Hofmann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Soeter and Kindt, 2011</xref>). For instance, one can induce the destabilization of a maladaptive memory and then block reconsolidation pharmacologically– preventing the memory from returning to a stable state and leading to memory impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nader et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>). Memory content can also be updated during reconsolidation, allowing it to be modified to a less aversive form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haubrich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Monfils et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Popik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schiller et al., 2010</xref>). However, extreme fear learning can result in pathological memories that are resistant to change through reconsolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), making them difficult to treat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In order, for reconsolidation interventions to work, memory destabilization must be triggered first. However, retrieval does not always induce destabilization. In rodent experiments, this is particularly the case in memories generated by high intensity fear conditioning or protocols that induce asymptotic levels of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">García-DeLaTorre et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gazarini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Winters et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Finnie and Nader, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2009</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holehonnur et al., 2016</xref>) have found that while auditory fear memories created with one tone-shock pairing (1P) do undergo destabilization and can be attenuated by reconsolidation blockade, a stronger, 10 tone-shock pairings (10P) protocol creates an intense fear memory that is resistant to this treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, the strength of the memory serves as a boundary condition to determine whether memory destabilization will occur after retrieval or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). This boundary condition is thought to be mediated in part by mechanisms that initialize destabilization. A well described mechanism for destabilization is GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben Mamou et al., 2006</xref>). GluN2B-NMDA receptors are reduced in reconsolidation-resistant memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2009</xref>) and blocking these receptors prevents destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milton et al., 2013</xref>). Another important mechanism involves the expression of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors, which are important for LTP maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henley and Wilkinson, 2016</xref>) and have been linked with memory strength and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Migues et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Migues et al., 2010</xref>). In order for destabilization to occur, a transient reduction of GluA2-AMPA receptor synaptic expression is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clem and Huganir, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ferrara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rao-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conceptual diagram showing differences in memory processes triggered by fear conditioning of different intensities.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Auditory fear conditioning training consisting of a single tone-shock pairing (1P). The fear memory initially exists in an unstable short-term state and in order to persist as a long-term memory (LTM), it must undergo a time-dependent stabilization processes termed consolidation. Later, recall of the LTM causes memory to destabilize and become transiently unstable. Afterwards, for memory to persist it is restabilized by reconsolidation.

These changes likely determine the future plasticity of the memory by altering mechanisms needed for destabilization, such as GluN2B-NMDA and GluA2-AMPA receptors expression. However, the specific links between memory encoding and reconsolidation have yet to be determined. It is well-established that emotionally arousing experiences cause increased release of noradrenaline in the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Quirarte et al., 1998</xref>) that modulates memory formation through the activation of β-adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McGaugh, 2000</xref>). The locus coeruleus is the main source of noradrenergic projections in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Giustino and Maren, 2018</xref>), and although it acts on many targets, its influence in the amygdala is critical to mediate the impact of stress on memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Giustino and Maren, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaouane et al., 2012</xref>). For instance, overactivation of projections coming from the locus coeruleus (LC) to the amygdala have been implicated in encoding traumatic memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hurlemann, 2008</xref>) and these projections promote fear learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>). This evidence suggests that the noradrenaline-locus coeruleus system (NOR-LC) likely contributes to the formation of maladaptive, reconsolidation-resistant fear memories. If so, NOR-LC signaling may trigger changes that determine future plasticity and destabilization, such as altered GluN2B and GluA2 expression.</p><p>Here, we compared how animals fear conditioned with a 1P or a 10P training protocol differ regarding plasticity mechanisms in the amygdala and the induction of destabilization. Using pharmacologic and chemogenetic interventions, we also tested the hypothesis that the overactivation of the NOR-LC system during severe fear encoding underlies the formation of reconsolidation-resistant memories with limited plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>R1 replicating the behavioral effects of 1 pairing vs 10 pairings fear conditioning protocol</title><p>To study the difference between mild and strong fear memories, our first aim was to assess how they differ at the behavioral level. Animals were trained in two different auditory fear conditioning tasks: to create a mild fear memory, we trained rats with one tone-shock pairing (1P), whereas strong fear memories were created using 10 tone-shock pairings (10P). The next day, fear memory was assessed in a test session where one unreinforced tone was presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

To better visualize the differences in memory strength, fear-conditioned rats underwent extinction with 20 unpaired tone presentations and were tested for extinction retention in the next day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A mixed ANOVA with training protocol as a between-subjects variable and bin as a within-subjects variable revealed a significant main effect between groups, with rats in the 10P group freezing more during the entire extinction session and at test ( F<sub>1,13</sub> = 58.18, p&lt;0.001). Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test revealed that only animals trained with 1P displayed extinction acquisition, with significant fear suppression within the extinction session (1-to-5 tone vs 16-to-20 tone: 1P group, t(52) = 3.65, p=0.02; 10P group, t(52) = 2.43, p&gt;0.05). Also, extinction retention 24 hr later was observed only in the 1P group (1-to-5 tone vs Test: 1P group, t(52) = 3.45, p=0.03; 10P group, t(52) = 0.85, p&gt;0.05). Therefore, in contrast with 1P, fear memories created with 10P exhibit impaired extinction learning, indicating a considerable difference in memory strength.</p><p>Next we assessed reconsolidation in 1P and 10P memories as previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2009</xref>. One day after 1P or 10P training, a 1-tone test was conducted to reactivate the fear memory. The protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (125 µg/µl; 0.5 µl per hemisphere) was infused in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) immediately after to block reconsolidation. The effectiveness of the treatment was then evaluated in a test 1 day later. A mixed ANOVA with training and drug as between-subjects variables and session as a within-subjects variable indicated that there was a significant interaction between training, drug, and session (F<sub>1,35</sub> = 18.27, p&lt;0.001). At test, post-reactivation anisomycin impaired performance in animals trained with one shock (Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test, t(55) = 5.59, p&lt;0.001) but had no effect in strongly trained rats (Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test, t(55) = −0.26, p&gt;0.05). This shows that retrieval rendered the 1P memory labile, necessitating reconsolidation shortly afterwards. On the other hand, retrieval did not render the 10P memory vulnerable to anisomycin, and hence it can be considered a reconsolidation-resistant memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>R2 quantification of synaptic plasticity molecules between reconsolidation-permissive vs resistant memories in the BLA</title><p>We evaluated the expression of molecules implicated with synaptic plasticity, GluN2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and GluA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anggono and Huganir, 2012</xref>), between animals trained in the 1P and 10P protocols.

After showing that strong training results in memories with decreased GluN2B and increased GluA2 postsynaptic expression in the BLA, we investigated if the β-adrenergic inhibitor propranolol would affect such outcomes. Animals were injected with either propranolol (10 mg/mL/kg, i.p.) or vehicle and 20 min later were trained in the 10P fear conditioning protocol. Rats were tested one day later and sacrificed 24 hr post-test when their brains were collected for western blot analysis. In comparison with the vehicle groups, propranolol treatment increased GluN2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left; Independent samples t-test t(17) = 2.47, p=0.025) and decreased GluA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right; Independent samples t-test t(9) = 2.41, p=0.039) in the BLA. Therefore, blocking β-adrenergic signaling during 10P training modulates GluN2B and GluA2 toward the levels found in 1P memories that do reconsolidate. Importantly, no direct comparison with the 1P and HC groups were made.

Some of the mechanisms required to induce destabilization have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haubrich and Nader, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), but not much is known regarding how severe fear experiences end up forming reconsolidation-resistant memories. In the current study we investigated the hypothesis that strong memories are different than mild ones due to the action of the NOR-LC system on encoding. Our results show that strong fear conditioning involves elevated β-adrenergic receptor activation which modulates encoding to produce memories that do not destabilize. At the systems level, reconsolidation-resistant memory formation entails inputs from the LC to the BLA during strong fear learning, and if these projections are silenced, even the memory of a strong fear experience can later undergo destabilization and reconsolidation.</p><p>This work builds on previous studies showing that the induction of reconsolidation involves the presence of specific cellular mechanisms in the amygdala, such as the activation of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2009</xref>) and transient reduction of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors upon retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rao-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we first replicated the seminal findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2009</xref> by showing that, while memories created with one tone-shock pairing destabilize upon recall, memories created with 10 pairings do not. Also, memories created with 10 pairings are much more robust and display impaired extinction learning, a hallmark of posttraumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pitman et al., 2012</xref>). When looking at GluN2B expression, we confirmed previous reports showing that strongly-trained animals display lower GluN2B levels than mildly trained ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holehonnur et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). However, here we included a home cage control group in our analysis which revealed that GluN2B is not actually downregulated by strong training. In fact, GluN2B is normally upregulated by fear learning, which is hampered when the experience is very intense. We also examined GluA2 expression, which is central for synaptic stability and must be endocytosed after recall for memory destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rao-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>). By comparing GluA2 levels of trained animals with home cages, we found a moderate increase in rats trained with one pairing and a significantly higher increase in rats trained with 10 pairings, indicating increased stability of strong memories. Retrieval transiently reduced synaptic GluA2 to home cage levels only in the mild memory, further indicating that the strong memory was overly stable and unable to destabilize. Overall, these data show that strong memories are stored in a state with different metaplastic properties that makes them resistant to reconsolidation.</p><p>Most studies concerning the boundary conditions of reconsolidation focus on the mechanisms implicated at the time of retrieval, while those at initial encoding have not received much attention. Here we show that conditions during encoding are crucial to defining the memory’s future plasticity. Emotionally arousing experiences cause increased release of noradrenaline from the locus coeruleus to the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Quirarte et al., 1998</xref>), which increases its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rodríguez-Ortega et al., 2017</xref>) and promotes fear learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gazarini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the overactivation of this system has been implicated with traumatic memory formation in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hendrickson and Raskind, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rombold et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate the role of noradrenaline signaling on the formation of reconsolidation resistant memories, we used pharmacologic and chemogenetic approaches. First, we pharmacologically blocked β-adrenergic receptors during strong fear learning and re-assessed plasticity mechanism in the BLA and reconsolidation induction. Propranolol before strong training modulated GluN2B and GluA2 expression towards levels seen in weakly trained animals— increasing GluN2B and decreasing GluA2 synaptic expression. Likewise, these strong memories formed under β-adrenergic receptors blockade can be destabilized following retrieval. Next we investigated the role of projections from the LC to BLA during strong fear memory formation. To this end, LC neurons were infected with the inhibitory DREADD receptor HM4Di and its projections to the BLA were silenced during strong training with the local infusion of the DREADD agonist C21. When these specific LC to BLA projections were silenced during strong training, recall was successful in triggering destabilization. As a result, infusion of a protein synthesis inhibitor blocked reconsolidation, leading to amnesia. Importantly, both pharmacologic and chemogenetic manipulations of noradrenaline signalling did not alter rats’ freezing compared to control animals. This suggests that noradrenaline blockade did not reduce memory strength per se. Overall, this reveals that the activation of LC-BLA pathway during severe fear learning is necessary for memories to encode in a fixed state and do not destabilize in the future (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). If this pathway is silenced, however, even the memory of a very aversive event displays plasticity and can undergo destabilization upon recall.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The noradrenaline-locus coeruleus system drives memory formation towards a reconsolidation-resistant state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fear learning engages plasticity in the amygdala that promotes long-term memory storage. Mildly aversive fear learning (1P) results in the formation of a memory where both GluN2Band GluA2 receptor subunits are upregulated. Extreme fear learning (10P) overactivates the noradrenaline-locus coeruleus systems, which prevents GluN2B upregulation and boosts GluA2 expression. (<bold>B</bold>) Upon recall, memory created with 1P fear conditioning is destabilized and undergoes reconsolidation.

Further, reconsolidation-targeted treatments provide a unique opportunity to weaken pathological fear memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Monfils and Holmes, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Phelps and Hofmann, 2019</xref>). Nonetheless, the intensity of the experience is an important parameter which can modulate whether reconsolidation can happen in the future, curbing the efficacy of some treatments. Thus, in order to better understand and treat disorders implicated in severe fear, it is crucial to elucidate how mild and strong memories differ. The current work underscores the widely accepted— but understudied— possibility that mild and strong fear memories are neurobiologically distinct. We have described how the NOR-LC system shapes memory encoding towards a maladaptive state that is resistant to change. This is achieved by triggering molecular modifications that increase memory stability at the expense of plasticity. The identification of this mechanism advances our understanding of the boundary conditions to reconsolidation. Moreover, this knowledge will help guide future research to understand why strong memories are so implacable, and how resistance to treatment can be overcome.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Rats</title><p>Male Sprague Dawley rats (275–300 g at arrival; Charles River, Quebec, Canada) were housed in pairs in plastic cages in a temperature-controlled environment (21–23°C) with ad libitum access to food and water and maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 A.M.).

Sections were washed and incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa-488 secondary antibody (1:500, Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) for 2 hr at room temperature. Afterwards, sections were washed, mounted on slides and immediately coverslipped with Fluoromount-G with DAPI (Thermo Fischer). Images were examined by fluorescence microscopy (Leica DM 5000 B) and c-fos positive cells were counted bilaterally from two LC coronal slices for each animal with ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histology</title><p>To identify cannulae placements, brains were removed and post-fixed in 10% formalin-saline, 20% sucrose solution and cryo-sectioned at 50 μm thickness. The slides were examined by bright-field light microscopy (Olympus IX81) by an experimenter blind to the group assignments. Only animals with injector tips bilaterally positioned within the BLA were included in the data analysis. Rats with extensive damage were excluded from analysis. To verify viral expression, brains were post-fixed in paraformaldehyde 4%, phosphate buffer 0.2M for 3 days followed by 10% formalin-saline, 20% sucrose solution for another 3 days and were then cryo-sectioned at 80 μm thickness. Slices were mounted onto slides with Fluoromount-G, with DAPI (Thermo Fischer) and examined by fluorescence microscopy (Leica DM 5000 B). Only animals with somatic viral expression in the LC were included in the data analysis, and rats with extensive damage were excluded. Across all experiments, a total of 32 animals with cannula placements or viral expression outside the targeted areas, blocked cannulae, and/or with tissue damage were excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>We used two-tailed independent-samples t test, one-way, two-way and three-way independent, repeated measures and mixed ANOVA for data analysis. Tukey’s p<italic>ost hoc</italic> tests were further used to identify the critical differences that contributed to significant interaction. Type-one error rate was set at 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group

transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Memory retrieval is often followed by a process of memory reconsolidating, which renders such memories labile and potentially subject to disruption or updating. Strong memories, however, are resistant to reconsolidating. The present paper uncovers the neural mechanisms that regulate the switch from reconsolidation-resistant to reconsolidating-prone memories.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Noradrenergic projections from the locus coeruleus to the amygdala constrain fear memory reconsolidation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Mihaela D Iordanova as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity:); Ingrid Reverte (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present an exciting manuscript studying the molecular and circuit mechanisms of fear memories that are reconsolidation resistant. The procedure used a 1-trial vs. a 10-trial fear conditioning design and led to a memory that is either susceptible or resistant to post-reactivation interference and to a different molecular signature (GluN2B and GluA2 glutamate subunits) in the basolateral amygdala after recall. The authors further our understanding on the resiliency to reconsolidation by exploring the role of β-adrenergic signaling during the formation of such memories. Through a series of experiments, the authors reveal the importance of b-adrenergic blockage and the role of LC to BLA projections in transitioning such strong reconsolidation-resistant memories to reconsolidation-prone memories.</p><p>This is an excellent analysis of the physiological characteristics of stable strong fear memories which are normally not subject to reconsolidation. This work is important because it specifies the physiological regulation of memories that are resistant to change. As a result this work carries important implication for other research that studies memory modification and carries clear clinical relevance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please report all statistics (including ANOVA main effects and interactions, not just post-hocs). Figure 2: Be explicit about the follow up test statistic for your Tukey post-hoc (either q/t/F value acceptable). Figure 4B and 5C require a 3 way interaction analysis.</p><p>2) Please provide histology figures with cannulae placements and viral expression spread for each subject, where appropriate.</p><p>3) Please revise the Introduction.

We have included new references that were indeed missing and restructured some paragraphs to better establish the links. We have also expanded the last paragraph of the Introduction to explain the general procedures, and made several minor changes across the manuscript to improve its readability. We hope that this addresses the reviewers’ concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Provide some discussion of the choice to use home cage controls, focusing on pros and cons.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 3 we were interested in evaluating how GluN2B and GluA2 change after 1P and 10P memory formation. To this end, we used home cage animals to see how these molecules are expressed when no learning occurs. However, other options for such control could have been used.</p><p>One option would be a no-shock control. One issue with this option would be that we would not have a single control for both 1P and 10P groups. Given that 1P and 10P training have different lengths, each training protocol would require a separate no-shock control. The no-shock control could be informative if considering the role of the contextual processing, and a structure such as the hippocampus. But it would be less valuable when studying the amygdala which is not a structure specialized in contextual processing.</p><p>Another option would be the use of unpaired control groups where animals would be exposed to the shocks but not to the tone presentations. The unpaired control would provide animals with no auditory fear learning but normal contextual learning. Again, this would require 2 control groups, one for each training protocol. Also, given that contextual fear was not the focus of this study, it would not add much for our goals.</p><p>The home cage control provides a clean way of assessing baseline levels of the targeted proteins. It gives us a single baseline value that can be compared with the data of both 1P and 10P groups. It does not address parameters such as context exposure and hippocampus-dependent learning, but on the other hand it avoids contamination intrinsic to other sorts of controls. Since our goal was to have a robust and comparable baseline value, we chose to use home cage animals. A sentence summarizing this was included in the first paragraph of subsection “Quantification of synaptic plasticity molecules between reconsolidation-permissive vs. resistant memories in the BLA”.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thank you for proving the tables with the statistical analyses.

Most of the outputs of ANOVAs and Tukey’s post hoc tests are now presented separately, and all the specific comparisons are now clearly stated. When the statistical test is mentioned inside the parenthesis, it always appears to the left of its output. We believe that with these changes it is now clear which test and comparison the statistic values correspond to, even when many outputs are inside the same parenthesis.</p><p>Of note, in the extinction experiment mentioned by the reviewers, the ANOVA referred to a main effect of group, not to a group x session interaction which was not significant. This was expected since the 10P group exhibited higher freezing than the 1P group regardless of the session.</p><p>The reviewers are correct about the analysis reported as repeated measures ANOVAs – we did conduct a mixed ANOVA but wrongly called it a repeated measure. This was fixed.</p><p>Regarding the sentence lacking citation at the end of the first paragraph, it was removed and integrated into the second paragraph. It now contains both the required citations and the call for the figure. We have also added another reference to what is now the end of the first paragraph.</p></body></sub-article></article>
