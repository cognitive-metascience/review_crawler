forms the molecular basis of cellular behavior. The primary cilium constitutes a subcellular compartment that orchestrates signal transduction independent from the cell body. Ciliary dysfunction causes severe diseases, termed ciliopathies. Analyzing ciliary signaling has been challenging due to the lack of tools to investigate ciliary signaling. Here, we describe a nanobody-based targeting approach for optogenetic tools in mammalian cells and in vivo in zebrafish to specifically analyze ciliary signaling and function. Thereby, we overcome the loss of protein function observed after fusion to ciliary targeting sequences. We functionally localized modifiers of cAMP signaling, the photo-activated adenylyl cyclase bPAC and the light-activated phosphodiesterase LAPD, and the cAMP biosensor mlCNBD-FRET to the cilium. Using this approach, we studied the contribution of spatial cAMP signaling in controlling cilia length. Combining optogenetics with nanobody-based targeting will pave the way to the molecular understanding of ciliary function in health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cyclic amp</kwd><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP 1926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Möglich</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name><name><surname>Wachten</surname><given-names>Dagmar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP 1726</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wachten</surname><given-names>Dagmar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR83/SFB</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wachten</surname><given-names>Dagmar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Germany's Excellence Strategy -

Primary cilia function as antennae that translate sensory information into a cellular response. The sensory function is governed by a subset of receptors and downstream signaling components that are specifically targeted to the cilium. This allows to orchestrate rapid signal transduction in a minuscule reaction volume, independent of the cell body. A central component of ciliary signaling is the second messenger 3’, 5’-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson and Leroux, 2010</xref>). The prime example is chemosensation in highly specialized olfactory cilia: odorant-induced activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) stimulates the synthesis of cAMP by the transmembrane adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC3). The ensuing increase in ciliary cAMP levels activates cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNG), resulting in a depolarization that spreads from the cilium to the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaupp, 2010</xref>). In recent years, it emerged that cAMP also controls signaling in primary cilia. AC3 is highly enriched in primary cilia and widely used as a ciliary marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bishop et al., 2007</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>ADCY3</italic> gene, encoding for AC3, or loss of <italic>ADCY3</italic> expression cause monogenic severe obesity and increase the risk for type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grarup et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nordman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saeed et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Siljee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). This has been attributed to the loss of AC3 function in neuronal primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Siljee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barroso, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the most prominent primary cilia signaling pathway, the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway, utilizes cAMP as a second messenger in the cilium to transduce stimulation by Shh into a change in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, the dynamic modulation of primary cilia length seems to be controlled by cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Besschetnova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Porpora et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jin et al., 2014</xref>). However, as of yet, it has been impossible to manipulate cAMP dynamics in primary cilia independently from the cell body. Hence, the molecular details and dynamics of cAMP-signaling pathways in primary cilia remain largely unknown.</p><p>Optogenetics might be the key to overcome this issue, not least because it has proven to be a powerful method to manipulate and monitor cAMP dynamics in mouse sperm flagella, a specialized motile cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balbach et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jansen et al., 2015</xref>). The photo-activated adenylyl cyclase bPAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stierl et al., 2011</xref>) has been employed to increase flagellar cAMP levels by blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jansen et al., 2015</xref>), and the FRET-based cAMP biosensor mlCNBD-FRET has been used to monitor cAMP dynamics in sperm flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>). This cAMP tool kit has been complemented with the red light-activated phosphodiesterase LAPD that allows to decrease cAMP levels in a light-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gasser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stabel et al., 2019</xref>). For primary cilia, the challenge is to specifically target these tools to the cilium to investigate cAMP signaling independent from the cell body. Free diffusion of proteins into the primary cilium is limited by the transition zone (TZ) at the base of the cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reiter et al., 2012</xref>). Protein transport into and out of the cilium relies on the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery in combination with the BBSome, a multi-protein complex at the ciliary base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berbari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Loktev and Jackson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nachury, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</xref>). The combined action of IFT, BBSome, and TZ shape the unique ciliary protein composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nachury and Mick, 2019</xref>). To localize a given optogenetic tool to the primary cilium, the ciliary transport machinery needs to be hijacked. Common strategies involve direct fusion to the C terminus of either a full-length GPCR, for example the somatostatin receptor 3 (Sstr3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berbari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2019</xref>), the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore et al., 2016</xref>), to a ciliary protein, for example Arl13b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>), or a truncated ciliary protein, for example the first 201 amino acids (aa) of the ciliary mouse Nphp3 (nephrocystin 3) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wright et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mick et al., 2015</xref>). Fusion of Sstr3 to the N terminus of bPAC or mlCNBD-FRET has already been applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2019</xref>). However, using a full-length GPCR as a fusion partner for ciliary localization might increase the abundance of this specific receptor in the cilium and, thereby, distort the ciliary set of signal receptors. This is particularly disadvantageous when analyzing ciliary cAMP signaling because fusion to GPCRs, which couple to cAMP signaling, might alter basal cAMP levels due to constitutive activity, as has been shown for the commonly used 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kohen et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, the truncated version of mNphp3 is sufficient to convey ciliary targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wright et al., 2011</xref>), but lacks any other known functionality, whereby its fusion for ciliary targeting represents by large a less invasive targeting approach than using a complete GPCR. Thus, to target optogenetic tools to the primary cilium, we fused aa 1–201 of mNphp3 to their N terminus. To our surprise, this approach largely failed for LAPD and mlCNBD-FRET, because N-terminal fusion disrupts their optogenetic and biosensoric function, respectively. Therefore, we developed a new approach to hijack the ciliary transport machinery to target intracellular nanobodies. The nanobody-based approach allows to specifically target proteins to the primary cilium without directly fusing them to a ciliary protein. Instead, the nanobody is cilia-targeted and tows the proteins of interest to the cilium by binding to a tag contained in the protein of interest.</p><p>We show that the cilia-targeted nanobodies bind to eGFP or mCherry-containing proteins of interest in the cytosol, such as bPAC, LAPD, or mlCNBD-FRET. As a complex, the proteins then translocate into the primary cilium. Nanobody binding does not substantially impair protein function, that is light-dependent activation of bPAC and LAPD, or cAMP-induced conformational changes of mlCNBD-FRET. We demonstrate the validity of this approach both in vitro and in vivo in mammalian cells and zebrafish, respectively. Moreover, using nanobody-based ciliary targeting of bPAC, we study the role of ciliary versus cytosolic (cell body) cAMP signaling in controlling cilia length. Our approach principally extends to the ciliary targeting of any protein of interest, which is recognized by a nanobody. Thereby, the huge variety of genetically encoded tools to manipulate cellular signaling, for example membrane potential, protein-protein interactions, or enzymatic activities, and to monitor cellular signaling, for example dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, pH, or the membrane potential, could be enriched in the primary cilium using our nanobody-based targeting approach. This strategy opens up new avenues for cilia biology and allows to address long-standing questions in cell biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>N-terminal fusion of optogenetic tools interferes with photoactivation</title><p>To utilize the optogenetic tools bPAC- or LAPD-mCherry in a cilium-specific manner, we first tested whether N-terminal fusion of mNphp3(201) is sufficient for targeting to the primary cilium. Indeed, fusions of both bPAC and LAPD predominantly localized to the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). To test whether protein fusion interferes with the light-dependent activation of LAPD or bPAC, we measured LAPD or bPAC activity using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. To this end, we used HEK293 cells stably expressing a cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channel CNGA2-TM (HEK-TM) that conducts Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon cAMP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wachten et al., 2006</xref>). HEK293 cells were not ciliated to directly compare the non-fused and the fused optogenetic tool. Activation of bPAC with a 465 nm light pulse increases intracellular cAMP levels, leading to a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which is quantified using the fluorescence of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To measure LAPD activity, HEK-TM cells were pre-stimulated with NKH477, a water-soluble forskolin analog that activates transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs) and, thereby, increases cAMP levels, leading to a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. NKH477 stimulation was performed under illumination with 850 nm that deactivates LAPD, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gasser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stabel et al., 2019</xref>). When the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx reached a steady-state, LAPD was activated by 690 nm light, decreasing cAMP levels and, thereby, the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We measured the mNphp3(201)-bPAC-mCherry or mNphp3(201)-LAPD-mCherry activity and compared it to the non-ciliary tagged bPAC- or LAPD-mCherry proteins. Light stimulation of mNphp3(201)-bPAC-mCherry or bPAC-mCherry expressing HEK-TM cells resulted in a transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase, which was absent in mCherry-expressing control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Repetitive light-stimulation with different light pulses reliably increased the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in mNphp3(201)-bPAC-mCherry or bPAC-mCherry expressing HEK-TM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Normalized peak amplitudes of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal evoked after the first light pulse were lower in mNphp3(201)-bPAC-mCherry than in bPAC-mCherry expressing HEK-TM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that the N-terminal fusion to a ciliary targeting sequence interferes with the light-dependent activation of bPAC. Next, responses of HEK-TM cells stably expressing mNphp3(201)-LAPD-mCherry or LAPD-mCherry to NKH477 stimulation were quantified: in both, mNphp3(201)-LAPD-mCherry and LAPD-mCherry expressing HEK-TM cells, NKH477 stimulation induced a Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Rather, we fused our optogenetic tools with a fluorescent reporter (e.g. mCherry) at their C termini, which leaves photoactivation unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jansen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stabel et al., 2019</xref>). To direct these proteins to primary cilia, we co-expressed a nanobody, which is directed against the tag (mCherry) and is fused to the ciliary targeting sequence mNphp3(201) at its N terminus. We hypothesize that the nanobody binds to its target in the cytoplasm, the nanobody-protein-complex is recognized by the ciliary targeting machinery and is then transported into the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We first tested the anti-mCherry nanobody VHH<sub>LaM-2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariotti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fridy et al., 2014</xref>), fused to eGFP at the C terminus and mNphp3(201) at the N terminus, in mIMCD-3 cells.

We first verified 5-HT<sub>6</sub>-cADDis sensor function by pharmacologically increasing cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). To this end, we used 40 μM Forskolin, an activator of transmembrane adenylyl cyclases, or 250 μM IBMX, a broad-band phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Of note, pharmacological stimulation increases cAMP levels in the whole cell and not specifically in the primary cilium. The sensor reliably reported an increase in cAMP levels in the primary cilium evoked by either of the two stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>).

In this approach, however, the tools are not spectrally separated as both bPAC and the cAMP biosensor are activated/excited by blue light (here: 488 nm). Thus, measuring the cpEGP fluorescence of the cADDis sensor concomitantly activates bPAC. Indeed, as soon as the measurement was started, bPAC was activated, cAMP levels increased and, in turn, the cpEGFP fluorescence of the cADDis sensor was significantly lower compared to the cpEGFP fluorescence in cilia that contained mCherry only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>), demonstrating that photoactivation of bPAC increased cAMP levels in the cilium. Thus, even though the approach lacks the spectral separation, it confirms light-induced changes of cAMP levels in the cilium and demonstrates that nanobody-based targeting of bPAC-mCherry to the cilium increases ciliary cAMP levels after photoactivation.</p><p>In summary, our nanobody-based approach provides a versatile means for ciliary targeting without interfering with protein function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Targeting of a genetically-encoded biosensor to the primary cilium</title><p>We previously engineered and applied a genetically encoded biosensor, named mlCNBD-FRET, to measure cAMP dynamics in motile cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>). We already demonstrated targeting of this sensor to primary cilia by fusing it to the C terminus of Sstr3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>). However, Sstr3 is a functional GPCR, which may interfere with ciliary signaling, in particular cAMP signaling, upon overexpression. We aimed to optimize the targeting approach by fusing mNphp3(201) to the N terminus of mlCNBD-FRET. While the biosensor localized to the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), biosensor function was severely impaired as mlCNBD-FRET no longer responded to changes in cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). We thus tested whether the biosensor can be targeted to primary cilia using our nanobody-based approach without interfering with protein function. The mlCNBD-FRET sensor consists of the FRET pair cerulean and citrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>).

Fusion of mNphp3(201) to the N terminus of the anti-eGFP nanobody also resulted in ciliary localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the absence of the nanobody, mlCNBD-FRET was uniformly distributed throughout the cytosol, whereas co-expression with the mNphp3(201)-tagged nanobody resulted in ciliary localization of mlCNBD-FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). To test whether nanobody interaction impaired mlCNBD-FRET function, we performed FRET imaging in HEK293 cells expressing mlCNBD-FRET in the presence or absence of the nanobody. Similar to the anti-mCherry nanobody, the cilia-targeted eGFP nanobody mNphp3(201)-VHH<sub>enhancer</sub>-mCherry showed a more clustered subcellular localization in HEK293 cells in the absence of primary cilia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Consistently, when binding to the nanobody, mlCNBD-FRET also formed clusters within the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), which did not occur in the presence of mCherry only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). To functionally test the FRET sensor in the presence of the nanobody, we first assessed the impact of the nanobody on the fluorescence intensity of the two fluorophores, cerulean and citrine. HEK293 cells were transfected with cerulean or citrine and the eGFP VHH<sub>enhancer</sub>-mCherry nanobody or mCherry only. The fluorescence intensity of cerulean or citrine was normalized to the mCherry fluorescence in the same cell. Both cerulean and citrine showed an increase in fluorescence in the presence of the nanobody compared to the mCherry control as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kirchhofer et al., 2010</xref>), but the relative change for each of the fluorophores was not substantially different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). To test whether mlCNBD-FRET:nanobody complexes still respond to changes in cAMP levels, we first measured cAMP-induced FRET changes in non-ciliated HEK293 cells and then in ciliated mIMCD-3 cells.

Whether an increase in cAMP levels in either the cilium or the cell body is sufficient to evoke a change in ciliary length, is not known.

Indeed, ectopic expression of the mNphp3(201)-tagged nanobody resulted in longer cilia compared to non-transfected control cells. There was a linear correlation between the expression level of the mNphp3(201)-tagged nanobody in the cilium and cilia length: the higher the expression (determined by eGFP fluorescence), the longer the cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), as has been reported previously for ectopic expression of membrane proteins in the cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guadiana et al., 2013</xref>). However, in the low expression regime, that is &lt; 7.5 a.u. eGFP fluorescence, there was no linear correlation between the expression level of the mNphp3(201)-tagged nanobody in the cilium and cilia length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), demonstrating that ectopic expression of the mNphp3(201)-tagged nanobody in the cilium at a low level does not change ciliary length. To verify whether the mNphp3(201)-tagged nanobody also does not alter cilia length in the low mNphp3(201)-VHH<sub>Lam-2</sub>-eGFP expression regimes (&lt;7.5 a.u.) while in complex with its target, we analyzed mIMCD-3 cells co-expressing mNphp3(201)-VHH<sub>Lam-2</sub>-eGFP and mCherry. In the low mNphp3(201)-VHH<sub>Lam-2</sub>-eGFP expression regimes (&lt;7.5 a.u.), there was no linear correlation between the mCherry fluorescence and cilia length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), demonstrating that targeting the mNphp3(201)-tagged nanobody in complex with another protein to the cilium does not alter cilia length. Our results underline that the amount of protein in the cilium has to be carefully titrated and a thorough analysis is needed to rule out any unspecific effects caused by ectopic expression of ciliary proteins. In the following, we hence only analyzed cilia with a mNphp3(201)-VHH<sub>Lam-2</sub>-eGFP expression level of &lt; 7.5 a.u. We compared the change in cilia length upon photoactivation of bPAC-mCherry either in the cell body or in the presence of mNphp3(201)-VHH<sub>Lam-2</sub>-eGFP in the cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–H</xref>). No light-dependent increase in ciliary length was observed in non-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Stimulating cAMP synthesis by light in the cell body significantly reduced cilia length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,H</xref>), whereas stimulating cAMP synthesis in the cilium significantly increased cilia length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>).</p><p>Next, we complemented our analysis by investigating whether reducing cAMP levels in either the cell body or the cilium using photoactivation of LAPD also changed cilia length. We compared the change in cilia length upon photoactivation of LAPD-mCherry either in the cell body or, in the presence of mNphp3(201)-VHH<sub>LaM-2</sub>-eGFP, in the cilium. However, neither stimulation of LAPD activity in the cell body nor in the cilium had an effect on cilia length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–K</xref>), although photoactivation of LAPD reduced basal cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, the cAMP-dependent signaling pathways that control the length of the cilium seem to be sensitive to an increase, but not to a decrease of the basal cAMP concentration. In summary, cAMP-dependent signaling pathways in the cell body or the cilium evoke opposing effects on cilia length control, demonstrating how compartmentalized cAMP signaling determines specific ciliary and, thereby, cellular functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L,M</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The primary cilium constitutes a unique subcellular compartment. However, our understanding of how specific ciliary signaling pathways control cellular functions is still limited. Optogenetics is an apt method to measure and manipulate ciliary signaling independent of the rest of the cell. We have developed a nanobody-based approach to target optogenetic tools or genetically-encoded biosensors to primary cilia in vitro and in vivo, while preserving protein function. This novel strategy principally extends to other proteins of interest and subcellular domains. The only requirement is fusion of the protein of interest to a tag or partner that is recognized by the nanobody, without impairing protein function. This is combined with fusion of the nanobody to a targeting sequence for the specific subcellular compartment. This approach is particularly useful for proteins, whose function is impaired by fusion to a targeting sequence, as we have shown here for the light-activated phosphodiesterase LAPD and the mlCNBD-FRET sensor.</p><p>Optogenetic tools have been used in motile cilia, that is sperm flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balbach et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jansen et al., 2015</xref>), where no specific targeting sequence is needed.

However, this approach does not work for primary cilia. Genetically-encoded biosensors for cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> have already been targeted to primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delling et al., 2016</xref>). These sensors have been fused to the C terminus of full-length GPCRs, for example 5-HT6 (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore et al., 2016</xref>).

Our results demonstrate that also high expression levels of the nanobody in the cilium increased cilia length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Targeting to organelles using nanobodies has also been achieved for two specific proteins, p53 and survivin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beghein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Steels et al., 2018</xref>). For primary cilia, recombinantly expressed fusion proteins fused to nanobodies have been used to investigate the ciliary diffusion barrier by diffusion-to-capture assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Breslow et al., 2013</xref>) and determined a free diffusion across the ciliary barrier only for proteins &lt; 100 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kee et al., 2012</xref>). Although larger proteins can enter cilia by active transport processes, this size cutoff may limit the size of proteins that can be targeted to cilia by a piggyback mechanism using a cilia-localized nanobody. To expand nanobody-based targeting to this or any other organelle, a few epitope tags with matching nanobodies can be employed, including the synthetic 13 amino acid ALFA tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Götzke et al., 2019</xref>), the C-tag derived from α-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Genst et al., 2010</xref>), and the SPOT-tag derived from β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Traenkle et al., 2015</xref>). Targeting via these tags is not only orthogonal to EGFP or mCherry-based targeting, but also expected to only exhibit a minimal effect on the tagged protein. This may be particularly advantageous if nanobody binding to a fluorescent reporter protein or direct fusion to a fluorescent protein alters its optical properties. This has to be carefully evaluated for each protein of interest. Importantly, epitope tags are also compatible with the reverse strategy: endogenous ciliary proteins can be tagged by CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing techniques, allowing optogenetic tools or sensors, fused to the respective nanobodies, to be recruited to ciliary proteins expressed at endogenous levels, and perhaps even to specific subdomains of primary cilia. Along the same lines, nanobodies against endogenous cilia proteins, for example Arl13b may reduce the necessary genetic modifications for cilia targeting. Nanobody-based binding controlled by light or by small molecules will further expand the versatility of this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gil et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farrants et al., 2020</xref>). To date, all intracellular applications of nanobodies require genetic modification of target cells, a limitation that may be overcome with improved strategies for intracellular protein delivery.</p><p>Since several proteins proposed to function in cilia also have well-known functions outside the cilium (such as PKA or AMPK), it is a major challenge in cilia biology to specifically interfere with their cilium-specific functions. One approach is to target proteins or peptides with inhibitory functions specifically to the cilium, for example to interfere with PKA activity inside cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mick et al., 2015</xref>). Cilia length is an important parameter that determines cilia function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>). However, the spatial contribution of signaling pathways in the cilium or cell body that regulate cilia length is not well understood. So far, only pharmacology that lacks spatial resolution has been used to investigate the role of cAMP in the regulation of cilia length. Using our approach to optogenetically manipulate cAMP levels in the cilium or cell body allows to address the spatial contribution of cAMP signaling in cilia length control. Our results indicate that an increase in cAMP levels and, thereby, cAMP signaling in the cilium or the cell body exerts opposing effects by either increasing or decreasing cilia length, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Indeed, it has been demonstrated in HEK293 cells that an increase in cellular cAMP levels and concomitant PKA-dependent protein phosphorylation at centriolar satellites induced ubiquitination and proteolysis of NEK10 by the co-assembled E3 ligase CHIP and promoted cilia resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Porpora et al., 2018</xref>). This is supported by elegant studies of cilia length control in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hendel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ludington et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Luo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meng and Pan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pan and Snell, 2005</xref>). Here, the IFT machinery and its regulation by phosphorylation plays an important role. There is a negative correlation between IFT particles entering flagella and flagella length, suggesting a length-dependent feedback control of IFT entry. At least in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, phosphorylation of the kinesin-II subunit Fla8 (pFla8) by the calcium-dependent kinase 1 (CDPK1), a homolog of CAMKII, changes the rate of IFT entry and, thereby, flagella length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liang et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, a cellular sensing system controls pFla8 levels, reduces the rate of IFT entry and controls flagella length. In contrast, stimulation of cAMP signaling in the cilium results in an increase in cilia length, probably through cAMP/PKA-dependent signaling pathways, as suggested by experiments in primary cilia of epithelia and mesenchymal cells, where cilia elongation is induced by a cAMP/PKA-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Besschetnova et al., 2010</xref>). In line with this finding, an increase in intracellular cAMP levels and downstream activation of PKA has been shown to contribute to an increase in cilia length by regulating anterograde IFT transport velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Besschetnova et al., 2010</xref>). In these reports, cells have been pharmacologically stimulated with for example Forskolin to increase intracellular cAMP levels. Forskolin activates transmembrane ACs, which have been identified in both, the cilium and cell body. Thus, Forskolin evokes an increase of the cAMP concentration in the cilium and the cell body. Based on the data presented here, this could outweigh the respective effect of cAMP in the cilium or cell body on ciliary length control, or, depending on the expression level of ACs in either compartment, favor an increase or decrease of the ciliary length, respectively. This may explain why some reports demonstrate an increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Besschetnova et al., 2010</xref>), while others see a decrease in cilia length upon Forskolin stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Porpora et al., 2018</xref>). We also performed stimulation with Forskolin and detected no significant change in ciliary length because the data was rather variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Thus, experiments using pharmacological stimulation of cAMP levels have to be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Although a light-stimulated increase in ciliary cAMP levels by bPAC resulted in an increase in cilia length, a decrease in ciliary cAMP levels evoked by photoactivation of LAPD did not change cilia length. Only a cAMP increase in the cell body resulted in a reduction of the cilia length. Thus, cilia length control seems to rely on a spatially segregated increase, but not decrease of cAMP levels. The origin of the cAMP increase determines whether cilia become shorter or longer. A possible explanation for this surprising finding is that PKA is the major target for cAMP and has also been implicated in the cAMP-dependent regulation of cilia length control. In vitro, PKA is half-maximally activated at 100–300 nM. However, a recent report demonstrated that in fact, the sensitivity of PKA for cAMP is almost twenty times lower in cells compared to in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koschinski and Zaccolo, 2017</xref>). In many different cell types, resting cAMP levels have been shown to be around 1 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koschinski and Zaccolo, 2017</xref>), and primary cilia in mIMCD-3 cells contain a similar cAMP concentration as the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). Based on these numbers, we hypothesize that cilia length is mainly regulated by PKA-dependent mechanisms, only responding to an increase of the local cAMP concentration. As described above, this increase has to be well above &gt;1 μM to activate PKA in cells. In turn, reducing basal cAMP levels below 1 μM by photoactivation of LAPD would not result in a change in ciliary length since the activity of PKA, compared to basal levels, would not be changed.</p><p>Our method is highly versatile, as it allows to both manipulate and measure cAMP signaling. Thus, ciliary signaling cascades involving cAMP would be a prime subject to investigate in future experiments. In fact, this includes the prominent ciliary Hedgehog signaling pathway, as stimulation with Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) has been proposed to reduce ciliary cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, GPCR signaling pathways use cAMP as a second messenger for signal transduction. Primary cilia are enriched in specific GPCRs, for example 5-HT<sub>6</sub>, V2R, EP4, SSTR3, or GPR120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berbari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nachury and Mick, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sherpa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hilgendorf et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hilgendorf et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the function of these GPCR-dependent signaling pathways could be analyzed with spatial and temporal resolution using our approach.</p><p>Our approach and complementary developments in other labs using nanobodies for subcellular targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herce et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harmansa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beghein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Steels et al., 2018</xref>) open up new avenues for analyzing signaling pathways in primary and motile cilia, as demonstrated by the application of the cilia-targeted nanobody in zebrafish, and beyond that in many other subcellular domains in vitro and in vivo. The nanobody-based targeting approach conveys high specificity through a strong interaction with its binding partner (K<sub>d</sub> ~1 nM), which is a prerequisite for subcellular targeting and binding of endogenously expressed proteins in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beghein and Gettemans, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Van Overbeke et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, nanobodies are small (~15 kDa) and genetically encoded on one single open reading frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beghein and Gettemans, 2017</xref>). Thus, the generation of transgenic animals, for example mice or zebrafish, expressing the nanobody targeted to a subcellular compartment is straightforward. Analogous to the Cre/loxP recombinase system, the nanobody-based targeting approach offers endless combinations of targeting any protein of interest to a desired subcellular compartment by simply crossing different transgenic lines. This will greatly facilitate the analysis of cellular signaling in the whole cell and in a specific compartment in vivo. Conditional expression patterns will further allow temporally controlled recruitment or cell-type-specific localization. Many transgenic animals have already been generated, expressing optogenetic tools that are either fused to a fluorescent protein or even contain fluorescent proteins as functional read-out, for example biosensors for second messengers. Combining these transgenic lines with transgenic animals that allow nanobody-based subcellular targeting will pave the way for a more systematic and nuanced application of optogenetics to study cellular signaling, for example by targeting Ca<sup>2+</sup>, PKA activity, or lipid sensors, enzymes, or even transcription factors to the primary cilium. Such studies will unravel how subcellular compartments control cellular functions under physiological and pathological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (mouse)</td><td>Nphp3</td><td>NCBI</td><td>NM_028721</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>HEK293</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-1573</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>HEK-TM</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wachten et al., 2006</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (mouse)</td><td>mIMCD-3</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-2123</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (mouse)</td><td>See Sup.

Afterwards, the buffer was replaced with 90 μl ES containing 3 mM probenecid, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 29°C in a fluorescence plate-reader (FLUOstar omega, BMG Labtech). Fluorescence was measured at 29°C with an Ex544 excitation and a 570 ± 10 nm emission filter (FluoForte) or with a 485 ± 6 nm excitation and a 530 ± 15 nm emission filter (Fluo4) (all filters BMG Labtech). During bPAC activity measurements, cells were stimulated with a 488-nm-light pulse (1 W/cm²) for 1 s at 3 min, for 10 s at 21 min, and for 60 s at 45 min. For bPAC+nanobody activity measurements, cells were incubated with 25 µM of IBMX (stock: 250 mM in DMSO, AppliChem) from 5 min before light activation on; light activation was induced 2 min after starting the recording using a 488-nm-light pulse (1 s, 162 µW/cm²). For LAPD and LAPD+nanobody activity measurements, cells were stimulated after 2 min with 100 µM NKH477 (Sigma-Aldrich) in ES buffer. During the measurement, the plate was illuminated with an 850 nm LED (0.5 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>) inside the reader and then switched to a 690 nm LED (0.5 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>) to activate LAPD. At the end of all experiments, ionomycin was added (final concentration: 2 µM, stock: 1 mM in DMSO, Tocris), and fluorescence was recorded until saturation of the signal amplitude. After the end of recording, cell integrity and transfection rate was scrutinized by confocal microscopy of the recorded wells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>FRET imaging</title><p>FRET imaging was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>). HEK293 or HEK-mlCNBD-FRET cells were seeded and transfected with pcA-Cerulean, pcA-Citrine, pcA-Cerulean + pc3.1-VHH<sub>enhancer</sub>-mCherry, or pcA-Citrine + pc3.1-VHH<sub>enhancer</sub>-mCherry (HEK293), and pc3.1-VHH<sub>enhancer</sub>-mCherry, pcDNA3.1zeo_mCherry (HEK-mlCNBD-FRET) as described for LAPD activity measurements. Fluorescence imaging of live cells was performed using the CellR Imaging System (Olympus), consisting of an inverse, fully motorized wide-field microscope (IX81) with a monochromatic CCD camera (XM10), a reflector turret, and an illumination system with an excitation-filter wheel (MT20, 150 W Xenon arc burner). Measurements were performed with a 20x/0.75 objective (UPlanSApo, Olympus) at room temperature under atmospheric conditions. Before the measurement, cells were washed once with ES (extracellular solution) buffer and measurements were performed in ES buffer. The experimental recordings were as follows: Before and after each time-resolved measurements, the mCherry fluorescence (12% light intensity, 200 ms exposure time, 575/25 excitation filter, mCherry-B-0MF Semrock dichroic mirror, 630/20 emission filter) was measured. Time-resolved measurements captured the cerulean (12% light intensity, 100 ms exposure time, 430/25 excitation filter, M2CFPYFP Olympus dichroic mirror, 480/40 emission filter), the citrine fluorescence (12% light intensity, 100 ms exposure time, 500/20 excitation filter, M2CFPYFP dichroic mirror, 535–30 emission filter), and the FRET signal (12% light intensity, 100 ms exposure time, 430/25 excitation filter, M2CFPYFP dichroic mirror, 535–30 emission filter) every 5 s. After 120 s, cells were stimulated with 20 µM isoprenaline hydrochloride (isoproterenol, Sigma Aldrich) or ES buffer as a control. Data was analyzed using Fiji/ImageJ (ImageJ Version 1.52i) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) by selecting mCherry positive cells with freehand ROIs and determining the mean fluorescence intensity for each ROI in each channel. Values were background subtracted and the FRET signal was corrected for bleed-through and cross-excitation with the following formula: FRET<sub>corrected</sub> = FRET – α * cerulean – β * citrine (with α being the determined bleed-through constant and β being the determined cross-excitation constant for the chosen experimental set-up; α and β values were calculated from single cerulean or citrine transfected cells of three independent experiments using the innate ImageJ tool ‘Coloc 2’, and are 0.75 and 0.02, respectively). Data were plotted as a change of cerulean/FRET<sub>corrected</sub> over time. Data were acquired from n = 3 independent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>R-FlincA imaging</title><p>HEK293 cells were seeded and transfected with pcDNA4HMB_R-FlincA or pcDNA4HMB_R-FlincAmut (R221E, R335E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ohta et al., 2018</xref>) (generously provided by Kazuki Horikawa, Tokushima University, Japan) and pEGFP-N1-bPAC (see Supp. Table 1) as described for LAPD activity measurements. Imaging was performed using the CellR Imaging System (Olympus). The experimental recordings were as follows: R-FlincA signal (57% light intensity, 200 ms exposure time, 572/25 excitation filter, mCherry-B-0MF Semrock dichroic mirror, 630/20 emission filter) was measured every 5 s. At 120 s, cells were illuminated for 5 s with 2.1 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> white light, followed by further recording of R-FlincA signal every 5 s for 480 s. Subsequently, bPAC-GFP fluorescence (12% light intensity, 100 ms exposure time, 500/20 excitation filter, M2CFPYFP dichroic mirror, 535–30 emission filter) was measured. Data were analyzed using Fiji/ImageJ (ImageJ Version 1.52i) by selecting low-expressing bPAC-GFP cells with freehand ROIs and determining the mean fluorescence intensity for each ROI in the average signal recorded during the 120 s before white light exposure. Data were plotted as a change of fluorescence over time. Data were acquired from n = 3 measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Imaging of primary cilia</title><p>mIMCD-3 cells were seeded on PLL (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma Aldrich)-coated chambers (µ-Slide 8 Well Glass Bottom, ibidi) and transfected after 24 hr with pc3.1-VHH<sub>enhancer</sub>-HA and pc3.1-mlCNBD-FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>) as described above. The medium was replaced with starvation medium (0.5% FCS) on the following day to induce ciliogenesis. Confocal FRET imaging was performed at the DZNE Light Microscopy Facility using the Andor Spinning Disk Setup (built on an inverted Eclipse Ti Microscope, Nikon) at 37° C. For FRET imaging, the 445 nm laser (18% intensity, 445-, 514-, 640-triple dichroic mirror in the Yokogawa CSU-X1 unit and 5000 rpm disk speed) was used as excitation source, combined with a dual-cam CFP/YFP filter cube (509 nm dichroic mirror with 475/25 nm and 550/49 nm emission filters) to simultaneously measure cerulean and citrine emission with the two EM-CCD cameras (100 ms exposure time, 300 EM gain, 5.36 frames per second frame rate, 10.0 MHz horizontal readout, 1.7 µs vertical readout time, 5x pre Amp gain, −70° C camera temperature). The imaging procedure was as follows: Cells were washed once with ES buffer and measurements were performed in ES buffer. Cilia were imaged with a 100x/1.45 oil objective with 1 µm step size in 10 s intervals. After a stable baseline was obtained, cells were stimulated by drug addition. Cilia-specific fluorescence values were obtained by analyzing the recordings using CiliaQ as described above in ‘Confocal microscopy and image analysis’. The FRET signal was calculated as a ratio of cerulean/citrine, normalized to the mean baseline value before stimulus addition, and plotted as a change over time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>cADDis imaging</title><p>mIMCD-3 cells were seeded as described above. After 24 hr, cells were transduced with the ratiometric cilia-targeted cADDis cAMP assay kit (5-HT<sub>6</sub>-mCherry-cADDis, Montana Molecular). In detail, 25 µl of the BacMAM stock was mixed with 3 µl sodium butyrate (Sigma Aldrich), and 22 µl Opti-MEM (ThermoFischer Scientific). The growth medium on the cells was exchanged with 250 µl Opti-MEM, and the 50 µl mixture containing BacMAM was added dropwise to the well. Cells were incubated for 24 hr at 37° C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and subsequently measured at the DZNE Light Microscopy Facility using the Andor Spinning Disk Setup. For ratiometric cADDis imaging, cpGFP and mCherry were excited with the 448 nm (10%) and 561 nm (10%) lasers, respectively, in combination with a 405, 448-, 561-, 640-quad dichroic mirror in the Yokogawa CSU-X1 unit and 5000 rpm disk speed. Images were acquired on the two EM-CCD cameras simultaneously (100 ms 100 ms exposure time, 300 EM gain, 5.36 frames per second frame rate, 10.0 MHz horizontal readout, 1.7 µs vertical readout time, 5x pre Amp gain, −70° C camera temperature) with a GFP/RFP emission filter cube (580 nm LP dichroic and 617/73 nm and 525/50 nm emission filters). The experimental procedure during imaging and data analysis was performed as described in the Materials and methods section ‘ Imaging of primary cilia’. Data analysis was as described above form mlCNBD-FRET sensor imaging, but without correction for bleed-through and cross-excitation. Accordingly, the cADDis signal was plotted as a ratio of mCherry/cpGFP, normalized to the mean baseline value before stimulus addition, and plotted as a change over time.</p><p>For imaging in combination with bPAC, mIMCD3 cells were transfected with mNphp3(201)-VHH<sub>Lam2</sub>-HA and bPAC-mCherry or mCherry as described above. After 24 hr, cells were transduced with the cilia-targeted cADDis cAMP assay kit (5-HT<sub>6</sub>-cADDis, Montana Molecular) as described above. Six hours after transduction, the medium was replaced with 250 µl starvation medium per well containing 2 µM sodium butyrate and further incubated at 37° C overnight. 24 hr post transduction, cells were measured at the Microscopy Core Facility of the Medical Faculty at the University of Bonn using the Visitron VisiScope Spinning Disk Setup (Build on a Zeiss Axio Observer, Zeiss) at 37° C. For non-ratiometric cADDis imaging in combination with bPAC-mCherry, cpGFP and mCherry were excited with the 448 nm (8%) and 561 nm (10%) laser, respectively, in combination with the 405-488-560bs dichroic mirror in the Yokogawa CSU-W1 unit and the 50 µm pinhole disk at 4000 rpm disk speed. A 60x C-Apochromat water objective (NA = 1.2) was used. Images were acquired on two pco.edge sCMOS cameras simultaneously (200 ms exposure time, 2x binning) with a GFP/RFP emission filter cube. The experimental procedure during imaging and image analysis was the same as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>ELISA-based cAMP measurements</title><p>Total cAMP levels were determined using a CatchPoint assay (Molecular Devices) according to manufacturer’s instructions mIMCD-3, mIMCD-3 bPAC-mCherry, or mIMCD-3 LAPD-mCherry cells were seeded on a PLL (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma Aldrich)-coated 96-well plate (F-Bottom, CELLSTAR, Greiner) at 1.8 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well and incubated over night at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in darkness. During all further experimental procedures, cells or cell lysates were kept in the dark and handled only under dim red (bPAC) or green (LAPD) light, preventing bPAC- or LAPD-activation, respectively. After 48 hr, the medium was changed to starvation medium (0.5% FCS) to induce ciliogenesis. Another 24 hr later, the medium was replaced with ES and cells were either subjected to a 2 min light pulse (465 nm, 38.8 µW/cm²; LAPD: 630 nm, 42.3 µW/cm²) or kept in the dark. Directly after light stimulation, cells were lysed and cAMP amounts per well were determined using a CatchPoint assay (Molecular Devices), according to manufacturer’s instructions. The protein concentration per well was determined with a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Zebrafish as an experimental model</title><p>The animal facilities and maintenance of the zebrafish, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, were approved by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA, 19/175222).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kirk Mykytyn (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors developed new techniques for studying ciliary signaling. Specifically, the authors combined optogenetic and nanobody tools to study cAMP signaling in a cilium. The enzymes that regulate cAMP levels were targeted to cilia and activated subsequently. They demonstrate that cAMP increase in cilia increase ciliary length whereas that in the cell body promotes ciliary shortening. The manuscript is well written, interesting and the tools developed may be useful for studying ciliary signaling in general. We have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) With regard to optogenetically manipulating ciliary cAMP levels, a limitation of the current study is the authors do not provide a direct physiological impact of increased ciliary cAMP levels. Although they demonstrate that cells possessing ciliary targeted bPAC have longer cilia after 16 hours of light stimulation, the assay did not activate bPAC specifically in the cilium. Rather, the entire cell was exposed to light, which will activate bPAC that is localized in the cell body. The authors should acknowledge that ciliary targeted constructs are not exclusively ciliary given the size limitation (Introduction, last paragraph, exclusively should be replaced with enriched). The study would be greatly strengthened if the authors could demonstrate a more immediate readout of optogenetic stimulation of cAMP specifically in the cilium. In the absence of this experiment (although addition of these data are recommended), you will need to alter the text to address this issue.</p><p>2) The data showed that increasing cAMP signaling in cilia promotes ciliary elongation whereas this increase in the cell body induces ciliary shortening. This is an interesting observation. However, in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion, the statement that an increase in intracellular cAMP levels contributes to an increase in cilia length seems to contradict the findings in this paper. This should be clarified. Forskolin is reported to stimulate ciliary length (Besschetnova et al., 2010), which is inconsistent with this work. The author should provide some explanation or speculation.</p><p>3) Figure 1E, if the values are calculated as mCherry/eGFP and eGFP fluorescence is decreasing then shouldn't the values increase after IBMX or forskolin treatment? Also, it would be helpful if the authors explained why different modulators of cAMP signaling were chosen for different assays.</p><p>4) Figure 4H, are the cilia in the before and after panels the same cilium? If not, why not? Similarly, Figure 3H, it would be helpful if videos or images of a time course were included to illustrate the changes in fluorescence.</p><p>5) Throughout the figures, it would be helpful if it was always indicated in the labels that the constructs were fused to a fluorophore. For example, in Figure 1D-G, indicate that bPAC and LAPD were fused to mCherry. Similarly, in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A legend, was mNphp3(201)-VHHlam-4 fused to eGFP? In Figure 1F legend, replace mNphp3(201)-bPAC-mCherry with mNphp3(201)-LAPD-mCherry. In Figure 2—figure supplement 2D legend, remove &quot;cilia-targeted&quot;.</p><p>6) In the Discussion, there should be additional discussion about how versatile this nanobody-optogenetics method would be and also a discussion of possible limitations.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>a) A large number of nanobodies are available, and a new nanobody can be developed if necessary. Therefore, we have a large number of choices for a tag that will be added to POI (protein of interest).</p><p>b) Addition of a tag to POI may interfere with its activity. Choice of a tag should be carefully considered so that addition of a tag or binding of nanobody to a tag will not influence activity of the POI.</p><p>c) Most importantly, what other ciliary signaling pathways can be studied by this method? For example, calcium signaling can be studied by this method but not Wnt or Shh signaling at this time.</p><p>d) what tags are currently used for ciliary targeting.</p><p>e) With regard to measuring cAMP levels in primary cilia, a limitation of this study is the authors have not demonstrated whether these techniques are sensitive enough to measure endogenous ciliary signaling. In Figure 4I, treatment of IMCD cells with 250 µM IBMX only results in a change in fluorescence of 0.1. It is unclear whether this readout is robust enough to detect changes in cAMP levels due to endogenous signaling, such as through a ciliary GPCR.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57907.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) With regard to optogenetically manipulating ciliary cAMP levels, a limitation of the current study is the authors do not provide a direct physiological impact of increased ciliary cAMP levels.

In addition, it would be great if we could combine the ciliary targeting approach with specific illumination of cilia independent of the rest of the cell. Although it cannot be excluded that small amounts of non-ciliary bPAC are activated by light, our targeting approach provides a strong enrichment in the cilium vs. cell body, and the ciliary length measurements clearly demonstrate the spatial resolution of the current experimental set-up. To add another level of complexity and read-out for the specific manipulation of cAMP signaling in the cilium, a combination of our approach with ciliary proteome analysis (e.g. Mick et al., 2015) would be perfect. This would allow to set the stimulus, i.e. an increase of cAMP levels, and then determine the phosphorylation status of known ciliary localized proteins, i.e. the Gli transcription factors, or even the localization of proteins that shuttle in and out of the cilium in a cAMP-dependent manner. This, however, is beyond the scope of this manuscript, but of course we have changed the wording in the Introduction according to the reviewer’s suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data showed that increasing cAMP signaling in cilia promotes ciliary elongation whereas this increase in the cell body induces ciliary shortening. This is an interesting observation. However, in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion, the statement that an increase in intracellular cAMP levels contributes to an increase in cilia length seems to contradict the findings in this paper. This should be clarified. Forskolin is reported to stimulate ciliary length (Besschetnova et al., 2010), which is inconsistent with this work. The author should provide some explanation or speculation.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret any confusion caused by the sentence in question: “In line with this finding, an increase in intracellular cAMP levels and downstream activation of PKA has been shown to contribute to an increase in cilia length by regulating anterograde IFT transport velocity.” Indeed, the Forskolin data is puzzling and needs some more clarification. Forskolin activates transmembrane adenylyl cyclases, which have been identified in both, the cilium and cell body. Thus, Forskolin evokes an increase of the cAMP concentration in the cilium and the cell body. Thereby, the respective effect of cAMP signaling on ciliary length control would either be compensated or, depending on the expression level of ACs in either the cilium or cell body, increase or decrease of the ciliary length would be favored. This explains why some reports demonstrate an increase (Beschetnova et al., 2010), while others see a decrease upon Forskolin stimulation (Porpora et al., 2018). We also performed stimulation with Forskolin and detected no significant change in ciliary length because the data was rather variable (Figure 6A). To clarify and address this issue, we have added a paragraph in the Discussion.</p><p>For clarification, we also changed the following sentence in the Discussion: “Thus, cilia length control only seems to be sensitive to an increase, but not to a decrease in cAMP levels, and the direction of the regulation (lengthening or shortening of cilia) appears to be dependent on the origin of the cAMP increase”. We changed the sentence as follows: “Thus, cilia length control seems to rely on a spatially segregated increase, but not decrease of cAMP levels. The origin of the cAMP increase appears to determine whether cilia become longer or shorter.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1E, if the values are calculated as mCherry/eGFP and eGFP fluorescence is decreasing then shouldn't the values increase after IBMX or forskolin treatment? Also, it would be helpful if the authors explained why different modulators of cAMP signaling were chosen for different assays.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer might be referring to Figure 3E, which illustrates the ciliary cAMP dynamics measured using 5-HT<sub>6</sub>-mCherry-cADDis. The reviewer is correct – the labeling of the y axis was wrong and has now been changed to “ciliary eGFP/mCherry fluorescence”.</p><p>In general, to pharmacologically stimulate cAMP levels in cells, we prefer to use the water-soluble Forskolin analog NKH477, which does not require addition of DMSO as a control. We routinely use NKH477 in HEK293 cells. However, in the literature on cAMP signaling in cilia, in particular in primary cilia, Forskolin seems to be predominantly used, maybe for historical reasons. This is why we also used Forskolin for the ciliated cells, i.e. IMCD-3 cells. In addition, we included IBMX, which blocks phosphodiesterases, as an alternative pharmacological stimulus to increase cAMP levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4H, are the cilia in the before and after panels the same cilium? If not, why not? Similarly, Figure 3H, it would be helpful if videos or images of a time course were included to illustrate the changes in fluorescence.</p></disp-quote><p>Cilia shown in Figure 3H represent different cilia – one contains the 5-HT6-cADDis sensor and mCherry, the other the 5-HT6-cADDis sensor and bPAC-mCherry. Images are shown for the first frame of imaging. Due to the experimental set-up, bPAC-mCherry is directly activated when starting the experiment. Thus, it is not possible to show before and after images, but only cilia with or without bPAC-mCherry. However, we have analyzed 8-10 cilia per condition and demonstrated consistent and significant differences between both conditions, underlining that this method is suited to study an increase of the ciliary cAMP concentration by photo-activation of bPAC.</p><p>Cilia shown in 4H indeed represent the same cilium for the respective before/after condition; during the recording, cilia move and, thereby, appear in the image in different orientations at different time points. In the revised version, we have included a video for the data shown in Figure 4H (Video 1), and also show more individual time points in the supplements to demonstrate the time course (Figure 4—figure supplement 1H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Throughout the figures, it would be helpful if it was always indicated in the labels that the constructs were fused to a fluorophore. For example, in Figure 1D-G, indicate that bPAC and LAPD were fused to mCherry. Similarly, in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A legend, was mNphp3(201)-VHHlam-4 fused to eGFP? In Figure 1F legend, replace mNphp3(201)-bPAC-mCherry with mNphp3(201)-LAPD-mCherry. In Figure 2—figure supplement 2D legend, remove &quot;cilia-targeted&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the labeling in all figures and in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the Discussion, there should be additional discussion about how versatile this nanobody-optogenetics method would be and also a discussion of possible limitations.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>a) A large number of nanobodies are available, and a new nanobody can be developed if necessary. Therefore, we have a large number of choices for a tag that will be added to POI (protein of interest).</p></disp-quote><p>This proof of concept study describes an approach to specifically target a broad selection of optogenetic tools or sensors derived from GFP or DsRed to primary cilia. To expand nanobody-based targeting to this or any other organelle, a few epitope tags with matching nanobodies can be employed, including the synthetic 13 amino acid ALFA tag (Goetzke et al., bioRxiv 2019), the C-tag derived from α-synuclein (de Genst et al., 2010), and the SPOT-tag derived from β-catenin (Traenkle et al., 2015). Targeting via these tags is not only orthogonal to EGFP or mCherry-based targeting, but is also expected to only exhibit a minimal effect on the tagged protein. This may be particularly advantageous if nanobody binding to a fluorescent reporter protein or direct fusion to a fluorescent protein alters its optical properties. This has to be carefully evaluated for each POI. Importantly, epitope tags are also compatible with the reverse strategy: endogenous ciliary proteins can be tagged by CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing techniques, allowing optogenetic tools or sensors, fused to the respective nanobodies, to be recruited to ciliary proteins expressed at endogenous levels, and perhaps even to specific subdomains of primary cilia. Along the same lines, nanobodies against endogenous cilia proteins, e.g. Arl13b may reduce the necessary genetic modifications for cilia targeting. Nanobody-based binding controlled by light or by small molecules will further expand the versatility of this approach (Yu et al., 2019, Gil et al., 2019, Farrants et al., 2020). To date, all intracellular applications of nanobodies require genetic modification of target cells, a limitation that may be overcome with improved strategies for intracellular protein delivery. We have added another paragraph about the different choices for a tag etc. in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Addition of a tag to POI may interfere with its activity. Choice of a tag should be carefully considered so that addition of a tag or binding of nanobody to a tag will not influence activity of the POI.</p></disp-quote><p>See answer to a). We have included a paragraph addressing these points in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Most importantly, what other ciliary signaling pathways can be studied by this method? For example, calcium signaling can be studied by this method but not Wnt or Shh signaling at this time.</p></disp-quote><p>Our method is highly versatile, as it allows to both manipulate and measure cAMP signaling. Thus, ciliary signaling cascades involving cAMP would be a prime subject to investigate. In fact, this includes Shh signaling as stimulation with Shh has been proposed to reduce ciliary cAMP levels (Moore et al., PNAS 2018). Furthermore, GPCR signaling pathways use cAMP as a second messenger for signal transduction. Primary cilia are enriched in specific GPCRs, e.g. 5-HT6, V2R, EP4, Sstr3, or GPR120, just to name a few. Thus, the function of these GPCR-dependent signaling pathways could be analyzed with spatial and temporal resolution using our approach. Most importantly, the nanobody-based ciliary targeting applies to all proteins of interest that can be fused to a tag that is recognized by a nanobody. The tool box can be extended to analyze diverse signaling pathways, e.g. by targeting Ca<sup>2+</sup>, PKA activity, or lipid sensors, enzymes, or transcription factors to the primary cilium. We have amended the discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) what tags are currently used for ciliary targeting.</p></disp-quote><p>Common strategies involve direct fusion to the C terminus of either a full-length GPCR enriched in cilia, e.g. Sstr3 or 5-HT6, to a ciliary protein, e.g. Arl13b, or a truncated ciliary protein, e.g. the first 201 amino acids (aa) of the ciliary mouse Nphp3 protein. We had briefly mentioned these tags for ciliary targeting in the Introduction and have now extended this paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) With regard to measuring cAMP levels in primary cilia, a limitation of this study is the authors have not demonstrated whether these techniques are sensitive enough to measure endogenous ciliary signaling. In Figure 4I, treatment of IMCD cells with 250 µM IBMX only results in a change in fluorescence of 0.1. It is unclear whether this readout is robust enough to detect changes in cAMP levels due to endogenous signaling, such as through a ciliary GPCR.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, we have not used a physiological stimulus, e.g. a ligand for a GPCR in mIMCD-3 cells. The main reason is that the knowledge about GPCRs, coupling to cAMP and for which an agonist has been identified is limited for mIMCD-3 cells, rendering it difficult to set a physiological stimulus. To circumvent this problem, other reports have fused the cAMP sensor to a GPCR, thereby ectopically expressing the GPCR and the biosensor, and then stimulated the cells with the respective ligand of the GPCR (e.g. Moore et al., PNAS 2018, Jiang et al., 2019). However, this approach includes the over-expression of a full-length GPCR, which might already alter ciliary cAMP signaling. We note that in sperm flagella, the mlCNBD-FRET biosensor was perfectly suited to measure changes of cAMP signaling in the physiological range (Mukherjee et al., 2016). Thus, we assume that also in primary cilia, physiological changes of the cAMP concentration can be reliably measured.</p></body></sub-article></article>
