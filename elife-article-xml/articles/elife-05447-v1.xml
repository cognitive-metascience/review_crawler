Brood care, a remarkable behavior promoting the survival of the next generation, has evolved independently numerous times among animals including insects. However, fossil evidence of such a complex behavior is exceptionally scarce. Here, we report an ensign scale insect (Hemiptera: Ortheziidae), <italic>Wathondara kotejai</italic> gen. et sp. nov., from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, which preserves eggs within a wax ovisac, and several freshly hatched nymphs. The new fossil is the only Mesozoic record of an adult female scale insect. More importantly, our finding represents the earliest unequivocal direct evidence of brood care in the insect fossil record and demonstrates a remarkably conserved egg-brooding reproductive strategy within scale insects in stasis for nearly 100 million years.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05447.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05447.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05447.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many animals care for and protect their offspring to increase their survival and fitness. Insects care for their young using a range of strategies: some dig underground chambers for their young, whilst others carry their brood around on their own bodies. However, it was unclear when these strategies first evolved in insects.</p><p>Now Wang et al. report that they have discovered the earliest fossil evidence of an insect caring for its young, in the form of a female insect preserved with her brood in a specimen of ancient amber. The amber comes from northern Myanmar, where amber deposits are around 95–105 million years old. The fossilised insect is an adult female scale insect with a cluster of around 60 eggs on her abdomen. Six young scale insect nymphs are also preserved in the same piece of amber. Wang et al. named this newly discovered species <italic>Wathondara kotejai</italic>, after an earth goddess in South-East Asian Buddhist mythology and the late Polish entomologist Jan Koteja.</p><p>Most scale insect fossils found to date have been males. Fossilised adult females are scarcer, most likely because female scale insects are wingless and less mobile and therefore less prone to accidental burial. The fossil reported by Wang et al. is therefore a rare find, and it is also sufficiently well preserved to reveal that the female's eggs are contained within a wax-coated egg sac. Today there are many species of scale insects, most of which are parasites of plants and many are economically important pests of trees and shrubs. In living relatives of <italic>W. kotejai</italic>, females use a similar wax coating to protect themselves and their offspring: young nymphs hatch inside the egg sac and remain there for a few days before emerging into the outside world.</p><p>This new fossil provides a unique insight into the anatomy and life cycle of a long-extinct insect; it also demonstrates that brood care in insects is an ancient trait that dates back to at least around 100 million years ago at the height of the age of the dinosaurs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05447.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05447.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>scale insect</kwd><kwd>fossil</kwd><kwd>amber</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012CB821900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Haichun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2011T2Z04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarzembowski</surname><given-names>Edmund A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The discovery of the earliest direct evidence of brood care in insects demonstrates a remarkably conserved egg-brooding reproductive strategy within scale insects in stasis for nearly 100 million years.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brood care is an altruistic trait that evolved to enhance the fitness of offspring at a cost to the parents and represents a breakthrough in the adaptation of organisms to their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tallamy, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Clutton-Brock, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gilbert and Manica, 2010</xref>).

In contrast, adult males are delicate, ephemeral insects with simplified wing venation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hodgson and Hardy, 2013</xref>). Scale insects separated from their sister-group, the aphids, at least by the Middle Permian based on the earliest occurrence of Aphidomorpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Szwedo et al., 2015</xref>), with the fossil record probably extending back to the Middle Triassic (trace fossils in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, their fossil record is over-dominated by males entrapped in fossil resins, and fossil adult females are very scarce—probably because they are commonly sedentary or sessile on host plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Koteja, 2000</xref>).

The thick wax cover not only protects the adult female but also serves to shelter her eggs and first instars. Extant ortheziid females have a band of pores on the ventral side of the abdomen, which secrete a waxy ovisac. The eggs and hatched nymphs are protected within the ovisac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), as in extant ortheziids and monophlebids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vogelsang and Szklarzewicz, 2001</xref>). In extant species, the young nymphs hatch within this ovisac and remain there for a few days until they have acquired a thin covering of wax secretion (visible in our specimens as a slight white pubescence on the fossil nymphs), then crawl out through a split in the wax at the distal end of the ovisac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gullan and Kosztarab, 1997</xref>). Extant first instars are mobile and serve as principle agents for dispersion and seeking out suitable feeding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koteja, 2001</xref>). This egg brooding is widely considered to be a primitive form of brood care (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Royle, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Siveter et al., 2014</xref>). Some Early Cretaceous cockroaches have been reported with an ootheca attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Grimaldi and Engel, 2005</xref>, Figure 7.72). However, it is not definitive evidence of egg brooding, because some cockroaches subsequently deposit the ootheca in a suitable crevice. Therefore, <italic>W. kotejai</italic> provides the earliest unequivocal evidence of brood care in insects.</p><p>Brood care is considered to have evolved independently in at least seven insect orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wong et al., 2013</xref>). This remarkable behavior takes several forms of which the most common are egg brooding and offspring attendance. Scale insects have evolved a variety of methods to protect their eggs and hatched nymphs from unfavorable abiotic conditions and natural enemies. Some extant species (e.g., Diaspididae, some Pseudococcidae) even possess an ovoviviparous form or pseudoplacental viviparity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gullan and Kosztarab, 1997</xref>). In addition to Ortheziidae, ovisacs occur in many other families, for example, Monophlebidae, unrelated Coccidae and many Pseudococcidae, in all of which the secretions of a variety of tubular ducts and disc-pores combine to form the ovisac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ben-Dov et al., 2014</xref>). These various types of ovisacs have evolved convergently to protect their offspring from wet and dry conditions, honeydew contamination, and natural enemies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gullan and Kosztarab, 1997</xref>). Our study demonstrates that these significant behavioral and morphological adaptations, associated with considerable maternal investment, were already well established by the mid-Cretaceous.</p><p>Many extant Ortheziidae females feed on roots and fungal mycelia or mosses and lichens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vea and Grimaldi, 2012</xref>) and ‘run about’ in forest litter with the eggs carried in the ovisac attached to their bodies. This is considered to be the most primitive habit in scale insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gullan and Kosztarab, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koteja, 2001</xref>), and similar brood care behavior also occurs in other early scale insects, for example, Margarodidae and Matsucoccidae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koteja, 2001</xref>). Therefore, this behavior probably has an early origin and maybe a synapomorphy for scale insects. Flowering plants and ants are thought to be important drivers for radiation of the most diverse advanced group, the neococcoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Grimaldi and Engel, 2005</xref>). However, both factors are absent in the evolutionary history of basal groups of scale insects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Brood care, greatly promoting the survival of offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Royle et al., 2012</xref>), could therefore have been an important driver for the early radiation of scale insects which occurred during the end of the Jurassic or earliest Cretaceous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Despite a great taxonomic diversity of extant insects with brood care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wong et al., 2013</xref>), direct evidence of such behavior has been reported only in Cenozoic ambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Peñalver et al., 2012</xref>). The new fossil is unique in providing evidence of ovarian and juvenile developmental stages in a fossil insect. More remarkably, it represents the earliest direct evidence of brood care in insects and highlights the long-term stasis of this behavior in archaeococcoids, extending nearly 100 million years.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Burmese amber (amber from northern Myanmar) harbors the most diverse biota in amber from the Cretaceous, and more than 200 families of arthropods have been reported from this deposit. Amber has been recorded from the Shwebo, Thayetmyo, Pakokku, and Pegu districts in Myanmar. However, the only commercial source is the Hukawng Valley in Tanaing Township, Myitkyina District of Kachin State. The amber under study is from an amber mine located near Noije Bum Village, Tanaing Town (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kania et al., 2015</xref>). Four institutes (Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Lingpoge Amber Museum, Huxuan Amber Museum, and Fushun Amber Institute) have collected more than 100,000 amber pieces from this mine, and each piece commonly contains some insects. All these amber pieces were collected from the ‘amber layer’. These deposits have been investigated and dated in detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cruickshank and Ko (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shi et al. (2012)</xref>. We tentatively followed the age (98.8 ± 0.6 million years) given by U-Pb dating of zircons from the volcaniclastic matrix of the amber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shi et al., 2012</xref>). However, some evidence (e.g., high degree of roundness of amber, bivalve borings on the surface of the amber) suggests that the amber was probably reworked before being deposited in the volcaniclastic matrix.</p><p>The type specimen is currently housed in the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology (NIGP), Chinese Academy of Sciences and will eventually be deposited in the Lingpoge Amber Museum in Shanghai (specimen available for study by contacting BW or FX). Photographs were taken using a Zeiss SteREO Discovery V20 microscope system. By merging several photographs of one sample, at different focal planes, a single final photograph was created in which the entire sample was in focus. Blue and green filters were used to improve the contrast between the insect and amber. The figures were prepared with CorelDraw X4 and Adobe Photoshop CS3.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Nomenclatural acts</title><p>The electronic edition of this article conforms to the requirements of the amended International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, and hence the new names contained herein are available under that Code from the electronic edition of this article.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers appreciated your study. The following main issues were identified and should be addressed in the revision.</p><p>1) Whilst it may be true that this record is the first record of actual eggs and young having been found in an insect showing brood care, the importance is slightly over-emphasised. There are earlier records of what are close to the ortheziids (e.g., <italic>Burmacoccus</italic>, from the Early Cretaceous, is pretty clearly an ortheziid, and <italic>Cretorthezia</italic>, also from the Early Cretaceous, is very probably an ortheziid, although these taxa are based on adult males). It is highly probable that these two genera also had adult females with an ovisac, which would surely only be used for brood care. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koteja and Azar (2008)</xref> also described an adult female or late nymph that he placed in <italic>Cretorthezia</italic> which looked very similar to extant ortheziids and is therefore very likely to have had an ovisac. Emphasising that <italic>Palaeorthezia</italic> extends crown-group Ortheziidae back only to the mid-Cretaceous therefore seems to overstate their study when there are earlier known probable ortheziid species. This should be explicitly addressed in the manuscript.</p><p>2) What is the suggestion about genus/species authorship? Who of the authors of the manuscript will be author of the genus/species? This should be made clear.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is based on studies by at least four other sets of workers and some of the studies were not based on any phylogenetic analyses. The tree is therefore hypothetical and this needs to be stated explicitly. Also, <italic>Palaeorthezia</italic> is not apparently included. Surely it should be. But, if it were, it would not be the earliest ortheziid in this figure! You need to include the names of the genera you are referring to in numbers 5 (Early Cretaceous Lebanese amber), 6 (Mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber) and 7 (Eocene Baltic Amber). This would make it much easier for other workers to follow the arguments in this paper.</p><p>4) A significant issue that needs to be addressed is the clear delineation of diagnoses for the new genus and species (even if they are the same), and a clear indication of what collection the specimen will be accessioned within. Both of these issues have implications for whether or not the new taxa can be made available under the ICZN.</p><p>5) There appears to be a minor misunderstanding of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shi et al. (2012)</xref> study that established a radiometric age estimate for the deposit (slightly younger than 100 Ma, as opposed to older than 100 Ma), but this does not impact the main findings of the paper, and is also easily addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05447.008</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Whilst it may be true that this record is the first record of actual eggs and young having been found in an insect showing brood care, the importance is slightly over-emphasised.

The other genus <italic>Cretorthezia</italic> Koteja and Azar was erected based on an adult male from Early Cretaceous Lebanese amber. It has been considered to be a stem group of scale insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hodgson and Hardy, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) or a group within Ortheziidae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vea and Grimaldi, 2015</xref>, Figure 24). A putative female (‘<italic>Cretorthezia sp</italic>.’, unnamed) was tentatively identified as an ortheziid by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koteja and Azar (2008)</xref>, and was further discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vea and Grimaldi (2012)</xref>. This female has wax lobes typical of the Ortheziidae, but preserves some strikingly plesiomorphic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vea and Grimaldi, 2012</xref>). Thus, the systematic position of this specimen is still uncertain.</p><p>The reviewers also mentioned the genus <italic>Burmacoccus</italic> Koteja, which is based on an adult male from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. It belongs to a separate family <italic>Burmacoccidae</italic> (Koteja, 2004), and two recent cladistic analyses also show that it is not closely related to Ortheziidae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hodgson and Hardy, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vea and Grimaldi, 2015</xref>, Figure 24).</p><p>We agreed with the reviewers that the statement that the fossil “extends crown-group Ortheziidae back to the mid-Cretaceous” is “slightly over-emphasised” because <italic>Cretorthezia</italic> from Lebanese amber may be a real ortheziid. We have revised the following to the Discussion:</p><p>“Two Cretaceous genera have been tentatively attributed to Ortheziidae: <italic>Burmorthezia</italic> Vea and Grimaldi in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber is considered […]. Our new fossil supports the view that crown-group Ortheziidae are present in the mid-Cretaceous.”</p><p><italic>2) What is the suggestion about genus/species authorship? Who of the authors of the manuscript will be author of the genus/species? This should be made clear</italic>.</p><p>Simon, Szwedo, and Xia are the authors of the genus/species. We have added the genus/species authorship in the main text: “<italic>Wathondara kotejai</italic> Simon, Szwedo, and Xia, 2015”.</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>is based on studies by at least four other sets of workers and some of the studies were not based on any phylogenetic analyses. The tree is therefore hypothetical and this needs to be stated explicitly. Also,</italic> Palaeorthezia <italic>is not apparently included. Surely it should be. But, if it were, it would not be the earliest ortheziid in this figure! You need to include the names of the genera you are referring to in numbers 5 (Early Cretaceous Lebanese amber), 6 (Mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber) and 7 (Eocene Baltic Amber). This would make it much easier for other workers to follow the arguments in this paper.</italic></p><p>During the review process of our manuscript, a new paper about fossil scale insects has been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vea and Grimaldi, 2015</xref>). It has already presented a comprehensive summary of fossil scale insects, including all taxa and fossil deposits. Thus, we slightly changed our figure to label only several new key taxa that are important for our discussion. We have revised the figure caption of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) A significant issue that needs to be addressed is the clear delineation of diagnoses for the new genus and species (even if they are the same), and a clear indication of what collection the specimen will be accessioned within. Both of these issues have implications for whether or not the new taxa can be made available under the ICZN</italic>.</p><p>We have added more access information about the specimen to the Materials and methods: “… and will eventually be deposited in the Lingpoge Amber Museum in Shanghai (specimen available for study by contacting B.W. or F.X.).” In this manuscript, we gave only the most important information of this specimen, including a brief diagnosis for the new taxa in this manuscript (the same as Chen et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2014; 3:e02844), making it available under the ICZN. We will present a detailed description in the following paper that will be published in a specialized journal.</p><p><italic>5) There appears to be a minor misunderstanding of the</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23"><italic>Shi et al. (2012)</italic></xref> <italic>study that established a radiometric age estimate for the deposit (slightly younger than 100 Ma, as opposed to older than 100 Ma), but this does not impact the main findings of the paper, and is also easily addressed</italic>.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shi et al. (2012)</xref> gave an age for the volcanoclastic matrix of the amber using U-Pb dating of zircons, and they thought that “the age of the volcanic lithic components should be regarded as the age of the amber”. However, some unpublished evidence (e.g., high degree of roundness, bivalve borings on the surface) suggests that the amber was probably reworked before being deposited in the volcanoclastic matrix. Thus, the age of amber may be older than that of the volcanoclastic matrix.</p><p>The detailed discussion of the age is beyond the aim of the paper. We agree with the reviewer that “this does not impact the main findings of the paper”. Thus, we have changed the “over 100 million years” to “nearly 100 million years”, and added a brief introduction to Materials and methods: “We tentatively followed the age (98.8 ± 0.6 million years) given by U-Pb dating of zircons from the volcanoclastic matrix of the amber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shi et al., 2012</xref>). However, some evidence (e.g., high degree of roundness of amber, bivalve borings on the surface of the amber) suggests that the amber was probably reworked before being deposited in the volcanoclastic matrix.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
