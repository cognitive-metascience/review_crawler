In hydrozoan jellyfish, spawning is triggered by dark-light or light-dark transitions acting on the gonad, and is mediated by oocyte maturation-inducing neuropeptide hormones (MIHs) released from the ectoderm. We determined in <italic>Clytia hemisphaerica</italic> that blue-cyan light triggers spawning in isolated gonads. A candidate opsin (Opsin9) was found co-expressed with MIH within specialised ectodermal cells. <italic>Opsin9</italic> knockout jellyfish generated by CRISPR/Cas9 failed to undergo oocyte maturation and spawning, a phenotype reversible by synthetic MIH. Gamete maturation and release in <italic>Clytia</italic> is thus regulated by gonadal photosensory-neurosecretory cells that secrete MIH in response to light via Opsin9. Similar cells in ancestral eumetazoans may have allowed tissue-level photo-regulation of diverse behaviours, a feature elaborated in cnidarians in parallel with expansion of the opsin gene family.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29555.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many animals living in the sea reproduce by releasing sperm and egg cells at the same time into the surrounding water. Animals often use changes in ambient light at dawn and dusk as reliable daily cues to coordinate this spawning behavior between individuals. For example, jellyfish of the species <italic>Clytia hemisphaerica,</italic> which can easily be raised in the laboratory, spawn exactly two hours after the light comes on.</p><p>Researchers recently discovered that spawning in <italic>Clytia</italic> and other related jellyfish species is coordinated by a hormone called ‘oocyte maturation-inducing hormone’, or MIH for short. This hormone is produced by a cell layer that surrounds the immature eggs and sperm within each reproductive organ, and is secreted in response to light cues. It then diffuses both inside and outside of the jellyfish, and triggers the production of mature eggs and sperm, followed by their release into the ocean. However, until now it was not known which cells and molecules are responsible for detecting light to initiate the secretion of MIH.</p><p>Quiroga Artigas et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the MIH work – now discovered that a single specialised cell type in the reproductive organs of <italic>Clytia</italic> responds to light and secretes MIH. These cells contain a light-sensitive protein called Opsin9, which is closely related to the opsin proteins in the human eye well known for their role in vision. When Opsin9 was experimentally mutated, <italic>Clytia</italic> cells could not secrete MIH in response to light, and the jellyfish failed to spawn. This opsin protein is thus necessary to detect light in order to trigger spawning in jellyfish.</p><p>A next step will be to examine and compare whether other proteins of the opsin family and hormones related to MIH also regulate spawning in other marine animals. This could have practical benefits for raising marine animals in aquariums and as food resources, and in initiatives to protect the environment. More widely, these findings could help unravel how sexual reproduction has evolved within the animal kingdom.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Clytia hemisphaerica</kwd><kwd>Oocyte maturation</kwd><kwd>photoreception</kwd><kwd>medusa</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-PEOPLE-2012-ITN 317172 (NEPTUNE)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jékely</surname><given-names>Gáspár</given-names></name><name><surname>Houliston</surname><given-names>Evelyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Houliston</surname><given-names>Evelyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR- 13-BSV2-0008-01 (&quot;OOCAMP&quot;)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Houliston</surname><given-names>Evelyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gamete release in the jellyfish Clytia is mediated by an opsin photopigment expressed in neurosecretory cells of the gonad ectoderm, which release an oocyte maturation hormone in response to light.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Integration of environmental light information contributes to tight coordination of gamete release in a wide range of animal species. The nature of the photodetection systems involved and their evolutionary origins are poorly undestood. Proposed involvement has mainly focussed on light-entrainment of endogenous clocks, which align many aspects of physiology and behaviour, including reproductive ones, to seasonal, monthly or daily cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cermakian and Sassone-Corsi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tessmar-Raible et al., 2011</xref>). Clock entrainment can involve both of the main families of photo-sensitive proteins (photopigments) used for animal non-visual photoreception: the evolutionarily ancient Cryptochrome/Photolyase family, which originated in unicellular eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oliveri et al., 2014</xref>), and the diverse, animal-specific opsin family of light-sensitive G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) known best for involvement in visual photodetection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cronin and Porter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gehring, 2014</xref>). Light cues can also provide more immediate triggers for gamete release, which integrate with seasonal and/or circadian regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaniewska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lambert and Brandt, 1967</xref>), but the involvement of specific photopigments in such regulation has not previously been addressed.</p><p>Members of Hydrozoa, a subgroup of Cnidaria which can have medusae or polyps as the sexual form, commonly display light-regulated sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leclère et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siebert and Juliano, 2017</xref>). They have simple gonads in which the germ cells are sandwiched between ectoderm and endoderm, and unlike many other animals they lack additional layers of somatic follicle cells surrounding oocytes in the female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deguchi et al., 2011</xref>). Light-dark and/or dark-light transitions trigger the release of mature gametes into the seawater by rupture of the gonad ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Freeman and Ridgway, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roosen-Runge, 1962</xref>). Gamete release is coordinated with diel migration behaviours in jellyfish to ensure gamete proximity for fertilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mills, 1983</xref>). We know that the photodetection systems that mediate hydrozoan spawning operate locally within the gonads, since isolated gonads will spawn upon dark-light or light-dark transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freeman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikegami et al., 1978</xref>). Opsin gene families have been identified in cnidarians and provide good candidates for a role in this process, with expression of certain opsin genes reported in the gonads both of the hydrozoan jellyfish <italic>Cladonema radiatum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suga et al., 2008</xref>) and of the cubozoan jellyfish <italic>Tripedalia cystophora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liegertová et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In female hydrozoans, the regulation of spawning is tightly coupled to oocyte maturation, the process by which resting ovarian oocytes resume meiosis to be transformed into fertilisable eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamashita et al., 2000</xref>). Oocyte maturation, followed by spawning, is induced by ‘Maturation Inducing Hormones’ (MIHs), released from gonad somatic tissues upon reception of the appropriate light cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freeman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikegami et al., 1978</xref>). The molecular identity of MIH of several hydrozoan species has been uncovered recently as PRPamide family tetrapeptides, which are released from scattered cells with neural-type morphology present in the gonad ectoderm following dark-light transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takeda et al., 2018</xref>). Here we report the identification of a cnidarian opsin gene expressed in the gonads of the hydrozoan jellyfish <italic>Clytia hemisphaerica</italic> and show by gene knockout that it is essential for spawning via MIH release in response to light. We further show that this opsin is expressed in the same gonad ectoderm cells that secrete MIH, which thus constitute a specialised cnidarian cell type responsible for mediating light-induced spawning. We discuss how these cells show many features in common with photosensitive deep brain neuroendocrine cells, such as those described in fish and annelids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tessmar-Raible et al., 2007</xref>). These cell types may have shared an origin in the common ancestor of the cnidarians and of the bilaterians, an animal clade comprising all the protostomes and deuterostomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spawning <italic>of Clytia</italic> ovaries is induced by blue-cyan light</title><p>MIH release in <italic>Clytia</italic> gonads is triggered by a light cue after a minimum dark period of 1–2 hr, with mature eggs being released two hours later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amiel et al., 2010</xref>). In order to characterise the light response of <italic>Clytia</italic> gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we first assessed the spectral sensitivity of spawning. Groups of 3–6 manually dissected <italic>Clytia</italic> female gonads were cultured overnight in the dark and then stimulated from above with 10 s pulses of monochromatic light across the 340 to 660 nm spectrum. Stimulated ovaries were returned to darkness for one hour before scoring oocyte maturation. Oocyte maturation is accompanied by breakdown of the membrane of the oocyte nucleus (‘GV’ for germinal vesicle) in fully-grown oocytes, followed by polar body emmission and spawning. We found that wavelengths between 430 and 520 nm provoked spawning in at least 50% of gonads, with 470–490 nm wavelengths inducing spawning of ≥75% of gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

To investigate the morphology of these key cells in more detail we performed immunofluorescence to visualise cortical actin and microtubules in cells producing MIH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The <italic>Clytia</italic> gonad ectoderm consists of a monolayer of ciliated epitheliomuscular cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leclère and Röttinger, 2017</xref>), tightly joined by apical junctions and bearing basal extensions containing muscle fibres. These basal myofibres form a layer over the oocytes and stain strongly with phalloidin fluorescent probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). The cell bodies of the MIH-secreting cells were found to be positioned within this epithelial layer, scattered between the much more abundant epitheliomuscular cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takeda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B,D</xref>). A variable number of neural-type processes containing prominent microtubule bundles project basally from these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>), and intermingle with the muscle fibres of surrounding epitheliomuscular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). The cell nuclei were generally located more basally than those of the surrounding epitheliomuscular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>). In regions overlying large oocytes, the gonad ectoderm, including most of the MIH-rich basal processes, was elevated by a characteristic space on the basal side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), probably reflecting the accumulation of extracellular jelly components around oocytes during late stages of growth. This configuration implies that most of the peptide hormone (MIH) is secreted at distance from its site of action at the oocyte surface, consistent with a neuroendocrine function. MIH-positive cells did not have extensive apical domains exposed on the external face of the ectodermal epithelium, although MIH staining was in some cases detected very close to this surface at the interstices between surrounding myoepithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C’ and D”</xref>).

Molecular phylogeny analyses are progressively revealing a complicated evolutionary history for the opsins, involving many gene duplications and losses in separate animal lineages, starting from a set of at least nine genes in the common ancestor of Bilateria, with three or four sequences already present before the cnidarian-bilaterian split (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramirez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vöcking et al., 2017</xref>).

The cnidops group includes some anthozoan opsins and all published opsin genes from the medusozoan clade (jellyfish and hydra), and is probably the sister group to the xenopsin group, which includes opsins from a few disparate protostome taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramirez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vöcking et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We performed molecular phylogeny for the <italic>Clytia</italic> opsin genes by adding the ten sequences to two recent datasets of animal opsin amino acid sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feuda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vöcking et al., 2017</xref>) and using the LG+Γ amino acid substitution model.

According to this scenario, this cell type would have been largely conserved during cnidarian evolution and function similarly today in hydrozoans, whereas during bilaterian evolution further levels of regulation were inserted between the secreting neurons and the responding gametes. Thus in vertebrates, peptide hormone secretion would have been delocalised to the hypothalamus, and the primary responding cells to the pituitary. Our study on opsins has further revealed a parallel between the MIH-secreting cells of the gonad ectoderm in <italic>Clytia</italic> and deep brain photoreceptor cells in vertebrates, as well as equivalent cells in various protostome species that regulate physiological responses through neurohormone release in response to ambient light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fischer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Halford et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tessmar-Raible et al., 2007</xref>). Like the <italic>Clytia</italic> MIH-producing cells, TSH-producing cells in birds and fish pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vigh et al., 2002</xref>), and vasopressin/oxytocin-expressing cells in fish hypothalamus and annelid forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tessmar-Raible et al., 2007</xref>), show opsin-related photodetection, secrete neuropeptide hormones and are implicated in hormonal control of reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Juntti and Fernald, 2016</xref>). We can thus propose that the putative neurosecretory cell type associated with the germ line that regulated gamete release in ancestral metazoans was also photosensitive. The active photopigments in these cells could have been cryptochromes, the most ancient metazoan photopigment family inherited from unicellular ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cronin and Porter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gehring, 2014</xref>) or animal opsins, whose gene family is absent in sponges but expanded extensively in both cnidarians and bilaterians from a common ancestral GPCR gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feuda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gehring, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liegertová et al., 2015</xref>). Under this evolutionary scenario, the essential Opsin9 protein in <italic>Clytia</italic>, and similarly the gonad-expressed <italic>Cladonema</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suga et al., 2008</xref>) and <italic>Tripedalia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liegertová et al., 2015</xref>) opsins, would have replaced the ancestral photopigment in the MIH-secreting cells during cnidarian evolution to provide optimised spawning responses to particular light wavelength and intensity. A parallel can be drawn with the evolution of vision in eumetazoans, in which deployment of animal opsins is thought to have allowed more rapid and precise photoresponses than the ancestral cryptochrome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gehring, 2014</xref>).</p><p>While the scenario above conforms to the evolutionary trend for specialised cell types with distributed functions in bilaterians to evolve from ancestral multifunctional cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arendt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arendt et al., 2016</xref>), an alternative hypothesis is that the <italic>Clytia</italic> gonad photosensitive–neurosecretory cells and deep brain photoreceptors in bilaterian species arose convergently during evolution. Specifically, a population of MIH-secreting cells in hydrozoan gonads, initially regulated by other environmental and/or neural inputs, may have secondarily acquired opsin expression to become directly photosensitive. More widely, cnidarians may have accumulated a variety of multifunctional cell types as specific populations of neural cells, muscle cells or nematocytes acquired photopigments during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Porter et al., 2012</xref>). Cnidarians are characterised by the lack of a centralised nervous system, and correspondingly show localised regulation of many physiological processes and behaviours at the organ, tissue or even the cellular levels. In addition to gamete release, other local light-mediated responses include light-sensitive discharge of cnidocyte-associated sensory-motor neurons expressing hydra <italic>HmOps2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Plachetzki et al., 2012</xref>), diel cycles of swimming activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mills, 1983</xref>) controlled in <italic>Polyorchis</italic> by photoresponsive cells of the inner nerve ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Mackie, 1977</xref>), and tentacle retraction in corals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gorbunov and Falkowski, 2002</xref>). <italic>Clytia</italic> Opsin9, the first cnidarian opsin to have a demonstrated function, is expressed in the scattered, MIH-secreting cells, which act autonomously in the gonad without any need for input from other parts of the medusa. It remains to be determined if they secrete the MIH peptides from localised cellular sites and are connected by synapses. The nature of these cells may thus be neurosecretory or neuroendocrine, rather than neuronal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hartenstein, 2006</xref>), fitting with the idea that neuropeptide signalling between epithelial cells may have predated nervous system evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosch et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Whether Hydrozoa gonad ectoderm MIH-secreting cells and Bilateria deep brain photosensitive cells derived from an ancestral multifunctional photosensory-secretory cell type, or from non-photoresponsive neural cells remains an open question.

These values divided by 1000 correspond to the RFU (Relative Fluorescence Units) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Generation of CRISPR-Cas9 mutant <italic>Clytia</italic> colonies</title><p>The template for <italic>Opsin9</italic> n1 small guide RNA (<italic>Opsin9</italic> n1 sgRNA; sequence in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) was assembled by cloning annealed oligonucleotides corresponding 20 bp Opsin9 target sequence into pDR274 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hwang et al., 2013</xref>) (42250, Addgene), which contains tracrRNA sequence next to a BsaI oligonucleotide insertion site. The sgRNA was then synthesised from the linearised plasmid using Megashortscript T7 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and purified with ProbeQuant G-50 column (GE healthcare) and ethanol precipitation. The sgRNA was dissolved in distilled water at 80 µM and kept at −80°C until use. Purified Cas9 protein dissolved in Cas9 buffer (10 mM Hepes, 150 mM KCl) was kindly provided by J-P Concordet (MNHN Paris) and diluted to 5 µM. The sgRNA was added to Cas9 protein in excess (2:1) prior to injection and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The final Cas9 concentration was adjusted to 4.5 µM and the sgRNA to 9 µM. The mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. 2–3% of egg volume was injected into unfertilised eggs within 1 hr after spawning, prior to fertilisation.</p><p>Injected embryos were cultured for 3 days in MFSW at 18°C. Metamorphosis of planula larvae into polyps was induced about 72 hr after fertilisation by placing larvae (20–80/slide) on double-width glass slides (75 × 50 mm) in drops of 3–4 ml MFSW containing 1 µg/ml synthetic metamorphosis peptide (GNPPGLW-amide; Genscript), followed by overnight incubation. Slides with fixed primary polyps were transferred to small aquariums kept at 24°C, to favour the establishment of female colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carré and Carré, 2000</xref>). Primary polyps and young polyp colonies were fed twice a day with smashed <italic>Artemia</italic> nauplii until they were big enough to be fed with swimming nauplii. Following colony vegetative expansion, a single well-growing colony on each slide was maintained as a founder. After several weeks of growth, polyp colonies were genotyped to assess mutation efficiency and mosaicism, and medusae were collected from the most strongly mutant colony (colony number four obtained using the n1 guide RNA, designated <italic>Opsin9</italic><sup>n1_4</sup>) for further experimentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mutant genotyping</title><p>Genomic DNA from <italic>Clytia</italic> polyps and jellyfish gonads was purified using DNeasy blood/tissue extraction kit (Qiagen).

For the rescue experiment with synthetic MIH, wild type and <italic>opsin9</italic><sup>n1_4</sup> mutant gonads adapted to light conditions were dissected and transferred to 96-well plastic plates and acclimatised for two hours. An equal concentration (100 µl) of double concentrated (2 × 10<sup>−7</sup>M) synthetic WPRPamide (synthetic MIH; Genscript) in MFSW was added in each well to give a final concentration of 10<sup>−7</sup>M. Oocyte maturation was scored after one hour. Spawning followed in all cases where oocyte maturation was triggered. Gonads that spawned prematurely due to manipulation stress were excluded from analysis.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;CRISPR/Cas9 mutation of a gonad-expressed opsin prevents jellyfish light-induced spawning&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado as the Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Laurinda A. Jaffe (Reviewer #2); Steve Haddock (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an outstanding study that provides exciting new information about a long-standing question in the field of developmental biology: how external signals cause eggs and sperm to be released from marine animals, allowing fertilization and development. Dark/light transitions are known to trigger spawning in a variety of species, but this work is the first to identify the cell and opsin that mediate secretion of a hormone that acts on the oocyte to cause its release from the ovary. This signaling also stimulates the oocyte meiotic cell cycle, in preparation for fertilization. The experiments supporting these conclusions are very clear and are beautifully documented. The reviewers were unanimously enthusiastic about quality of the work, particularly the clear and elegant experiments reported.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>Although this paper is generally very well written with excellent figures, we have some minor suggestions for improving the presentation listed below.</p><p>Consider a shorter title, without &quot;CRISPER/Cas 9 mutation&quot;, such as &quot;A gonad-expressed opsin mediates light-induced spawning in jellyfish&quot;. The original title is also fine if the authors want to emphasize the novel way that this method was used. If the method is to be included in the title we strongly suggest it be changed to: &quot;CRISPER/Cas 9 mutation of a gonad-expressed opsin prevents light-induced spawning in jellyfish&quot;.</p><p>The section on opsin phylogeny might be better placed at the end of the Results, with a separate subheading. In the present manuscript, the description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is broken up by two paragraphs about <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Also, the sentence about the absence of detectable opsin 9 expression in non-gonad tissues (subsection “Opsin9 gene knockout prevents oocyte maturation and spawning”, last paragraph) would be better mentioned in connection with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> should be explained for a more general audience. Mention the functions of the various types of opsins (rhabdomeric, retinal, ciliary). Add a phrase to define &quot;bilateria&quot;. Add a reference for the statement that &quot;opsin sequence evolution is rapid&quot;.</p><p>Opsin 9<sup>n1_4</sup> should be defined in the Results.</p><p>The finding that treatment of Opsin 9 KO ovaries with synthetic MIH peptides (subsection “Opsin9 is required for light-induced MIH secretion from gonad ectoderm”) would be better mentioned in the preceding section. At the end of the second paragraph of the section on the prevention of oocyte maturation and spawning, add something like the following: &quot;However, these gonads did release oocytes in response to synthetic MIH peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These oocytes resumed meiosis normally and could be fertilized […]&quot;</p><p>Consider adding a photo (or a sentence) indicating that the oocytes that remained in the ovary in the Opsin 9 KO failed to resume meiosis in the ovary.</p><p>For the section on the opsin requirement for the light-induced MIH secretion (subsection “Opsin9 is required for light-induced MIH secretion from gonad ectoderm”), the second line of evidence seems to be the important one.</p><p>The description of &quot;neuronal morphology&quot; is based on the observation of &quot;neural processes […] that did not appear to form a connected network&quot;. Because further studies would be needed to determine whether these cells are neurons (as defined as cells that are connected to the rest of the nerve net), consider replacing the term neuron, or if it is used, explain that this is a tentative terminology. However, this is not a major issue. The findings are equally interesting whether or not these cells are &quot;neurons&quot;.</p><p>The statement that the MIH-secreting cells &quot;appear to respond individually to light with no obvious coordination of MIH release between them&quot; should be more completely explained.</p><p>References 24 and 32 are the same (Fischer et al., 2013).

The original title is also fine if the authors want to emphasize the novel way that this method was used. If the method is to be included in the title we strongly suggest it be changed to: &quot;CRISPER/Cas 9 mutation of a gonad-expressed opsin prevents light-induced spawning in jellyfish&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this suggestion and have changed the title to: “A gonad-expressed opsin mediates light-induced spawning in the jellyfish <italic>Clytia</italic>”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The section on opsin phylogeny might be better placed at the end of the Results, with a separate subheading.

The Opsin phylogeny section is now the subsection “Evolution of the <italic>Clytia</italic> Opsin9 gene”, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> has been correspondingly repositioned and renamed as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the sentence about the absence of detectable opsin 9 expression in non-gonad tissues (subsection “Opsin9 gene knockout prevents oocyte maturation and spawning”, last paragraph) would be better mentioned in connection with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a sentence: “No Opsin9 expression was detected anywhere else in the medusa”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> should be explained for a more general audience.

Furthermore we re-analysed the phylogenetic relationships between the <italic>Clytia</italic> opsins and other animal opsins using the recently published sequence alignment of Vöcking et al. (2017), rather than the less comprehensive Feuda et al.

At the end of the second paragraph of the section on the prevention of oocyte maturation and spawning, add something like the following: &quot;However, these gonads did release oocytes in response to synthetic MIH peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Because further studies would be needed to determine whether these cells are neurons (as defined as cells that are connected to the rest of the nerve net), consider replacing the term neuron, or if it is used, explain that this is a tentative terminology. However, this is not a major issue. The findings are equally interesting whether or not these cells are &quot;neurons&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the issue of whether the MIH-secreting cells are connected remains to be resolved and have added sentences to this effect in the Results (subsection “Neural type morphology of <italic>Clytia</italic> gonad MIH-secreting cells”), as well as in the Discussion (last paragraph). We have also taken care not to refer to these cells as ‘neural’ or ‘neuronal’ anywhere in the manuscript, using instead using terms such as &quot;cells with neural-type morphology&quot; or &quot;sensory-neurosecretory cells&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The statement that the MIH-secreting cells &quot;appear to respond individually to light with no obvious coordination of MIH release between them&quot; should be more completely explained.</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid possible over interpretation of this non-quantified observation we have removed this sentence and replaced with a short discussion emphasising that connections between MIH/Opsin9 cells remains to be demonstrated, and that the nature of these cells may be more neurosecretory / neuroendocrine cells than neuronal (as distinguished for instance by Hartenstein, 2006).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>References 24 and 32 are the same (Fischer et al., 2013).
