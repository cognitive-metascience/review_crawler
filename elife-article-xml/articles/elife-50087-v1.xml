allows for opening of inaccessible regulatory elements and has been extensively studied in the context of cellular differentiation and reprogramming. In contrast, the function of pioneer activity in self-renewing cell divisions and across the cell cycle is poorly understood. Here we assessed the interplay between OCT4 and SOX2 in controlling chromatin accessibility of mouse embryonic stem cells. We found that OCT4 and SOX2 operate in a largely independent manner even at co-occupied sites, and that their cooperative binding is mostly mediated indirectly through regulation of chromatin accessibility. Controlled protein degradation strategies revealed that the uninterrupted presence of OCT4 is required for post-mitotic re-establishment and interphase maintenance of chromatin accessibility, and that highly OCT4-bound enhancers are particularly vulnerable to transient loss of OCT4 expression. Our study sheds light on the constant pioneer activity required to maintain the dynamic pluripotency regulatory landscape in an accessible state.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pioneer factor</kwd><kwd>chromatin accessibility</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>pluripotency</kwd><kwd>OCT4</kwd><kwd>SOX2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Curie Intra Europen Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meireles-Filho</surname><given-names>Antonio CA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SystemsX</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AgingX</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deplancke</surname><given-names>Bart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P3_179068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suter</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_182655</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deplancke</surname><given-names>Bart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>OCT4 and SOX2 display partially independent activity to regulate chromatin accessibility, and highly dynamic activity of OCT4 is required throughout the cell cycle to maintain pluripotency enhancer accessibility.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription factors (TFs) regulate the expression of genes through interactions with specific DNA sequences located in gene promoters and distal regulatory elements. A minority of TFs display pioneer activity, that is they have the ability to bind and induce the opening of nucleosome-occupied chromatin regions, allowing for the subsequent binding of other TFs and co-factors required for transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cirillo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schaffner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zaret and Carroll, 2011</xref>). Pioneer TFs thereby play a central role in developmental and reprogramming cell fate decisions, which hinge on large-scale reshaping of the chromatin landscape in tissue-specific regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chronis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwafuchi-Doi and Zaret, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jacobs et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pastor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Soufi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Soufi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Takaku et al., 2016</xref>). Gain of chromatin accessibility at previously inaccessible regulatory elements has been reported to require several hours or days after pioneer TF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mayran et al., 2018</xref>). The role of pioneer TFs in maintaining the accessibility of regions that are already open has been much less studied, and little is known about pioneer activity dynamics over the cell cycle.</p><p>The OCT4 (encoded by <italic>Pou5f1</italic>) and SOX2 pioneer TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Soufi et al., 2015</xref>) are absolutely required for the self-renewal of embryonic stem (ES) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Masui et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Niwa et al., 2000</xref>). OCT4 and SOX2 can form a heterodimer that binds to a composite motif at thousands of sites in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nishimoto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yuan et al., 1995</xref>). A recent study has shown that depletion of OCT4 for 24 hr in ES cells leads to loss of accessibility and co-factor occupancy at a large fraction of its bound enhancers involved in pluripotency maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">King and Klose, 2017</xref>). In contrast, the role of SOX2 in the regulation of ES cell chromatin accessibility has not been elucidated. Thus, to which extent the pioneering activities of OCT4 and SOX2 overlap and/or depend on each other to regulate chromatin accessibility in ES cells is unclear.</p><p>Self-renewal requires the ability to progress through the cell cycle without losing cell type-specific gene expression. This is not a trivial task since chromatin accessibility of gene regulatory elements is markedly decreased during S phase and mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Festuccia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hsiung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oomen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stewart-Morgan et al., 2019</xref>). How recovery of chromatin accessibility after DNA replication and mitosis is controlled and whether it requires pioneer activity is poorly understood. The period of genome reactivation occurring at the mitosis-G1 (M-G1) transition coincides with a particularly favorable context for reprogramming by somatic cell nuclear transfer (mitosis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Egli et al., 2008</xref>) and increased sensitivity to differentiation signals in human ES cells (G1 phase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pauklin and Vallier, 2013</xref>). Recent evidence also points at cell cycle stage-specific functions of OCT4 and SOX2 in cell fate regulation. OCT4 expression levels in G1 phase affect the propensity of ES cells to differentiate towards neuroectoderm and mesendoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Strebinger et al., 2019</xref>), and depletion of OCT4 at the M-G1 transition impairs pluripotency maintenance of ES cells and leads to a lower reprogramming efficiency upon overexpression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Depletion of SOX2 at the M-G1 transition impairs both pluripotency maintenance and SOX2-induced neuroectodermal differentiation of ES cells upon release of pluripotency signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deluz et al., 2016</xref>). Whether the particular sensitivity of M and G1 phases to the action of OCT4 and SOX2 is related to the dynamics of their pioneer activity across the cell cycle is unknown.</p><p>Here we studied the interplay of OCT4 and SOX2 in regulating chromatin accessibility of ES cells and dissected the pioneer activity of OCT4 across the cell cycle. We show that most enhancers bound by both TFs depend on only one of them to maintain their open chromatin state, and that cooperative binding of OCT4 and SOX2 is mainly mediated indirectly through changes in chromatin accessibility. Using forms of OCT4 engineered for mitotic or auxin-inducible degradation, we demonstrate the role of OCT4 in continuous maintenance of chromatin accessibility throughout the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>OCT4 and SOX2 regulate chromatin accessibility at mostly distinct loci</title><p>OCT4 and SOX2 bind cooperatively to thousands of genomic locations in ES cells both independently and as a heterodimer on a composite OCT4::SOX2 motif. How OCT4 and SOX2 interplay to regulate chromatin accessibility in ES cells is not known. To address this question, we decided to determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility changes upon acute loss of OCT4 or SOX2. To deplete OCT4 and SOX2 from ES cells in an inducible manner, we took advantage of the ZHBTc4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Niwa et al., 2000</xref>) and 2TS22C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Masui et al., 2007</xref>) mouse ES cell lines, in which a Tet-Off promoter regulates the expression of <italic>Pou5f1</italic> (encoding OCT4) and <italic>Sox2</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While OCT4 is fully depleted after 24 hr of doxycycline (dox) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Niwa et al., 2000</xref>), SOX2 is not, likely due to its longer half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Masui et al., 2007</xref>). We determined SOX2 levels by immunofluorescence staining after 26 and 40 hr of dox treatment and found that residual SOX2 expression persisted after 26 hr but not 40 hr of dox treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, despite its known role in regulating expression of OCT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dunn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Strebinger et al., 2019</xref>), SOX2 depletion for 26 or 40 hr had only a minor impact on OCT4 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). In ZHBTc4 cells, as expected, 24 hr of dox treatment led to the complete depletion of OCT4 and only mildly affected SOX2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Therefore, changes in chromatin accessibility upon short-term SOX2 or OCT4 loss are unlikely to be confounded by changes in expression levels of OCT4 and SOX2, respectively.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Interplay between OCT4 and SOX2 in regulating ES cell chromatin accessibility.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental strategy to compare the effect of OCT4 and SOX2 depletion on chromatin accessibility.

We first compared chromatin accessibility changes between ZHBTc4 cells +/- dox for 24 hr in our culture conditions (serum + 2i + LIF (S2iL), see Materials and methods) to a previous dataset acquired with ZHBTc4 cells +/- dox for 24 hr but cultured in serum + LIF (SL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">King and Klose, 2017</xref>). The good correlation (Pearson’s R = 0.7) in chromatin accessibility changes at OCT4 binding sites between culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) prompted us to take advantage of both datasets for further analysis. We next compared changes in accessibility at SOX2 binding sites in the 2TS22C cell line treated for either 26 or 40 hr with dox, which also displayed a clear correlation (Pearson’s R = 0.61) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We reasoned that the 26 hr dox dataset should be less prone to changes in accessibility due to indirect effects of prolonged SOX2 depletion than the 40 hr dox dataset, while the latter should be more sensitive to identify loci that are still accessible at low SOX2 concentrations. We thus called significantly affected loci using limma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>) (false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05) and selected only those in which the direction of change (decrease or increase in accessibility) was the same for 26 hr vs 40 hr of dox treatment in 2TS22C cells, and likewise for SL vs S2iL in ZHBTc4 cells. In line with previous reports, loss of OCT4 led to decreased accessibility at 20’587 loci, most of which are distal regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Loss of SOX2 also led to decreased accessibility mainly at distal elements, but at fewer loci (7’874). We also found that loss of OCT4 led to a gain in accessibility at 20’209 loci, while 1’080 loci gained accessibility upon loss of SOX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Loci that lost accessibility were highly enriched for OCT4 and SOX2 ChIP-seq binding while loci that gained accessibility were much less so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>).</p><p>To compare the loci impacted by OCT4 vs SOX2 depletion, we next focused on all regions that were bound by OCT4 and/or SOX2 as identified from available and newly generated ChIP-seq datasets (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref> and Materials and methods) and that lost accessibility upon dox treatment. To avoid misrepresenting differences in SOX2 and OCT4 regulation that arise from differences in accessibility due to culture conditions or cell lines, we called significantly different loci (FDR &lt; 0.05) between untreated ZHBTc4 cells cultured in SL vs S2iL conditions as well as between untreated ZHBTc4 cells and 2TS22C cells in S2iL. We then discarded all loci that displayed a large difference (FC &gt;4) in any of those comparisons. We classified the remaining loci as OCT4-dependent (OD, 8’869 loci), SOX2-dependent (SD, 1’834 loci), and co-dependent (CD, 2’973 loci), as defined by loss of accessibility upon depletion of OCT4 only, SOX2 only, or either of them, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). All three groups were enriched for chromatin marks of enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). We performed ChIP-seq analysis of the active enhancer mark H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>) upon OCT4 or SOX2 loss for 24 hr and 26 hr, respectively. All groups displayed a reduction in H3K27ac, suggesting concordant maintenance of enhancer accessibility and activity by OCT4 and/or SOX2 at these loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, all groups were enriched for the binding of both OCT4 and SOX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). 89% of SD sites overlapped with an OCT4 peak and 65% of OD sites overlapped with a SOX2 peak. Therefore, differences in the regulation of chromatin accessibility at these loci cannot simply be explained by differential DNA binding of SOX2 and OCT4. OCT4 has been shown to regulate chromatin accessibility by recruitment of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, including the BRG1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">King and Klose, 2017</xref>). As SOX2 also interacts with BRG1 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2018</xref>), we asked whether SOX2 regulates chromatin accessibility through BRG1 recruitment.

While both OD and CD loci were strongly enriched for the OCT4::SOX2 canonical motif and the OCT motif, SD loci were more enriched for the SOX motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). SD sites were also enriched for the AP-2 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). TFAP2C, a member of the AP-2 family, is known to regulate differentiation into trophoblast stem (TS) cells together with SOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, when reanalyzing data from TS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ishiuchi et al., 2019</xref>) we found SD sites to be highly accessible and SOX2-bound compared to OD and CD loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Furthermore, SD loci were enriched near genes that increased in nascent mRNA expression upon loss of OCT4 (data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">King and Klose, 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), which by itself leads to TS cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, OD and CD loci were enriched near genes that decreased in nascent mRNA expression upon OCT4 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We next aimed to determine the enrichment of pluripotency-associated enhancers falling in the OD, SD, and CD groups. To this end, we checked for enrichment of the nearest gene in three gene ontology (GO) sets associated specifically with pluripotency. We found that these GO sets tended to be most highly enriched in genes near OD loci, although all groups were enriched in at least one of the GO sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I</xref>). We also analyzed the binding profiles of other pluripotency TFs (ESRRB, NANOG, KLF4, SALL4) (data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aksoy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chronis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xiong et al., 2016</xref>) and found the highest enrichment in the CD group, although all these TFs bound to some extent to all groups of loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Notably, all groups were also enriched for the ‘cell differentiation’ GO term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>), in line with the role of OCT4 and SOX2 in ES cell differentiation. Since SOX2 was shown to require PARP1 to bind to a subset of genomic regions in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu and Kraus, 2017</xref>), we asked whether PARP1 dependence could explain the differential regulation of chromatin accessibility between these groups. We thus reanalyzed data from wt and PARP1 knockout (KO) ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yang et al., 2004</xref>), and found a reduction of SOX2 binding in PARP1 KO cells at all groups of loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Thus, PARP1 dependence cannot explain the differential regulation of chromatin accessibility between OD, CD, and SD loci. Overall, these results indicate that OCT4 and SOX2 regulate partially independent sets of pluripotency and differentiation enhancers, with OCT4 having the largest influence on chromatin accessibility of pluripotency-associated regulatory elements.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cooperative binding between OCT4 and SOX2 is mainly mediated indirectly through changes in chromatin accessibility</title><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that OCT4 and SOX2 exhibit cooperative DNA binding. In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments have shown that OCT4 and SOX2 display enhanced binding to the OCT4::SOX2 motif when binding together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mistri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mistri et al., 2018</xref>). While in vitro experiments reported OCT4-assisted binding on a purified nucleosomal template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2019</xref>), single-molecule imaging in live ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>) and ChIP-seq analysis of OCT4 in the presence or absence of SOX2 in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Raccaud et al., 2019</xref>) have provided evidence that SOX2 assists OCT4 binding in vivo. However, while these experiments suggest that OCT4 and SOX2 can display direct cooperativity, the role this mechanism plays in their colocalization in the complex in vivo chromatin and nuclear environment is unclear. We reasoned that the independent regulation of chromatin accessibility by OCT4 and SOX2 at a large number of loci could result in indirect cooperativity, that is each TF could assist the binding of the other through increasing chromatin accessibility. In line with this hypothesis, it was previously shown that upon loss of OCT4, SOX2 binding loss is correlated to the loss in chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">King and Klose, 2017</xref>). However, since in vivo evidence points at a role for SOX2 in mediating cooperative OCT4 DNA-binding rather than vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Raccaud et al., 2019</xref>), we interrogated the genome-wide binding of OCT4 upon loss of SOX2 using ChIP-seq in 2TS22C cells treated with dox for 26 hr. We found that changes in OCT4 binding were also highly correlated to changes in chromatin accessibility upon SOX2 loss (Pearson’s R = 0.77) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We next analyzed OCT4 and SOX2 binding in the presence or absence of SOX2 and OCT4, respectively, at OD, CD, and SD loci. We found that OCT4 binding was only slightly decreased at OD sites in the absence of SOX2, while SOX2 binding at SD sites was mildly increased in the absence of OCT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–K</xref>). These findings were also consistent when narrowing down our analysis to sites containing a canonical OCT4::SOX2 motif, although SOX2 binding did not increase at these SD sites in the absence of OCT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>). The slight loss of OCT4 binding at OD sites upon only minor changes in accessibility suggests that other mechanisms such as recruitment by SOX2 may play a role in the binding of OCT4, in line with SOX2 enhancing OCT4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).</p><p>Upon loss of its partner protein, OCT4 loses binding at 8’324 loci (of which 7’638 are called OCT4 peaks, representing 31% of OCT4 sites) and gains binding at 739 loci (of which 212 are called OCT4 peaks, representing 1% of OCT4 sites). Conversely, SOX2 loses binding at 6’892 loci (of which 5’302 are called SOX2 peaks, representing 29% of SOX2 sites) and gains binding at 4’136 loci (of which 983 are called SOX2 peaks, representing 5% of SOX2 sites). This indicates that the ability of OCT4 to occupy its specific binding sites is more impacted by the absence of SOX2 than vice-versa, and that SOX2 can get rerouted to new loci in the absence of OCT4. We further noticed that loci gaining accessibility upon loss of OCT4, which are enriched for differentiation terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>), also gained binding by SOX2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> columns 6–7 bottom half) and were enriched for the SOX and AP-2 motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). 3’270 loci displayed a significant increase in both accessibility and SOX2 binding. Interestingly, these loci decreased their accessibility upon SOX2 loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>) and gained BRG1 occupancy concomitantly with OCT4 loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>), in line with SOX2 recruiting the BAF complex to promote chromatin opening. This may suggest that OCT4 sequesters SOX2 to OCT4-SOX2 sites, and upon OCT4 loss SOX2 is free to bind and increase the accessibility of differentiation-associated regulatory elements. Overall, these results indicate that cooperative binding of OCT4 and SOX2 in ES cells is mainly mediated indirectly through changes in chromatin accessibility. However, while SOX2 enhances OCT4 binding in general, the presence of OCT4 reroutes SOX2 to pluripotency loci.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>OCT4 is required at the M-G1 transition to re-establish enhancer accessibility</title><p>Transient depletion of OCT4 or SOX2 at the M-G1 transition has been shown to hinder pluripotency maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deluz et al., 2016</xref>), but the underlying mechanisms are not known. This time window coincides with enhancer reopening upon chromatin decompaction, but whether pioneer factors are involved in this process is not clear. As we found OCT4 to have the broadest influence on accessibility of pluripotency-associated loci, we focused on its role in regulating chromatin accessibility at the M-G1 transition. To allow near-complete loss of OCT4 at the M-G1 transition, we used ZHBTc4 cells constitutively expressing OCT4 fused to a SNAP-tag and a Cyclin B1 degron (mitotic degron; MD) or a mutated version thereof (MD*; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kadauke et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, lower than wildtype levels of OCT4 have been shown to sustain or even enhance pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karwacki-Neisius et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Radzisheuskaya et al., 2013</xref>). We thus reasoned that OCT4 levels need to decrease below a certain threshold to impact chromatin accessibility of pluripotency regulatory elements. Furthermore, the MD strategy strongly decreases but does not fully eliminate the target protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deluz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore expressed MD-OCT4 and MD*-OCT4 at lower than wildtype levels from the constitutively active but relatively weak PGK promoter. After lentiviral transduction of the constructs, we stained cells with the SNAP-Cell 647-SiR dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lukinavičius et al., 2013</xref>) and sorted for a narrow window of SNAP expression to obtain the same average level of OCT4 tagged with MD and MD* across the cell cycle, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deluz et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also transduced cells to express YPet-MD in a constitutive manner, which allows for discrimination between cells in early G1 (YPet-negative) and late G1 phase (YPet-positive). In combination with Hoechst staining, this enables sorting cells in early G1 (EG1), late G1 (LG1), S, and late S/G2 (SG2) phase as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kadauke et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Note that dox-treated cells had a longer G1 phase as compared to wt ES cells, as shown before to be a consequence of lower than wt OCT4 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). However, there was only a minor, albeit statistically significant, difference in the proportion of cells in LG1 between MD-OCT4 and MD*-OCT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). We sorted cells in EG1, LG1, S, and SG2 phases, performed ATAC-seq, and compared the accessibility between MD-OCT4 and MD*-OCT4 cells at each cell cycle phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). OCT4-regulated loci that increased or decreased in accessibility upon complete OCT4 depletion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) were also affected by transient M-G1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I–J</xref>). This shows that OCT4 is required at the M-G1 transition to restore chromatin accessibility and that loci gaining accessibility upon OCT4 loss are also dynamically regulated by OCT4 levels.</p><p>To characterize the different dynamic behaviors of chromatin accessibility changes across the cell cycle, we used k-means clustering on the change in accessibility between MD-OCT4 and MD*-OCT4 cells at all accessible loci displaying an OCT4 ChIP-seq peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Two clusters displayed decreased accessibility in EG1 and recovered their accessibility incompletely (cluster 1) or completely (cluster 2) over the cell cycle. Notably, cluster 2 loci were less affected in EG1 than cluster 1 loci, which likely explains their complete recovery. Cluster 3 loci were characterized by a minor decrease in accessibility but that persisted over the cell cycle, and cluster 4 loci were unaffected by OCT4 loss. Cluster 1 loci were more distally located from transcription start sites (TSS) compared to the other clusters, especially cluster 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Cluster 4 was also most enriched for the H3K4me3 promoter mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), in line with OCT4 generally not affecting accessibility at promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">King and Klose, 2017</xref>). In contrast, clusters 1–3 were most enriched for active enhancer marks (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) (data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rickels et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To test whether active histone marks also acutely change upon rapid loss of OCT4, we performed ChIP-seq for H3K27ac across the cell cycle in cells expressing MD-OCT4 or MD*-OCT4. The difference in H3K27ac across the cell cycle between the SNAP-MD-OCT4 and SNAP-MD*-OCT4 cell lines mimicked the corresponding changes in accessibility, although with smaller amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C–F</xref>), suggesting that this modification is also highly dynamic and sensitive to OCT4 levels.</p><p>We then further characterized these clusters by analyzing their enrichment in proximity to genes regulated by OCT4. Loci in clusters 1–3 were enriched near genes that decreased in nascent mRNA expression upon loss of OCT4, in line with these loci being involved in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We next performed GO analysis using the KEGG database and compared the relative enrichment in the clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Interestingly, cluster 1 loci were most enriched near genes annotated for pluripotency and least enriched close to genes involved in MAPK signaling, which promotes the exit from the naïve pluripotent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kunath et al., 2007</xref>). Loci in clusters 1–3 were enriched near genes annotated for PI3K-Akt signaling, which is also involved in the regulation of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yu and Cui, 2016</xref>). This suggests that all three OCT4-dependent clusters contain regulatory elements involved in pluripotency maintenance.</p><p>We analyzed the fraction of regions in the clusters overlapping previously annotated ES cell super-enhancers (SEs) and ‘typical’ enhancers (TEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sabari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>). We found these to be enriched in all clusters compared to non-OCT4 bound accessible regions, with slightly more enrichment in clusters 1 and 3 for both SEs and TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). This suggests that a large fraction of both SEs and TEs are affected across one cell cycle by the transient loss of OCT4 at the M-G1 transition.</p><p>As mentioned above, pluripotency was shown to be maintained at lower than wildtype OCT4 expression levels. To ask whether chromatin accessibility of the observed clusters was OCT4 level-dependent within a higher OCT4 concentration range, we interrogated chromatin accessibility in the context of physiological variations of OCT4 levels. To do so, we took advantage of ATAC-seq data we previously acquired from cells differing in their OCT4 levels by a factor of ~2, due to temporal fluctuations in their endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Strebinger et al., 2019</xref>). We compared chromatin accessibility of the clusters for cells expressing high versus low endogenous levels of OCT4 and found only very minor differences in chromatin accessibility between these groups across all clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>), consistent with the ability of moderately low OCT4 levels to fully sustain pluripotency.</p><p>To understand the reason for the differential impact of transient OCT4 depletion on chromatin accessibility, we performed motif search analysis and compared OCT4 binding at the different clusters. We found a higher enrichment for the canonical OCT4::SOX2 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and a higher OCT4 occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) at cluster 1 loci. Consistently, cluster 1 contained mostly OD and CD loci identified above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>). As high OCT4 binding was a signature of the loci most sensitive to transient OCT4 loss, we next aimed to determine the relationship between OCT4 binding and chromatin accessibility. We compared chromatin accessibility in ZHBTc4 cells in the presence or absence of OCT4 in conditions with matched OCT4 ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">King and Klose, 2017</xref>). The OCT4 ChIP-seq signal was correlated to loss of accessibility upon OCT4 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>) as shown previously, but also to chromatin accessibility in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>), indicating that strong OCT4 binding sites are both highly accessible and sensitive to OCT4 levels. We also found several other motifs that were differentially enriched between the clusters, including KLF, ESRRB, NANOG, and CTCF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). To systematically search for differential binding in the clusters, we looked for overlap with peak regions from 5’261 ChIP-seq datasets from mouse ES cells in the cistromeDB database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mei et al., 2017</xref>), of which 3’628 showed overlap with at least one region in the clusters and were used for subsequent analysis. We trained a random forest model on the data to predict which cluster a region belonged to, based on the peaks it overlapped. This model performed better than random sampling (46.5% true positives compared to 25% expected by chance, Cohen's κ = 0.29) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>), and we thus examined features used for prediction in the model to identify potential binding partners enriched in the clusters. As confirmation of the validity of the approach, the top parameters included OCT4, peaks from Dox-treated ZHBTc4 cells (e.g. SS18/SOX2/NANOG), and promoter marks (e.g. H3K4me3/H3K9ac/RPB2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We identified several factors associated with pluripotency enriched in clusters 1 and 3, including DAX1, SOX2, NANOG, and SALL4. We analyzed binding profiles of all factors described as related to pluripotency regulation in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dunn et al. (2014)</xref> and available in cistromeDB. We confirmed that all of these factors tended to be enriched in clusters 1 and 3, and in particular SALL4, NANOG, ESRRB, SOX2, and TBX3, which were most enriched in cluster 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D</xref>) (data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aksoy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chronis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deluz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stevens et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xiong et al., 2016</xref>). We also found a depletion of RAD21 (a Cohesin subunit) and CTCF in cluster 1, in line with the differential enrichment of the CTCF motif. Indeed, both RAD21 and CTCF, which are involved in the regulation of genome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Phillips-Cremins et al., 2013</xref>), were poorly bound in cluster 1 compared to the other clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4E</xref>) (data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cattoglio et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these results reveal different classes of OCT4-bound loci that show different cell cycle accessibility dynamics upon OCT4 loss at the M-G1 transition, and that sites highly occupied by OCT4 and other pluripotency factors and lowly occupied by CTCF/Cohesin are particularly sensitive to OCT4 loss for the maintenance of their accessibility and H3K27 acetylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>OCT4 is required throughout the cell cycle to maintain enhancer accessibility</title><p>We next asked whether OCT4 also plays a role in maintaining enhancer accessibility in other cell cycle phases. To do so, we generated a cell line allowing drug-inducible degradation of OCT4. Briefly, we used lentiviral vectors to constitutively express the Tir1 ubiquitin ligase (allowing Auxin-inducible ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kepinski and Leyser, 2005</xref>]) and OCT4 fused to mCherry and an Auxin-inducible degron tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Morawska and Ulrich, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>) (mCherry-OCT4-AID) in ZHBTc4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To verify the functionality of this fusion protein, we transduced ZHBTc4 cells with a lentiviral vector allowing expression of mCherry-OCT4-AID under the control of the constitutive EF1α promoter. After sorting for mCherry-positive cells, we plated them at low density and cultured them for one week in the presence of dox to deplete endogenous OCT4 expression, as described previously in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Strebinger et al.

We found that these cells maintained their pluripotency, thus confirming the proper function of mCherry-OCT4-AID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). To ensure near-complete OCT4 depletion upon auxin treatment, we then generated a ZHBTc4 cell line in which OCT4-AID is constitutively expressed at low levels using the PGK promoter. We further expressed YPet-MD in this cell line to allow for cell sorting in different cell cycle phases, as described above. Upon addition of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, also known as Auxin), the AID-tagged OCT4 displayed an exponential degradation profile with a half-life of 0.32 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Since residence times of OCT4 on specific DNA sites are in the second-range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Teves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deluz et al., 2016</xref>), we reasoned that if continuous OCT4 re-binding is required to maintain chromatin accessibility, changes in chromatin accessibility and OCT4 concentration should occur in a quasi-synchronized manner. To test this hypothesis, we performed a time-course experiment by treating OCT4-AID cells with IAA for 0.5 hr, 1 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 4 hr, 6 hr, and 10 hr, and performed ATAC-seq at each time point. We took advantage of our clusters, which showed differential response to OCT4 loss at the M-G1 transition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and analyzed accessibility loss at these loci over time. At all OCT4-responsive clusters (1-3), accessibility loss was near-complete after 1 hr of IAA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>), in line with accessibility being highly dynamic with OCT4 levels. At 6 and 10 hr of treatment, cluster 4 sites that were insensitive to OCT4 degradation at the M-G1 transition started to lose accessibility, suggesting a broader and potentially indirect impact of OCT4 loss on chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We thus focused on the first 4 hr of OCT4 removal to estimate the kinetics of accessibility loss. We fitted a single-component exponential function including an offset to account for the residual ATAC-seq signal after OCT4 loss.

In contrast, pre-mRNA levels of genes close to cluster 4 loci and mRNA (exon-exon) levels were generally unaffected, and one control gene (<italic>Cntln</italic>) displayed a significant increase in mRNA levels after OCT4 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This indicates that rapid OCT4 depletion can impact transcription levels, particularly at genes close to loci regulated in accessibility by OCT4. In summary, these data suggest that regulation of enhancer accessibility and activity is extremely dynamic and requires the constant presence of OCT4.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we dissected the roles and interplay of OCT4 and SOX2 in regulating chromatin accessibility in ES cells. To our surprise, we found a large number of enhancers that were bound by both transcription factors but for which chromatin accessibility was regulated by only one of them. In the future, it will be interesting to explore whether differences in the topology of OCT4 and SOX2 binding sites on the nucleosome surface or genomic location-dependent DNA residence times could explain these findings. While we found a larger influence on chromatin accessibility upon depletion of OCT4 than SOX2, we cannot fully exclude that this is partly caused by differences in protein half-lives or cell lines. Regions bound but not regulated by SOX2, including OD loci, could in principle also be controlled by other SOX family members such as SOX3 or SOX15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corsinotti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Masui et al., 2007</xref>). As OCT4 depletion affects accessibility already after 30 min, we can also not exclude that some of the changes in accessibility observed after long-term (24–40 hr) depletion may be due to secondary effects. Nevertheless, the differential regulation of accessibility between OCT4 and SOX2 is unlikely to be explained by these factors. Our results also show that both OCT4 and SOX2 regulate the genomic occupancy of each other mainly via regulation of chromatin accessibility. This is reminiscent of dynamic assisted loading, in which two TFs assist the loading of each other to either the same or nearby DNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Swinstead et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldstein et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, upon OCT4 loss chromatin accessibility increased at a large number of genomic sites enriched for proximity to differentiation genes, even when OCT4 was degraded for only a brief period of time at the M-G1 transition. The fact that SOX2 occupies these sites and is required to maintain their accessibility suggests that in the absence of OCT4, SOX2 is rerouted to these loci and promotes differentiation together with other partners such as TFAP2C. Therefore, the rapid action of OCT4 in early G1 phase might be required to ensure both the maintenance of chromatin accessibility at pluripotency enhancers and to silence differentiation enhancers. This is further substantiated by the fact that clusters 1 and 3 were particularly enriched for the binding of pluripotency regulatory factors and contained sites that did not fully recover upon OCT4 depletion at the M-G1 transition. Whether the previously shown association of OCT4 to mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deluz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Teves et al., 2016</xref>) facilitates its action in early G1 will require further investigation.</p><p>We found that OCT4 degradation led to a rapid decrease in chromatin accessibility at all clusters of OCT4-regulated enhancers across the cell cycle with very similar kinetics, which tightly mirrored changes in OCT4 concentration and thus suggests highly dynamic regulation of chromatin accessibility by OCT4. However, the recovery of chromatin accessibility upon increase of OCT4 concentration displayed locus-dependent behavior. In contrast to clusters 1 and 2, cluster 3 loci did not recover over the time course of several hours either after M-G1 or auxin-induced degradation. While the mechanisms underlying these findings are unclear, loss across the whole cell cycle (cluster 3) or incomplete recovery (cluster 1) of chromatin accessibility may explain why OCT4 loss at the M-G1 transition results in impaired pluripotency maintenance.</p><p>Protein depletion by degron systems works by increasing protein degradation rates without affecting their synthesis rate. Therefore, they suffer from an inherent tradeoff in maximizing expression levels when the degron is inactive while minimizing residual expression level when the degron is active. Here we expressed OCT4 at relatively low levels to ensure sufficient depletion, allowing us to show that the pioneering function of OCT4 is required constantly and throughout the cell cycle to maintain enhancer accessibility. However, the low dynamic range of accessibility changes prohibits sensitive detection of specific loci that are quantitatively more or less sensitive to OCT4 loss at different cell cycle phases. Furthermore, whether recurrent, transient loss of OCT4 outside of the M-G1 transition would also lead to pluripotency loss would have to be addressed in future studies.</p><p>Here we found that OCT4 is constantly required to maintain chromatin accessibility in self-renewing ES cells. This is reminiscent of a recent study showing that the pioneer factor Zelda is required throughout zygotic genome activation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> for proper gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McDaniel et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, in the context of pituitary lineage specification PAX7 requires 72 hr to fully open melanotrope-specific enhancers but is subsequently not required to maintain these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mayran et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that PAX7 hands over the role of maintaining accessibility to other factors, such as TPIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mayran et al., 2019</xref>), and is only required at the transition between cell fates. This indicates that pioneering activity can have different manifestations that depend heavily on other regulatory factors and chromatin features. Pluripotent stem cells may be particularly dynamic in this regard, as they need to be able to quickly rewire their gene expression programs upon receiving differentiation signals. In contrast, more differentiated cell types may have mechanisms to avoid precocious changes in gene expression upon subtle alterations in the concentration of TFs. Therefore, the high sensitivity of enhancers to the concentration or activity of pioneer TFs in ES cells could serve as a mechanism to regulate cell fate with precise temporal control.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>ZHBTc4 ES cells</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Niwa et al., 2000</xref>)</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_C715">CVCL_C715</ext-link></td><td>OCT4 OFF cell line</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>2TS22C ES cells</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Masui et al., 2007</xref>)</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_E266">CVCL_E266</ext-link></td><td>SOX2 OFF cell line</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit anti-BRG1</td><td>Abcam #ab110641</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10861578">AB_10861578</ext-link></td><td>ChIP (5 μg per 10 million cells)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit anti-OCT4 monoclonal</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10547892">AB_10547892</ext-link> <break/></td><td>ChIP (20 μl per 10 million cells)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit anti-H3K27ac polyclonal</td><td>Abcam #ab4729</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2118291">AB_2118291</ext-link></td><td>ChIP 2 μg/25 μg chromatin)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse anti-OCT4 monoclonal</td><td>Santa Cruz #sc-5279</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_628051">AB_628051</ext-link></td><td>IF (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit anti-SOX2 polyclonal</td><td>Thermo Fisher #48–1400</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2533841">AB_2533841</ext-link></td><td>IF (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>psPAX2</td><td>Addgene</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_12260">Addgene_12260</ext-link></td><td>For lentiviral production</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pMD2.G</td><td>Addgene</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_12259">Addgene_12259</ext-link></td><td>For lentiviral production</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pLV-PGK-YPet-MD</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deluz et al., 2016</xref>)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pLV-PGK-SNAP-MD-OCT4</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Used to generate lentiviral particles for the MD-OCT4 cell line (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Using inducible systems of expression and silencing, as well as cell-cycle stage-specific degradation, the authors draw the following conclusions: 1) OCT4 and SOX2 regulate partially independent loci for chromatin accessibility, 2) OCT4 has a larger effect than SOX2, 3) the cooperative binding of OCT4 and SOX2 is itself regulated by chromatin accessibility, 4) chromatin accessibility is very dynamic and requires OCT4 to be re-established after M phase and also throughout the cell cycle, 5) depletion of OCT4 can reroute SOX2 binding to new sites and 6) TF binding and chromatin accessibility are tightly coupled in pluripotent cells, in contrast to the temporal separation between these two events previously reported in somatic (pituitary) cells. This last point may relate to the hyperdynamic aspect of pluripotent cell chromatin, allowing sensitivity and/or rapid response to developmental signals. Some of the conclusions confirm previous works, but the temporal resolution brought by the study is clearly novel and uniquely interesting. The reviewers appreciated the quality of the experimental design and the impact of the conclusions. There were also some recurrent concerns – mostly implying nuancing the conclusions – and requests for additional experiments to support the conclusions, as listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Additional descriptive analyses of the four identified types of OCT4 target sites (clusters 1 to 4) in Figures 3-5 are needed, to allow speculation about the different properties that may define these distinct classes of binding sites. For example, do they display differences in the number of OCT4/SOX2 binding sites? Are they differentially bound (ChIP-seq signals) or do they exhibit motifs (motif analysis required) by other relevant TFs, such as bookmarking factors (ESRRB or CTCF would be of primary interest)? Do regulatory sites within a cluster tend to be in proximity/regulate the same category of genes (ontology)? Position regarding TADs? A greater depth of discussion/conjecture on this point is really required – why might these sites behave so differently?</p><p>2) There is little analysis relating chromatin accessibility with changes in expression at nearby genes (Figure 2—figure supplement 2 excepted). The functional impact of the observed (rather modest) chromatin changes should be tested at the level of gene expression, at least at a few target genes. This would be an interesting point to infer whether the different properties of the various clusters are functional or not and perhaps whether different clusters are more likely to be more or less important for maintaining pluripotency when exiting mitosis. The OCT4-AID-degron cell line would be the perfect system to examine this question and should avoid a lot of secondary effects that may occur even at 24 hours DOX treatment in the ZHBTc4 cell.</p><p>3) ATAC-seq is a non-specific assay that is largely interpreted as chromatin accessibility, which likely reflects TF binding. Since the authors are specifically looking at peaks that change in ATAC-seq signal before and after OCT4/SOX2 degradation/silencing, changes in ATAC-seq peaks may reflect TF binding loss, rather than direct change in accessibility. To address this concern, the authors should computationally parse the ATAC-seq peaks into different size classes, such as short fragments that represent TF binding regions and 180-250 bp fragments that represent nucleosomes. The authors could then plot the nucleosome fragments in the different peak lists and show that nucleosome occupancy is changing as a function of TF loss.</p><p>4) All reviewers agreed that statistical analyses are required throughout the manuscript. For example, in Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, a small decrease in ATAC-seq signal is observed at OD sites after SOX2 depletion, yet the major conclusion from the authors is that chromatin accessibility is unchanged. Are the authors arguing that this change is insignificant? Hence the need of statistical analyses.</p><p>5) Data should be presented as heatmaps more consistently, not only as bar plots (as it currently is) to really reflect the order of magnitude of the effects observed on chromatin accessibility and histone marks (which are in reality rather modest, but expanded by the bar graph displays). It is at least the case for Figure 3—figure supplement 2C-D (as was done in Figure 3—figure supplement 2B) and in Figure 4D.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50087.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Additional descriptive analyses of the four identified types of OCT4 target sites (clusters 1 to 4) in Figures 3-5 are needed, to allow speculation about the different properties that may define these distinct classes of binding sites.

As described in the original manuscript, we found that unaffected regions were enriched near promoters and we had identified an enrichment for OCT4-SOX2 motifs (Figure 3E) and OCT4 binding (Figure 3F) in cluster 1. We had also performed motif analysis that did not reveal other clear differences between the clusters (revised Supplementary file 2) and commented on this in the original manuscript.</p><p>We have now expanded this analysis substantially. As suggested, we analyzed the number of OCT4/SOX2 binding sites (Figure 3E), showing that cluster 1 loci have a higher prevalence of two binding sites in the same region. We also analyzed motif enrichment in the entire region (defined by peak calling), as opposed to 200bp close to the peak center as done previously, and replaced all motif analysis in the manuscript with whole region motif enrichment. This yielded mostly similar results to what we already commented on in the original manuscript. However, this analysis also yielded additional differential motif enrichments, including lower enrichment for CTCF motifs in Cluster 1 and slight enrichment for ESRRB motifs in Cluster 3. In addition, we have now used the large body of publicly available ChIP-seq datasets that have been processed by a standardized pipeline as part of the cistromeDB project to perform a more unbiased screening of potential co-binding factors in the different clusters that may not be detected by motif analysis. We analyzed the peak overlap of 3’628 ChIP-seq datasets from mouse ES cells in cistromeDB that overlapped with at least one region in our clusters and used this information to train a random forest model to classify the different clusters. The trained model predicted the correct cluster in the test data in 46.5% of cases, as opposed to 25% expected by random chance. Therefore, the features used by the model and enriched in the different clusters can inform us on factors that distinguish the clusters. Top parameters in the model included data from dox-treated ZHBTc4 cells, including a depletion of SOX2 and SS18 binding in cluster 1 after OCT4 depletion compared to the other clusters. This confirms that our approach can identify features that distinguish the clusters. The model uncovered several other expected top parameters, including promoter marks (H3K4me3, POLR2B, H3K9ac) enriched in Cluster 4 and POU5F1 (OCT4) enriched in Cluster 1. In addition, we detected several other pluripotency factors enriched in clusters 1 and 3 including NANOG, SOX2, NR0B1, and SALL4. We thus decided to check for overlap with the network of pluripotency regulators from Dunn et al., 2014, which were enriched in clusters 1 and 3. In accordance with our motif analysis, we found lower enrichment of CTCF, as well as RAD21, binding in cluster 1 compared to the other clusters. This new analysis is described in the manuscript (subsection “OCT4 is required at the M-G1 transition to re-establish enhancer accessibility”, last paragraph) and can be found as Figure 3—figure supplement 4C-E and Supplementary file 3. We have also included a statement on the relevance of these findings in the Discussion (second paragraph) in the context of pluripotency loss when OCT4 is depleted.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we also looked for gene ontology of nearby genes, which revealed differential enrichment of KEGG GO categories in the different clusters, with pluripotency most enriched in cluster 1 (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B). This is described in the third paragraph of the subsection “OCT4 is required at the M-G1 transition to re-establish enhancer accessibility”. Note that we have utilized a Z-normalized scale for relative GO enrichment among the different clusters to avoid bias coming from the different number of regions, as previously done in Schwanhäusser et al. Nature 2011. We have modified all our previous GO analysis to utilize this method, which did not change any of the conclusions (see e.g. revised Figure 2G-I) and described this in the Materials and methods section. We also show that genes near clusters 1-3 are enriched for downregulation upon OCT4 depletion (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A). As suggested, we looked for the position of loci with regards to TAD boundaries (from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chromosome.sdsc.edu/mouse/hi-c/download.html">http://chromosome.sdsc.edu/mouse/hi-c/download.html</ext-link>) and found a very minor enrichment in larger distance to TAD boundaries in cluster 1. Because of the small difference, we have not included this analysis in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50087-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is little analysis relating chromatin accessibility with changes in expression at nearby genes (Figure 2—figure supplement 2 excepted).

Importantly, it is not straightforward to directly compare the effect of changes in chromatin accessibility of the different clusters on transcription, due to the difficulty in assigning specific regulatory elements to their corresponding gene. Based on chromosome conformation capture assays, only 47% of distal regulatory elements interact with the nearest expressed TSS (Sanyal et al., Nature 2012). Furthermore, we do not expect large changes in transcription because of the relatively small changes in chromatin accessibility inherent to our experimental system.</p><p>Nevertheless, we annotated the closest OCT4-bound region to each gene (excluding those where the region was &lt;1 kb from TSS) and among these and for Clusters 1-3, selected 5 genes for which expression was significantly downregulated upon OCT4 depletion for 24 hours according to King et al., 2017. As controls, we chose 7 genes closest to Cluster 4 regions that were shown unaffected by OCT4 depletion (also King et al., 2017). We extracted RNA from 5 replicates of mCherry-OCT4-AID cells untreated or treated with IAA for 2 hours and performed RT-qPCR using primers flanking intron-exon junctions and exon-exon junctions. Pre-mRNAs of genes close to elements in cluster 1-2 and some in cluster 3 tended to be modestly downregulated upon OCT4 depletion, while those close to cluster 4 regions or mature mRNAs were generally not (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F-G). This suggests that transcription of genes near loci whose accessibility depends on OCT4 can be affected by acute OCT4 depletion. This new analysis is included in the last paragraph of the subsection “Dynamic relationship between OCT4 concentration and chromatin accessibility”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) ATAC-seq is a non-specific assay that is largely interpreted as chromatin accessibility, which likely reflects TF binding. Since the authors are specifically looking at peaks that change in ATAC-seq signal before and after OCT4/SOX2 degradation/silencing, changes in ATAC-seq peaks may reflect TF binding loss, rather than direct change in accessibility. To address this concern, the authors should computationally parse the ATAC-seq peaks into different size classes, such as short fragments that represent TF binding regions and 180-250 bp fragments that represent nucleosomes. The authors could then plot the nucleosome fragments in the different peak lists and show that nucleosome occupancy is changing as a function of TF loss.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have now split the reads into bins of 0-100bp (nucleosome-free regions) and 180-250bp (single nucleosomes flanked by accessible regions). We decided to perform this analysis on the acute degradation of OCT4 using IAA treatment for 2 hours as this allows us to clearly assess the direct effects of TF loss on chromatin accessibility. Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-E show that the loss in accessibility upon acute OCT4 depletion also affects nucleosomal regions and therefore excludes that changes in accessibility simply reflect loss of TF binding. We have modified the text to incorporate this analysis (see the last paragraph of the subsection “Dynamic relationship between OCT4 concentration and chromatin accessibility”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) All reviewers agreed that statistical analyses are required throughout the manuscript. For example, in Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, a small decrease in ATAC-seq signal is observed at OD sites after SOX2 depletion, yet the major conclusion from the authors is that chromatin accessibility is unchanged. Are the authors arguing that this change is insignificant? Hence the need of statistical analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that more thorough statistical analysis of our data is useful. We have now included null hypothesis testing using either t-tests or Mann-Whitney U/Wilcoxon tests (when Shapiro-Wilk’s showed evidence of non-normality) at all comparisons of distributions (see e.g. Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, E, G, H, I, J). We have also included Fisher’s exact tests for comparisons of categories (see e.g. Figure 2—figure supplement 2E). Furthermore, we have displayed the p-values of all motif enrichments in the plots. We have justified and explained our choice of statistical tests in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Note that concerning the example mentioned above (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B), these loci have been statistically tested for significant difference in accessibility using the limma algorithm at the differential analysis stage (Figure 1C). However, we did not want to claim that there is no statistically significant difference when analyzing these data as a group, but rather that the effect size is small. We have now included statistical analysis of the distribution of values used to derive metaplots (such as the one referred to) where comparisons are made (see Supplementary file 1). This reveals that there is indeed a strong statistical significance at all comparisons due to the large number of data points measured. We have been careful in our writing so that our claims do not conflate effect size and significance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Data should be presented as heatmaps more consistently, not only as bar plots (as it currently is) to really reflect the order of magnitude of the effects observed on chromatin accessibility and histone marks (which are in reality rather modest, but expanded by the bar graph displays).

We have included the suggested heatmaps in revised Figure 3—figure supplement 2E and Figure 4—figure supplement 2B, D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1E. Because it is difficult to visually appreciate these differences using such plots, we have also included heatmaps of fold-change values (Figure 3—figure supplement 2F, Figure 4—figure supplement 2E).</p></body></sub-article></article>
