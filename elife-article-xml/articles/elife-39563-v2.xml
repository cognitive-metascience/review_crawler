The valve complex is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. Females have a penis-like intromittent organ to coercively anchor males and obtain voluminous semen. The semen is packed in a capsule, whose formation is initiated by seminal injection. It is not only used for fertilization but also consumed by the female as nutrition. The valve complex has two slots for insemination so that <italic>Neotrogla</italic> can continue mating while the first slot is occupied. In conjunction with the female penis, this switching valve is a morphological novelty enabling females to compete for seminal gifts in their nutrient-poor cave habitats through long copulation times and multiple seminal injections. The evolution of this switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in <italic>Neotrogla</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39563.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In dry caves of southeastern Brazil, live a group of insects named <italic>Neotrogla</italic> that are perhaps best known because the egg-producing females have penises while the sperm-producing males have vaginas. The sex roles of these Brazilian cave insects are also reversed: females compete over the males, who in turn are selective of their female partners. This sex role reversal likely evolved within <italic>Neotrogla</italic> because the males’ semen represents a rich and reliable source of energy within a nutrient-poor cave environment. When females are not using semen to fertilize their eggs, they consume it. Yet, while other animals show sex role reversal, <italic>Neotrogla</italic> species alone have reversed sexual organs.</p><p><italic>Neotrogla</italic> penises are spiky and may have evolved so that females can anchor themselves to males and then mate for prolonged periods. This would allow the females to stock up on the nutritious semen. Compared to their closest relatives, <italic>Neotrogla</italic> species can hold twice as much semen within their sperm storage organs. Scientists have speculated that a valve-like structure within this organ enables this extra storage by allowing the female to redirect semen into two separate chambers. But the organ’s small size has made it difficult to determine its inner workings, and scientists have yet to discover a switching valve that serves such a purpose within the animal kingdom.</p><p>Yoshizawa et al. examined three <italic>Neotrogla</italic> species using advanced imaging technology and detected the first example of a biological switching valve. <italic>Neotrogla</italic> females can control this valve, switching the flow of semen between two slots. In this way, females can store two batches of semen at once. Seemingly exploiting this adaptation, the females’ spiky penises help them restrain males until they have received multiple semen injections. Yoshizawa et al. therefore suggest the emergence of this valve within the sperm storage organ may have promoted the evolution of the female penis.</p><p>Along with giving insight into the lives of cave insects, these findings are of interest to engineers, who face challenges when constructing valves on a microscopic scale. The unique switching valve of female <italic>Neotrogla</italic> may one day inspire new man-made machinery that could advance a range of industries.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>sexual selection</kwd><kwd>novelty</kwd><kwd>biomechanics</kwd><kwd>Psocodea</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H04409</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yoshizawa</surname><given-names>Kazunori</given-names></name><name><surname>Kamimura</surname><given-names>Yoshitaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>304682/2014-4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferreira</surname><given-names>Rodrigo L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>754290</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blanke</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The discovery of a biological switching valve provides an example of a mechanism that evolved in nature long before its invention by man and could inspire alternative valve technologies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many man-made engineering solutions have evolved already in insects. Such examples include hinges (flapping flight enabled by the wing base: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brodsky, 1994</xref>), on-off valves (spiracle openings to regulate airflow: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapman, 1998</xref>), backflow valves (the bombardier beetle's defensive spray: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arndt et al., 2015</xref>), coiling mechanisms (genital tubes: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Matsumura et al., 2017a</xref>) or catapult-like mechanisms (the legs of many jumping insects: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burrows, 2013</xref>). Some mechanisms that were formerly thought to be unique to human engineering have been discovered recently in insects: biological screws have been found in a beetle's leg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">van de Kamp et al., 2011</xref>), and interacting gears were found in the jumping legs of planthoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burrows and Sutton, 2013</xref>). The design and construction of such mechanisms on a micrometer scale is a challenging task in engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feinberg et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, studies of micron-scale biological structures can be rewarding as they illuminate construction principles in insects that could be applied to technical solutions in engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Matsumura et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>The genus <italic>Neotrogla</italic> (family Prionoglarididae) is a minute Brazilian cave insect belonging to the order Psocodea (booklice, barklice, and parasitic lice). This genus is of special evolutionary and morphological interest because of the reversal in its genital structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yoshizawa et al., 2014</xref>). The females of <italic>Neotrogla</italic> have a penis-like intromittent organ (gynosome: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is inserted to a male vagina-like genital cavity for copulation. During mating, the male injects liquid semen into the female’s sperm storage organ (spermatheca) through the opening of the spermathcal duct at the tip of the female penis. Within the spermatheca, the injected semen then induces the formation of a hard capsule shell around itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wearing-Wilde (1995)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yoshizawa et al., 2014</xref>). Although there is only a single inlet spermathecal duct present, occasionally two seminal capsules are attached simultaneously to a plate-like structure on the spermatheca (termed ‘spermathecal plate’: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lienhard et al., 1893</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yoshizawa et al., 2014</xref>]).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39563.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Morphology of the spermatheca and spermathecal plate of <italic>Neotrogla</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole abdomen of a virgin female showing the location of the mating system.

To compete for nutritious semen, the direction of sexual selection is reversed in <italic>Neotrogla</italic> (sex-role reversal: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yoshizawa et al., 2014</xref>). Each seminal capsule is voluminous (~0.05 mm<sup>3</sup>, corresponding to ~300 ml scaled up to humans), and the duration of the copulation is very long (for 40 to 70 hr). In a closely related species lacking reversal of genital structure (<italic>Lepinotus patruelis</italic>, Trogiidae), the seminal transfer for forming a similarly voluminous seminal capsule is known to complete in 50 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wearing-Wilde, 1995</xref>). The female penis of <italic>Neotrogla</italic> bears a lot of spines, by which females anchor a male coercively during copulation. Therefore, females are obviously responsible for this very long copulation, probably to obtain more semen from a male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yoshizawa et al., 2014</xref>). After consumption of the semen, the empty capsule is detached from the plate, which is kept within the spermatheca. Because females frequently have empty capsules within the spermathecal pouch (in an extreme case, up to nine empty capsules and two filled ones attached to the plate were observed: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yoshizawa et al., 2014</xref>), female <italic>Neotrogla</italic> can be considered polyandrous, which is apparently controlled actively by the female.</p><p>Although several examples of sex-role reversed animals induced by seminal gifting have been reported, <italic>Neotrogla</italic> so far is the only example with a morphological reversal of its intromittent organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kamimura and Yoshizawa, 2017</xref>). This morphological reversal seems to require further upstream modifications of the genital system, such as the formation of the spermathecal plate, which was reported as an additional novelty tightly associated with the seminal gifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lienhard et al., 1893</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yoshizawa et al., 2014</xref>). However, the detailed morphology and function of this spermathecal plate, which presumably plays an important role in the evolution of the female penis, remained unclear due to the extremely small size of the involved subcomponents and their fragile spatial composition.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the structure of the spermathecal plate by using a combination of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and high-resolution synchrotron microcomputed tomography (HR-µCT) to assess the functional morphology of sperm storage and control of seminal flow. We examined three species of <italic>Neotrogla</italic> (<italic>N. brasiliensis</italic>, <italic>N. aurora</italic> and <italic>N. truncata</italic>), the spermathecal morphology of which is practically identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lienhard et al., 1893</xref>).

This is the location where seminal capsules are formed during copulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Both Sc1 and Sc2 possess a system of patches of resilin, a rubber-like protein found in arthropod cuticles wherever potential energy is stored for spring-like motions or bending of structures. The region surrounding the CE contains extensive resilin patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1CD</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Two larger patches are located where the seminal capsules are attached so that this region can expand to harbor the base of the seminal capsule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DF</xref>). Another resilin-rich region is located around the valve mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1CD</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), where the resilin serves to passively keep the valve opening in the <italic>closed</italic> position. Opening of the valve can only occur through activation of the actuator muscle bundle. In the fixed material analyzed, the muscle bundles are contracted due to the fixation process. Therefore, the switching valve is in an <italic>opened</italic> position in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>.</p><p>The seminal fluid entering the main lumen of the duct can be directed into the left or right channel depending on the position of the CE. If the left part of the actuator muscle is activated, the CE is moved to the left, so that a channel on the right side opens, which then allows for seminal flow into the right capsule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). A small lateral extension at the distal end of the CE serves to close the opposite channel during the opening of the other channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DE</xref>). If the right part of the actuator is activated, the process is executed in reverse. In a female fixed during copula, seminal flow from the duct opening lumen toward one of two seminal capsules was clearly observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Seminal flow can thus be directed by the female through differential muscle activation that moves the CE.</p><p>Measurements of each structure and the estimated power produced by the discernible muscle bundles mentioned above are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39563.007</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Measurements of each component of the spermathecal plate.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Object</th><th>Pennation angle</th><th>Attachment area of muscle [cm2]</th><th>Muscle strength [mN]</th><th>Length [mm]</th><th>Volume [µm3]</th><th>Mass [µg]</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Muscle m1</td><td>34.16</td><td>0.0000199</td><td>0.6562</td><td>0.1</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Muscle m2</td><td>30.18</td><td>0.0000191</td><td>0.6319</td><td>0.08</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Muscle m3</td><td>15.59</td><td>0.0000023</td><td>0.0758</td><td>0.09</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Muscle m4</td><td>44.55</td><td>0.0000133</td><td>0.4374</td><td>0.09</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Muscle m5</td><td>12.26</td><td>0.0000033</td><td>0.1096</td><td>0.09</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Muscle m6</td><td>32.75</td><td>0.0000073</td><td>0.2394</td><td>0.11</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Sum of muscle strength</td><td/><td/><td>2.1503</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Closure element</td><td/><td/><td/><td>0.03</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Spermathecal pouch</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>1847443779</td><td>0.0021246</td></tr><tr><td>Body sclerite 1</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>199709300</td><td>0.0002297</td></tr><tr><td>Body sclerite 2</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>101434410</td><td>0.0001166</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present analyses show that females of <italic>Neotrogla</italic> use a special mechanism to actively control the direction of seminal flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A–D</xref>).

A similar but less sclerotized structure can be observed in close relatives of <italic>Neotrogla</italic> (<italic>Sensitibilla</italic> and <italic>Afrotrogla</italic>, all belonging to the tribe Sensitibillini), suggesting that the structure probably originated in their common ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lienhard, 1893</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lienhard et al., 1893</xref>). <italic>Neotrogla</italic> is distributed in South America, whereas <italic>Sensitibilla</italic> and <italic>Afrotrogla</italic> are distributed in southern Africa. Therefore, the origin of this switching valve dates to at least the break-up of the two continents, over 100 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Seton et al., 2012</xref>). In other psocodeans, no sclerite or muscle corresponding to those of the spermathecal plate elements have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badonnel, 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Klier, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wearing-Wilde, 1995</xref>). The spermathecal plate thus clearly represents an evolutionary novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Müller and Wagner, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of flow control and redirection within this biological switching valve is fundamentally different from that in man-made switching valves, which are used, for example in the oil and gas industry. Technical switching valves use the active rotation of tube or ball elements with various openings to redirect the flow and both closing as well as opening involve an active movement of the valve. In contrast, the observed biological switching valve involves a passive movement component. The seminal flow injected by a male is redirected by a differential inclination of the CE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This inclination is due to the fan-like geometry of the actuator muscle whose parts can pull the CE in the preferred direction to work against the passive closing forces generated by the resilin patches around the valve complex. This muscle-closure element configuration could be advantageous since each muscle bundle pulls in an optimal direction to incline the CE into one of the two opening positions. Additionally, there is no need for lubrication since the moveable parts do not move against each other. Compared to technical switching valves, this design is advantageous to some extent because the muscle forces are not redirected via a lever arm.</p><p>The presence of a spermathecal plate with a valve function to control seminal flow may further refine our understanding of the causes and consequences of the reversed sexual selection in this genus. Female-female competition for males (sex-role reversal) to receive nutritious seminal substances is considered as the most important factor driving the evolution of the female penis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yoshizawa et al., 2014</xref>). Among all animals with known sex-role reversal, <italic>Neotrogla</italic> is the only example in which a female penis evolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kamimura and Yoshizawa, 2017</xref>). In a close relative of <italic>Neotrogla,</italic> the barklouse species <italic>Lepinotus patruelis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wearing-Wilde, 1996</xref>), the sex-roles are also reversed, but the species possesses normal genital structures. Therefore, it is very likely that, in addition to the sex-role reversal, there is at least one other key factor that enabled the evolution of a female penis. Although females of all three known genera of Sensitibillini possess a spermathecal plate, females of <italic>Sensitibilla</italic> do not have a penis-like organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lienhard, 1893</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lienhard et al., 1893</xref>). This strongly suggests that the evolution of the spermathecal plate, possibly including a switching valve, preceded the evolution of the female penis.</p><p>The spermathcal plate has two slots available for insemination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In <italic>Neotrogla</italic> and the related species (<italic>Lepinotus</italic>), content of the capsule is digested as nutrition during the seminal capsule being attached to the spermathecal plate (the transparent capsule shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> is a digested and empty one: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yoshizawa et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, if there is only one slot for insemination, as in the spermatheca of <italic>Lepinotus</italic>, females cannot receive another capsule while digesting one. With the switching valve, the female <italic>Neotrogla</italic> (and possibly <italic>Sensitibilla</italic> and <italic>Afrotrogla</italic>) can selectively use one of two slots for insemination, with leaving the other slot empty. This enables the females to immediately receive an additional seminal package from the same or other males by using the empty slot. Males are predicted to prudently allocate limited resources, such as nutritious seminal gifts and sperm, to multiple females, especially when operational sex ratio is biased to females, rendering female-female competition for male-derived nuptial gifts (i.e, propensity for multiple mating) more intense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe and Kamimura, 2015</xref>). The male-holding organ (spiny female penis) and female-induced long copulation durations of 40 – 70 hr (compared to just ~50 min for formation of one seminal capsule in close relatives) in <italic>Neotrogla</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yoshizawa et al., 2014</xref>) thus can be considered as exaggerated adaptations for such escalated competition for nuptial gifts in this group of insects inhabiting highly oligotrophic cave habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lienhard and Ferreira, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lienhard and Ferreira, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yoshizawa et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The condition of having two freshly deposited spermatophores at once is comparable to that in multiple sperm storage organs reported for females of some animal groups, such as dung flies, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, or tephritid fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ward, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pitnick et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Twig and Yuval, 2005</xref>). Although theory predicts that having multiple sperm stores can be a powerful mechanism for choosing sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hellriegel and Ward, 1998</xref>), evidence is scarce for a gain in fitness by actively selecting for particular sperm from among multiple mates (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Demont et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schäfer et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, in the case of <italic>Neotrogla</italic> and related barklice (<italic>Lepinotus patruelis</italic>), the content of the seminal capsule is digested quite rapidly if not used for fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wearing-Wilde, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yoshizawa et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the switching valve system reported here likely represents an adaptation for direct benefits (i.e., for obtaining more nutrients) rather than for genetic benefits (i.e., for choosing sperm from high-quality males).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Three species of <italic>Neotrogla</italic> were examined.

These tiny insects are adapted to extreme cave habitats and have evolved exceptional genital structures associated with a sex-role reversal. Males produce large, nutritious spermatophores that the females store in their spermathecae for fertilisation as well as for nutrition. Sperm are apparently taken up by females, which possess a penis like intromitting structure that also secures a firm attachment of the male to the female. Copulations can take several days and the general sexual biology suggests that females compete for nutritious seminal capsules and coerce males into lengthy copulations and perhaps into producing additional sperm packages. Little is known about the ecology and behaviour of the species so that the costs of producing seminal capsules as well as the potential benefits for females to receive multiple capsules must remain speculative.</p><p>The current study is concerned with a special valve that females can use to direct the sperm flow. The morphology of female genitals is investigated using μCT and 3D reconstruction as well as confocal laser scanning microscopy.</p><p>I have no major concerns and only editorial suggestions. However, not being a morphologist, I had some trouble understanding what happens during copulation. In a previous study, I found highly relevant additional information that was indeed crucial for my comprehension of the highly peculiar sex in this animal group. To the benefit of a non-specialised readership I would therefore advise to add more detail and less technical language about the copulation procedure.</p><p>I appreciate that word counts are limited but perhaps some of the information could be included into the figure legends if there is no space in the text. To my taste, parts about valve technology could be replaced to some extend with some more details on sexual biology.</p><p>I am fascinated by these animals and am looking forward to additional future insights into their reproductive biology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors present an interesting story about a biological valve in female reproductive system of a cave insect. The manuscript is well composed with clear organization and good writing. The description is on point and the figures are of decent quality. Therefore, I consider its publication in <italic>eLife</italic> to be appropriate, with no additional work required.</p><p>Although, I wish the authors may address the following concern:</p><p>Three species of <italic>Neotrogla</italic> were examined in this study, however, this is not mentioned except in the Materials and methods section, which follows after Discussion section. I think not only it's necessary to describe this information in the main text (Abstract, Introduction, Results section and Discussion section), but also the authors should describe any nuances in morphological difference among the three species examined, if any.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39563.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The three reviews were all in general agreement that the work provided valuable insights into the valve, but that the work required more careful discussion and development of the biological context regarding a number of key points, which are articulated in the reviews below.

Our and previous observations showed that capsules are formed within the females’ sperm storage system during copulation. Those observations show that the formation of the capsule is initiated by seminal transfer. Empty capsules are not prepared by the females as the reviewer might have assumed (again this is due to our previous poor explanations which have now been modified). The capsule formation process is least understood (see below), but probably initiated either by a substance provided by the male or by a protective response of the female against the semen (known as “melanisation”). Alternatively, capsule formation could be a result of a chemical reaction between the semen and spermathecal fluid. Because the female spermatheca does not have any muscles or structures enabling sucking up semen, the seminal transfer is apparently caused by an active infusion of the male, as is the case for the majority of animals including insects. When the semen was not used for fertilization, the content of the seminal capsule was consumed by females while the capsule was attached to the spermathecal plate. After consumption of the content of a capsule, the empty capsule detached from the plate before or during the next copulation. The detached capsule is kept within the spermatheca and is never dissolved.</p><p>The above knowledge on the seminal capsule formation was added in the revised manuscript (Introduction and Discussion section), which we hope remove the readers' confusion about the formation of the seminal capsule and helps to understand the function of the switching valve. In contrast, the detailed process of the formation of the sperm capsule is less well understood. One possible explanation, although not mentioned previously, is that the formation of the capsule shell can be the result of a chemical reaction between the contents of the semen and the spermathecal fluid (like a reaction between a drop of sodium alginate solution put into calcium chloride solution, which provides solid outer shell containing liquid sodium alginate solution). The size of all the sperm capsules is fairly constant possibly because it is: (1) limited by the amount of semen males can produce, or (2) constrained by the balance between the speed of seminal flow and speed of chemical reaction for formation of the capsule shell. In either case (or combination of both), having two openings WITHOUT a switching valve would cause formation of two half-sized seminal capsules which would occupy both plate slots. This would in turn not increase the female's benefit since multiple matings are not possible while previous sperm capsules are consumed or dissolved. We think this explanation, although likely, is too speculative to discuss in the paper.</p><p>Having multiple spermathecae can also be an alternative option to obtain more semen. As also mentioned by reviewer 2 and in our paper, this option is employed by some insects and spiders. In these animals, liquid semen directly fills the spermatheca. In contrast, the evolutionary origin of a hard seminal capsule apparently preceded the evolution of the switching valve in Sensitibillini (formation of the sperm capsule is common in the outgroups). Such differences might have been a factor for the evolution of the switching valve, but it is also too speculative to discuss in the paper.</p><p>The main purpose of our paper is to report and describe the biological switching valve and discuss its potential relationship for the evolution of the female penis. Ultimate factors for the origin of the switching valve deserve attention by future investigations and it would be premature to discuss in the present paper. We therefore also modified the title to tone down the over extrapolations about the ultimate factor for the origin of the switching valve.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is a very interesting study on the fascinating booklice genus Neotrogla. These tiny insects are adapted to extreme cave habitats and have evolved exceptional genital structures associated with a sex-role reversal. Males produce large, nutritious spermatophores that the females store in their spermathecae for fertilisation as well as for nutrition. Sperm are apparently taken up by females, which possess a penis like intromitting structure that also secures a firm attachment of the male to the female. Copulations can take several days and the general sexual biology suggests that females compete for nutritious seminal capsules and coerce males into lengthy copulations and perhaps into producing additional sperm packages. Little is known about the ecology and behaviour of the species so that the costs of producing seminal capsules as well as the potential benefits for females to receive multiple capsules must remain speculative.</p><p>The current study is concerned with a special valve that females can use to direct the sperm flow. The morphology of female genitals is investigated using μCT and 3D reconstruction as well as confocal laser scanning microscopy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your very positive reaction and useful comments to improve the manuscript. Some of the concerns raised by reviewer 2 are in common with those by reviewer 1. Please also see the reply to reviewer 1, in which detailed explanation about the formation process of the sperm capsule is given.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have no major concerns and only editorial suggestions. However, not being a morphologist, I had some trouble understanding what happens during copulation. In a previous study, I found highly relevant additional information that was indeed crucial for my comprehension of the highly peculiar sex in this animal group. To the benefit of a non-specialised readership I would therefore advise to add more detail and less technical language about the copulation procedure.</p><p>I appreciate that word counts are limited but perhaps some of the information could be included into the figure legends if there is no space in the text. To my taste, parts about valve technology could be replaced to some extend with some more details on sexual biology.</p><p>I am fascinated by these animals and am looking forward to additional future insights into their reproductive biology.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provided more detailed explanation about the mating biology and sex-role reversals in <italic>Neotrogla</italic> in the Introduction and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors present an interesting story about a biological valve in female reproductive system of a cave insect. The manuscript is well composed with clear organization and good writing. The description is on point and the figures are of decent quality. Therefore, I consider its publication in eLife to be appropriate, with no additional work required.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for your interests and positive reaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although, I wish the authors may address the following concern:</p><p>Three species of Neotrogla were examined in this study, however, this is not mentioned except in the Materials and methods section, which follows after Discussion section. I think not only it's necessary to describe this information in the main text (Abstract, Introduction, Results section and Discussion section), but also the authors should describe any nuances in morphological difference among the three species examined, if any.</p></disp-quote><p>At the end of the Introduction, we added the information that the present study is based on the examination of three species. No notable morphological differences among these species can be detected in our examination, which was also noted at the beginning of the Material and methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
