proliferative and regenerative potential shortly after birth. In this study, we explored the role of the mechanical properties of the underlying matrix in the regulation of CM maturation. We show that rat and mouse neonatal CMs cultured on rigid surfaces exhibited increased myofibrillar organization, spread morphology, and reduced cell cycle activity. In contrast, compliant elastic matrices induced features of CM dedifferentiation, including a disorganized sarcomere network, rounding, and conspicuous cell-cycle re-entry. The rigid matrix facilitated nuclear division (karyokinesis) leading to binucleation, while compliant matrices promoted CM mitotic rounding and cell division (cytokinesis), associated with loss of differentiation markers. Moreover, the compliant matrix potentiated clonal expansion of CMs that involves multiple cell divisions. Thus, the compliant microenvironment facilitates CM dedifferentiation and proliferation via its effect on the organization of the myoskeleton. Our findings may be exploited to design new cardiac regenerative approaches.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07455.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07455.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07455.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Heart muscle contracts and relaxes in a regular rhythm to pump blood around the body. Soon after birth, the cells that form our heart muscle stop multiplying. As we grow, these cells increase in size and their internal skeleton—called myoskeleton—becomes more complex, to withstand the demands of pumping more blood. However, because the cells can no longer divide, the body is unable to replace heart muscle cells that are damaged by a heart attack or other illness. This lack of ability to regenerate heart muscle is a major challenge for medicine. While researchers have documented many of the changes that occur in heart muscle cells (known as cardiomyocytes) after birth, it is not known exactly what triggers these changes.</p><p>A network of proteins and other molecules—also known as a matrix—surrounds the cardiomyocytes and affects their behavior. Here, Yahalom-Ronen et al. investigated the degree to which the mechanical properties of this matrix affect the ability of cardiomyocytes to divide. In the experiments, cardiomyocytes from newborn rodents were grown on matrices with different rigidities. The cells grown on rigid matrices stopped dividing and became larger with a more robust myoskeleton. These cells also contained two nuclei, which indicates that these cells have become mature cardiomyoctyes.</p><p>In contrast, heart cells grown on a softer matrix continued to multiply. These cells also began to lose some of the features that distinguish mature cardiomyocytes from the cardiomyocytes found in embryos. Next, Yahalom-Ronen et al. treated the cardiomyoctes with a drug that stops them from contracting, which led to increases in cell multiplication.</p><p>Yahalom-Ronen et al.'s findings suggest that the stiffness of the matrix that surrounds heart muscle cells regulates their ability to divide and mature. In the future, these findings may pave the way towards the development of soft scaffolds that can stimulate the regeneration of adult human heart.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07455.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07455.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>rigidity</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd><kwd>dedifferentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC Grant 281289, CMturnover</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tzahor</surname><given-names>Eldad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation (ISF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ISF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tzahor</surname><given-names>Eldad</given-names></name><name><surname>Geiger</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission (EC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EU 710639 (NanoCARD)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geiger</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC Grant 294852, SynAd</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geiger</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Compliant matrix provides a permissive micoenvironment for cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation, cell division and expansion, and thus may open a new avenue towards cardiac regeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the early postnatal period, cardiomyocytes (CMs) undergo a switch from a proliferative, hyperplastic mode to non-proliferative, hypertrophic growth that persists throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soonpaa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soonpaa and Field, 1998</xref>). This process is accompanied by multiple, highly synchronized cellular changes. The expression of cell-cycle and embryonic markers falls precipitously in CMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Walsh et al., 2010</xref>), while the expression of CM differentiation genes increases, along with the appearance of sarcomeres, contractile units that undergo cross-striation to form a functional myoskeletal system within CMs. Further, mechanical and electrical cell-to-cell communication between CMs is established via intercalated discs, containing gap junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Noorman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sheikh et al., 2009</xref>). In parallel, up-regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, as well as increased cross-linking of matrix proteins, also occurs postnatally, leading to an overall stiffening of the heart tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janmey and Miller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Swift et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Majkut et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanisms whereby these complex developmental processes are regulated and coordinated, and their putative effects on CM maturation, are yet enigmatic.</p><p>Over the first week of postnatal life in mice, most CMs exit the cell cycle and differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soonpaa et al., 1996</xref>), although some CMs undergo an additional burst of proliferation in the pre-adolescent period, driven by the thyroid hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Naqvi et al., 2014</xref>). Mammalian CMs display distinct cycling phases: a fetal/neonatal phase in which nuclear division (karyokinesis) is immediately followed by cell division (cytokinesis), and a later neonatal phase, in which karyokinesis proceeds without cytokinesis, leading to binucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soonpaa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 1997a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zebrowski and Engel, 2013</xref>). Binucleation, hypertrophic growth, increased myofibrillar organization, and cell cycle withdrawal are all manifestations of the differentiated state of adult CMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahuja et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Naqvi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zebrowski and Engel, 2013</xref>), while the ‘terminal differentiation’ state is yet uncertain.</p><p>Naturally, there are physiological advantages in the postnatal maturation of CMs. Nonetheless, loss of the proliferative potential of differentiated CMs creates a major barrier to cardiac regeneration after injury. In humans, myocardial infarction (MI) is a life-threatening disease leading to permanent loss of hundreds of millions of CMs, followed by an inflammatory response and formation of scar tissue, that progressively lead to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Virag and Murry, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ausoni and Sartore, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Cardiac regeneration does exist in lower vertebrates such as newts and fish. The zebrafish heart, for example, is able to fully regenerate after injury, without scarring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poss et al., 2002</xref>). The lack of regenerative potential of the mammalian heart was challenged by Porrello and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>), who showed that the neonatal murine heart displays a transient regenerative phase that diminishes within the first week after birth. Both mammalian and zebrafish heart regeneration is characterized by increased CM proliferation associated with sarcomere disassembly, attributed to a CM dedifferentiation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poss, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jopling et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies with diverse cell types indicate that the rigidity of the underlying (or surrounding) matrix strongly influences cell structure, cytoskeletal organization, migration, polarization, and regulation of gene expression and cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pelham and Wang, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Discher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Engler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vogel and Sheetz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geiger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prager-Khoutorsky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shin et al., 2011</xref>). In particular, it was demonstrated that interaction with rigid surfaces (hundreds of kPa and stiffer) promotes the formation of large, integrin-mediated adhesions, and consequently, development of a well-organized and polarized cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prager-Khoutorsky et al., 2011</xref>). Following this logic, we tested here the hypothesis that the decline in CM proliferative and regenerative capacities can be attributed to changes in the mechanical properties of the pericellular environment, which facilitate the assembly of a tightly organized myoskeletal structure. We hypothesize that matrix stiffening, which occurs in the heart after birth, and even more so following MI, is part of a mechanism that blocks CM cell cycle activity.</p><p>In this study, we discovered that soft matrices promote CM dedifferentiation, as evidenced by CM rounding, myofibrillar disassembly, increased CM cell division, and clonal expansion. In contrast, a rigid matrix facilitates CM differentiation, characterized by tightly packed arrays of long and aligned sarcomeric bundles, cell cycle arrest, and binucleation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that matrix rigidity specifically affects CM cytokinesis, but not karyokinesis. We next demonstrated that disruption of the highly organized architecture of the CM myoskeleton, using the myosin-II inhibitor blebbistatin, induced CM cell cycle re-entry. We suggest that the mechanical properties of the postnatal heart play a key role in the acquisition of the fully differentiated phenotype, and inhibition of the specialized contractile system in CMs could be used to promote CM dedifferentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Compliant substrates promote cardiomyocyte morphological changes and proliferation</title><p>To study the effect of matrix rigidity on CM cellular characteristics, we plated newborn (P1) rat CMs on PDMS substrates with different rigidities, ranging from stiff (2 MPa) to compliant (20 kPa and 5 kPa), and analyzed the sarcomeric and cellular organization.

Proliferating CMs were observed on all tested matrices (Ki67+/cTnT+, and PH3+/MHC+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>, respectively). CMs cultured on either glass or on the stiff (2 MPa) substrate presented similar proliferative capacities (data not shown). However, CM proliferation was increased on the compliant substrates (5 kPa and 20 kPa) by ∼50–65%, respectively, relative to the rigid substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, visualized with Ki67), and by ∼25–110% on the 5 kPa and 20 kPa substrates, respectively, marked by PH3+ MHC+ CMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that myoskeletal disassembly, a tendency toward cell rounding, and increased CM proliferation are more compatible with compliant matrices, in comparison with the rigid matrix.</p><p>Inspired by the important finding of the transient regenerative potential in the neonatal mouse heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>), we established a mouse culture system of P1 neonatal CMs cultured on 2 MPa, 20 kPa, and 5 kPa substrates. As in rat CMs, mouse neonatal CMs grew on all substrates, and developed normal beating within 48–72 hr after seeding. We quantified the percentage of proliferating Ki67+ cTnT+ CMs, and observed that both the 5 kPa and 20 kPa substrates facilitated CM proliferation by ∼30–50%, respectively, relative to the rigid 2 MPa substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>). There was no significant difference in the area of cells plated on the different substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similar to the rat system, CMs cultured on the rigid substrate were elongated and more polarized, compared to those on the compliant substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). A decrease in CM cell perimeter, indicative of roundness, was observed on the compliant substrates, compared to the rigid one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Hence, compliant substrates promote CM proliferation as well as alterations in CM cell shape, in both rat and mouse neonatal cultures.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Distinct rigidity-dependent cardiomyocyte proliferation mechanisms</title><p>Various proliferation markers (e.g., Ki67 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, BrdU, PH3, and Aurora B), are widely used for cell-cycle assessment and quantification of cell proliferation; however, they sometimes prove insufficient, especially in CMs in which polyploidization and binucleation are natural outcomes of cell proliferation in the postnatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bersell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zebrowski and Engel, 2013</xref>).

Blocked cytokinesis leads to binucleated CMs. A mitotic checkpoint determines the ability of CMs to re-enter the cell cycle. Compliant substrates control a second checkpoint, mechanical in nature, which enables cytokinesis. Compliant substrates induce CM dedifferentiation into a less organized, immature and proliferative state. This state involves cytoskeletal disarrangements leading to CM mitotic rounding, thus enabling cell division.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07455.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07455.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07455-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>What is the mechanism underlying the matrix rigidity-dependent CM dedifferentiation process? In particular, we wondered whether there is a clear hierarchy between the mechanical properties of the heart during embryonic and postnatal stages. We propose that the rigidification of the heart after birth from 10-20 kPa to 40–55 kPa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jacot et al., 2010</xref>) promotes CM terminal differentiation by triggering the formation of a rigid myoskeleton that mechanically interferes with CM cytokinesis, without affecting karyokinesis. Ultimately, this physiological transition leads to an accumulation of binucleated CMs, correlating with the transition from embryonic hyperplastic growth of CMs, to postnatal hypertrophic growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>It was previously shown that CM shape is linked to sarcomeric alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bray et al., 2008</xref>); circular CMs do not assemble actin networks or sarcomeric arrays, whereas rectangular CMs do. Consistent with this, we show high polarity and organization of triangular CMs on rigid substrates, as opposed to low polarity, roundness, and disorganized sarcomeres on compliant substrates. Eukaryotic cell division requires cellular and cytoskeletal remodeling: cells become round and spherical upon entering mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heng and Koh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>). This mitotic rounding is, to some extent, considered a hallmark of cell division, and the interplay between the actin cytoskeleton, cell shape, and the developing mitotic spindle are all involved in this rounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cadart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lancaster and Baum, 2014</xref>). Thus, it appears that cytoskeletal organization and cell-cycle control are linked together.</p><p>In line with this notion, we demonstrate that inhibition of the organized CM contractile apparatus following blebbistatin treatment resulted in increased CM cell cycle re-entry. We show an increase in Ki67-expressing CMs in the presence of blebbistatin on the 2 MPa and 20 kPa rigidities. Blebbistatin treatment strongly perturbed CM myoskeletal organization and consequently induced CM cell cycle activity, suggesting that the development of a robust myoskeleton in CMs is linked to their cell cycle arrest. We suggest that compliant matrices promote CM proliferation primarily via their effect on the organization of the myoskeleton. More broadly, we propose that the rigid matrix increases the forces imposed on the CMs' actin myoskeleton and this facilitates CM differentiation, while inhibition of sarcomeric organization, function and contractility by blebbistatin has the opposite effect, eventually, leading to CM dedifferentiation. That said, it was previously shown that long blebbistatin treatment inhibits cell division, leading to generation of polyploid megakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shin et al., 2011</xref>). Polyploidity and binucleation are natural outcomes of postnatal CM proliferation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zebrowski and Engel, 2013</xref>). It is possible that the high CM cell-cycle activity observed in the presence of blebbistatin may ultimately result in inhibition of cytokinesis, leading to CM binucleation, or even multinucleation.</p><p>One of the most important findings in this study is that cytokinesis, but not karyokinesis, is affected by matrix rigidity: it is facilitated by the compliant substrates, or inhibited by the rigid substrate. Taken together, the data presented here suggest that committed CMs cultured on the 20 kPa (and, to some extent, the 5 kPa) substrate lose the environmental mechanical barrier, leading to the disorganization of the myoskeleton, which facilitates the acquisition of a rounded morphology compatible with cytokinesis and cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms underlying CM binucleation, due to failure to complete cytokinesis, are poorly understood. Recently, the view that binucleated CMs cannot divide was challenged, showing that a proliferative burst on P15, induced by a thyroid hormone surge, led to a 1.4-fold increase in CM number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Naqvi et al., 2014</xref>). We observed rare events of binucleated CMs attempting to divide, though most remain binucleated. However, the few successful division events were facilitated by growth on the 20 kPa matrix, further supporting the notion that CM can respond to matrix rigidity. Interestingly, transgenic expression of a constitutively active (ca) form of ErbB2 in mouse CMs during the neonatal and adult periods could stimulate CM division, expanding the postnatal proliferative and regenerative windows into adulthood. Stimulation of CM division by caErbB2 involved both CM dedifferentiation, and hypertrophy leading to cardiomegaly. In line with the observed dedifferentiation phenotype, caErbB2 signaling promoted proliferation of mono- and bi-nucleated CMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Uva et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In other model systems, rigidity was shown to influence proliferation and stemness of cells. In line with our data, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and MCF10A cells proliferate best on ∼24 kPa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klein et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, muscle stem cells (MuSCs) that were cultured on a soft substrate that mimics muscle tissue rigidity (∼12 kPa) display delayed differentiation, self-renewal, and maintained stemness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilbert et al., 2010</xref>). In agreement with our findings, these researchers propose that decreased rigidity preserves stemness by altering cell shape, resulting in cytoskeletal rearrangements.</p><p>In both neonatal mice and adult zebrafish, cardiac regeneration processes were accompanied by loss of sarcomeric structures and re-acquisition of cell division, both attributed to CM dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poss, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jopling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>). Our correlative live-imaging and immunostaining results support the notion that dedifferentiated CMs disassemble their sarcomeres, in order to divide.</p><p>The fact that CMs have lost MHC or cTnT expression, and the partial disassembly of the sarcomeres during cytokinesis, further support our model of CM dedifferentiation, rather than the presence of progenitor cells. The <italic>Myh6-Cre;R26R-confetti-lox</italic> system enabled us to document clonal behavior in neonatal CMs. We show that clonal expansion is rigidity-dependent, with an optimal clonal efficiency on the 20 kPa. Clone formation originated at various time points and progressed at different rates, suggesting a continuous proliferative capacity, rather than a final ‘burst’ of proliferation. Whether neonatal or adult CMs are capable of undergoing multiple cycles of cell division in vivo, has yet to be determined.</p><p>Our findings bear obvious relevance for cardiac regeneration after injury. In this unfortunate event, CMs in the vicinity of the scar tissue sense a stiffer environment, compared to the healthy adult heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jacot et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, if fully differentiated CMs present in the vicinity of the damaged area, can still maintain the capacity to dedifferentiate and resume cell division if confronted with a sufficiently compliant scaffold, a new avenue toward the regeneration of heart tissue may be opened.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Isolation and culture of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes</title><p>Experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Weizmann Institute of Science.

In the current version of the manuscript, we revised the statistical analyses. Specifically, we conducted ANOVA followed by definitive Post-Hoc tests, both of which yield significant P-values. Importantly, we added new experimental data, addressing: 1) the number of cardiomyocytes (CMs); 2) the effect of actomyosin relaxation (by adding blebbistatin) on CM myoskeleton architecture and proliferation; 3) the influence of the compliant 20kPa substrate on the behavior of the rat neonatal CMs; and 4) the lack of “leakiness” of αMHC-Cre-driven tdTomato fluorescent protein expression in CMs. Finally, we revisited some of our earlier statements, as suggested by the reviewers, and modified them, where necessary.</p><p><italic>1) In order to definitively assess CM proliferation, the authors need to demonstrate increase in CM numbers in addition to staining for markers</italic>.</p><p>To directly address the reviewers’ comment, we performed a large-scale live-cell imaging analysis of CMs cultured on PDMS displaying the various rigidities. We then traced and quantified CM cytokinesis events that resulted in two daughter CMs. To do so, we performed 6 independent time-lapse experiments. For each experiment, we cultured CMs derived from P1 transgenic <italic>αMHC-Cre;tdTomato-lox</italic> mice on 2 MPa, 20kPa, and 5kPa. After 4 days, we performed time-lapse imaging of the CMs for 48 hours, with 10 min intervals between images. For all rigidities in each experiment, we imaged between 15-30 fields, ranging from 300 to over 700 cells, for a total of 2,878 CMs. In these experiments we counted the number of new CMs and calculated their percentage formed on the two compliant surfaces compared to cells growing on the rigid 2MPa substrate. The results of this analysis appear in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>.</p><p>To further quantify the actual increase in CM number, we used the <italic>R26R-Confetti</italic> reporter line, and counted <italic>αMHC-Cre;Confetti-lox</italic> -derived CMs growing on 2MPa, 20kPa, and 5kPa surfaces, between days 4 -11 in culture (over 5,000 CMs). Part of the analysis of the clonal expansion was included in the original submission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H, I</xref>). In light of reviewer’s comment regarding total CM numbers, formed on the different surfaces, we have now calculated the addition of CMs between days 4 and 7 following cell seeding. This new analysis indicates a significant increase in CM number on the 20kPa and 5kPa substrates (2.4- and ∼1.4-fold, respectively), compared to the “rigid” 2MPa substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, a</xref> new panel). These values are in agreement with the increase in proliferation markers, counting of cytokinesis events, and clonal expansion of CMs cultured on the soft matrices.</p><p><italic>2) Based on the limited data presented, it is quite an overly strong statement to say that cell rounding is a “prerequisite” for induction of CM cytokinesis. Similarly in the Discussion, it is too strong to say that cytoskeleton and cell cycle are “inseparable” based on the experiments performed</italic>.</p><p>We rephrased the relevant sections in the Results and Discussion sections, indicating that our findings are in line with the view that cell rounding and the decrease in myoskeleton organization correlate well with increased cytokinesis, and refrain from strong causal claims that go beyond the currently available evidence.</p><p><italic>3) It doesn't appear that the authors measured the compliance of the materials they performed the studies with. This needs to be done to ensure the accuracy of the effects of the reported stiffness (modulus) values. It is not sufficient to rely on previously reported values, and no citation is provided along with the mixture ratios and values provided</italic>.</p><p>The compliance of the PDMS substrates was verified, using a methodology previously employed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prager-Khoutorsky et al. (2011)</xref> conducted in our (the Geiger) lab. Briefly, polymerized slabs of PDMS were subjected to bulk measurements of Young’s moduli, using an Instron Universal Testing System. The elastomers prepared for this study had curing agent ratios of 1:10, 1:50 and 1:75, corresponding to Young’s moduli of 2MPa, 20kPa and 5kPa, respectively. Specific batches of Sylgard<sup>®</sup> 184 (Dow Corning), including those used in this study, are routinely tested in our lab. This information was added to the Methods section.</p><p><italic>4) Quantitative methods are generally weak and statistical analyses were not performed correctly.</italic> T<italic>-tests can only be used to compare between two experimental groups.

We further improved the overall validity of the analyzed data by increasing the number of biological repeats in several experiments, and providing the statistical parameters both within the figures themselves, and in the relevant text. We also added the number of cells examined in each experiment throughout the manuscript. Notably, our findings were based on hundreds to thousands of CMs analyzed per experiment. The quantifications of karyokinesis, cytokinesis, and binucleation events described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were obtained from 5 independent time-lapse experiments, and based on the tracking of over 2,000 CMs by analyzing thousands of movies.</p><p>It is noteworthy that some events, such as definitive cytokinesis of mature, binucleated CMs, were quite rare events, and observed in only a few cases in our movies. The fact that binucleated CMs can undergo cytokinesis and divide is a highly unexpected event, too rare to be subjected to a standard significance test. In these unusual cases, we refer in the text to the number of events, without calculating their statistical significance. We highlight and further discuss these considerations in the revised manuscript. These results are now moved as a new panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1E</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) An alternative mechanism for more proliferation on intermediate softness matrices is that cells are more upright and rounded (like in division) rather than spread as on rigid substrate, but in this case the cell shape on 20kPa needs quantitation (add to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figures 1C and D</italic></xref><italic>). In addition, cell division should be studied on micropatterned substrates</italic>.</p><p>As requested, we performed additional experiments with compliant substrates on rat neonatal CMs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C and D</xref>, we now provide further quantifications and statistics of CM axial ratio (“polarization”) and projected area (“spreading”) on 2MPa, 20kPa, and 5kPa substrates. We found that CMs cultured on 20kPa are less polarized than those on 2MPa, but more polarized than those on 5kPa substrates. We observe that CMs on the 20kPa are less spread and more rounded, compared to those cultured on the rigid substrate. However, CMs growing on the 5kPa substrate, although smaller and more rounded than the CMs growing on the 20kPa surfaces, were less proliferative than the CMs cultured on the 20kPa substrate. We cannot yet definitively explain the apparent differences between the rounding and cytoskeletal effects induced by the 5kPa and the 20kPa surfaces, and the effects of the two surfaces on cytokinesis. It is possible that the 5kPa substrate is simply “too soft” for CMs, and cannot support the formation of the actomyosin-based contractile ring, essential for successful cytokinesis. We refer to this issue in the revised text.</p><p>The reviewers’ suggestion to study cell division on micropatterned substrates is interesting, but we think that it would exceed, by far, the current scope of this research, which focuses on the effects of matrix rigidity on CM cell fates.</p><p><italic>6) Since the highly proliferative cardiac fibroblasts and the “non-dividing” cardiomyocytes might share a common progenitor, the authors should prove the specificity of their αMHC driven expression of tdTomato (or is the expression leaky?). In other words, do all tdTomato cells stain for cardiac-specific MHC and/or Troponin? In this respect,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figures 3E and G</italic></xref><italic>, showing more tdTom cells than with cardio markers, should be explained better</italic>.</p><p>The αMHC-Cre-driven expression of tdTomato is very commonly used in the cardiac regeneration field to label the CM lineage. That said, we now provide further evidence that αMHC-Cre-driven tdTomato expression is not leaky, and is restricted to CMs.</p><p>First, we co-stained αMHC-Cre dTomato cells with anti-cTnT antibody. The staining showed an overlap of 99.62% of dTomato<sup>+</sup>/cTnT<sup>+</sup> CMs, with less than 1% of the dTomato CMs negative for cTnT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). Secondly, Nkx2.5 is a well-known cardiac marker that identifies embryonic and mature CMs, as well as cardiac progenitors. We therefore co-stained dTomato CMs with Nkx2.5, and found that all dTomato CMs were also positive for Nkx2.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly demonstrate the “clean” genetic lineage marker system that we used for labeling CMs.</p><p>The definition of CM “terminal differentiation” is quite elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zebrowski and Engel, 2013</xref>). CM differentiation is often characterized by binucleation, hypertrophic growth potential, withdrawal from the cell cycle, and increased myofibrillar organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zebrowski and Engel, 2013</xref>). Dedifferentiation is often defined as a functional and morphological regression of a mature cell within its own lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jopling, Boue and Izpisua Belmonte, 2011</xref>). Moreover, in both zebrafish and mouse models, dedifferentiation was defined by a partial and transient disassembly of the sarcomeric structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jopling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>As explained above, “dTomato” cells represent CMs that express, or have previously expressed, the αMHC gene, a signature of CM differentiation. Under regular conditions, we detected almost 100% of dTomato<sup>+</sup>/cTnT+ CMs. Therefore, dTomato-positive CMs, which were cTnT<sup>-</sup> or MHC<sup>-</sup> (protein), reflect the loss of sarcomeric markers within the CM lineage, which is consistent with the definition of CM dedifferentiation, among other parameters such as cell cycle re-entry. We clarify our explanations of this type of analysis in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) The finding that “rigid matrix promotes karyokinesis without cytokinesis, leading to CM binucleation (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2G</italic></xref><italic>)” (in the subsection “Distinct rigidity-dependent cardiomyocyte proliferation mechanisms”) seems consistent with results for megakaryocytes cultured on stiff rather than soft gels with high collagen (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40"><italic>Shin, PNAS 2011</italic></xref><italic>), but this latter paper used the myosin-II inhibitor blebbistatin as well as collagen density (for cell spreading control) to elucidate some aspects of mechanism. The observations in the present submission by Yahalom-Ronen et al. could benefit from similar (or other) approaches to clarifying some aspect of mechanism</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate this suggestion to investigate some aspect of the mechanism by using the myosin-II inhibitor blebbistatin, which was previously shown to inhibit actin-myosin interactions in mouse CMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dou, Arlock and Arner, 2007</xref>). Specifically, we explored whether disruption of the highly organized architecture of the CM myoskeleton would induce cell cycle reentry. Towards that end, we used the methodology employed by Shin and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shin et al., 2011</xref>), by culturing 1-day-old neonatal CMs on substrates of varying rigidities (2MPa, 20kPa, 5kPa), allowing them to adhere to the substrate for 72h, and then treating them with 20µM blebbistatin for 24 hours. We then fixed the cells and immunostained them for cTnT and Ki67. We found that blebbistatin severely disrupts the CM myoskeleton, leading to massive disorganization in the sarcomeric system. Blebbistatin treatment further induced a major shift in CM cell shape, manifested by major flattening, dramatic fragmentation of the sarcomeric arrays, and nearly complete loss of striations (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate that blebbistatin treatment results in severe disorganization of contractile myofilaments in CMs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Since our findings strongly suggest that disruption of the CM myoskeleton facilitates, or is linked to, CM cell cycle re-entry and overall CM dedifferentiation, we analyzed CM cell cycle activity in the absence or presence of blebbistatin, by quantifying the percentage of Ki67<sup>+</sup>/cTnT<sup>+</sup> cells (n=25,544). This analysis indicated that blebbistatin-treated CMs display higher cell cycle activity compared with control (untreated CMs) on the 2MPa and 20kPa rigidities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Hence, we conclude that relaxation of the myoskelton in CMs by blebbistatin promotes cell cycle re-entry. The lack of blebbistatin effect on the 5kPa substrate is consistent with the “already-relaxed” morphology of CMs cultured on the 5kPa substrate.</p><p>We suggest that compliant matrices promote CM proliferation primarily via their effect on the mechanics and organization of the myoskeleton. More broadly, we propose that the rigid matrix enhances the forces imposed on the CMs’ actin myoskeleton and this facilitates CM differentiation. In contrast, inhibiting CM sarcomeric organization and function (i.e. contractility) by blebbistatin has the opposite effect of inducing CM dedifferentiation. These results point the way toward additional avenues of investigation, which we plan to pursue in greater detail in a follow-up study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
