faculty positions knowing relatively little about the hiring process or what is needed to secure a job offer. To address this lack of knowledge about the hiring process we conducted a survey of applicants for faculty positions: the survey ran between May 2018 and May 2019, and received 317 responses. We analyzed the responses to explore the interplay between various scholarly metrics and hiring outcomes. We concluded that, above a certain threshold, the benchmarks traditionally used to measure research success – including funding, number of publications or journals published in – were unable to completely differentiate applicants with and without job offers. Respondents also reported that the hiring process was unnecessarily stressful, time-consuming, and lacking in feedback, irrespective of outcome. Our findings suggest that there is considerable scope to improve the transparency of the hiring process.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meta-research</kwd><kwd>careers in science</kwd><kwd>tenure</kwd><kwd>scientific publishing</kwd><kwd>research culture</kwd><kwd>early-career researchers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007237</institution-id><institution>University of North Dakota</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haage</surname><given-names>Amanda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM125388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernandes</surname><given-names>Jason D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HL007749</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kozik</surname><given-names>Ariangela J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012807</institution-id><institution>Midwestern University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jadavji</surname><given-names>Nafisa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001906</institution-id><institution>Washington Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fund for Innovation in Data-Intensive Discovery</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pejaver</surname><given-names>Vikas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007812</institution-id><institution>University of Washington</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments Project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pejaver</surname><given-names>Vikas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007268</institution-id><institution>Washington University in St. Louis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holehouse</surname><given-names>Alex S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A survey of over 300 applicants for faculty positions reveals that there are many paths to securing a job offer.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Template</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The number of PhDs awarded in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) has increased dramatically over the past three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cyranoski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghaffarzadegan et al., 2015</xref>), but the number of faculty positions available has essentially remained constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schillebeeckx et al., 2013</xref>). In the US, for instance, the situation has not changed significantly since 2003, when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) received a major budget increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alberts et al., 2014</xref>). Given the low numbers of faculty positions compared to the numbers of PhDs produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Committee to Review the State of Postdoctoral Experience in Scientists and Engineers, 2014</xref>), trainees are limited in their job prospects. Many also emerge from academic training feeling underprepared and under-mentored for any other type of job search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McDowell et al., 2015</xref>). This leads to a high number of applicants per academic position, many of whom are uncertain about their chances of obtaining a faculty job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grinstein and Treister, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sauermann and Roach, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Cohorts of new PhDs are also both more diverse than before and more diverse than many current hiring committees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alberts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">White, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhalla, 2019</xref>). Scientific publishing is also faster-paced than it used to be: for example, evolutionary biologists recruited as &quot;junior researchers&quot; in 2013 had published nearly twice as many articles (22 ± 3.4) as those hired in 2005 (12.5 ± 2.4); the same study also found that the length of time between first publication and recruitment as a faculty member had increased from 3.25 (±0.6) to 8.0 (±1.7) years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brischoux and Angelier, 2015</xref>). Longer training periods have been reported repeatedly in many STEM fields, and are perceived as detrimental to both the greater scientific community and individuals in temporary postdoctoral positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Committee to Review the State of Postdoctoral Experience in Scientists and Engineers, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rockey, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acton et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite these changes, the academic job search has largely remained the same, resulting in academic hiring being perceived as an opaque process with no clear standards or guidelines. Beyond a requirement for a doctoral degree and possibly postdoctoral training, faculty job advertisements rarely contain specific preferred qualifications. Furthermore, the criteria used to evaluate applicants are typically determined by a small departmental or institutional committee and are neither transparent nor made public. The amount of materials required for faculty job applications is also highly variable among hiring institutions, and often places a heavy burden on both applicants and search committees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies agree on a need to increase transparency in career outcomes and hiring practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Golde, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Polka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wright and Vanderford, 2017</xref>). The annual pool of faculty job applicants is large and provides a unique opportunity for examining the application process. We performed an anonymous survey, asking applicants for both common components of research and scholarly activity found on an academic CV, as well as information on their success through the 2018–2019 job cycle. We further performed a small-scale, complementary survey of search committee members. Here we present qualitative and quantitative data on the academic job market, including information on the number of successful off-site and on-site interviews, offers, rejections, and the lack of feedback.</p><p>Job applicants start by searching for relevant job postings on a variety of platforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The initial electronic application generally consists of a cover letter addressing the search committee, a teaching philosophy statement, CV, and a research plan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The length and content of these materials can vary drastically based on the application cycle, region, institution, or particular search committee. In the current system, the expectation is that application materials be tailored for each specific institution and/or department to which the applicant is applying. This includes department-specific cover letters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fox, 2018a</xref>), but may also involve a range of changes to the research, teaching, and diversity statements.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An overview of the academic job search process.</title><p>The first column defines common terms in the academic job search; while the second column outlines how the search for an academic job progresses, from a job being posted to an offer being accepted.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54097-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The search committee convenes for a few meetings to shortlist the applicants. Applicants are then contacted for interviews somewhere between one to six months after application materials are due. Searches may include an initial off-site (remote) interview, followed by an on-site interview at the hiring university. The on-site interview typically lasts one or two days and consists of a research seminar, possibly a teaching demonstration, and likely a chalk-talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rowland, 2016</xref>). The on-site interview also usually consists of one-on-one meetings with other faculty members, including a meeting with the hiring department chair, trainees, and the administrative staff.</p><p>After the interviews, candidates may be contacted and offered a position, usually in writing. The offer package will include the proposed start date, salary and start-up funds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macdonald, 2019</xref>). The time to offer is also variable, but is usually shorter than the time between application and first contact (based on anecdotal information). Importantly, a single search can result in multiple offers (for instance the department may be able to fund multiple competitive candidates, or the first-choice candidate may decline and the second candidate is given an offer). Searches can also fail if the committee does not find a suitable candidate for their program/department or &quot;go dry&quot; if the applicant(s) deemed qualified by the search committee decline their offer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We designed a survey for early-career researchers aimed at bringing transparency to the academic job market (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp41">Supplementary file 41</xref>). The survey was distributed via Twitter, the Future PI Slack group, and email listservs of multiple postdoctoral associations, resulting in 322 responses from self-identified early-career researchers who applied for academic positions in the 2018–2019 application cycle. Of these, data from 317 respondents passed simple quality filters and were used for analyses. As all questions were optional, these 317 responses represent the maximum number in our analyses; in cases where respondents chose not to answer the question, we analyzed only the applicant subset with responses and list the number of responses used for each analysis in the appropriate figures and supplementary files.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Demographics of respondents</title><p>Respondents reported a large range in the number of submitted applications from a minimum of one to a maximum of 250 (median: 15). The respondent pool was notably enriched in applicants who received at least one off-site interview (70%), at least one on-site interview (78%) and at least one offer (58%); this may represent a significant bias towards successful applicants in our study, as a recent study shows that less than 23% of PhDs eventually secure a tenure-track position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Langin, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Respondents represented researchers in a wide variety of fields, with 85% from life sciences and related fields, with relatively equal numbers of applications from men and women across this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our survey captured data from an international applicant pool, representing 13 countries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, 72% of our respondents reported currently working in the United States, which may reflect the larger circulation of our survey on social media platforms and postdoctoral associations there.

Regardless, we plotted subgroups based on offer status and each of these criteria to see if there was evidence for any general trends in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Notably, respondents who were first author on a CNS paper and received at least one offer had a greater number of total citations than those who were first author on a CNS paper but did not receive any job offers. Applicants who were first author on a CNS paper or who had a career transition award had higher percentages of securing at least one offer, and those with both had an even greater percentage, although the differences between these groups was not statistically significant.</p><p>This analysis suggests that the combination of different criteria holistically influence the ability to obtain an offer. Therefore, we performed logistic regression to examine the relationship between multiple variables/metrics on the successful application outcome of receiving an offer on a subset of applicants (n = 105) who provided answers across all variables. We implemented a rigorous variable selection procedure to maximize accuracy and remove highly correlated variables. This resulted in a model that included only seven variables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp24">Supplementary file 24</xref>).</p><p>This regression model revealed that a higher number of applications, a higher citation count and obtaining a postdoctoral fellowship were significantly associated with receipt of an offer. When missing values were imputed and the full applicant pool (n = 317) was considered, all previous variables remained significant, and a significant positive coefficient was also observed for having a career transition award. In both versions of the model, the search for non-academic jobs was significantly negatively associated with offer status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We note that the model with imputed data was more accurate than that with missing values excluded at distinguishing between applicants with and without offers in 10-fold cross-validation experiments. However this accuracy was found to only be 69.6%, which is insufficient to construct a usable classifier of offer status. Due to the predominance of applicants from the life sciences in our dataset, we also repeated these analyses on a subset containing only these applicants. While more variables were included in the model, the general trends remained the same, with the addition of the number of years spent on the job market as a significant negative factor in receiving an offer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp25">Supplementary file 25</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we extended this analysis to visualize the interplay between all variables in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> by learning a decision tree automatically from the collected data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The algorithm tries to partition the applicants into groups such that each group is entirely composed of individuals with at least one offer or without. A variety of different classifier groups were identified, but no group contained more than ~19% (61 out of 317) of the dataset. In fact, the accuracy of the overall decision tree in distinguishing between candidates with offers and those without was only ~59% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that there are multiple paths to an offer and that the variables we collected do not sufficiently capture this variability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Levels of teaching experience</title><p>Discussions surrounding the academic job market often center on publications and/or funding, while teaching experience generally receives much less attention.

As with any opaque, high-pressure environment, an absence of clear guidelines and expectations coupled with anecdotal advice can lead individuals to focus on tangible goals and metrics that they feel will help them stand out in the system. Our findings were consistent with several commonly held notions: the number of applications submitted, career transition awards (e.g. a K99/R00 award), and total citation counts were significantly associated with obtaining offers in our Wilcoxon test and when jointly considering all variables in a logistic regression analysis. Joint academic/industry job searches were negatively associated with obtaining academic offers in both analyses, while the number of years an applicant was on the job market was negatively associated in our Wilcoxon analysis. Papers in CNS were only significantly associated with offers in the Wilcoxon analysis, while postdoc fellowships were only significant in the logistic regression.</p><p>Metrics such as career transition awards and postdoctoral fellowships can be broadly categorized as funding metrics and the positive association between these metrics and offer outcomes likely reflects the hiring institute being confident that the candidate will be competitive for future funding for their research program. Indeed, career transition awards essentially provide additional start up funds, while postdoc fellowships provide a track record of funding. Although postdoc fellowships were not significant in our Wilcoxon analyses, this metric was significant in our life science-specific Wilcoxon subgroup analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.) as well as our logistic regression on the whole dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The search committee respondents confirmed the benefit of career transition funding as major strengths for an application.</p><p>Association between offers and the number of applications, non-academic job searches, and years on the academic job market requires cautious interpretation. Given that receiving any single faculty offer is a low-probability event, there is value in submitting enough applications to increase the odds of receiving an offer. However, there is likely a balance in ensuring the quality of each application, which requires time and effort to individually tailor to each position. Searching for non-academic jobs might detract from the time available to tailor applications, although the negative association may also reflect other factors such as the typically swifter non-academic hiring timeline, which could cause applicants to remove themselves from a search prior to its conclusion. Likewise, the negative association between repeated years on the job market and offers might reflect fundamental problems with the quality of an application, or more complex factors such as geographical constraints. As we did not collect data that would allow us to determine the quality of application, or the fit of an application to a particular opening, we cannot evaluate these metrics beyond the broad associations found in our dataset. Additionally, other unmeasured factors (e.g. applicant pedigree) are likely important considerations, consistent with recent data implicating institutional prestige and non-meritocratic factors in faculty hiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clauset et al., 2015</xref>). This should be a major consideration for future studies of the academic job market.</p><p>When examining publication-related metrics, we found that total citation counts were significantly associated with receiving a job offer in both the Wilcoxon and logistic regression analyses. There was also a significant positive association between being first author on a CNS paper and receiving a job offer in the Wilcoxon analysis, but not in our logistic regression models. Examination of our data also revealed a gender gap in publication metrics, with males reporting more CNS papers and more papers overall, indicating that opportunities for publication are not equally available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arvanitis and Cho, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gumpertz et al., 2017</xref>). Second, the results of our automated variable selection procedure suggest that being an author in any position on a paper in CNS is an advantage overall (though the result is not significant); however, within the life sciences, being the first author is more of an advantage (again, not significant). Finally, papers in CNS and other journals with high impact factors have been regarded as a major benchmark for trainees in the life sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Dijk et al., 2014</xref>), and qualitative comments from our applicant survey conveyed a perception that the absence of a CNS paper is deemed detrimental to offer prospects. Collectively, our data suggest that while being first author on a CNS paper increases the chances of receiving an offer (particularly in life sciences), papers in CNS were neither necessary nor sufficient for securing an offer, as the majority of our respondents received offers without having a paper in CNS.</p><p>Consistently, being the author of a CNS paper was not deemed highly important by the search committee members we surveyed. These data may reflect a discordance of priorities for individual faculty members compared to their peers and the system at-large, as recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Niles et al., 2019</xref>). This could lead to an unspoken expectation that faculty (especially pre-tenure faculty) see themselves as passive participants in the current academic system, instead of active participants with the authority to realign priorities through search committees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Niles et al., 2019</xref>). Future studies with higher numbers of faculty respondents should endeavor to further explore this phenomenon.</p><p>Despite challenges in the job market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andalib et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kahn and Ginther, 2017</xref>), our survey revealed positive outcomes that suggest progress in select areas. Nearly half of the job applicants we surveyed reported posting at least one preprint. Several of the search committee members we surveyed confirmed that while published papers carry the most weight, preprints are generally viewed favorably. Further, despite the fact that women face numerous challenges in academia, including underrepresentation at the faculty level in most STEM departments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arvanitis and Cho, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gumpertz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ceci and Williams, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leaper and Starr, 2019</xref>), and trail men in publication-related metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), our data suggest very few differences in outcomes in the May 2018–May 2019 job cycle. Both genders received similar numbers of interviews and offers, and gender-based differences in publication-related metrics persisted even when considering only the 185 individuals with offers, suggesting that committees are becoming increasingly aware of gender bias in publication-related metrics and are taking them into account when evaluating applicants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp40">Supplementary file 40</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the respondents were generally highly qualified according to the metrics we measured, and yet they reported high stress and frustration with their experiences of the faculty job search. In a large number of cases, applicants were not notified of a receipt of their application, nor were they updated on its status, given a final notice of rejection, or informed that the search may have failed. This uncertainty further complicates an already stressful process that can be mitigated by improving practices for a more streamlined application process. Applicants perceived poor mentorship as a major obstacle to their applications. Further, we found that most metrics were differentially valued by candidates and committees. Collectively, these differences in expectations between applicants and hiring institutions, coupled with the opaque requirements for obtaining a faculty position, likely drive the high stress reported by both candidates and committee members alike.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Limitations of this study and measuring outcomes in the academic job market</title><p>There are several limitations of this study imposed by both the original survey design and general concerns, such as the anonymity of respondents, and the measurability of various contributing factors. For future data collection we suggest keeping surveys focused on region-specific job markets. Our pool of applicants was largely those seeking a position in North America. We believe these results can be aggregated, but the survey questions may not all be applicable to other large markets (e.g. Europe, China, India). We did not receive a sizable response from applicants looking outside of North America and in fields outside of life sciences to make useful comparisons. A similar survey circulated in each market individually with a similar number of responses would have broader impact.</p><p>We purposely did not ask for race, ethnicity, or citizenship demographics, PhD or postdoc institution, and region or institution where offers were received. We believe the addition of these metrics could potentially jeopardize the anonymity of respondents. Despite this, these factors could be significant contributors to the receipt of an academic job offer. Racial inequalities in all STEM fields at all levels exist and need to be addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whittaker et al., 2015</xref>), specifically with how they intersect with gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gumpertz et al., 2017</xref>). As indicated in our open question responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), international postdocs may be specifically challenged in obtaining faculty job offers in the United States and Europe due to immigration policies as well as how mobility is interpreted by the job market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cantwell, 2011</xref>). The reputation of a training institution is questionably measurable, but is also often listed in anecdotal advice as important. Recently it was reported that a majority of new faculty are hired from a minority of institutions providing postdoc training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clauset et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miuccio et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that adding institutional reputation to the other traditional metrics we measured could provide a more complete picture of the current path to a faculty position.</p><p>While we measured some of the attributes widely perceived as important in faculty hiring (e.g. funding track record), others are less easily quantified (e.g. the research proposal, lab pedigree, or letters of recommendation that comments from our search committee survey revealed to be important) and data collection on these items would be highly recommended in future surveys. Addressing the quality of application materials is highly context-specific (given the field, search committee, and institutional needs) and can improve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grinstein and Treister, 2018</xref>). Other aspects which are not directly measurable and are often cited as important for applicants in the academic job market are &quot;fit&quot; and &quot;networking&quot; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wright and Vanderford, 2017</xref>). Respondents agreed that networking, conferences, collaborations, and connections were helpful in their job search (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Conference organizers are also starting to offer badges that those searching for faculty jobs can wear at events; exploring the relationship between networking metrics (such as number of conferences and networking events attended) and success on the job market could be a topic for future research. Departmental or institutional &quot;fit&quot; is largely determined by the search committee on an individual basis, and it is likely that we will never be able to measure fit adequately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saxbe, 2019</xref>).</p><p>All questions in our survey were optional. We chose this survey design in order to make the survey easier for respondents to complete; however, missing answers represent a source of potential bias as unanswered questions may represent answers that could be negatively perceived and/or zero in value. For example, some individuals may not have felt comfortable indicating they had zero offers, which could lead to the offer percentages we report being inflated. Such bias could also affect the imputations in our logistic regression, and for these reasons we have attempted to provide multiple transparent and qualified analyses of the data. Future surveys may benefit from all questions requiring a response. It is also possible that participation in the survey from the outset suffers from survivorship bias, in that those applicants that had a positive experience are more likely to reflect upon it and complete a survey on the process. Our survey was also likely completed by a highly-engaged group of aspiring future faculty. The Future PI Slack group itself is a space for postdoctoral researchers most interested in obtaining a faculty career to engage with and learn from one another. Thus, the survey data likely reflects a highly motivated and accomplished group and not the full pool of applicants to faculty positions each year. Wider dissemination of future surveys will hopefully be aided by the publication of these results and increased awareness of the survey among trainees in various research communities.</p><p>Finally, the data from our survey of job applicants focused on candidates and not the search committees. It is unclear how many individual searches are represented in our dataset. It is likely that as many as ~200–500 committees were represented in our aggregated job applicant data, and different committees may adopt distinct assessment criteria. Our limited search committee survey responses show that the committees represented by our sample favor a holistic assessment of candidates and that decision by universal criteria (especially based solely on career transition awards or papers in CNS) is likely not unilateral, especially across disciplines. Future studies would benefit from surveying a larger pool of search committees to see what major trends and practices dominate, whether the majority of searches adopt a comprehensive evaluation approach, or if there is heterogeneity among committees in how tenure-track hiring assessments are conducted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The search process for faculty jobs lacks transparency and data regarding what makes a successful applicant. Here, we began to address this deficiency through a survey targeted at the applicants themselves, and including their perceptions of the application process. Of over 300 responses by job applicants, we did not receive a single positive comment about the process, despite the fact that 58% of our participants received at least one job offer. Our data suggest that baseline thresholds exist for those more likely to receive a faculty job offer, but that many different paths can lead to a job offer. This variety of paths likely reflects both the preparation done by applicants and the different evaluation criteria used by individual search committees. For these reasons, we urge applicants not to conclude that lower than average metrics in any one area are automatically disqualifying. Indeed, we believe that increasing the transparency of the application process through systematic data collection will allow a more detailed study of the many paths to obtaining a faculty offer.</p><p>Our data also show the mental strain on applicants during the hiring process. We propose a number of potential solutions with the understanding that hiring faculty is a complex process involving multiple stakeholders. We believe the application process could be improved by simplifying the process, including standardizing application materials (e.g. requirements for research statements are similar for R1 institutions) and requesting references only after candidates are shortlisted, so that the burden of application preparation time can be reduced. Constructive feedback from mentors is vital for success during the application and interview preparation stages. Additionally, if possible, communication from search committees about unsuccessful applications would be helpful. We understand that these points may increase the workload of mentors and search committees but, if put into place, could alleviate some of the stress related to the academic job application process. In addition, applicants need to work to be sure their materials are strong and well-researched as the quality of these materials and demonstrating fit for a job posting are important to faculty on search committees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clement et al., 2019</xref>). Further work into the challenges search committees face is needed to improve their experience of the application process.</p><p>It is our hope that this and future work will not only allow all stakeholders to make informed decisions, but will also enable critical examination, discussion, and reassessment of the implicit and explicit values and biases being used to select the next generation of academic faculty. Such discussions are crucial in building an academic environment that values and supports all of its members.</p></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s5-1"><title>Survey materials</title><p>We designed a survey (the &quot;applicant survey&quot;) to collect demographics and metrics that were commonly discussed on Future PI Slack during the 2018–2019 academic job search cycle. The survey was designed to take less than 5 min in order to maximize response rates, and respondents were not required to answer all questions.</p><p>After collecting and performing initial analyses of this survey, we designed an additional survey for search committees (the &quot;search committee survey&quot;). The text of both surveys used in this work is included in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp41">Supplementary files 41</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp42">42</xref>. A Google form was used to conduct both surveys.</p><p>The applicant survey was distributed on various social media platforms including the Future PI Slack group, Twitter, and Facebook, and by several postdoctoral association mailing lists including in North America, Europe and Asia. The survey was open for approximately six weeks to collect responses.</p><p>The search committee survey was distributed to specific network contacts of the various authors. Though this distribution was more targeted, a Google form link was still used to maintain anonymity. The search committee survey was open for approximately three weeks to collect responses. In both cases, respondents to the surveys were asked to self-report, and the information collected was not independently verified. The surveys can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp41">Supplementary files 41</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp42">42</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s5-2"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Prior to analysis, we manually filtered out five responses in which answers were not interpretable or did not appear to answer the correct questions. Microsoft Excel and RStudio were used to graph the results of both surveys shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>. Specifically, data was filtered and subdivided using the 'tidyverse' collection of R packages, and figure plots were generated using the 'ggplot2' package. Whenever statistical analyses were used, the exact tests, p-values and χ<sup>2</sup> values are reported in the appropriate figure or figure legend or caption, results section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>, and represent the implementations in the basic R 'stats' package.</p><p>A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Where a number of demographics are combined in the reporting throughout this study, any analysis groups with less than five respondents were combined with other similar values instead of the raw <italic>n</italic> value in an effort to protect the anonymity of participants. Briefly, statistical methods are as follows: in general, the two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test (with Holm correction when applicable) or Chi-squared test was used to report p-values (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref> for detailed breakdown).</p><p>The qualitative survey comments were categorized by theme (keywords/context) describing each comment and the frequency of comments pertaining to a particular theme and tabulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp17">Supplementary files 17</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp38">38</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp39">39</xref>). Word clouds were generated using the WordItOut platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">WordItOut, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). The visual summary heatmap of the job applicant perception and the survey results along with the search committee survey results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>) was created by counting the frequency of comments for each metric (i.e. publications, fellowships, preprints) from the respondents to the qualitative (long answer) questions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp17">Supplementary files 17</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp38">38</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp39">39</xref>). The job applicant survey quantitative results were also used to rank metrics based on significance (as determined by Wilcoxon analysis or logistic regression analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>)) and were also incorporated into the heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). A number of metrics were not measured/surveyed as part of our study. These missing values are shown in gray.</p><p>Logistic regression analysis was performed in R using the 'glm' function with the 'family' parameter set to 'binomial'. All variables collected in the survey were included as independent variables, except those that were considered to be outcomes (numbers of remote interviews, onsite interviews and offers). The outcome variable was a binary 'Offer' or 'No offer' variable. All continuous variables were z-score normalized to ensure that they were centered and scaled consistently. To reduce collinearity between variables, a forward stepwise variable selection approach was adopted by starting with the variable that was most accurate in predicting offer status when included in a logistic regression model and then iteratively adding a variable to the model to maximize accuracy at every step. Furthermore, at every step, a variable would only be added if it was not correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient ≤0.5) with a variable already included in the model from a previous step. The model with the most accurate variable-combination was used to report coefficients. When multiple independent variables were considered together, missing values accounted for nearly two-thirds of the data, and were therefore imputed by fitting a bagged tree model for each variable (as a function of all the others; 63). Both variations of the analysis (missing data excluded and missing data imputed) were reported. In addition, this entire logistic regression analysis was repeated on a subset, solely comprising of applicants from the life sciences.</p><p>In order to visualize the potential paths to an offer, a decision tree was learned automatically from the data using the C5.0 algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuhn and Johnson, 2013</xref>). All possible combinations of the following parameter settings were evaluated: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cyranoski et al., 2011</xref>) either the tree-based variant or the rule-based variant of the algorithm was run, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghaffarzadegan et al., 2015</xref>) winnowing of irrelevant variables was set to 'TRUE' or 'FALSE', and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schillebeeckx et al., 2013</xref>) the number of boosting 'trials' was set to 1, 4, 16, 32 or 64. The parameter combination with the best accuracy in predicting offer status in a 10-fold cross-validation experiment (as implemented in the 'caret' package in R) was chosen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuhn, 2008</xref>). Since decision trees naturally handle missing values and differences in scales, no additional imputation or data normalization was performed before training and testing. The most accurate tree was found to be the one that used the rule-based variant, had no winnowing and no boosting (trials = 1) and was plotted using the 'plot' function in the 'partykit' R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hothorn and Zeileis, 2015</xref>) and then manually grouped in Illustrator.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Carol Greider, Feilim Mac Gabhann, Cori Bargmann, Mark Kunitomi, Needhi Bhalla, Lucia Peixoto, Sarah Stone and Dario Taraborelli for their valuable comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

Men have more first author publications than women particularly in CNS journals - the authors should comment on this.</p><p>4. In Figure 4D the authors should identify the factors that differentiate between candidates with one or more offers vs. those who received none.</p><p>5. Regarding the logistic regression: rather than conducting an analysis with 16 variables, many of which are collinear, the authors should conduct this analysis one variable at a time to identify the single features that predict job market success. The authors can then test these variables for collinearity and combine uncorrelated variables into models that include two, three, four, etc. independent predictors.</p><p>6. 96% of the respondents with CNS publications were in fields in &quot;Biomedical or life sciences&quot; or &quot;Biology (other)&quot; as described in Figure 1A. The authors should therefore repeat several of the key analyses on success predictors on the life science cohort alone, including making a new version of Figure 4 that includes data for the life science cohort alone. The authors should also update the tables S7, S9, S10 and S22 to include statistics about CNS publications done for the life scientists in the cohort alone (alongside the data already presented for the full cohort).</p><p>7. The authors conducted a &quot;PUI-only&quot; subgroup analysis (Figure 6), but it would also be informative to conduct an analysis among candidates who only applied to research-intensive positions. The differences between the positions may be noteworthy, and by combining too many unrelated job searches into one analysis, the authors may be missing out on important relationships.</p><p>8. The authors should provide some more background on the survey and how it was distributed at the start of the results section. What checks were in place to ensure that only early-career scientists answered it? Similarly, the authors should provide more information in the results section on how the search committee survey was distributed and who answered it.</p><p>9. This study really does not represent a cross section of different types of early career researchers from different fields nor &quot;a wide variety of fields.&quot; Nor is it really an international applicant pool since data on race/ethnicity or nationality or citizenship status was not asked. It really represents a sample of postdocs (96%) from the biomedical and biological sciences with (72%) currently working within the U.S., Canada and U.K. who are on the job market. This is an important distinction to make because prior research Cantwell (2011), Cantwell &amp; Taylor (2015), and Sauerman &amp; Roach (2016) and others have done research in this area and shown how international postdocs working in the U.S. have had limited success in transitioning into tenure-track faculty positions and provide reasons to suggest why. The authors should discuss this at an appropriate place in the text and consider citing some or all of the following references:</p><p>- Cantwell, B., &amp; Taylor, B. J. (2015).

Doi: 10.1126/science.aaf2061</p><p>10. Another concern is an attempt to make correlations between number of applications with both number of interviews and offers, without taking into consideration the quality of the application, nor where the applicants received their training. There have been some large quantitative studies done by others (e.g. Clauset, Arbesman, &amp; Larremore, 2015) that found faculty hiring follows a common and steeply hierarchical structure where doctoral prestige and where an applicant did both their Ph.D. and postdoc appointment better predicts hiring, especially in R1 institutions. The authors should discuss this concern at an appropriate place in the text and consider citing the following reference:</p><p>- Clauset, A., Arbesman, S., &amp; Larremore, D. B. (2015). Systematic inequality and hierarchy in faculty hiring networks. Science Advances 1: e1400005. doi:10.1126/sciadv.1400005</p><p>11. Under &quot;Statement of Ethics&quot;, the authors write that an IRB exemption was obtained on 08/29/2019. However, the survey itself was conducted in April 2019. I believe that retroactive IRB approval is generally prohibited by federal regulations. Was the IRB aware that the study had already been conducted when they granted the exemption? Can the authors comment on this serious discrepancy?</p><p>12. Teaching experience was not assessed either from the applicant or the institution perspective. Applicants self-disclosed their presumed teaching experience and then when a number of them did get job offers at R1s, the statement was made that applicants fulfill the teaching requirements for any university type. That is an oversimplification of findings. The authors' data indicates that the majority of applicants applied to R1s. This should be further discussed by the authors.</p><p>13. The authors could comment on whether the number of postdoc positions attained correlated with their ability to obtain faculty positions (in other words, are 3 postdoc appointments more desirable as compared to 1 when applying for a faculty position at a prestigious institution?).</p><p>14. The authors could address how the application process might be improved so it is a more positive experience.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54097.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[We repeat the reviewers’ points here in italic, and include our replies in Roman.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We agree with the reviewers that the discussion of the importance of CNS publications is a sensitive and well-known issue. The relationship between job market success and CNS publications is complex. We have read the references suggested by the reviewers, and we agree that several studies have concluded that CNS publications are generally held in high regard by search committees. Moreover, we discuss in the text that there is a high perceived importance of CNS papers to applicants. However, our data shows 2 clear findings with regards to CNS: 1) Most applicants who get offers do *not* have a CNS paper and 2) Applicants with a CNS paper appear to have a higher chance of getting an offer than those who do not have a CNS paper. We believe that the demonstration of the first point (most candidates do not have a CNS paper) is an important point for postdocs to consider but does not detract from the 2nd point (CNS papers appear to confer an advantage to an applicant). We note that an analysis of the offer association with CNS publications is shown in Figure 4D. We observed a 7-15% increase in offer rate for candidates which had published in CNS journals. We also note that despite this observation, ~60% of our survey respondents still received at least one offer. Moreover, our data (Figure 4C) suggest that those individuals with CNS authorship who also received a job offer were more highly cited than those with CNS authorship without a job offer, suggesting that assessment of the impact of an applicant’s work is a complex blend of many factors.</p><p>Our small survey of faculty search committee members, revealed an attitude towards CNS publications that was discordant with that of the applicants and the conventional expectation. While we acknowledge that we do not have extensive information on the decision making process of every single search committee, the volume of current literature around this issue speaks to the culture shift that is occurring around academic hiring. Formal discussions of CNS as a metric and its impact on equity in the professoriate have resulted in the development of guidelines such as DORA, that reflect the burgeoning culture change. While an in-depth analysis of impact is outside the scope of this work, we look forward to future work on this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Men have more first author publications than women particularly in CNS journals - the authors should comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that these results are presented in Figure 2B and 2C, as well as discussed in the “applicant scholarly metrics by gender” results subsection. How these results are in line with previous findings is presented within the introductory paragraph to that results section. We additionally revisit this point in the discussion stating “Further, despite the fact that women face numerous challenges in academia, including underrepresentation at the faculty level in most STEM departments (52,53,56,57), and trail men in publication-related metrics (Figure 2B), our data suggest very few differences in outcomes in the May 2018-May 2019 female applicant pool relative to their male counterparts. Both genders received similar numbers of interviews and offers, and gender-based differences in publication-related metrics persisted even when considering only the 185 individuals with offers, suggesting that committees are becoming increasingly aware of gender bias in publication-related metrics and are taking them into account when evaluating applicants (Table S40 Supplementary File 1). We have also now added a further point in the discussion pertaining specifically to the intersection of gender and CNS publications. “First, examination of our data revealed a gender gap in publication metrics, with males reporting more CNS authorship and publications overall, indicating that opportunities for publication are not equally available (52,53). ” Our survey has captured numerous aspects of the academic job market and the factors influencing the success of applicants. We recognize that gender (and other marginalized identities) play a large role. We believe the role of gender is thoroughly discussed in our manuscript while allowing in depth analysis of other factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 4D the authors should identify the factors that differentiate between candidates with one or more offers vs. those who received none.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment, and for the opportunity to clarify this point within our manuscript. In our study, we performed two different analyses to understand which factors differentiate candidates based on their success in obtaining offers. We performed Wilcoxon tests (presented in Figure 4B and Table S7 Supplementary File 1) comparing the offer percentage (the number of offers/the number of applications) and also performed a logistic regression comparing candidates with offers vs those without (Table S22). The data from these two analyses are summarized in Figure 4D, as noted by the reviewer, but were confusing due to the wording in both the text and the figures. We have clarified this in the text by adding further details regarding the offer status and positive correlations in the following sentence: “When missing values were imputed, significant positive coefficients were observed for having a higher h-index, higher application numbers, career transition awards and identifying as female and obtaining an offer.” Further, we have clarified this in the figure legend for Figure 4D as follows: “Summary of significant results testing criteria associated with 1+ offer (positive) or no offers (negative) with offer outcomes either through Wilcoxon analyses (Table S7 Supplementary File 1) or logistic regression (Table S24 Supplementary File 1) ordered by decreasing effect size.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Regarding the logistic regression: rather than conducting an analysis with 16 variables, many of which are collinear, the authors should conduct this analysis one variable at a time to identify the single features that predict job market success. The authors can then test these variables for collinearity and combine uncorrelated variables into models that include two, three, four, etc. independent predictors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. As suggested by the reviewer, we have undertaken a greedy stepwise variable selection procedure in which we started with the variable that was the most predictive of offer status (1+ offer vs 0 offers) and then incrementally added one variable at a time, selecting for the best pair, triplet, and so on. While doing this we also ensured that no new variable was highly correlated or anticorrelated with a previously included variable (Absolute Spearman correlation coefficient cutoff of 0.5). This resulted in the exclusion of two variables that were highly correlated with citation count: h-index and total number of publications (see correlation plot below).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54097-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Among the remaining 14 variables, the combination of seven variables resulted in the highest accuracy in cross-validation experiments: (Applying to) Other jobs, Application number, Citations, Years on job market, Postdoc fellowships, (transition to independence) Funding and CNS (co-authorship) (see Author response table 1 below).Author response table 1.</p><p>We note that while this 7-variable model is more accurate in predicting offer status than the full model presented in the earlier version, there is a possibility of bias typically arising from the subjective decisions made during a variable selection exercise. For instance, the choice of a greedy stepwise approach, the use of Spearman correlation as a measure of collinearity, the correlation coefficient thresholds, the choice of accuracy as the quantity to maximize, among others, are all likely to influence which variables are selected and how many are deemed optimal. Nonetheless, the agreement between the single-variable analyses (Wilcoxon tests) and the more rigorous logistic regression analysis gives us confidence to update the logistic regression analysis in the manuscript to this 7-variables model (see updated Figures 4 and Table S24 Supplementary File 1). We have also modified the text summarizing these results in the “Interplay between metrics” section to read as follows:</p><p>&quot;We implemented a rigorous variable selection procedure to maximize accuracy and remove highly correlated variables. This resulted in a model that included only seven variables (Table S24 Supplementary File 1) that was tested on a subset of applicants (n=105) who provided answers across all variables. This regression model revealed that a higher number of applications, a higher citation count and obtaining a postdoctoral fellowship were significantly associated with receipt of an offer. When missing values were imputed and the full applicant pool (n=317) was considered, all previous variables remained significant, and a significant positive coefficient was also observed for having a career transition award. In both versions of the model, the search for non-academic jobs was significantly negatively associated with offer status (Figure 4D). We note that the model with imputed data was more accurate than that with missing values excluded at distinguishing between applicants with and without offers in 10-fold cross-validation experiments. However this accuracy was found to only be 69.6%, which is insufficient to construct a usable classifier of offer status. Due to the predominance of applicants from the life sciences in our dataset, we also repeated these analyses on a subset containing only these applicants. While more variables were included in the model, the general trends remained the same, with the addition of the number of years spent on the job market as a significant negative factor in receiving an offer (Table S25 Supplementary File 1; Figure 4 – Supplement 1).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. 96% of the respondents with CNS publications were in fields in &quot;Biomedical or life sciences&quot; or &quot;Biology (other)&quot; as described in Figure 1A. The authors should therefore repeat several of the key analyses on success predictors on the life science cohort alone, including making a new version of Figure 4 that includes data for the life science cohort alone. The authors should also update the tables S7, S9, S10 and S22 to include statistics about CNS publications done for the life scientists in the cohort alone (alongside the data already presented for the full cohort).</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated Table S7 in Supplementary File 1 and added new tables S9 and S11 equivalents for Life/Biomedical Sciences applicants (respondents who indicated their field of research as Chemistry, Biology, Bioengineering or Biomedical or Life Sciences) scholarly metrics to the Supplementary file. The new added tables are numbered S10 and S12 in Supplementary File 1. Figure 4 – Supplement 1 shows the same analyses as in Figure 4, but restricted to the life sciences cohort. Table S25 in Supplementary File 1 reports the coefficients, p-values and other related information in the same manner as in Table S24 in Supplementary File 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors conducted a &quot;PUI-only&quot; subgroup analysis (Figure 6), but it would also be informative to conduct an analysis among candidates who only applied to research-intensive positions. The differences between the positions may be noteworthy, and by combining too many unrelated job searches into one analysis, the authors may be missing out on important relationships.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated Figure 6 to include comparisons of candidates who only applied to PUIs (PUI-focused), those who only applied to R1 institutions (R1 Focused) and candidates who applied to both. Our original observations still hold (candidates applying to PUI positions are more likely to have more extensive teaching experience). However the new analysis also reveals some interesting trends (the R1 Focused subgroup is majority male in contrast to the two other groups) that we now comment on in the “Research versus Teaching-intensive institutions” section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The authors should provide some more background on the survey and how it was distributed at the start of the results section. What checks were in place to ensure that only early-career scientists answered it? Similarly, the authors should provide more information in the results section on how the search committee survey was distributed and who answered it.</p></disp-quote><p>We have altered the text in two separate places to provide clarity on this point. The first paragraph under “Academic Job Applicant Demographics” has been changed to include statements that participants in the survey self-identified as applicants in the academic job market in 2018-2019. The first paragraph under “Search Committees Value the Future” has been changed to state that the search committee survey was sent to a limited number of faculty, from within the authors’ professional networks, who were known to serve on search committees.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. This study really does not represent a cross section of different types of early career researchers from different fields nor &quot;a wide variety of fields.&quot; Nor is it really an international applicant pool since data on race/ethnicity or nationality or citizenship status was not asked. It really represents a sample of postdocs (96%) from the biomedical and biological sciences with (72%) currently working within the U.S., Canada and U.K. who are on the job market. This is an important distinction to make because prior research Cantwell (2011), Cantwell &amp; Taylor (2015), and Sauerman &amp; Roach (2016) and others have done research in this area and shown how international postdocs working in the U.S. have had limited success in transitioning into tenure-track faculty positions and provide reasons to suggest why.

We acknowledge that our survey did not fully capture the difficulties faced by non-citizens in obtaining a US faculty position, though these difficulties have been demonstrated in previous literature. We have added that citizenship status was a common issue thought to hinder applicants’ progress in the last line of the last paragraph of the “Applicants perceive the process to be time-consuming and opaque, with minimal to no feedback” section and highlight its prominence in Figure 7B. We have also added the following text to the discussion of the limitations of our study: “As indicated in our open question responses (Figure 7B), international postdocs may be specifically challenged in obtaining faculty job offers in the United States and Europe due to immigration policies as well as how mobility is interpreted by the job market (59).” We note that we had previously referenced Sauermann, H. &amp; Roach, M. (2016) in our introduction, it is reference number 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Another concern is an attempt to make correlations between the number of applications with both number of interviews and offers, without taking into consideration the quality of the application, nor where the applicants received their training. There have been some large quantitative studies done by others (e.g. Clauset, Arbesman, &amp; Larremore, 2015) that found faculty hiring follows a common and steeply hierarchical structure where doctoral prestige and where an applicant did both their Ph.D. and postdoc appointment better predicts hiring, especially in R1 institutions. The authors should discuss this concern at an appropriate place in the text and consider citing the following reference:</p><p>- Clauset, A., Arbesman, S., &amp; Larremore, D. B. (2015).

The current study was not designed to explore these variables because of privacy concerns for our respondents. We did not inquire about respondents’ training institutions, advisors’ prestige, or other metrics associated with their “networks” which may have influenced their job search success. Future work to explore these variables are certainly needed. We have cited Clauset et al in our discussion section when we discuss the potential impact of these training/mentoring/network variables we did not assess in the current study. From “Challenges in the Academic Job Market” in the Discussion:</p><p>“Additionally, other unmeasured factors (e.g. applicant pedigree) are likely important considerations, consistent with recent data implicating institutional prestige and non-meritocratic factors in faculty hiring (51). This should be a major consideration for future studies of the academic job market.”</p><p>We would like to add that our open-ended question regarding “What was helpful for your application” (Figure 7A) indicated applicants perceived networking methods and pedigree to be valuable in helping them land faculty jobs. So, there is clearly merit to study these metrics in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Under &quot;Statement of Ethics&quot;, the authors write that an IRB exemption was obtained on 08/29/2019. However, the survey itself was conducted in April 2019. I believe that retroactive IRB approval is generally prohibited by federal regulations. Was the IRB aware that the study had already been conducted when they granted the exemption? Can the authors comment on this serious discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>We initially conducted the surveys for the Future PI Slack community only. When we decided on data analysis and wider dissemination of the results, we applied for IRB exemption for use of existing data. We have now corrected our statement of ethics to reflect the exemption criteria for publication of the survey data: “The surveys used in this manuscript were designed and implemented by the authors listed above on a voluntary basis outside of their post-doctoral positions at the time. The authors respect the confidentiality and anonymity of all respondents, and no identifiable private information was collected. Participation in both surveys was voluntary and the respondents could stop responding to the surveys at any time. The use of the data collected in these surveys was determined to meet the exemption criteria for secondary use of existing data [45 CRF 46.104 (d)(4)] by the University of North Dakota Institutional Review Board (IRB) on 08/29/2019.

Teaching experience was not assessed either from the applicant or the institution perspective. Applicants self-disclosed their presumed teaching experience and then when a number of them did get job offers at R1s, the statement was made that applicants fulfill the teaching requirements for any university type. That is an oversimplification of findings. The authors' data indicates that the majority of applicants applied to R1s. This should be further discussed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the teaching section within the results section to address the reviewers’ comments about oversimplification of the findings. The statement that applicants fulfill the teaching requirement for any university type has been removed, as requested by reviewers. Below is the revised text.</p><p><bold>“</bold>Levels of teaching experience varied among respondents</p><p>Discussion surrounding the academic job market is often centered on applicants' publications and/or funding record, while teaching experience generally receives much less attention. Accordingly, a candidate’s expected teaching credentials and experience vary, largely depending on the type of hiring institution. We asked applicants whether they focused their applications to a specific type of institution (R1, PUI, or both; see Box 1 for definitions), allowing us to examine teaching experience across R1 and/or PUI applicants. Most respondents applied to jobs at R1 institutions (Figure 5A), which may explain the focus on research-centric qualifications. It remains unclear what the emphasis on teaching experience is for search committees at R1 institutions, however the literature suggests that there seems to be a minimal focus (47). Additionally, there might be differences in departmental or institutional requirements that are unknown to outsiders. What is commonly accepted is that many applications to an R1 institution requires a teaching philosophy statement. The majority (99%) of our survey respondents have teaching experience (Figure 5B), with roughly half of applicants’ experience limited to serving as a Teaching Assistant (TA) (Box 1), and half reporting experience beyond a TA position, such as serving as an instructor of record (Figure 5B). The degree of teaching experience did not change based on the target institution of the applicant (Figure 5C), nor did the percentage of offers received significantly differ between groups based on teaching experience (Figure 5D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. The authors could comment on whether the number of postdoc positions attained correlated with their ability to obtain faculty positions (in other words, are 3 postdoc appointments more desirable as compared to 1 when applying for a faculty position at a prestigious institution?).</p></disp-quote><p>We did not look for a correlation between the number of postdoc positions and the ability to obtain faculty positions since the length of postdoctoral positions vary widely in our dataset (i.e. 1 postdoctoral position does not necessarily infer a shorter length of training compared to training spanning across more than one postdoctoral positions) and the majority of our respondents had a single postdoctoral appointment (see Figure 1E). In our survey, we did ask respondents for the total number of years (across all appointments) of postdoc training (Figure 1D) and this further reveals field-specific differences in expectations of postdoc appointments and length. Therefore we believe that the relationship between likelihood of receiving a faculty job offer and training extent is complex and likely requires additional considerations (e.g. quality of training over a training timespan, length of graduate training, etc) and is beyond the scope of the analysis in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. The authors could address how the application process might be improved so it is a more positive experience.</p></disp-quote><p>We note the reviewer’s desire to provide recommendations for hiring institutions and applicants going on the job market. We have added a paragraph to the conclusion of the paper to address how the application process might be improved, so that it is a more positive experience. Additionally, we plan to share our perspective and recommendations for policy changes in a companion piece currently under preparation that provides opinion on data reported here.</p><p>The following text has been added to the conclusion of the manuscript:</p><p><bold>“</bold>Conclusions</p><p>The faculty job search process lacks transparency and data regarding what makes a successful applicant. Here, we began to address this need via a job market survey targeted towards the applicants themselves, including their perceptions of the application process. Of over 300 responses by job applicants, we did not receive a single positive comment on the process, despite the fact that 58% of our applicants received at least one job offer. Our data suggest that baseline thresholds exist for those more likely to receive a faculty job offer, but that many different paths can lead to a job offer. This variety of paths likely reflects both the applicant's preparation as well as different evaluation criteria used by individual search committees. For these reasons, we urge applicants not to conclude that lower than average metrics in any one area are automatically disqualifying. Indeed, we believe that increasing the transparency of the application process through systematic data collection will allow a more detailed study of the many paths to obtaining a faculty offer.</p><p>Our data show that there is a mental strain on applicants during this process, and we propose a number of potential solutions with the understanding that faculty hiring is a complex process involving multiple stakeholders. We believe the application process could be improved by simplifying the process, including standardizing application materials (e.g. requirements for research statements are similar for R1 institutions) and requesting references only after candidates are shortlisted, so that the burden of application preparation time can be reduced. Constructive feedback from mentors is vital for success during the application and interview preparation stages. Additionally, if possible, communication from search committees about unsuccessful applications would be helpful. We understand that these points may increase the workload of mentors and search committees but, if put into place, could alleviate some of the stress related to the job application process. In addition, applicants need to work to be sure their materials are strong and well-researched as the quality of these materials and demonstrating fit for a job posting are important to faculty on search committees (47). More work is needed to understand the challenges search committees face in order to improve their experience of the application process.</p><p>It is our hope that this and future work will not only allow all stakeholders to make informed decisions, but will also enable critical examination, discussion, and reassessment of the implicit and explicit values and biases being used to select the next generation of academic faculty. Such discussions are crucial in building an academic environment that values and supports all of its members.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
