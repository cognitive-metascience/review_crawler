largely to limitations imposed by existing sorting technologies. Here, we present a new method that permits labeling cells of interest by attaching streptavidin-coated magnetic beads to their membranes using the lasers of a confocal microscope. A simple magnet allows highly specific isolation of the labeled cells, which then remain viable and proliferate normally. As proof of principle, we tagged, isolated, and expanded individual cells based on three biologically relevant visual characteristics: i) presence of multiple nuclei, ii) accumulation of lipid vesicles, and iii) ability to resolve ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage foci. Our method constitutes a rapid, efficient, and cost-effective approach for isolation and subsequent characterization of rare cells based on observable traits such as movement, shape, or location, which in turn can generate novel mechanistic insights into important biological processes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45239.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When scientists use microscopes to look at cells, they often want to then isolate certain cells based on how these look like. For example, researchers may want to select cells with specific shapes, movements or division rates, because these visual clues give important information about how the cells may be behaving in the body. However, it remains difficult to precisely pick a few live cells within a bigger sample.</p><p>To address this problem, Binan et al. created a new approach, called single cell magneto-optical capture (scMOCa), to set aside specific cells within a larger population. The technique uses the lasers present on confocal microscopes to attach tiny metallic beads to the surface of chosen cell. Then, a magnetic field is applied to gently pull the cell to a new location. The method is cheap – it relies on commonly available research tools – and it works on a broad variety of cells. In the future, scMOCa could be used to capture and then grow cells that can only be recognized by how they look or behave, which will help to study them in greater details.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single cell capture</kwd><kwd>visual phenotypes</kwd><kwd>cell sorting</kwd><kwd>rare cells</kwd><kwd>clonal expansion</kwd><kwd>cell labeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Affar</surname><given-names>El Bachir</given-names></name><name><surname>Drobetsky</surname><given-names>Elliot</given-names></name><name><surname>Wurtele</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Affar</surname><given-names>El Bachir</given-names></name><name><surname>Drobetsky</surname><given-names>Elliot</given-names></name><name><surname>Wurtele</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name><name><surname>Costantino</surname><given-names>Santiago</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Affar</surname><given-names>El Bachir</given-names></name><name><surname>Wurtele</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008762</institution-id><institution>Genome Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Costantino</surname><given-names>Santiago</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000147</institution-id><institution>Canadian Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Costantino</surname><given-names>Santiago</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003151</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Nature et Technologies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Costantino</surname><given-names>Santiago</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single cells from a large heterogeneous population can be identified, isolated and clonally expanded using commonly available microscopy equipment and simple reagents, based solely on visual characteristics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Characterization of biological samples relies heavily on microscopy where, in response to various stimuli, molecular probes and a myriad of contrast reagents are routinely used to identify and label individual live cells of interest. These methods often require prior knowledge of cellular markers or use of elaborate reporter constructs. On the other hand, based solely on visual inspection or using image processing algorithms, it is possible to distinguish rare cells which exhibit distinct biological properties from among thousands of counterparts within a microscopy field. Such visually discernable traits include movement, shape, intracellular protein distribution, and location within the sample, and in turn can reflect important physiological features of individual cells. For example, cell migration (movement) is an essential determinant in normal embryonic development, wound healing, immune responses, tumor progression, and vascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurosaka and Kashina, 2008</xref>). Moreover, changes in cellular morphology (shape) constitute biomarkers of cellular growth, division, death, and differentiation, as well as of tissue morphogenesis and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prasad and Alizadeh, 2019</xref>). Cell-to-cell contacts (location) or distance to sources of chemical cues such as senescent cells, inflammation or necrotic tissue are critical factors in chemokinesis, differentiation, neural function, and immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, expression and visualization of fluorescent fusion proteins permits the identification of cells presenting molecular behaviors of interest, such as differential relocalization of proteins to subcellular compartments or structures upon various stimuli. Unfortunately, however, isolation and expansion of single cells characterized by such easily-observable features is technically challenging, and indeed has not been accomplished to date.</p><p>We recently developed a method termed Cell Labeling via Photobleaching (CLaP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binan et al., 2016</xref>) allowing the arbitrary tagging of individual cells among a heterogeneous population within a microscopy field. This is accomplished by crosslinking biotin molecules to their plasma membranes with the lasers of a confocal microscope, followed by use of fluorescent streptavidin conjugates to reveal the marked cells. In this manner, the same instrument used for imaging can also be adapted to label particular cells based on any visible trait that distinguishes them from the ensemble. Importantly, previous knowledge of surface markers or transfection of reporter genes are not required. Tags can be added with single-cell precision and the incorporated label displays convenient tracking properties to monitor location and movement. The mark is stable, non-toxic, retained in cells for several days, and moreover, does not engender detectable changes in cell morphology, viability, or proliferative capacity. Moreover, gene expression profiling indicated no major changes associated with the procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binan et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, a technology for the efficient isolation and expansion of CLaP-tagged cells is still lacking.</p><p>The fact that cell populations are often highly heterogeneous underscores the need for new approaches to capture and clonally expand individual cells of interest for further characterization. However, as mentioned above, current sorting techniques cannot efficiently isolate such rare cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pappas and Wang, 2007</xref>); indeed, classical protocols like Fluorescence and Magnetic Activated Cell Sorting (FACS and MACS) are typically optimized for high throughput at the expense of capture efficiency and specificity, and require large numbers of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pappas and Wang, 2007</xref>). Small cell populations representing 10<sup>−3</sup> of the total, which have been defined as rare, or ultrarare in the case of 10<sup>−5</sup>, can only be effectively captured and purified with repeated cycles of sorting and cell expansion protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pappas and Wang, 2007</xref>). Starting with rare and hence precious cell populations, highly conservative gating strategies are needed, which can at best achieve approximately 45% purity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuka, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shields et al., 2015</xref>). Time-consuming manipulations, cost, hardware footprint, and handling complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takahashi and Okada, 1970</xref>) make approaches based on microfluidics ill-suited for capturing small numbers of cells, which are often masked within tens of thousands.</p><p>Here, we report a novel technology, termed Single-Cell Magneto-Optical Capture (scMOCa), for isolating cells based purely on visual traits from within large heterogenous populations. After tethering biotin moieties to their membranes, cells of interest are targeted with streptavidin-coated ferromagnetic beads and captured with high efficiency using a simple magnet. The procedure is fast, uses low-cost commercially available reagents and only requires access to a standard confocal microscope. As proof-of-principle for the utility and power of this novel approach, we used scMOCa to i): capture and expand individual cells that differ in their capacity to resolve ionizing radiation (IR)-induced foci of the DNA repair protein 53BP1, ii) purify rare multinucleated cells, and iii) isolate cells that differentiated into adipocytes and accumulated lipid vesicles. Overall, the ease of use and affordability of our method is expected to facilitate the characterization of phenotypes of interest occurring in a small fraction of cell populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>scMOCa: efficient magnetic sorting of cells using ferromagnetic streptavidin-coated beads</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Cell membrane biotinylation and ferromagnetic functionalization</title><p>We set out to evaluate whether individual cells illuminated with a low-power laser can be labeled with ferromagnetic beads, thereby facilitating their purification and clonal expansion.

This operation effectively crosslinks biotin molecules to plasma membranes and was repeated for all targeted cells.

Depending on their size, beads may later be internalized (nanometer-size beads), or retained at the cell surface and shared between daughter cells after mitosis (micron-size beads). If needed, special beads, which integrate a DNA spacer between the streptavidin and their magnetic core to allow enzymatic cleavage, are commercially available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This permits detachment from cells in cases where beads can compromise downstream experiments, for example analysis of migration, or single-cell RNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Rare cells can be sorted and expanded with high efficiency and specificity</title><p>We used trypsin to detach cells from the substrate before subjecting the entire population to a magnetic field that attracts labeled (positive) cells upwards to a collection chamber, while non-labeled (negative) cells remain in the original chamber. Specifically, two home-made chambers cast with silicone were filled with cell culture medium and positioned one on top of the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The top (receiving) chamber is also filled with trypsin and slowly brought together with the bottom chamber until both liquid drops merge. On top of the receiving chamber, a nail is placed to guide the magnetic field generated by a pile of 10 N35 magnets, each generating a 1.18 Gauss magnetic field at its surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, the nail must have high iron-alloy content for strong ferromagnetism. Only positive cells coated with ferromagnetic beads are pulled upwards to the top chamber, whereas negative cells are held down by gravity.</p><p>Magnets only attract positive cells with beads from the bottom well to the top well, regardless of the total number of cells in the sample. Repetition of the magnetic capture up to four times yields optimal selectivity: the collection (top) chamber can be simply flipped to replace the original donor chamber, while a new clean collection chamber is placed on top. The entire procedure takes only a few minutes and a detailed protocol is provided in Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. We note that a number of experimental parameters from this protocol need to be fine-tuned for specific cell types which exhibit different binding strengths and adhesion kinetics. In particular, the duration of the trypsin incubation, the number of times the capture is repeated, the time of exposure to the magnetic field, and the concentration of beads must be experimentally optimised.</p><p>Chamber dimensions can be critical for effective sorting, as their diameter (5 mm) and thickness (2 mm) determine the surface tension that holds liquid in the collection chamber and prevents it from falling. Furthermore, turbulence and movement must be avoided to prevent negative cells from reaching the collection chamber when both chambers are pulled apart. The distance that separates the two chambers while cells are being magnetically transferred must be maintained at approximately 6 mm such that gravity attracts negative cells as far away as possible from the collection chamber. The more distant the chambers are, the stronger the magnetic field must be to attract positive cells into the collection chamber; however, this could in turn affect the viability of transferred cells subjected to high pressure from beads pushing towards their cytoplasm.</p><p>We quantified the capacity of scMOCa to tag and isolate single cells from large populations. For this, we illuminated individual cells from chambers where approximately 50,000 cells had been seeded the day before and assessed capture efficiency. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows examples where one or five cells were successfully sorted. Cells were non-specifically stained with WGA-Alexa-555 to facilitate detection and images were obtained before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, left panels) and immediately after sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, right panels).

IMCD cells were incubated in WGA-Alexa 555 prior to mixing, to add a species-specific fluorescent marker. After 1 day in co-culture, the sample was brought to the microscope where 10 (non-fluorescent) MDCK cells were illuminated. We sorted the cells using scMOCa and performed PCR with primers specific for the cytochrome C gene from both dog and mouse. The results show that both cell types were present in the original mix, but only dog DNA was detected after magnetic sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We also show by qPCR that these samples respectively contain an amount of DNA that corresponds to 10 and 9 dog cells, whereas mouse DNA is essentially undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also note that since we amplified a mitochondrial gene present at hundreds of gene copies per cell, one negative cell or even a DNA dilution corresponding to less than one cell is expected to be detectable (DNA dilutions corresponding to less than one cell give readily detectable signals; see calibration curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These experiments demonstrate that scMOCa isolates individual cells with high specificity. Indeed within a heterogeneous population, that is starting with a ratio 1:10,000 (positive: negative cells) in the source chamber, the method yields pure samples in the collection chamber. Our examples represent a five-orders-of-magnitude enrichment, as pure samples originating from a rare cell population (0.02% of the total) can be generated.</p><p>As a comparison to other capture methods based on magnetic fields, we prepared samples in which we sought to isolate 30 U2OS cells arbitrarily tagged amongst 30,000 by using commercially available separation columns (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec). These columns are optimized for high-throughput enrichment of large samples and are not designed for rare cells. In three independent experiments, we could isolate 5.3 ± 1.5 positive cells on average, while also capturing 17.6 ± 7.3 negative cells. This represents a population in which approximately 75% of the captured cells are contaminating false-positive cells with no beads attached, while scMOCa generates pure samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These results underscore the importance of the design of the home-made chambers and capture protocol, which prevents turbulent movement of cells.</p><p>Cells can be placed back in culture and expanded after sorting. Immediately after capture cells are round (as expected after trypsin treatment), but after one day in culture they display normal elongated shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Upon proliferation the number of cells with beads attached is reduced exponentially as cells divide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, right panels). In addition to immortalized cell lines, we have tested and successfully sorted three different types of primary cells: human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), human lung fibroblasts, and mice dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons dissected and plated 24 hr before the assay. We specifically chose primary cells as these are known to be more fragile during manipulation than cell lines. Importantly, HUVECs and lung fibroblasts proliferated normally for several days and primary DRG neurons actively extended cellular processes, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Finally, we tested mouse embryonic stem cells which, after capture and replating, displayed similar growth and morphological features relative to the original population. Indeed, cells sorted using gelatin-coated plastic chambers migrated and regrouped into small colonies which proliferated normally during 10 days. Sorted cells formed small poorly adherent spherical structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) which is expected from embryonic stem cells as they are known to spontaneously form embryonic bodies in culture.

For this, we used U2OS osteosarcoma cells harboring a construct permitting doxycycline-inducible expression of 53BP1 fused to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). 53BP1 is directly involved in DSB repair and is rapidly recruited to DSB sites where it forms foci that can be readily detected by fluorescence microscopy in live-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mirzayans et al., 2018</xref>) when fused with GFP. Foci of 53BP1 are resolved gradually as cells repair DSB, and within approximately 3 hr post-irradiation with 0.5 Gy most are expected to disappear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mirzayans et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We exposed cells to 0.5 Gy of IR and imaged GFP-53BP1 foci.

At 2 hr post-irradiation, a second set of images was acquired, and the average number of foci was reduced to 7.6 ± 2.3. Since on average cells resolved approximately 25% of their foci within 2 hr, we defined cells in which more than 85% of foci have disappeared after 2 hr as ‘fast resolving’. Such fast resolving cells, represented approximately 1% of the population.

Importantly, all three populations exhibited similar numbers of foci per cell 45 min after irradiation, indicating that the initial formation of 53BP1 foci is comparable between all cell populations. However, we found that the progeny of captured cells (Populations #1 and #2) retained the original visually detected phenotype of fast focus resolution. These cells resolved foci at least 1.5 times more rapidly than parental counterparts, as the median number of GFP-53BP1 foci per cell 60 min post-IR for Populations#1 and #2 (17 and 15 respectively) is equal to the median number of foci that parental cells exhibit at 90 min post-IR. After 75 min, these numbers of foci are already statistically different (p-values from student T-tests comparing the parental cells to Populations #1 and #2 are respectively 10<sup>−75</sup> and 10<sup>−39</sup>). Such differences in focus resolution dynamics is particularly striking in cells for which the expression of GFP-53BP1 is induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) but is clearly observable as well using immunofluorescence of the endogenous protein in non-induced fixed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>To rule out the possibility that resolution of 53BP1 foci might be due to increased degradation upon IR or to globally decreased levels of the protein, we monitored 53BP1 levels by immunoblotting at different time points post-IR.

Finally, FACS analysis shows that all populations exhibit similar ratios of cells in each cell cycle phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

Rare false positive cells, presumably attached by cell junctions to true positive cells, can be eliminated by repeating the sorting procedure to reach 100% purity. The most widely used cell sorting technique, FACS, is not optimized for sorting rare cells. Adaptations needed for capturing cell populations representing &lt;1% of the sample with high specificity make FACS experiments cumbersome and inefficient. Moreover, repetition of flow cytometry sorting to obtain pure samples of a given cell type imposes can only be performed with robust cell types due to reduced survival and proliferation capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pappas and Wang, 2007</xref>). More refined procedures have been developed to sort rare cells via binding to microfluidic channels coated with antibodies against specific surface markers of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antfolk et al., 2017</xref>). However, this requires high-affinity antibodies that are specific to the target cell types and leads to dilution of cells in laminar flows within microfluidics chips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kang et al., 2012</xref>), which can become a drawback for downstream applications. Techniques based on magnetism display an improved capacity to isolate rare cells without dilution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tham et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, while the majority of protocols that use magnetic fields can capture cells of interest with efficiency near 90%, their specificity remains a major challenge, as published results vary between 10% and 80% purity for captured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miltenyi et al., 1990</xref>), generally closer to 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zborowski and Chalmers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pamme and Wilhelm, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Radbruch et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khojah et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, only a handful of approaches allow label-free cell sorting, where intrinsic physical properties, such as size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Monti et al., 2017</xref>) or magnetic susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pamme and Wilhelm, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hosokawa et al., 2010</xref>) differentiate the target population. Filtration, for example, relies on porous membranes to capture cells based on size and deformability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gascoyne et al., 2009</xref>) and can achieve 80% efficiency. Dielectrophoresis exploits natural differences in dielectric properties of cell types for discrimination and circulates cells in microfluidics channels, deviating target cells within an electric field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Landry et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The application we introduced here is focused on magnetic separation, but the same concept of adding particles to individual live cells may open the door to novel strategies where other actionable properties can be exploited in a simple and straightforward manner. For example, fluorescence or electron density can be manipulated on single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binan et al., 2016</xref>), and recent advances in cellular nanotechnologies such as scattering and plasmon resonance using gold nanoparticles, thermal capacity with nanoshells, or electrical properties using carbon nanotubes can now be modulated only on chosen cells using low-cost commercially available reagents.</p><p>ScMOCa presents critical advantages over more traditional sorting techniques. It allows isolation of live cells without previous knowledge of surface markers and can simply be based on morphological traits such as the presence of nuclear foci or lipid vesicles and the number nuclei. More importantly, it has the potential to sort based on time-dependent characteristics such as migration speed or foci resolution. In addition, because sorting is carried out in small chambers of similar size, there is no sample dilution. This prevents cells from sustaining strong shear stress upon passing through microfluidic tubing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miltenyi et al., 1990</xref>), and allows their use in downstream applications such as cell culture, reinjection, or even lysis prior to transcriptomic or proteomic analysis. ScMOCa crosslinks biotin to cell membrane and the strength of the ensuing biotin-streptavidin bond is extremely high (K<sub>d</sub> = 10<sup>−15</sup>M). In comparison, the bonds utilized in immunochemistry are much weaker, from 10<sup>−12</sup> to 10<sup>-9 39,40</sup>, which may cause tags to detach from cells because of shear stress within the microfluidics tubing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wooldridge et al., 2009</xref>). Another example is provided by ligands targeting the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on immune cells where binding strength is so weak that ligands usually need to be grouped in tetramers for increased strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van der Toom et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, while the precise mechanisms influencing 53BP1 focus resolution was not investigated in our proof-of-principle experiments, our data demonstrates that markers used for identification need not be exposed on the membrane since the spatial distribution of fluorescent signal originating from the nucleus were used here as a reporters.</p><p>Simplicity is a key advantage of scMOCa, as it does not require highly specialized software, or hardware such as microfluidic chips. Indeed, a standard confocal microscope with no modification, simple handmade chambers and low-cost magnets are all that is needed to sort single cells of choice from among tens of thousands. The main limitation of scMOCa is that high throughput implementations would depend on efficient image processing tools for cell detection. While automated detection and tagging are possible on motorized microscopy systems, the duration of the procedure is roughly proportional to the number of target cells. Thus, even if laser illumination of a single cell typically requires one second, this might become a limitation for applications that deal with large cell numbers.</p><p>The capacity of scMOCa to isolate and profile individual cells within a large population based purely on visual phenotypes constitutes a powerful tool for understanding cellular heterogeneity. We envision that one potential application of high interest would combine scMOCa with single cell sequencing to characterize the molecular basis of differential metastatic potential among particular cells within a tumour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Navin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Valastyan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shapiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tirosh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heitzer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gierahn et al., 2017</xref>).

The dish was degassed overnight in a vacuum chamber and the resin allowed to polymerize at room temperature for 2 days. Square pieces were cut with a blade, circular wells of 5 mm diameter were made using a biopsy punch from Miltex (33-38) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>) and placed on either glass or Aclar coverslips (onto which PDMS naturally adheres).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>scMOCa protocol</title><p>Cells were incubated in regular medium with 40 μg/mL biotin-4-fluorescein (Sigma) on glass coverslips or Aclar substrates. A spot within each cell of interest was illuminated at 473 nm with the laser of a confocal microscope at 75 μW for 2 s with 10 × 0.4 NA objective. The sample was then thoroughly rinsed in PBS, and medium containing 8 μL of streptavidin-coated ferromagnetic beads of 2.8 μm in diameter (Thermofisher, 65305 and 11533D) was added. When beads were attached to a whole area rather than a single cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) the sample was scanned with a 700 µW laser scanned at 0.2 mm/s with a 0.4 NA objective in a succession of lines 0.005 mm apart to form a pattern generated from a binary image.</p><p>Beads were pulled down in contact with the cells and re-suspended 3 times, attracted by a magnet placed alternatively below or above the sample. Cells were then rinsed thrice with PBS and a magnet was positioned above the sample to remove unbound beads. After this, very few beads remain in the dish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Cells are detached using 0.25% trypsin (Thermofisher, 25200072) for magnetic capture. The resulting cell suspension is then subjected to a magnetic field that attracts positive cells upwards to a collection chamber, while negative cells settle by gravity in the original chamber, regardless of the total number of cells in the sample.</p><p>More specifically, once the original PDMS culture chamber contains a suspension of individual cells in trypsin, a second identical PDMS culture chamber is placed on top of the first one as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The structure that holds the top chamber in place can be built with Lego bricks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>): the collection chamber is positioned between two Lego bricks that maintain it at 6 mm above the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). While magnetic attraction of tagged cells toward the collection chamber is quick, negative cells require 4 min to settle down to the original chamber before the top chamber is separated, flipped, and the magnets removed. This procedure needs to be performed slowly to minimize turbulence and to avoid capture of negative cells.</p><p>These manipulations are repeated three times to attain maximum specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The collection chamber is always filled with trypsin solution to avoid rapid cell adhesion, and gentle up and down pipetting can be performed to prevent cell clumping. Only for the last capture is the collection chamber filled with medium in which the cells will be expanded. The entire procedure is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>.</p><p>Experimental conditions need to be fine-tuned for different cell types. The most important parameters that need to be optimised are surface coating of both donor and collection chambers, duration and number of repeats of the sorting steps. The collection chamber should provide optimal plating efficiency to maximize cell survival of very few cells while the donor chamber should allow strong adhesion of the cells to allow thorough rinsing of free magnetic beads. In our experience collagen coating provides strong cell attachment, but also generates extracellular fibers where beads and negative cells can be entangled and captured. Gelatin solves the issue of collagen fibers, but cell adhesion is slightly reduced, which may cause cell loss during rinsing. Uncoated substrates are an easy solution for cells like U2Os but many cell types including primary cells do not proliferate well on such surfaces. Plastic bottom chambers allow better cell adhesion and survival, but their reduced optical quality may hamper the precise observation of selection criteria. In this respect, Aclar possesses excellent optical properties and represents an excellent alternative. For most cell types, longer incubations (approximately 4 min) allow negative cells to settle down in the donor chamber, reducing the number of repeats required for optimal purity. On the contrary, experimentation with cells that adhere rapidly (e.g. MDA-MB-231), require the capture protocol to be performed as quickly as possible and more repeats may be needed.</p><p>In our hands, the best results were obtained using 10 magnets each generating a 1.2 Gauss magnetic field and 2 mm deep PDMS wells. In this condition, it is important that the distance between the bottom of each chamber is kept at 6 mm to allow the magnetic field to attract all tagged cells against gravity to the collection chamber while preventing the turbulence generated by the separation of the chambers to bring negative cells into the collection chamber. Increasing this distance requires a stronger magnetic field, which in turn reduces viability of captured cells. The diameter of the chambers should also be 5–6 mm, to ensure the necessary surface tension that allows merging and splitting the media in both donor and collections chambers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell sorting using commercial magnetic cell separation columns</title><p>30,000 U2Os cells were plated in our homemade chambers 1 day prior to sorting. On the day of the experiment, 30 cells were arbitrarily chosen and tagged in three independent experiments. We manually counted and verified that the right number of cells (30) were covered with magnetic beads in each dish. Commercial MACS columns were washed with PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA as indicated by the manufacturer. Cells were detached using 60 µL trypsin and then diluted in 500 µL of the same buffer and placed in the column in the magnets from Miltenyi Biotec. Columns were rinsed three time with buffer, then removed from magnets and washed with 5 mL buffer. Cells were then centrifuged, resuspended in 70 µL medium and placed in new homemade chambers for observation and counting under the microscope.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Paul S Maddox (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors present a follow-up to their single-cell laser tagging system (named CLaP) where they couple live-cell labelling with Biotin-4-fluorescein with magnetic cell retrieval using ferromagnetic streptavidin-coated beads. They authors show convincingly that the method has high selectivity and efficiency. They highlight the potential of this approach by isolating cells with unusual phenotypes such as fast-resolver of 53BP1 IR-induced foci as well as multinucleated cells. They show that cells tolerate the isolation procedure and can be expanded afterwards.</p><p>All of the reviewers were enthusiastic about the concepts, and felt the potential benefits of the method to a broad range of applications in the community made the study potentially interesting. However, the reviewers raised a number of points that would require addressing before the study can be further considered for publication.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>- The benefit of isolating artificially induced multi-nucleated cells was not very clearly made and Figure 6 and Figure 6— figure supplement 1 were not convincing or informative as to the benefit of using this approach. It would be important to make this clearer and provide additional rationale and evidence for why this application of scMOCa is of importance to the broader scientific community.</p><p>- It would be important to show the approach works for more sensitive cells where the method will likely be most useful. It would be very helpful to show that more sensitive cells that do not usually tolerate FACS well, such as stem cells or primary neurons, can be isolated using this approach and survive in culture post-isolation.</p><p>- Please define how critical the collection chamber setup shown in Figure 1C is. Could one simply trypsinise the cells and pass them on a MACS-type column?</p><p>- Can scMOCa be used on fixed cells (e.g. after immunofluorescence)? This would open up additional applications.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45239.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>- The benefit of isolating artificially induced multi-nucleated cells was not very clearly made and Figures 6 and Supp Figure 6—figure supplement 1 were not convincing or informative as to the benefit of using this approach.

We originally induced polyploidy to increase our chance of detecting various populations of polyploid cells (4N, 8N, 16N.). For this resubmission, we were able to capture spontaneously arising multinucleated cells (which arise in very low numbers) and culture them for several days. Since these cells do not divide, we stained them using Mitotracker green to show they retain metabolic activity. Multinucleated cells have recently garnered considerable interest in light of burgeoning evidence that these play important roles in drug resistance and cancer relapse. Recent studies suggest these cells persist in tumour tissues after treatment. They normally do not divide but may later undergo a budding process resulting in de novo formation of mononucleated cells that contribute to cancer relapse. They also transmit stemness promoting factors and sub-genomes to neighboring cells. To the best of our knowledge live multinucleated cells cannot be rigorously sorted by classical methods such as FACS, since e.g., cells in G2 cannot be distinguished from tetraploid cells in G1. As such, isolation of these rare cells would depend solely on visual identification. We modified the manuscript to better explain the interest of sorting such cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It would be important to show the approach works for more sensitive cells where the method will likely be most useful. It would be very helpful to show that more sensitive cells that do not usually tolerate FACS well, such as stem cells or primary neurons, can be isolated using this approach and survive in culture post-isolation.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we show (subsection “Rare cells can be sorted and expanded with high efficiency and specificity”) that scMOCA can be successfully used for sorting 3 primary cell types: lung fibroblasts (Figure 4A), endothelial cells (Figure 4B), and neurons (Figure 4C).</p><p>In addition we also added experiments (see the aforementioned subsection) with mouse embryonic stem cells. In the new version of Figure 4 we show that these cells, known to be remarkably fragile and do not tolerate FACS well, can be captured with scMOCA and kept proliferating for at least 15 days (Figure 4D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Please define how critical the collection chamber setup shown in Figure 1C is. Could one simply trypsinise the cells and pass them on a MACS-type column?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we repeated the same type of experiment we previously used to characterise the efficacy of scMOCa, i.e. cells were tagged with the laser but this time we used MACS columns for capture. We provide the quantification of this experiment and show that approximately 75% of cells captured by columns are contaminating cells that do not have any magnetic bead attached. Moreover, this procedure yields important losses, as only an average of 17% of the positive cells were captured in three independent assays. These poor results can be explained by the fact that MACS columns are optimised for larger cell samples, where the target population to be extracted represents a more important proportion of the original sample and therefore contamination with negative cells may not represent a major drawback. This result underscores the importance of our design that significantly limits cell manipulations such as dilution and spinning, while also reducing the influence of turbulence and flow forces that contaminate the collection tubes with negative cells. The manuscript was modified in the subsection “Rare cells can be sorted and expanded with high efficiency and specificity” to clarify these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Can scMOCa be used on fixed cells (e.g. after immunofluorescence)? This would open up additional applications.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting possibility. However, we strongly believe that the primary strength of our technology lies in the ability to manipulate live cells. Other commercially available technologies, such as laser microdissection, can do this adequately with fixed cells.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have successfully performed the suggested experiments with fixed cells and were able to attach magnetic beads on chosen cells as well as detaching with trypsin and capturing them. Importantly, there is a limitation in the purity of the sample that can be achieved as fixed and crosslinked cells are often attached to negative neighboring cells which can be captured. The use of scMOCa with fixed cells would therefore be restricted to very low-density cell cultures.</p><p>In addition, we confronted a major challenge in manipulating fixed and permeabilized cells for immunofluorescence. Since cell membrane integrity is severely compromised during these protocols, even if beads attach to target cells, trypsin and magnetic forces often shear cells, potentially resulting in capture of severely physically-damaged cells.</p><p>In view of the above, we feel that our technology is not yet optimized for capture of fixed cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
