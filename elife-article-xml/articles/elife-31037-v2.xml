How endothelial cells arise in adequate numbers and arrange suitably to shape functional vascular networks is poorly understood. Here we show that YAP/TAZ promote stretch-induced proliferation and rearrangements of endothelial cells whilst preventing bleeding in developing vessels. Mechanistically, YAP/TAZ increase the turnover of VE-Cadherin and the formation of junction associated intermediate lamellipodia, promoting both cell migration and barrier function maintenance. This is achieved in part by lowering BMP signalling. Consequently, the loss of YAP/TAZ in the mouse leads to stunted sprouting with local aggregation as well as scarcity of endothelial cells, branching irregularities and junction defects. Forced nuclear activity of TAZ instead drives hypersprouting and vascular hyperplasia. We propose a new model in which YAP/TAZ integrate mechanical signals with BMP signaling to maintain junctional compliance and integrity whilst balancing endothelial cell rearrangements in angiogenic vessels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vascular development</kwd><kwd>YAP</kwd><kwd>TAZ</kwd><kwd>VE-Cadherin</kwd><kwd>BMP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

cell biology relates to how cells integrate mechanical and chemical signals to orchestrate the morphogenic behaviours that ensure adequate tissue patterning. During sprouting angiogenesis, the arrangement and distribution of cells rather than their numbers appear to drive morphogenesis of the vascular tree. Recent data showing unaltered remodelling in the absence of endothelial cell apoptosis and normal branching frequency across a range of endothelial cell densities support this idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watson et al., 2016</xref>). In the extreme, however, too few cells will jeopardize network formation and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phng et al., 2009</xref>), whereas too many cells might compromise vessel calibre control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watson et al., 2016</xref>). Functional network formation therefore needs to establish the right number of cells in the right place, and distribute them such that the hierarchical branching pattern is supported. What establishes such a balance has remained unclear. Here we provide evidence for the yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) and its paralog WW domain containing transcription regulator 1 (TAZ) as critical endothelial cell autonomous regulators in this process.</p><p>YAP and TAZ, two transcriptional co-activators initially discovered as effectors of the Hippo signalling pathway, play a central role in organ size control via regulation of proliferation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piccolo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). In confluent cells, YAP and TAZ are phosphorylated by kinases of the Hippo pathway, which induces their retention in the cytoplasm. In sparse cells, YAP and TAZ can translocate to the nucleus, where they interact with transcription factors to regulate the expression of pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic genes. Other stimuli have been found to regulate YAP and TAZ nuclear translocation and activity – these include, among others, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yu et al., 2012</xref>), junctional proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giampietro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schlegelmilch et al., 2011</xref>), and mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aragona et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, besides cell proliferation and apoptosis, YAP and TAZ also regulate cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu and Guan, 2013</xref>), migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) and actomyosin contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). In vascular development, the roles of YAP and TAZ are not fully understood. <italic>Yap</italic> null mutant zebrafish develop an initially normal vasculature but display increased vessel collapse and regression. <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> double mutant zebrafish die before the onset of circulation with severe developmental defects, precluding analysis of vascular development in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakajima et al., 2017</xref>). Endothelial-specific deletion of <italic>Yap</italic> in mice using the Tie2-Cre transgenic line is embryonically lethal due to heart valve defects caused by failed endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). During post-natal development of the mouse retina, YAP was shown to regulate vascular branching and density by promoting the transcription of <italic>Angiopoetin-2</italic> (16). While these studies point towards an important role for YAP in regulating blood vessel formation and maintenance, the cellular principles and effectors of YAP/TAZ in endothelial cells in vivo, as well as the possible interplay between YAP/TAZ and the major signalling pathways regulating angiogenesis remain poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we used loss and gain of function endothelial specific mouse models to address the roles of YAP and TAZ in the vasculature. We show that YAP and TAZ are both expressed and active in sprouting ECs and critical for sprouting angiogenesis. The inducible, endothelial-specific deletion of YAP and TAZ leads to severe morphogenic defects consistent with impaired junctional remodelling in vivo. We found that the loss of YAP and TAZ decreased VE-Cadherin turnover and decreased the frequency of junction associated intermediate lamellipodia. Furthermore, the loss of YAP and TAZ decreased cell migration and increased cell-cell coupling. We also discovered that endothelial YAP and TAZ strongly inhibit BMP signalling in vitro and in vivo, and that this is mechanistically linked to the migration and permeability defects. Together our results suggest that YAP and TAZ integrate mechanical stimuli with key transcriptional regulators of endothelial sprouting and cell rearrangements during angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>YAP and TAZ have distinct expression patterns in endothelial cells of developing vessels and localise to the nucleus at the sprouting front</title><p>Immunofluorescence staining in the postnatal mouse retina showed that YAP and TAZ are distinctly expressed in the ECs of the developing vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). While YAP is evenly expressed throughout the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>), the expression of TAZ is especially prominent at the sprouting front (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>). Furthermore, YAP is exclusively cytoplasmic in all areas of the retinal vasculature, with the exception of the sprouting front where some ECs express nuclear YAP, although at lower levels than in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A’–D’</xref>). TAZ staining signal is very low in the remodelling plexus, arteries and veins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E’–H’</xref>); at the sprouting front, TAZ is strongly nuclear in numerous ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, green arrowheads and E’), and both nuclear and cytoplasmic in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, red arrowheads). The nuclear signal of YAP and TAZ did not correlate with a tip or stalk cell phenotype; nuclear YAP and TAZ are rather present in a subset of tip and stalk ECs at the sprouting front. YAP and TAZ were also found at endothelial adherens junctions in veins and in the remodelling plexus, (yellow arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D’ and F’</xref>), as revealed by co-staining for VE-Cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that YAP/TAZ are abundant proteins in the endothelium, which are dynamically regulated during the angiogenic process.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31037.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>YAP and TAZ are expressed throughout the vasculature of developing mouse retinas, and localise to the nucleus of sprouting endothelial cells.</title><p>Immunofluorescence staining of YAP (green, <bold>A–D and A’–D’</bold>) and TAZ (green, <bold>E–H and E’–H’</bold>) was performed in wild-type mouse retinas at post-natal day 6 (P6).

VE-Cadherin staining also unveiled profound differences in the arrangement of ECs within vessels. In control retinas, ECs were arranged into multicellular tubes, highlighted by the presence of two or more VE-Cadherin junctions running longitudinally along the axis of the vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,G’’</xref>). Some unicellular segments lacking VE-Cadherin staining could also be found and always correlated with decreasing calibre, indicative of regressing vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> red arrowheads) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franco et al., 2015</xref>).

Previous studies have correlated junctional morphology with cellular activities. In vivo, straight or linear junctions were associated with high Notch activity and stalk cell behaviour, while serrated junctions (also referred to as VE-Cadherin fingers) were found in tip cells or actively rearranging cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bentley et al., 2014</xref>). In vitro, VE-Cadherin fingers were shown to steer migrating ECs and couple leader and follower cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayer et al., 2016</xref>), and have also been correlated with increased permeability in cell monolayers. More recently, junction associated intermediate lamellipodia (JAIL) have been identified in the sprouting vessels of the mouse retina, and linked to increased migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2017</xref>) as well as decreased permeability in cultured ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breslin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To more accurately describe the differences in junctional morphology after YAP/TAZ knockdown, we defined five junctional categories: straight junctions, thick junctions, thick to reticular junctions, reticular junctions and fingers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Only the combined knockdown of YAP/TAZ led to a significant increase in permeability in comparison to the control situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), suggesting that YAP/TAZ are both required for the barrier function of the endothelium and can compensate for each other in this particular role.</p><p>The dynamic rearrangements of ECs during sprouting require that cell-cell junctions are constantly assembled, rearranged and disassembled. To understand whether YAP and TAZ regulate the turnover of cell junctions, we pulse-labeled VE-Cadherin molecules at cell junctions using an antibody directly coupled to a fluorescent dye for 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorland et al., 2016</xref>). The antibody was subsequently washed out and cells cultured for two more hours in normal conditions, before being fixed and stained for surface VE-Cadherin using a second fluorescent label. Comparing the two sequential VE-cadherin labels allowed us to distinguish junctions with high, intermediate and low turnover rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). In control cells, 44% of patches were of high turnover junctions, 24% of intermediate turnover junctions and 32% of low turnover junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). The knockdown of YAP/TAZ significantly decreased the percentage of high turnover junctions to 14% (p=0.0387) and increased the percentage of low turnover junctions to 58%. Interestingly, we found a correlation between the morphology of junctions and VE-Cadherin turnover rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>): straight junctions and fingers showed the lowest turnover rate, while reticular junctions showed the highest. To understand if the different VE-Cadherin turnover observed after knockdown of YAP/TAZ was caused by a shift in morphology, we compared the turnover of VE-Cadherin within the same morphological categories. Knockdown of YAP/TAZ decreased the percentage of high turnover junctions within all morphological categories, confirming a specific defect in VE-Cadherin turnover. To further investigate how YAP and TAZ affect the turnover of VE-cadherin, we transfected HUVECs with a photo-convertible fluorescent protein tagged VE-Cadherin (VE-cadherin-mEos3.2) and measured the fluorescence loss after photo conversion in straight junctions. The knockdown of YAP/TAZ led to a significant increase in the amount of immobile VE-cadherin-mEos3.2 at the junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>) without significantly affecting the half time of fluorescence loss of the mobile fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>). Together, these results show that YAP/TAZ increase the turnover of adherens junctions by increasing the pool of mobile VE-Cadherin.</p><p>Immunofluorescence staining for f-actin in YAP/TAZ deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5P,P’</xref>) showed an increase in actin bundles (actin filaments along the junction and stress fibers) and a decrease in branched actin networks, in comparison with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O,O’</xref>). This result correlates with the junctional morphologies observed before, as straight junctions and fingers associate respectively with actin filaments and stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu Taha and Schnittler, 2014</xref>), while JAILs associate with branched actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abu Taha et al., 2014</xref>).

Recent data illustrated that collectively migrating ECs in vitro move in streams and swirls and display straight junctions along the lateral boundaries and fingers along the front and rear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayer et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate collective cell migration we therefore analysed the arrangement of cells in a confluent monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J–O</xref>). Control cells displayed a cobblestone appearance without identifiable subgroups of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). In contrast, after knockdown of YAP/TAZ cells adopted elongated shapes and arranged into streams and swirls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). To quantity this effect we used the longest axis of the EC nucleus as a proxy for the orientation of each cell and developed a measure of monolayer coordination based on the alignment of cells with their neighbours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L,L’,M,M’, N</xref>). A score of 1 would signify parallel alignment between all cells, and a score of 0 random alignment of the population. Control cells displayed higher than random alignment with their closest neighbours, but cells beyond 300 µm from each other were arranged at random (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). While the knockdown of YAP did not affect the alignment score of cells, the knockdown of TAZ led to increased alignment. The combined knockdown of YAP/TAZ led to an even higher degree of coordination, with higher alignment scores across all distances between cells. These results suggest that YAP/TAZ promote the ability of cells to distribute individually within monolayers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Nuclear YAP and TAZ inhibit Notch and BMP signalling in endothelial cells</title><p>To gain insight into the nuclear function of YAP and TAZ, we generated a <italic>Pdgfb-iCreERT2</italic> -inducible TAZ gain-of-function mouse allele, in which a mutated version of TAZ (TAZ S89A) is introduced in the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus and expressed by a <italic>CAG</italic> promoter following Cre-mediated excision of an upstream stop cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Only Ldn193187, an Alk2/3/1 kinase inhibitor, significantly decreased the BMP reporter activity after YAP and TAZ knockdown (p=0.0063) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). In comparison to control cells, the BMP reporter activity in YAP/TAZ deficient cells was 12 times higher, dropping to seven times higher after Ldn193187 treatment. To understand if the partial BMP rescue altered the cellular defects after YAP/TAZ loss, we performed the scratch wound and permeability assays using this inhibitor. Ldn193187 treatment partially rescued the migration defect of YAP/TAZ knockdown HUVECs in the scratch wound assay, significantly increasing the wound closure at 16 hr from 33 ± 3% in DMSO treated cells to 56 ± 5% in Ldn193187 treated cells (p=0.0022) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Ldn193187 treatment fully rescued the permeability defect of YAP/TAZ knockdown HUVECs to 250 kDa FITC dextran molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Staining for VE-Cadherin further showed that Ldn193187 treatment decreased the frequency of finger junctions and increased the frequency of JAIL in YAP/TAZ deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G–H</xref>). Quantification of junction morphologies identified that Ldn193187 treatment decreased the frequency of finger junctions in YAP/TAZ deficient cells to the levels found in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, % of fingers: siYAP/TAZ DMSO, 25 ± 5%, siYAP/TAZ Ldn193187 12 ± 0.6%, siCTR: 9 ± 4%). Ldn193187 treatment also led to a 3-fold increase in thick to reticular (p=0.012) and reticular junctions (p=0.043) in YAP/TAZ knockdown cells. The frequency of straight junctions was also significantly decreased (p=0.0326) although still remaining high in comparison to control cells. Together, these results show that the BMP signaling increase is at least partially involved in the cellular defects caused by YAP/TAZ deficiency.</p><p>To gain insight into how YAP and TAZ repress BMP signalling, we analysed the gene expression of BMPs, BMP receptors and co-receptors and BMP antagonists in <italic>YAP</italic> and <italic>TAZ</italic> gain of function mutant HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). As YAP and TAZ function as transcriptional co-activators, the direct targets of YAP and TAZ would be upregulated in this assay, while genes that are downregulated would represent indirect regulation. Forced activation of YAP and TAZ led to increased expression of the BMP ligands BMP2, BMP4 and BMP6, which cannot explain the increase in BMP signalling in the loss of function condition.

Our finding that YAP and TAZ were present in the nucleus of ECs at the sprouting front of developing vessels shows parallels with other cell types where nuclear YAP and TAZ are detected in actively proliferating areas of developing tissues. Interestingly, however, YAP and TAZ show distinct expression patterns in ECs, although these proteins show a high degree of redundancy in many other cell types. While TAZ was predominantly expressed in the sprouting front where it accumulated strongly in endothelial nuclei, YAP was mostly cytoplasmic both in the sprouting front and also in more mature, remodelling vessels. Interestingly, recent work by Sakabe and colleagues showed that cytoplasmic YAP promotes endothelial cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sakabe et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to nuclear and cytoplasmic YAP and TAZ, we also detected junctional localization of these proteins in retinal vessels. A previous study by Giampietro and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giampietro et al., 2015</xref>) has shown that endothelial YAP associates with adherens junction proteins at stable junctions and that this prevents its nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity. Whether this is also true for TAZ has previously not been addressed. A sequestration of YAP and TAZ either in the cytoplasm or bound to junctional proteins can potentially serve different and not necessarily mutually exclusive roles: preventing their nuclear activity, keeping a pool of protein ready to shuttle to the nucleus and drive gene expression, and having other cytoplasmic functions. It is not yet entirely clear what regulates the subcellular localisation of YAP and TAZ in the developing vasculature. ECs at the sprouting front and in more mature vessels have different adherens junctions, experience distinct levels of signalling from secreted angiogenic molecules and are exposed to different levels of shear stress by blood flow. In vitro, endothelial YAP and TAZ relocate to the nucleus upon disruption of cell junctions or loss of VE-Cadherin (shown for YAP by Choi and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2015</xref>) and confirmed in our analysis also for TAZ, data not shown). In the mouse retina vasculature, Cao and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2017</xref>) recently observed that endothelial cells at the sprouting front display reduced relative VE-Cadherin concentration that promotes cell-cell junction dynamics and JAIL formation. These observations nicely correlate with our own data showing the sprouting front as the area of preferential nuclear YAP/TAZ. Furthermore, we did not find junctional localisation of YAP/TAZ at the sprouting front, pointing to less sequestration of YAP/TAZ away from the nucleus by more dynamics junctions. Together, these data provide additional strength to a model in which reduced VE-Cadherin concentration at cell junctions may promote YAP and TAZ relocation to the nucleus. In zebrafish, Nakajima and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakajima et al., 2017</xref>) showed that YAP nuclear relocation correlated with lumenisation of sprouting vessels, and they attributed this to the effect of shear stress on YAP. In the mouse retina, hemodynamic fluid laws predict that vessels at the sprouting front experience very low levels of shear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernabeu et al., 2014</xref>), arguing against YAP and TAZ being activated by shear in this model. Additionally, we found no difference in the subcellular localisation of YAP or TAZ between arteries and veins, that is, vessels that experience distinct shear stress levels. However, it is possible that local and fast changes in shear stress levels are more relevant to regulate YAP and TAZ than sustained shear. In support of this idea, YAP and TAZ appear not to respond to 12 or 24 hr of laminar shear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), but translocate to the nucleus after only 10 min of laminar shear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakajima et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, although VEGF, a pro-angiogenic molecule secreted by astrocytes at the avascular front, drives endothelial proliferation and migration, we found no evidence for VEGF induced YAP and TAZ nuclear translocation, although others found opposite results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Other pro-angiogenic molecules, either locally produced or blood-borne, could regulate endothelial YAP and TAZ during development; future work will help clarify these questions and how different chemical and mechanical stimuli come together to regulate YAP and TAZ.</p><p>To address the cell autonomous role of YAP and TAZ we took advantage of an endothelial specific inducible Cre to inactivate YAP and/or TAZ genetically during angiogenesis. The mild phenotype of the single mutants in comparison to the drastic phenotype of the compound mutant indicates functional redundancy in the endothelium. The compound loss of endothelial YAP and TAZ leads in the mouse retina to a decrease in the radial expansion of vessels, vascular density, branching and sprouting. This phenotype could be a consequence of a decreased number of ECs caused by a proliferation defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ubezio et al., 2016</xref>). However, our further discovery that YAP and TAZ are required to establish homogeneity in the plexus and prevent cellular aggregations suggests that endothelial YAP/TAZ signalling is not only required to provide adequate numbers of cells but is also critically involved in ensuring adequate EC distribution. We propose that endothelial YAP/TAZ operate in several mechanisms that jointly establish a balance of the right number of endothelial cells in the right place. First, endothelial YAP/TAZ drive proliferation in response to mechanical stimulation at the cell-cell junction, and not in response to VEGF. We propose that in this way endothelial YAP/TAZ provide a cell intrinsic mechanism of locally controlling cell densities, in contrast to growth factor-mediated cell proliferation instructed by the surrounding tissue. Second, endothelial YAP/TAZ increase VE-Cadherin turnover at cell-cell junctions, which we propose is essential for cells to migrate and rearrange while maintaining the endothelial barrier at the same time. This corroborates recent findings in mouse hepatocytes where YAP antagonises adherens junction stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2016</xref>). The authors showed that YAP regulates hepatocyte adherens junctions in response to increased actomyosin contractility by increasing myosin II light chain gene expression. Accordingly, the transcriptional, nuclear role of YAP was required for junctional regulation. Together with our observations, these findings indicate the existence of a positive feedback loop where stable junctions sequester YAP and TAZ from the nucleus, therefore maintaining less junctional turnover, while remodelling junctions allow YAP and TAZ to relocate to the nucleus where they increase VE-Cadherin turnover. Our results also suggest that a high VE-Cadherin turnover at the sprouting front is required in order to maintain junctional integrity and prevent bleedings. YAP and TAZ increase the presence of JAIL (the more dynamic type of junction in our analysis) and promote branching of actin. These results are in accordance with recent data from Sakabe and colleagues reporting that YAP and TAZ increase Cdc42 activity in lamellipodia and phosphorylation of N-WASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sakabe et al., 2017</xref>), an actin binding protein that promotes branching of actin through the activation of the Arp2/3 complex.</p><p>Molecularly, how YAP and TAZ affect this complex cell behavior is not entirely clear. Our results identify that endothelial YAP/TAZ reduce the expression of Notch and BMP signaling in ECs, yet the in vitro rescue attempts show that the Notch increase is not the reason for the YAP/TAZ phenotype. This is further corroborated by in vivo data from Kim and colleagues showing that DAPT treatment fails to restore sprouting defects in YAP/TAZ mutant retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, reducing the increased BMP signalling experimentally corrected the permeability, and partially restored cell migration in YAP/TAZ deficient cells. This would suggest that BMP, not Notch, is a main driver of the observed cellular phenotypes. Whether the increased BMP signalling is also responsible for the phenotypes of YAP/TAZ loss of function in vivo remains to be shown. Furthermore, the full details of the involved ligands and receptors of the BMP pathway remain to be determined. Previous studies identified that BMP9/10 – Alk1 signalling is anti-angiogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larrivée et al., 2012</xref>), while BMP2/4/6 - Alk2/Alk3 signalling is pro-angiogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Given the hyposprouting phenotype and reduced cell migration, we expected an increase in BMP9/10-Alk1 signalling after YAP/TAZ loss. However, the results from the panel of BMP inhibitors instead point towards a possible increase of the BMP2/4 – ALK3 pathway activity. However, given the notorious promiscuity of chemical inhibitors, and the different cellular context in which they are tested, this result should be seen as an indication at best. Further studies will need to address the nature of the BMP ligand/receptors and how the deregulated BMP signalling affects endothelial cell migration and adherens junctions in the context of YAP/TAZ deficiency.</p><p>Together, our results identify a role for YAP/TAZ in promoting endothelial cellular rearrangements through the regulation of junctional turnover and collectiveness of cell migration. Conceptually, linking stretch-induced proliferation (to balance cell numbers) with modulation of junctional turnover (to facilitate cell rearrangements) seems ideally suited to achieve the required balance of cell distribution for functional vascular patterning.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Taz <sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gruber et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>Pdgfb-iCreERT2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Claxton et al., 2008</xref>). A detailed description of the knock-in mice overexpressing the TAZ gain-of-function allele will be provided elsewhere. Briefly, <italic>3xFLAG-TAZ<sup>S89A</sup>-IRES-nEGFP</italic> with a preceding floxed STOP cassette was knocked into the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus. Cre-mediated removal of the STOP sequence leads to CAG promoter-driven expression of 3xFLAG-tagged TAZ<sup>S89A</sup> as well as of nuclear-localized enhanced green fluorescence protein (nEGFP). The allele was kept heterozygous in the experimental studies and was developed together with genOway.</p><p>Mice were maintained at the London Research Institute and at the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine (loss of function mice) and at the Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research (gain of function mice) under standard husbandry conditions. To induce Cre-mediated recombination 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma, 7904) was injected intraperitoneally (IP) (20 μL/g of 1 mg/mL solution) at postnatal day 1 and day 3 and eyes were collected at P6. In all loss and gain of function experiments control animals were littermate animals without Cre expression. Male and female mice were used for the analysis.</p><p>For endothelial cell proliferation assessment in the retina, mouse pups were injected IP 2 hours before culling with 20 uL/g of EdU solution (0.5 mg/mL; Thermo Fischer Scientific, C10340).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HUVECs from pooled donors (PromoCell) were cultured in EGM2-Bulletkit without antibiotics (Lonza) and used until passage 6. For YAP and TAZ gain of function experiments HUVECs were obtained from Lonza, cultured in endothelial basal medium (Lonza) supplemented with hydrocortisone (1 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>), bovine brain extract (12 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>), gentamicin (50 μg ml−1), amphotericin B (50 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>), epidermal growth factor (10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) and used until passage 4. The manufacturers authenticated the identity of HUVECs by flow cytometry for cell-type specific markers (vWF, CD31, CD105) and by functional analysis (cells positive for acetylated low density lipoprotein uptake). All cells were tested negative for mycoplasma.</p><p>For knockdown experiments, HUVECs were transfected with SMARTpool: siGENOME siRNAs purchased from Dharmacon (Yap #M-012200-00-0005, Taz #M-016083-00-0005, VE-Cadherin #M-003641-01-0005 and non-targeting siRNA Pool 1 #D001206-13-05). Briefly, subconfluent (70–80%) HUVECs were transfected with 25 nM siRNA using Dharmafect 1 transfection reagent following the protocol from the manufacturer; transfection media was removed after 24 hr and experiments were routinely performed on the third day after transfection.</p><p>To activate YAP and TAZ signalling in ECs, FLAG-YAP<sup>S127A</sup>- or 3x-FLAG-TAZ<sup>S89A</sup>-encoding adenoviruses were generated in the adenoviral type five backbone lacking the E1/E3 genes (Vector Biolabs). GFP-encoding adenoviruses were used as a control. Infections were carried out by incubating sub-confluent HUVECs (70–80%) with starvation media (EBM containing 0.1% BSA) for 4 hr followed by the addition of adenoviral particles and polybrene (Santa Cruz). After 4 hr, HUVECs were washed with Hanks Buffer for at least five times and then cultured in complete EBM media with 10% FCS and supplements overnight. All experiments were performed 24 hr post transduction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunofluorescence staining</title><p>To perform retina immunofluorescence, eyes were collected from postnatal day six mice and fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for 1 hr at 4C. Retinas were dissected in PBS and permeabilised/blocked for 1 hr at room temperature in 1% BSA, 2% FBS, 0.5% Triton X100, 0.01% Na deoxycholate and 0,02% Na Azide in PBS. Primary and secondary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4C and for 2 hr at room temperature, respectively, both in 1:1 PBS: blocking buffer. Isolectin staining was performed overnight at 4C in Pblec after retinas were equilibrated for 1 hr in Pblec at room temperature. Retinas were post-stained fixed in 2% PFA in PBS for 10 min. To mount the samples Vectashield mounting medium. (Vector Labs, H1000) or ProLong Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used. Imaging was done by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss LSM700, LSM780 and Leica TCS SP8). Processing of samples was carried out in tissues from littermates under the same conditions.</p><p>For immunofluorescence in HUVECs, cells were grown in #1.5 coverslips coated with poly-lysine and gelatin 0.2%. At the end of the experiment cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min, permeabilised in 0.3% Triton-X100 in blocking buffer for 5 min and blocked in 1% BSA 20 mM Glycine in PBS for 30 min. Primary and secondary antibodies were incubated for 2 and 1 hr, respectively, in blocking buffer. Nuclei labeling was performed by incubating cells with DAPI for 5 min (Life technologies, D1306).</p><p>A list of the primary antibodies used can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Analysis of radial expansion, capillary density, branching frequency, proliferating ECs, apoptosis and sprouting numbers was done using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Radial expansion corresponds to the mean distance from the optic nerve to the sprouting front (eight measurements in tilescans of two whole retinas per animal). Capillary density corresponds to the vessel area (measured by thresholding IB4 signal) divided by the field of view area (6–8 images of (425 µm)<sup>2</sup> between artery and vein per animal). Branching frequency was measured by manually counting all branching points in a field of view (4–5 images of (200 µm)<sup>2</sup> between artery and vein per animal). The plexus regularity was assessed through the standard deviation of the size and the circularity of the vascular loops in the plexus (using same images as for analysis of capillary density). Vascular loops were segmented by thresholding the IB4 signal to avoid artifacts we excluded loops with a size smaller than 86 um^2 for the analysis. Endothelial proliferation was measured by manually counting the number of EdU positive endothelial nuclei (ERG positive) and dividing by the vessel area (measured by thresholding IB4 signal) (4 images of (425 µm)<sup>2</sup> containing the sprouting front and localized on top of arteries per animal). Apoptosis was measured manually by counting the number of cleaved caspase 3 positive figures and dividing by the vessel area (measured by thresholding IB4 signal) (tilescan of one whole retina per animal). The number of sprouts was measured manually (3 images of 425 × 850 µm of the sprouting front per animal). To quantify DLL4 intensity the outline of the sprouting front and the position of the arteries were manually defined using IB4 staining. Vessels were segmented by thresholding the IB4 staining in Fiji. Then, DLL4 intensity inside the vasculature was normalised with the average DLL4 intensity outside of the vasculature. Subsequently, for every pixel inside the vasculature (excluding the arteries) the distance to the sprouting front was calculated. The normalised DLL4 values within each bin were averaged (15 µm bins from 0 to 500 µm). For each retina quarter a curve was obtained, and the average and SEM of these curves was shown in the graph (one retina quarter was used per animal). To quantify pSMAD1/5/8 status the number of pSMAD1/5/8 positive endothelial nuclei was manually counted and dividing by the total number of endothelial nuclei (defined by being ERG positive) (3 images of (225 µm)<sup>2</sup> containing the sprouting front were used per animal).</p><p>To analyse YAP/TAZ subcellular localisation in HUVECs we adapted a previously existing cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation assay pipeline from Cell Profiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carpenter et al., 2006</xref>). Briefly, YAP or TAZ staining intensity was measured both inside the nucleus of the cell and in a 12 pixels wide ring of cytoplasm grown radially from the nucleus. The nucleus localisation was determined using a DAPI mask.</p><p>Cell junction morphology analysis was done in confluent monolayers of HUVECs stained for VE-Cadherin. Five morphological categories were defined: straight, thick, thick to reticular, reticular and fingers. We acquired 5 images of (160 µm)<sup>2</sup> per condition per experiment, divided each image in (16 µm)<sup>2</sup> patches, and randomly grouped these patches. The classification into categories was done manually and blindly for the condition.</p><p>To analyse cell coordination we used confluent cells labelled for DAPI. The nuclei were automatically segmented using a customized Python algorithm relying on the Scikit Image Library. By fitting an ellipse to each nucleus we obtained its major and minor axis, and the angle of the major axis with the x-axis of the image was assigned to the nucleus as its orientation. This way each nucleus in the images was assigned a position given by its midpoint and an orientation. Next we analyzed the average alignment of the nuclei of two cells depending on their distance. As the nuclei don't have a directionality (i.e. they are nematics as opposed to vectors), the angles between two nuclei range from 0 corresponding to the nuclei being parallel, to π<italic>/2</italic> corresponding to them spanning a right angle. For any two cells in each image we calculated the angle and the Euclidean distance between them, and then we binned the cells depending on their distance. We introduced a parameter called 'alignment' which is one if all cells are perfectly aligned and 0 for a completely random distribution of cell orientations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Live imaging of VE-Cadherin-EGFP</title><p>24 hr after siRNA transfection, knockdown HUVECs were transduced with VE-cadherin-EGFP adenovirus as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bentley et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, cells were incubated with the virus for 24 hr and then washed three times to remove viral particles. Cells were replated onto 2-well LabTek chambered coverslips (Nunc) coated with 10 ug/mL Fibronectin (Sigma, F1141). Imaging was performed 48 hr post-transduction. Cells were imaged at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> on LSM 780 (Zeiss) using a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 oil objective. Images were acquired at a 260 s time frame.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>VEGF treatment and YAP/TAZ staining</title><p>Confluent HUVECs were maintained in VEGF free media for 24 hr. VEGF treatment was then performed for 30 min, 1 hr and 3 hr with 0 or 40 ng/mL of VEGF-165 (PrepoTech, 450–32). Immunofluorescence staining and analysis of YAP and TAZ subcellular localisation was performed as above described.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>VEGF treatment and proliferation assessment</title><p>Knockdown HUVECs were maintained in VEGF free media for 24 hr. VEGF treatment was then performed for 24 hr with 0 ng/mL, 40 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL or 1000 ng/mL of VEGF-165. Cells were pelleted, ressuspended in 90% cold Methanol and stored at −20C° before further processing. Cells were then ressuspended in Propidium Iodide/RNase staining solution (Cell signaling, 4087) for 30 min before cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry (LSRII, BD). Data was analysed using BD FACSDiva software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mechanical stretch application and proliferation assessment</title><p>HUVECs were plated on collagen I - 0.2% gelatine-coated Bioflex plates (BF-3001C, Flexcell International Corporation). Gene knockdown was preformed as previously described. Cells were incubated in transfection media for 24 hr, and allowed to recover in fresh complete media for 4 hr. Afterwards cells were incubated for 24 hr in serum starvation media (0,1%BSA in EBM2 pure media) to form a confluent, quiescent monolayer. Cyclic stretch (0.25 Hz, 15% elongation) was then applied for 24 hr using a Flexcell FX-5000 Tension System. Control cells were placed in the same incubator but not on the Flexcell device (static conditions). EdU pulsing was performed after 20 hr of the 24 hr stretch period. At the end of the experiment cells were fixed in 4% PFA and EdU staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Click-It EdU C10340 Life Technologies). Nuclei were labelled with DAPI. Three regions of interested were acquired per sample in a Carl Zeiss LSM700 scanning confocal microscopes (Zeiss, Germany). Quantification of proliferation was done using a CellProfiler pipeline. Percentage of S phase cells was determined as percentage of EdU positive nuclei over the total number of nuclei.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Permeability assay</title><p>24 hr after siRNA transfection cells were re-plated into fibronectin coated Transwell membranes (Costar 3460) at confluence and incubated for two more days to stabilize cell junctions. On the third day after transfection 0.5 mg/mL of 250 kDa FITC Dextran in cell media (Sigma FD250) was added to the top well. Fluorescence on the bottom well was measured after 6 hr in a Gemini XPS fluorescent plate reader.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Pulse chase VE-Cadherin experiment for quantification of low, intermediate and high turnover junctions</title><p>Cells were labelled live with a non-blocking monoclonal antibody directed against extracellular VE-Cadherin and directly coupled with Alexa-Fluor647 (BD Pharmingen, #561567, 1:200) for 30 min. Cells were then washed 2x with PBS and incubated with complete media for additional 2 hr. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA and stained for VE-Cadherin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #6458, 1:200) with a secondary antibody coupled with Alexa-Fluor-488. 5 (160µm)<sup>2</sup> images per condition per experiment were acquired in a Carl Zeiss LSM700 confocal laser scanning microscope using the same acquisition settings. Max projection of z stack and merging of channels was done in Fiji. Images were divided in (16 µm)<sup>2</sup> patches and the patches were randomly grouped. Patches were classified into a morphological category and into low, intermediate or high turnover categories, manually and blindly for the condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>VE-cadherin mEos3.2 cloning</title><p>mEos3.2 cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) was cloned downstream of full-length human VE-cadherin with a short linker (ARDPPV) and inserted into pAc-GFP-N1 backbone (Clontech) using NEBbuilder HiFi Assembly mix (NEB).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Fluorescent loss after photoconversion experiments</title><p>HUVECs double-transfected with YAP/TAZ or scrambled siRNAs and pN1-CMV-VE-cadherin-mEos3.2 were cultured to confluency in 2-well LabTek chambered coverslips (Nunc) coated with 10 ug/mL Fibronectin (Sigma, F1141) in EGM (Promocell) supplemented with EGM2 bulletkit (Lonza). Cells were imaged at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> on LSM 780 (Zeiss) equipped with Definite Focus stabilizer. Imaging was performed using the 488 nm (green mEos3.2 component) and the 561 nm (red component) lasers using Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 oil objective, 0.26 × 0.26 µm pixel size and 5.09 µs pixel dwell time, 16-bit image depth. A circular region of interest (ROI) of 21 µm<sup>2</sup> area was selected on straight junctions and photoconverted using the 405 nm laser. Mean fluorescence intensity in the ROI was monitored in the red channel for 15 min with 10 s resolution, while the movement of the junction was followed in the green channel.</p><p>Background signal in each frame was estimated by measuring mean intensity in non-photoconverted region and subtracted from the fluorescence-loss curves. The curves were further corrected for bleaching, using parameters estimated from fixed cells. The curves were normalized between the mean intensity in the frames before photoconversion and fluorescence intensity measured immediately after photoconversion. Normalized curves were smoothed using the moving average method; the half-time of redistribution and immobile fraction of VE-cadherin were estimated directly from the plots. Only junctions which did not substantially move or remodel during the observation time were considered for analysis. Analysis was performed using Fiji and Matlab (Mathworks).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Scratch wound assay</title><p>24 hr after siRNA transfection cells were re-plated into a scratch wound assay device (IBIDI).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Reinhard Fässler (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Guido Serini (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors report that YAP/TAZ activity is mechanically regulated in endothelial cells. This regulation of YAP/TAZ in turn controls EC proliferation and migration, VE-cadherin turnover, and Notch and BMP signalling. The reviewers spent quite a bit of time reviewing and then discussing this paper, in part because some of the findings were already published (Kim et al. JCI). However, the reviewers concluded that work on the role of YAP/TAZ in vascular biology is important, particularly since it was carried out in vivo (with loss and gain of function models) and reaches slightly different conclusions than the published work by Kim et al. Based on this discussion the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help prepare a revised submission. We hope it will be possible to submit the revised version within two to three months.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is stated in the manuscript that &quot;VEGF treatment did not alter the subcellular localisation of YAP and TAZ in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that VEGF is not a primary regulator of their activity&quot;. The lack of a link between VEGF and YAP/TAZ activation could be due to the experimental design. The Materials and methods say that &quot;Confluent HUVECs were maintained in VEGF free media for 24h. VEGF treatment was then performed for 6h with 0ng/mL, 4ng/mL, 20ng/mL or 100ng/mL of VEGF-165&quot;.</p><p>The VEGF treatment is probably too long to see an effect on YAP/TAZ translocation. It was previously reported that 30 min treatment with a prototypical growth factor, such as EGF, induces YAP nuclear accumulation in MCF-10A cells (Fan et al., PNAS 2013; 110: 2569-2574). Furthermore, Kim et al. treated HUVECs for 30 min, as did Wang et al. in their paper (Developmental Cell, 2017). Hence, we propose to repeat the VEGF treatment for shorter periods (30 min, 1hr, 3hrs), quantify nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ by co-staining with a nuclear marker, and compare and discuss the findings against the published results.</p><p>2) The VE-cadherin turnover needs to be better analysed. There is a body of evidence in the literature demonstrating that VE-cadherin internalization is key to increase vascular permeability in vitro and in vivo (Gavard and Gutkind, Nat. Cell Biol. 2006, 8:1223-1234; Gavard et al., Dev. Cell 2008, 14:25-36; Dwyer et al., Oncogene 2011, 30:190-200; Orsenigo et al., Nat. Commun. 2012, 3:1208; Yoshioka et al., Nat. Med. 2012, 18:1560-1569; Wessel, F. et al., Nat. Immunol. 2014, 15:223-230; Dorland et al., Nat. Commun. 2016, 7:12210; Di Russo et al., EMBO J. 2017, 36: 183-201). The observation that YAP/TAZ knockdown would increase endothelial cell permeability and at the same time reduce VE-cadherin endocytosis appears difficult to be reconciled in light of the above mentioned papers.</p><p>The problem is that pulse-chase experiments provide only a semi-quantitative analysis of the VE-cadherin turnover at cell-cell contacts rather than a quantitative analysis VE-cadherin endocytosis or recycling. FRAP experiments may be a more precise quantitative approach to evaluate VE-cadherin turnover at cell-cell junctions in YAP/TAZ-depleted HUVECs. We also advise to characterise the colocalization of VE-cadherin with markers of early and/or late endosomes, such as EEA1 or LAMP1, respectively.</p><p>3) We find the YAP/TAZ link interesting, although such a link has recently been proposed by Totaro et al. (2017). The role of Notch and its epistatic relationship with YAP and/or TAZ should be somehow tackled experimentally, at least in vitro, and demonstrated not in all but at least in few key experiments. There are good reagents to manipulate Notch in cell culture and to couple it as downstream effector of YAP/TAZ (at least partially). The authors should also consider to test whether Notch serves as a mechanical mediator of (some) YAP/TAZ biology for endothelial cells.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;YAP and TAZ regulate adherens junction dynamics and endothelial cell distribution during vascular development&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

(1) and Wang et al. (2), we repeated the experiments using the shorter periods of treatment as suggested by the reviewers and quantified translocation of YAP/TAZ by co-staining with the nuclear marker DAPI. We also noticed on reviewing our experiments that we were not using 0-4-20-100ng/mL as stated, but instead 0-40-200-1000ng/mL of VEGF-165, which we corrected in the manuscript accordingly. We therefore repeated the staining for YAP and TAZ using 40ng/mL VEGF-165 concentration, as this was most equivalent to the concentration used in the referred papers (50ng/mL), and evaluated YAP/TAZ nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio after 30 min, 1h and 3h treatment.

(1) also used HUVECs – confluent conditions – EBM2 Lonza media, cells cultured in gelatine – starvation 24h pure EBM2). However, we cannot exclude differences due to the nature or source of VEGF used. We used a commercial VEGF (murine VEGF165 from Prepotech) (and confirmed it’s bioactivity by WB to pVEGFR2/VEGF and pERK/ERK – not shown), while in Kim et al. (1) the origin of the VEGF is not specified and in Wang et al. (2) the VEGF used comes from Carmeliet’s lab. It is possible then that the source of VEGF is critical to interpret these conflicting results. Without the missing information on nature (isoform) and source of VEGF in the papers by Wang and Kim, it will not be possible to test the reproducibility of their results. Critically, we find that despite the clear activation of VEGFR2 we see no evidence for activation of YAP or TAZ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The VE-cadherin turnover needs to be better analysed. There is a body of evidence in the literature demonstrating that VE-cadherin internalization is key to increase vascular permeability in vitro and in vivo (Gavard and Gutkind, Nat.

We also advise to characterise the colocalization of VE-cadherin with markers of early and/or late endosomes, such as EEA1 or LAMP1, respectively.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we performed quantitative analysis of the VE-Cadherin turnover by fluorescence loss after photoconversion. When evaluating the best method to quantify VE-Cadherin turnover, we discovered that FRAP suffers from uncertainty when junctions move during the measurement. This happens frequently in endothelial cells. Therefore, we established VE-Cadherin tagged with photoconvertible mEos, allowing to quantify the loss of fluorescence after conversion of a subset of molecules, whilst monitoring location of the unconverted molecules. Using this method, we observed an increase in the immobile fraction of VE-Cadherin at the junction after YAP/TAZ knockdown (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This result corroborates and explains our previous observations in the pulse-chase experiments that showed decreased VE-Cadherin turnover.</p><p>As pointed out by the referees, our results showing increased permeability together with decreased endocytosis were surprising and conflicting with current concepts. To gain more insight into cause and potential mechanisms, we repeated the experiment as suggested, by doing co-staining with the endocytosis markers EEA1 and LAMP1.</p><p>To ensure that we studied internalised VE-Cadherin, we pulse labeled cells with the VE-cadherin 55/7H1 at 4C, allowed 30 min of internalization at 37C and performed an acid wash prior to fixing the cells to remove cell surface bound antibody. Acid wash treatment removed most of cell surface bound antibody, including junctional VE-Cadherin. In this baseline condition prior to challenging the junctions with calcium chelation, control and YAP/TAZ depleted cells showed no obvious differences in amount or localization of pulsed VE-cadherin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Calcium chelation with EGTA led to dramatic internalization of VE-Cadherin in control cells, but very little after knockdown of YAP and TAZ, confirming our previous results.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31037.039</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Acid wash treatment removes cell surface bound antibody.</title><p>HUVECs knocked down for YAP/TAZ (E-H) and control (A-D) were pulse labelled with VE-cadherin 55/7H1 for 30 mins at 4C and internalisation was allowed for 30 min at 37C in the presence of 5mM EGTA (B, D, F, H) or vehicle (A, C, E, G).

As such, instead of addressing VE-Cadherin endocytosis, these results instead suggest that in YAP/TAZ deficient cells adherens junctions are under less tension – either less actomyosin tension from the cytoskeleton or less linked to the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, Kim et al. reported reduced phospho-myosin light chain 2 staining, indicating reduced tension in YAP/TAZ depleted endothelial cells (1). Our own f-actin staining showed strongly reduced branched actin networks and increased bundled actin at junctions in YAP/TAZ deficient cells, consistent with the observed changes in junctional patterning (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Together, these new results provide no evidence for altered endocytosis of VE-Cadherin, but confirm the reduced VE-cadherin turnover associated with altered junctional morphology in YAP/TAZ deficient endothelial cells. We propose it is this altered morphology together with reduced junction plasticity that is the cause for increased permeability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) We find the YAP/TAZ link interesting, although such a link has recently been proposed by Totaro et al.

Similarly, when testing the hypothesis further, we found that the in vitro treatment of YAP/TAZ deficient cells with DBZ was able to rescue the Notch signalling increase, but did not rescue the migration defect in the scratch wound assay (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The fact that recent literature links stronger Notch activity to reduced endothelial permeability (6), and yet we find increased permeability in YAP/TAZ loss of function conditions, also raises doubts whether the observed Notch increase is indeed a driver of the YAP/TAZ phenotype. Thus Notch signalling may not be the critical signalling pathway downstream of YAP/TAZ regulating behaviour in endothelial cells.</p><p>We then tested if the strong increase in BMP signalling in YAP/TAZ deficient cells was responsible for the phenotype. We found that a partial rescue in BMP signalling in vitroimproved the cell migration defect and corrected the permeability defect; it also rescued the increase in finger junctions in YAP/TAZ deficient cells. As we could not completely rescue the signalling deregulation in YAP/TAZ deficient cells, we can only conclude from our experiments that BMP signalling is at least partially responsible for the phenotype of YAP/TAZ loss. Our microarray data on YAP and TAZ gain of function mutant cells further showed that YAP and TAZ regulate the transcription of several BMP inhibitors, providing a plausible mechanistic link between YAP/TAZ and BMP signalling.

In light of a recent paper published by the Schnittler lab in Nat. Commun., 2017, we would appreciate if you make the following changes in the text:</p></disp-quote><p>We have read and discussed the recent paper by the Schnittler lab in Nat. Comm. 2017 in depth in our team and we agree that it is an important piece of work, presenting data that relates to our own work and even supports our hypothesis. Specifically, Cao <italic>et al.</italic> were the first to identify the presence of junction associated intermediate lamellipodia (JAIL) in sprouting endothelial cells in vivo, thereby expanding the significance of these structures that to our knowledge had only been studied in cultured cells before, and so proving that their existence is not only an adaptation to the artificial in vitro culture system. Importantly, Cao <italic>et al.</italic> show that JAILs are present in sprouting endothelial cells (of the mouse retina and in the developing yolk sac), while they were not found in mature vessels. This strongly suggests that JAILs are characteristic of newly forming and highly dynamic angiogenic blood vessels. Therefore, the data from Cao <italic>et al.</italic> and our present work together would support a model in which decreased VE-Cadherin content at sprouting endothelial cells drives YAP and TAZ to the nucleus, where they increase the turnover of VE-Cadherin and increase the formation of JAILs, promoting cell migration and rearrangements. We have now included the reference Cao <italic>et al.</italic> 2017 and discuss the implications.</p><p>However, the very specific instructions of what to place in the Introduction of our manuscript and of adopting the terminology from Cao <italic>et al.</italic> throughout are problematic. After very careful consideration, we strongly feel that it is not appropriate or in the best interest of science to do so. In the following we explain our concerns and provide a point-by-point response:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Explain in the Introduction section that two classes of VE-cadherin-based adhesions exist: adherent junctions (characterizing endothelial cells of mature and already formed blood vessels) and JAILs (typical of endothelial cells of newly forming and very dynamic angiogenic blood vessels).</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t agree with this classification of VE-Cadherin based adhesions. Cell-cell junctions belong to one of three main categories: adherens junctions (AJ), tight junctions (TJ) and desmosomes. While in epithelial cells AJ and TJ are spatially separated, in the endothelium, with its characteristic flatness, this is not the case. In spite of that, AJ can be defined not only by (7) their spatial location in cell but also by (8) their molecular composition – the main components of adherens junctions are the cadherin molecules. Depending on the type of cell, AJ assume different morphologies: in polarised epithelial AJ is also called adhesion belt as it completely encloses the cells along with the F-actin lining; in fibroblasts AJ are discontinuous, and in neurons they are organized into tiny puncta as a constituent of the synaptic junctions (7). AJ in endothelial cells have been extensively studied and it was observed that there are different morphologies in endothelial cells – A) continuous/ linear/ straight junctions B), discontinuous/ fingers/serrated junctions and more recently also C) JAILs (8) (for illustration see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>). We therefore place JAIL as a subcategory of AJ, and not as a new category of VE-Cadherin based adhesions. These distinct morphological categories are associated with actin filaments in particular ways: continuous junctions overlap a bundled actin filament, discontinuous junctions are linked to actin filaments perpendicular to the junction border, and JAIL are linked to branched actin on the dependence of ARP2/3 activity. How these morphologies relate to the behaviour of the endothelial cells has been extensively investigated along with their description, but not often in vivo. Studies in the developing mouse retina vasculature have shown that continuous/ linear/ straight junctions were associated with stalk cell behaviour, while discontinuous/ fingers/serrated junctions were found in tip cells or actively rearranging cells (9). To this model, the new data from Cao <italic>et al.</italic> adds JAIL as a new category characteristic of sprouting, actively rearranging cells [added to the manuscript in line 210, highlighted in red]. A general new categorisation that sets JAIL apart from AJ would seem premature and we feel it is more correct to add JAIL as a new subcategory of AJ.</p><fig id="respfig4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31037.041</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31037-resp-fig4-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Adopt the Schnittler nomenclature throughout the manuscript by re-defining their &quot;reticular junctions&quot; as &quot;large JAILs&quot; and &quot;thick to reticular junctions&quot; as &quot;small JAILs&quot; (as also mentioned by authors in subsection “YAP/TAZ regulate adherens junction morphology and stability”). This will allow readers to more easily compare the complementary concepts exposed in these manuscripts.</p></disp-quote><p>An aspect that was raised already during this work and more so with this revision request it that the field of vascular biology will highly benefit from a consensus in nomenclature for adherens junctional categories. However, we believe it is important to most accurately describe the data in the Results section, without binning them into categories with assumed functions. For that reason, we defined the categories in morphological terms. Only subsequently, with live imaging, we were able to correspond thick to reticular and reticular junctions as small and large JAIL.</p><p>One important and novel aspect shown by Cao <italic>et al.</italic> by the use of live imaging is that these categories are not static. In fact, JAILs develop on top of continuous/ linear/ straight junctions and also on top of discontinuous/ fingers/ serrated junctions. In our work however, we characterized the morphology of AJ based on static data only. Because of this, we also caught what by live imaging data are clearly intermediate morphologies – as thick junctions and thick to reticular junctions.</p><p>In the paper from Cao <italic>et al.,</italic> endothelial cells are polarised by means of scratching a monolayer or by treatment with VEGF, so that they display lateral junctions and leading and trailing edge junctions. Cao <italic>et al.</italic> observed that, in polarised endothelial cells, lateral junctions associated with small JAIL and leading edge junctions associated with large JAIL. In our manuscript however, we did not analyse VE-Cadherin morphologies after polarising cells, so they do not display lateral and polar junctions. Our thick to reticular/small JAILs can be fully developed JAIL of smaller size or a developing or retracting JAIL or larger size. In this sense, adopting the Schnittlernomenclature would be overreaching the data – when we refer to small and large JAILs we refer to the size only, whereas they refer to a location in a polarized cell that is associated either with straight junctions or fingers (small JAIL – lateral junction – develops on top of straight junction and large JAIL – leading edge junction – develops on top of fingers). We propose that it is best to retain the strict morphology categories that can be directly connected to what the reader can see in the Results section. However, to embed the findings and provide functional interpretation and discussion, we refer to JAIL as discussion points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Mention that the preferential nuclear YAP/TAZ localization in endothelial cells of the sprouting front of the developing retinal vasculature nicely fit with the observation reported by Cao et al.
