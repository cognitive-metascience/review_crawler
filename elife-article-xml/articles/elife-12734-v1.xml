Here, we identify novel intrinsic regulators of axon regeneration: poly(ADP-ribose) glycohodrolases (PARGs) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). PARGs, which remove poly(ADP-ribose) from proteins, act in injured <italic>C. elegans</italic> GABA motor neurons to enhance axon regeneration. PARG expression is regulated by DLK signaling, and PARGs mediate DLK function in enhancing axon regeneration. Conversely, PARPs, which add poly(ADP-ribose) to proteins, inhibit axon regeneration of both <italic>C. elegans</italic> GABA neurons and mammalian cortical neurons. Furthermore, chemical PARP inhibitors improve axon regeneration when administered after injury. Our results indicate that regulation of poly(ADP-ribose) levels is a critical function of the DLK regeneration pathway, that poly-(ADP ribosylation) inhibits axon regeneration across species, and that chemical inhibition of PARPs can elicit axon regeneration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12734.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12734.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12734.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons carry information around the body along slender projections known as axons. An injury that crushes or cuts an axon can lead to permanent disability if the axon fails to regenerate. While some damaged neurons in the body can repair themselves, typically those present in the brain and spinal cord cannot regenerate successfully after injury.</p><p>The ability of a neuron to regenerate its axon depends in part on factors present inside the neuron itself. By understanding how these internal mechanisms regulate axon regeneration, researchers hope to develop new ways to boost the repair of damaged neurons.</p><p>A protein called DLK acts inside neurons to promote regeneration of injured axons across a range of species including worms and mammals. In the absence of DLK, regeneration is impaired. The DLK signaling pathway is activated in damaged neurons and is thought to promote repair by altering the activity of genes and proteins that control the regeneration process.</p><p>Byrne et al. have now identified genes that are activated by the DLK signaling pathway in the roundworm, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. The experiments show that DLK signaling increases the activity of genes encoding enzymes known as PARGs, which in turn enhance axon regeneration. PARG enzymes remove chain-like molecules called poly(ADP-ribose) that are attached to target proteins.</p><p>Further experiments showed that other enzymes known as PARPs, which add the poly(ADP-ribose) markers to proteins, act to inhibit axon regeneration in both <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and in injured neurons from mice. Consistent with this, Byrne et al. found that drugs that inhibit PARP enzymes improved axon regeneration when they were given to <italic>C. elegans</italic> with injured neurons. These results suggest that a critical role of the DLK signaling pathway is to regulate poly(ADP-ribose) levels and that reducing the amount of poly(ADP-ribose) added to proteins can promote axon regeneration.</p><p>The next step is to understand exactly how poly(ADP-ribose) regulates axon regeneration and to identify the other factors – besides poly(ADP-ribose), PARGs and PARPs – that act downstream of DLK signalling to regulate regeneration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12734.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12734.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>axon regeneration</kwd><kwd>poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase</kwd><kwd>poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase</kwd><kwd>dlk-1/MAPKKK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Craig H.

Failure to regenerate has been attributed to two components of the regeneration response: intrinsic and extrinsic factors. While extrinsic inhibitory factors such as the glial microenvironment can be modulated with some success, regeneration potential is still substantially hindered, providing evidence that intrinsic factors play a significant role in modulating the ability of an axon to regenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Richardson et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Neumann and Woolf, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">GrandPré et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fournier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Qiu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yiu and He, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Smith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).

In worms, flies, and mice, the function of DLK signaling in regeneration depends on gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yan and Jin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stone et al., 2014</xref>). These data suggest that specific targets of DLK transcriptional regulation may mediate the ability of DLK signaling to promote regeneration. Further, these targets may identify novel aspects of the cell biology of axon regeneration.

RNA sequencing and analysis suggested the <italic>parg</italic> genes as candidates for further evaluation. The gene <italic>parg-2</italic> (poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase-2) was significantly upregulated in neurons with activated DLK signaling (187-fold upregulated in <italic>dlk-1(OE)</italic> vs <italic>wild type</italic>, p&lt;0.01, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Thus, axon regeneration defects in <italic>parg-1</italic> and <italic>parg-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) could be due to accumulation of PAR. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed regeneration in animals with reduced PAR. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome contains two PARP homologs, <italic>parp-1 and parp-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gagnon et al., 2002</xref>).

Regenerating axons in these assays include all those that initiate a migrating growth cone after injury. To determine whether axons in PARP mutants are capable of sustained growth toward their original target, we assessed ability to extend towards the dorsal nerve cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Therefore, we hypothesized that blocking PARP function might be sufficient to improve regeneration of mammalian CNS neurons. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of PARP knockdown on mouse cortical neuron regeneration. We cultured primary cortical mouse neurons in 96-well plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huebner et al., 2011</xref>). We subsequently added lentiviral control or one of two unique PARP1 shRNAs at three days in vitro (DIV), and injured the neurons with a custom pin-replicator five days later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huebner et al., 2011</xref>). Three days after injury, we fixed the neurons and assessed regeneration. We found that axons exposed to PARP1 shRNA regenerated significantly better than axons exposed to control shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). To confirm the shRNA clones targeted PARP1, we performed western blots on cortical neurons exposed to the negative control shRNA or to the two unique shRNA that target PARP1. In each case PARP was detected in the insoluble fraction and not in the lysate, in agreement with previously reported localization to the nucleus (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai, 2015</xref>). PARP was significantly reduced in neurons exposed to either of the PARP1-targeting shRNAs compared to negative control shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). PARP levels were normalized to actin levels in each sample of neurons. Therefore, PARP-1 and PARylation are conserved inhibitors of axon regeneration after injury, and reducing their function improves axon regeneration across species.</p><p>Having established that PARGs are novel regulators of axon regeneration, we sought to determine the extent to which DLK function is mediated by PARGs.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest the <italic>parg</italic> genes are transcriptionally regulated downstream of DLK signaling to promote regeneration. First, we find both of the <italic>parg</italic> genes are upregulated in animals with activated DLK signaling. Second, we find that endogenous <italic>dlk-1</italic> signaling drives <italic>parg-2</italic> expression in an injury-dependent manner. Third, we find that loss of the <italic>parg</italic> genes reduces regeneration, both in animals with endogenous levels of <italic>dlk-1</italic> activity and in animals with elevated DLK-1 signaling. These findings suggest a linear model in which DLK signaling induces <italic>parg</italic> expression, which in turn facilitates regeneration by removing PAR.</p><p>In addition to regulating PARylation, our data indicate that DLK signaling regulates regeneration upstream of multiple effectors. Although PARylation has a strong effect on regeneration in both animals with wild-type levels of <italic>dlk-1</italic> and in animals that overexpress <italic>dlk-1</italic>, some GABA axons in <italic>parg-1(lf) parg-2(lf)</italic> mutants are still able to regenerate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating high levels of PAR do not completely prevent DLK-mediated axon regeneration. By contrast, GABA axons do not regenerate in animals lacking DLK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hammarlund et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yan et al., 2009</xref>). These data suggest that DLK activity has other functions besides regulating PARylation. Some of these functions may be mediated by other transcriptional outputs of DLK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>). Understanding these factors, as well as understanding the cellular effects of PAR on regeneration, await further study.</p><p>Besides shedding light on functional outputs of DLK signaling, our findings identify a novel pathway, involving control of poly(ADP-ribose) levels, that regulates axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Specifically, we find that PARG and PARP activity regulate the acute response of neurons to axon injury, and that chemical PARP inhibition after injury is sufficient to improve regeneration. The lack of additive phenotype in the double loss of function <italic>parg-1(-); parg-2(-)</italic> mutant suggests the two <italic>parg</italic> genes are not partially redundant. Rather, <italic>parg-1</italic> and <italic>parg-2</italic> may function together, for example as part of a complex. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, the two <italic>PARG</italic> homologs physically interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Song et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting the <italic>PARG</italic> homologs may function coordinately. Alternatively, concerted action of both PARGs may be required to maintain PAR levels below a threshold. In this model, loss of either single PARG results in a sufficient PAR increase to block regeneration, but increasing PAR beyond this threshold does not further reduce regeneration.</p><p>Previous investigations of the relationship between the two <italic>C. elegans parg</italic> homologs have been complicated by the physical proximity of the two genes in the genome. As a result, double loss of function mutants have been generated using RNAi. Since RNAi can result in incomplete knockdown of target genes, it has been difficult to determine the functional redundancy of the two genes using this approach. The <italic>parg-1; parg-2</italic> mutant described here may be useful for further characterization of animals that completely lack PARG function.</p><p>In vivo, injured mammalian axons must overcome extrinsic growth inhibition to regenerate. PARP1 is upregulated in murine cortical neurons exposed to inhibitory growth molecules (myelin-associated glycoprotein, Nogo-A, Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans) in vitro and in crushed optic nerves in vivo. Moreover, inhibiting PARP1 promotes neurite outgrowth on inhibitory substrates in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brochier et al., 2015</xref>). Since PARPs and PARGs have contrasting effects on PAR levels, NAD+ levels, which are substrates of PAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai, 2015</xref>), and on axon regeneration, we conclude the balance between PARP and PARG function regulates axon regeneration, and present the hypothesis the PARG-PARP balance may determine axon regeneration by regulating PAR levels or by regulating NAD+ levels. Finally, the conservation of the role of PARP in mammalian axon regeneration may have important implications for nerve repair following injury or disease.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains</title><p>Strains were maintained as previously described at 20°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Primary cortical cultures were established from E17 C57BL/6 mice. Digested cells were plated on 96-well poly-D-lysine coated plates at a density of 25,000 cells per well in 200 µL of plating medium. Lentiviral particles encoding control non-targeting or PARP1 shRNA clones (Sigma) were added on DIV3 (Day In Vitro 3) as described for other shRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zou et al., 2015</xref>). On DIV8, 96-well cultures were scraped using a custom-fabricated 96-pin array and allowed to regenerate for another 72 hr before fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde. Regenerating axons in the scrape zone were visualized using an antibody against β3 tubulin (1:2000, mouse monoclonal; catalog #G712A; Promega). Growth cones were visualized by staining for F-actin using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (1:2000, catalog #R415, Life Technologies). Cell density was visualized using nuclear marker DAPI (0.1 μg/mL, catalog #4083, Cell Signaling Technology). Images were taken on a 10X objective in an automated high-throughput imager (ImageXpress Micro XLS, Molecular Devices) under identical conditions. Regeneration zone identification, image thresholding and quantitation were performed using an automated MATLAB script in a fully automated fashion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Synapse analysis</title><p>The synapse marker <italic>hpIs3[punc-25::SYD-2::GFP; lin-15+]</italic> was crossed onto indicated combinations of <italic>parg(lf)</italic> and <italic>dlk-1(OE)</italic> backgrounds.

Images were analyzed with ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>PARP inhibitors</title><p>All PARP inhibitors were acquired from Selleckchem. To assess the effects of PARP inhibitors on regeneration, GABA axons in L4 animals were axotomized and the worms placed on NGM plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brenner, 1974</xref>) containing 100 µM of the respective PARP inhibitor. Control plates were made with the same amount of DMSO as the plates containing inhibitor. Axon regeneration was scored 24 hr post-axotomy. Functional recovery was assessed by counting the number of body bends an animal made after being tapped on the nose with a platinum wire. Zero body bends is referred to as ‘shrinker’.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Craig H Neilsen Foundation to ABB, by NIH R21NS082667 to MH and DMM, by NIH R33NS079306 to SMS and by the Falk Medical Research Trust to SMS.</p></ack><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>ABB, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>RDM, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>YS, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>SMS, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>DMM, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>MH, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Althaus</surname><given-names>FR</given-names></name><name><surname>Richter</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="1987">1987</year><article-title>ADP-ribosylation of proteins.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kang Shen as the Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Both reviewers found this paper interesting and worth publishing despite the recently published paper that is relevant to this manuscript. Both reviewers found similar strengths and weaknesses in this work.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Byrne and colleagues present an interesting manuscript that demonstrates a role for poly-ADP-ribosylation in the regulation of axonal regeneration in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. They find that overexpressing DLK, which promotes regeneration, leads to the upregulation of PARGS (glycohydrolases that remove PAR [poly(ADP-ribose)]. They show that loss of PARGS inhibits regeneration. PAR is generated by PARP1-here it is shown that genetic or pharmacological loss of PARP1 enhances regeneration. This is an interesting and well-done study that makes a significant contribution to the field. However, there are a number of suggestions to improve the manuscript. For example, both reviewers found the mammalian part of the paper to be somewhat preliminary and suggested cutting it out. Both reviewers also found it necessary to include more careful interpretation and discussion of the PARG double mutant, especially in the DLK OE case. One reviewer would also like to see the figure modified to include the <italic>parg1, 2</italic> DKO on the same histogram as the <italic>dlk oe, parg1,2</italic> DKO.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Very recently, Langley and colleagues published a PNAS paper (PMID 26598704) that reached very similar conclusions. They showed in mammalian neurons that inhibiting PARPs improves axon regeneration, and also that axon injury induces the formation of PAR. I think two near simultaneous papers will highlight this interesting new result, and I find value in publishing the worm results. However, the Discussion section should incorporate this new paper.</p><p>2) While the results presented are compelling, there is some question about the physiological relevance of the induction of PARGS, as this was only demonstrated in the case of DLK overexpression. While the authors do show that PARGs are necessary for regeneration, they do not show that they are regulated by injury. The authors have created a very nice transcriptional reporter of PARGs that has single cell resolution. It would strengthen the paper to test whether injury activates PARG using this reporter. If PARGs are regulated by injury, this would imply that they are an active part of the injury signaling mechanism rather than merely permissive factors for regeneration.</p><p>3) The <italic>parg1/parg2</italic> double mutant has the same phenotype as each single mutant. While this could make sense for two components of a single pathway, that is not expected for these enzymes. Some discussion of this unexpected result is warranted.</p><p>4) There is a small figure showing some role for Parp1 in mammalian axon regeneration. This makes use of shRNA targeting <italic>parp1</italic>. Appropriate controls were not included. First, it should be demonstrated that the shRNA actually leads to loss of <italic>parp1</italic>. Second, an effort should be made to show the phenotype is not due to an off-target effect. This could be done with sh-resistent cDNA rescue. An alternative is to use two independent PARP1 inhibitors (I suggest two to get around off target drug effects). These drugs are very well validated, and would give the story a hint of translational potential. If these controls cannot be done, this small figure should be removed. The point that this pathway is conserved in mammals is well demonstrated in the Langley paper.</p><p>5) The authors claim that the DLK overexpression phenotype is partially suppressed by loss of <italic>parg1</italic> and <italic>parg2</italic>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, it would be nice to include the level of regeneration seen in the <italic>parg1/2</italic> double knockout, so that it is clear to the reader that DLK OE still leads to improved axon regeneration in the absence of <italic>parg1/2</italic>. Indeed, I am unconvinced that it is fair to call this suppression. Loss of <italic>parg1/2</italic> leads to less regeneration in both the wild type background and the DLK overexpression background. In fact, DLK overexpression leads to very robust increase in regeneration in the absence of <italic>parg1/2</italic> (from ~30% to ~70%). In the presence of parg, DLK overexpression leads to an increase in regeneration from ~70% to about ~90%. Obviously there is a ceiling effect so it is difficult to compare, but I don't think these results clearly show that PARG is acting downstream of DLK. These are also the results you would expect if PARG were acting in a parallel pathway. A more balanced discussion of the interpretation is warranted.</p><p>6) It is less clear on the significance of this pathway in regulating axon regeneration given the partial phenotype of <italic>parg1/parg2</italic> double mutant, with or without <italic>dlk-1 OE</italic>. With a single mammalian neuron culture experiment with shRNA knockdown, it also remains open how much this pathway plays a role in the mammalian system. Any speculation on the link between a role in axon regeneration and well established roles of PARGs and PARPs?</p><p>7) Related to #1 above, may want to do the same level of analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-C</xref> to dig deeper into the phenotype since at the first glance the phenotype is not strong in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>. Also for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, how does <italic>dlk-1(OE);parg-1(-);parg-2(-)</italic> compare to <italic>dlk-1(OE);pmk-3(-)?</italic> </p><p>8) Any way to directly measure poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) levels? The conclusion is on PAR levels but there is no direct evidence on this.</p><p>9) How does axon injury regulate <italic>dlk-1 – parg</italic> and possibly <italic>dlk-1 – parp</italic>? E.g., Does injury upregulate <italic>parg-2</italic> reporter gene expression? Is <italic>parp</italic> downregulated in <italic>dlk-1 OE</italic>? Given the experiments in cortical neurons, is PARG a transcriptional target of DLK in mammalian neurons?</p><p>10) Why pick this gene (<italic>parg-2</italic>)? Top hit by fold change? More detailed description of top hits from the screen? E.g., any DLK-dependent and PMK3-independent hits?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12734.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Very recently, Langley and colleagues published a PNAS paper (PMID 26598704) that reached very similar conclusions.

We agree that these results support our finding that after axon injury, PAR regulates axon regeneration and have incorporated discussion of these results into the paper. The revised manuscript includes the following:</p><p>“in vivo, injured mammalian axons must overcome extrinsic growth inhibition to regenerate. PAR levels are upregulated in murine cortical neurons exposed to inhibitory growth molecules (myelin-associated glycoprotein, Nogo-A, Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans) in vitro and in crushed optic nerves in vivo.

As suggested, we investigated PARG expression after injury using the PARG reporter.

This makes use of shRNA targeting parp1. Appropriate controls were not included. First, it should be demonstrated that the shRNA actually leads to loss of parp1.</italic> </p><p>We agree and to address the question, we performed western blots on cortical neurons exposed to negative control shRNA or to two unique shRNAs that target PARP1. We found exposure to PARP1 shRNAs caused a loss of PARP1 in cortical neurons. We have included the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>.</p><p>We included the following description in the Results and Discussion of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“To confirm the shRNA clones targeted PARP1, we performed western blots on cortical neurons exposed to negative control shRNA or to two unique shRNAs that target PARP1. […] PARP was significantly reduced in neurons exposed to either of the PARP1-targeting shRNAs compared to negative control shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, I</xref>). PARP levels were normalized to actin levels in each sample of neurons.</p><p><italic>Second, an effort should be made to show the phenotype is not due to an off-target effect.

We have two lines of evidence that demonstrate the increased regeneration seen in mammalian neurons after PARP inhibition is not due to an off-target effect: 1) Regeneration of cortical neurons is significantly increased when PARP function is inhibited by either of two unique shRNAs, 2) Regeneration of cortical neurons is significantly increased when PARP function is inhibited chemically. Together, these experiments suggest PARP is the relevant target.</p><p>These experiments are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref> and described in the Results and Discussion section of the revised manuscript. In addition, Brochier et al. independently found cortical axon outgrowth on restrictive substrates is increased when PARP is inhibited with another chemical PARP inhibitor (Brochier et al., 2015). This complementary finding is described in the last paragraph of the Results and Discussion section.</p><p>” We cultured primary cortical mouse neurons in 96-well plates (Huebner et al., 2011). […] We found that axons exposed to PARP1 shRNA regenerated significantly better than axons exposed to control shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>).”</p><p>“We found that treatment with chemical PARP inhibitors after injury resulted in significantly enhanced axon regeneration in vivo in <italic>C. elegans</italic> GABA neurons and in vitro in murine cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B, C</xref>, and Figure 4—figure supplement 2).”</p><p><italic>5) The authors claim that the DLK overexpression phenotype is partially suppressed by loss of parg1 and parg2. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, it would be nice to include the level of regeneration seen in the parg1/2 double knockout, so that it is clear to the reader that DLK OE still leads to improved axon regeneration in the absence of parg1/2.</italic> </p><p>We included the <italic>parg1/2</italic> double knockout data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> (previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) and address the question of whether PARG is downstream of DLK below. The revised manuscript includes all four genotypes in the figure (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> and included below): wild type, <italic>parg1/2</italic>, DLK OE, and <italic>parg1/2</italic>; DLK OE.</p><p><italic>Indeed, I am unconvinced that it is fair to call this suppression. Loss of parg1/2 leads to less regeneration in both the wild type background and the DLK overexpression background.

We agree, our finding that loss of <italic>parg1/2</italic> reduces regeneration in both the wild type and the DLK overexpression backgrounds does not on its own show that parg is downstream of DLK. However, this finding, together with our finding that DLK overexpression increases parg expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and our finding that parg expression is dependent on DLK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), strongly suggest the PARGs act downstream of <italic>dlk-1</italic>. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that these pathways also have parallel functions. The revised section of the manuscript now reads:</p><p>“We assessed regeneration in animals with activated DLK signaling (<italic>dlk-1(OE)</italic>), but lacking both <italic>parg-1</italic> and <italic>parg-2.</italic> […] Thus, DLK-dependent regeneration depends in part on <italic>parg-1</italic> and <italic>parg-2.</italic>”</p><p>“Together, our findings suggest that regulation of PARylation is an important component of the DLK pathway role in the axon regeneration mechanism. […] Some of these functions may be mediated by other transcriptional outputs of DLK signaling (Watkins et al., 2013). Understanding these factors, as well as understanding the cellular effects of PAR on regeneration, await further study.”</p><p><italic>6) It is less clear on the significance of this pathway in regulating axon regeneration given the partial phenotype of parg1/parg2 double mutant, with or without dlk-1 OE.</italic> </p><p>We agree that compared to the DLK pathway, the PARGs and PARPs have a smaller effect on regeneration. However, our work on the PARGs/PARP pathway identifies a novel mechanism, PARylation, that significantly regulates the ability of an injured axon to regenerate after injury. Further, this mechanism is distinct from DLK in that it is 1) druggable; 2) affects functional recovery after injury; and 3) does not affect synaptic morphology. Thus, the role of the PARGs and PARPs is different from DLK. In our opinion, our findings are significant because they identify PARylation as important to the cell biology of axon regeneration, they reveal an axon regeneration-specific mechanism downstream of DLK, and they show that drugs that target this pathway improve axon regeneration and functional recovery.</p><p><italic>With a single mammalian neuron culture experiment with shRNA knockdown, it also remains open how much this pathway plays a role in the mammalian system.</italic> </p><p>Please see our first two responses to #4 above.</p><p><italic>Any speculation on the link between a role in axon regeneration and well established roles of PARGs and PARPs?</italic> </p><p>Please see our response to #8 below.</p><p><italic>7) Related to #1 above, may want to do the same level of analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-C</xref> to dig deeper into the phenotype since at the first glance the phenotype is not strong in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>.</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>. We reanalyzed the data and determined whether each axon regenerated below the midline of the worm (M-), beyond the midline (M+), at least ¾ of the distance to the dorsal cord (M++). The analysis confirmed our initial finding that the greatest difference in regenerative ability between the genotypes is in overall regeneration, in other words, axons that showed some degree of regeneration (all blue bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This analysis also indicates other, more granular phenotypes that may be of interest. We added the figure to the supplemental figures (Now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Also for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, how does dlk-1(OE);parg-1(-);parg-2(-) compare to dlk-1(OE);pmk-3(-)?</italic> </p><p>As published in Hammarlund et al., 2009, 7% of <italic>dlk-1OE; pmk-3(-)</italic> axons regenerate. Thus, the suppression of <italic>dlk-1OE</italic> by <italic>parg-1</italic> and <italic>parg-2</italic> is not as strong, suggesting regulation of the <italic>parg</italic> genes is not the only mechanism that mediates regeneration downstream of the canonical <italic>dlk-1</italic> pathway. We have modified the text as follows (Results and Discussion section):</p><p>“We assessed regeneration in animals with activated DLK signaling (<italic>dlk-1(OE)</italic>), but lacking both <italic>parg-1</italic> and <italic>parg-2.</italic> […] Thus, DLK-dependent regeneration depends in part on <italic>parg-1</italic> and <italic>parg-2.</italic>”</p><p><italic>8) Any way to directly measure poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) levels? The conclusion is on PAR levels but there is no direct evidence on this.</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately, although PAR levels can be measured in bulk preps, we do not have a way to detect the relevant PAR levels, specifically within the GABA neurons. Our data suggests PAR levels regulate axon regeneration since PARPs and PARGs have contrasting effects on PAR levels (Bai, 2015) and on axon regeneration. In addition, Brochier et al. found PAR levels are increased in injured axons in the optic nerve (Brochier et al., 2015). We modified the text as follows:</p><p>“Since PARPs and PARGs have contrasting effects on PAR levels, NAD+ levels (Bai, 2015) and on axon regeneration, we conclude the balance between PARP and PARG function regulates axon regeneration, and present the hypothesis the PARG-PARP balance may determine axon regeneration by regulating PAR levels or by regulating NAD+ levels.”</p><p><italic>9) How does axon injury regulate dlk-1 – parg and possibly dlk-1 – parp? E.g., Does injury upregulate parg-2 reporter gene expression? Is parp downregulated in dlk-1 OE? Given the experiments in cortical neurons, is PARG a transcriptional target of DLK in mammalian neurons?</italic> </p><p>As discussed in response to comment #2 above, expression of the glycohydrolase (<italic>parg-2</italic>) reporter gene is upregulated by injury, and expression in both injured and uninjured neurons is <italic>dlk-1</italic>-dependent. By contrast, expression of the polymerases (<italic>parp-1</italic> or <italic>parp-2</italic>) is not significantly changed in <italic>dlk-1OE</italic> axons relative to wild type axons. PARG was not identified as one of 342 genes upregulated in a DLK-dependent manner in crushed optic nerves (Watkins et al., 2013). However, the Watkins investigation was performed three days after injury and does not preclude an earlier DLK-dependent response to injury.</p><p><italic>10) Why pick this gene (parg-2)? Top hit by fold change? More detailed description of top hits from the screen? E.g., any DLK-dependent and PMK3-independent hits?</italic> </p><p><italic>parg-2</italic> was the fourth-most upregulated gene in the <italic>dlk-1OE</italic> background whose upregulation was dependent on the downstream kinase <italic>pmk-3</italic>. Similarly, <italic>parg-1</italic> was also upregulated in the <italic>dlk-1OE</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The presence of both paralogs made this gene family a particularly intriguing candidate. We did not include a description of any other candidate genes in this manuscript since including them would require a significant amount of validation, which we believe is beyond the scope of this paper. We have rewritten this section of the manuscript to describe how the <italic>parg</italic> genes were selected for analysis. The revised section now reads:</p><p>“RNA sequencing and analysis suggested the <italic>parg</italic> genes as candidates for further evaluation. […] These data suggested that regulation of PARG function might be a major effect of DLK signaling.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
