Class IV neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae are polymodal nociceptors responsible for thermal, mechanical, and light sensation. Importantly, activation of Class IV provoked distinct avoidance behaviors, depending on the inputs. We found that noxious thermal stimuli, but not blue light stimulation, caused a unique pattern of Class IV, which were composed of pauses after high-frequency spike trains and a large Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise in the dendrite (the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient). Both these responses depended on two TRPA channels and the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (L-VGCC), showing that the thermosensation provokes Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The precipitous fluctuation of firing rate in Class IV neurons enhanced the robust heat avoidance. We hypothesize that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx can be a key signal encoding a specific modality.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12959.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12959.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12959.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals often need to get away quickly from dangers in their environment, such as temperatures that are hot enough to damage their tissues. As such, an animal’s brain often encodes automatic ‘avoidance responses’ to signs of danger, which help the animal move away from harm.</p><p>The nervous system of a fruit fly larva, for example, contains a distinct class of neurons (known as class IV neurons) that respond specifically to high temperatures and ultraviolet or blue light. Both of these stimuli are potentially harmful, but the larvae escape from heat by rolling with a corkscrew-like motion, yet they turn their heads away from a source of ultraviolet or blue light. So, how does the same set of neurons orchestrate these two different types of behavior?</p><p>To answer this question, Terada, Matsubara, Onodera et al. measured the activity in the class IV neurons in two different ways. First, the levels of calcium ions in the neurons, which play a key role in neurons’ activity, were imaged using a calcium-sensitive biosensor. Second, electrodes were used to directly on the class IV neurons to record changes in their electrical activity.</p><p>The experiments showed that class IV neurons responded to heat by producing a characteristic burst of electrical activity followed by a pause, and that this pattern of electrical activity was accompanied by a large rise in the calcium signal. In contrast, the same neurons did not show this ‘burst and pause’ pattern of activity when the fruit fly larvae were exposed to ultraviolet/blue light. Instead, these conditions triggered much smaller changes in electrical activity. Further experiments then confirmed that the characteristic ‘burst and pause’ pattern of electrical activity was linked to the rolling motion observed when the larvae try to escape from heat.</p><p>These findings show how differing patterns of activity in the same neurons can be used to differentiate between different types of stimuli. Further work is now needed to explain how these two different patterns of activity in one set of neurons is translated by the fruit fly’s brain into different patterns of behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12959.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12959.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals can sense diverse sensory inputs such as optical stimuli, plumes of volatile chemicals, acoustic waves, and atmospheric temperature by using a variety of specific sensory organs. Among these, polymodal nociceptors are defined as sensory neurons that respond to aversive stimuli with distinct physical properties. For example, mammalian C-fiber nociceptors detect harsh touch, high temperature, acid stimulus, and a number of toxic chemicals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delmas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perl, 1996</xref>).</p><p>Ion channel proteins that are expressed in polymodal nociceptors of nematodes, insects, and mammals have been discovered, and nowadays, molecular basis of thermal or mechanical nociceptive sensory transduction has primarily converged on three protein superfamilies: the TRP channels, the PIEZO channels, and the DEG/ENaC channels, all of which are well-conserved across many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basbaum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geffeney and Goodman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lumpkin et al., 2010</xref>). TRP channels are nonspecific cation channels and several members of this family have been implicated in thermal nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lumpkin and Caterina, 2007</xref>). For example, dTrpA1 is an essential component of both thermal and mechanical nociception in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>). PIEZO and DEG/ENaC channels are required specifically for the mechanical nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2012b</xref>).</p><p>Exposure to short-wavelength light is also one of the hazardous stimuli for terrestrial animals such as soil-dwelling nematodes and a number of boring insects including the larval forms of holometabolous insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hori et al. 2014</xref>). Both the <italic>lite-1</italic> gene in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Gustatory receptor 28b (Gr28b</italic>) gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> encode the light-activated G-protein-coupled receptors and are essential for the noxious light sensation eliciting stereotypical light-avoidance behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamanaka et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In at least two noteworthy cases, organisms can react to different modes of stimuli through a single type of nociceptor: the <italic>C. elegans</italic> PVD neuron responds to a harsh poke and cold temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2010</xref>), whereas one subclass of multidenritic neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva perceives a sharp poke, noxious high temperatures, and UV or blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Im and Galko, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae exhibit distinct escape behavior outputs in response to the thermal or mechanical stimuli versus blue light (see below). To unveil the mechanism of this type of polymodal sensation and processing, we addressed how the distinct sensory inputs are transduced and encoded into differential firing patterns.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> dendritic arborization (da) neurons constitute a subfamily of sensory neurons that elaborate their dendritic arbors two-dimensionally on the basal surface of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grueber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Im and Galko, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jan and Jan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shimono et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yasunaga et al., 2010</xref>). da neurons in the larval abdominal hemisegment are classified into four morphological categories, Classes I-IV, in order of increasing territory size and/or branching complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grueber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jan and Jan, 2010</xref>). A series of studies have shown that Class IV neurons are polymodal nociceptors and relevant receptors are identified as described below: Touching the dorsal cuticle of larvae with a metal probe hotter than 45°C evokes a stereotypic corkscrew-like escape rolling behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babcock et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tracey et al., 2003</xref>); and activation of the Class IV neurons is necessary and sufficient for this output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ohyama et al., 2013</xref>). This thermal nociception behavior is mediated by thermoTRPs genes including <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPA1 (dTrpA1), Painless, and Pyrexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babcock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hwang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neely et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tracey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to the noxious heat, strong mechanical stimuli, such as a sharp poke, elicit the same nocifensive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, Class IV neurons are extra-ocular photoreceptors that respond to short-wavelength light stimuli and evoke a directional shift of locomotion, which requires Gr28b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamanaka et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, to achieve such a discriminative processing, Class IV neurons are supposed to integrate multiple modes of sensory inputs into distinct firing patterns in a highly sophisticated manner. Recently, extracellular single-unit recordings have been developed to monitor physiological activities of Class I-IV dendritic arborization neurons upon naturalistic stimulation, such as light and gentle touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsubouchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). However, there have been few extensive analyses of firing responses of Class I–IV neurons upon spatially restricted and temporally controlled noxious heat stimulations.</p><p>In this study, we built a new measurement system that combines three components: an infrared (IR) laser that allows quantitatively controlled step-like and local heating, neuronal calcium imaging, and extracellular single-unit recording to monitor firing patterns. In response to the local heating over 45°C, Class IV neurons generated unique firing patterns that were composed of intermittent pause periods after high-frequency firing trains. This 'burst and pause' firing pattern was associated with a large rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the entire dendritic tree, which we designated as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient. We showed that both of the unique firing pattern and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient are physiological responses of Class IV neurons, characterized their underlying mechanisms by using pharmacological and genetic approaches, and compared the response to the noxious heat with that to short-wavelength light to address the basis of the polymodal sensation. Furthermore, we pursued which characteristics of the 'burst and pause' firing pattern contributes to the induction of the rolling behavior, and showed that the multiple fluctuations of firing rate enhanced robust output by using optogenetic manipulation. Altogether, we propose that the low-frequency continuous firing train transmits the noxious light sensation; in contrast, the multiple peaks of firing rate fluctuation facilitate the perception of a noxious heat stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Infrared laser-mediated noxious thermal stimuli evoke high-frequency firing in Class IV neurons</title><p>To understand how Class IV neurons respond to noxious thermal stimuli, we built a new system employing a 1462-nm infrared (IR) laser as a step-like and local heating device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To measure the microenvironmental temperature, we exploited the temperature dependence of the electrical resistance of a glass microelectrode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Palmer and Williams, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shapiro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yao et al., 2009</xref>). The temperature within a radius of approximately 50 μm from the laser focus rapidly increased from an ambient temperature (25°C) to target temperatures (30–50°C) within 100 ms, and stayed almost constant at the maximum temperature throughout the 1 s irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Moreover, the temperature maximum was directly proportional to the power output of the laser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Compared to the perfusion protocol involving a preheated solution that is introduced into the recording chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>) as well as the direct heating of the chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2003</xref>), the IR-laser system allowed us to reproducibly deliver more spatially restricted, and more temporally controlled stimuli.</p><p>Next, we stimulated Class IV neurons by means of this system and measured the cellular physiological responses. For this purpose, we dissected third instar <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, prepared fillet preparations, and performed extracellular single-unit recordings. The foci of the IR-laser irradiation were targeted onto the proximal dendritic arbors (the path length of branches between the IR-laser foci and soma was no longer than 100 µm). IR-laser irradiation of more than 30-mW laser output power evoked high-frequency firings in Class IV neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>: 30 mW, 40.6 ± 4.8 Hz; 40 mW, 83.9 ± 7.3 Hz; <italic>n</italic> = 9 cells). From our calibration of the IR laser, an irradiation of 1-mW raised the temperature by an increment of ~0.6°C in the focused region (inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); thus, the estimated temperature was ~43°C for the 30-mW laser output power. This threshold temperature was close to that of previous experiments, where the jumps of the firing rate were detected at around 40°C with perfusion of the preheated solution into the recording chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>). We were intrigued by the firing patterns in response to IR irradiation of 40-mW laser power, which typically contained pauses that followed high-frequency spikes (see 40-mW in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>); and we characterized the underlying mechanistic details as described later. Our control or 'wild-type' larvae in the electrophysiological experiments carried a transgene of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe that was expressed selectively in Class IV neurons, unless described otherwise.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Interplay of dTrpA1 and Painless generate putative thermocurrents in Class IV neurons</title><p>We investigated how the IR-laser irradiations evoked high-frequency firings in Class IV neurons by extracellular recording.

The temporal pattern of the wild-type firing was not a simple summation of the two TRPA mutants; thus, we infer that the two heat-activated channels should function in a coordinated manner. Our results also strongly suggested that the firing responses of the wild-type neurons reflected intrinsic neuronal activities, dependent on the heat-activated channels and were not induced by photo damage (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>IR irradiation to the soma evokes dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients</title><p>Although the occurrences of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises are often taken to be a hallmark of neural activity, it was not clear that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises were faithfully indicative of the activation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory neurons.

The probabilities of the occurrence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were dependent on the output powers of the IR-laser, which arose abruptly at around 36 mW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), so this high occurrence is one advantage of irradiation to the soma. Furthermore, the probabilities were significantly lowered in the neurons of <italic>dTrpA1</italic> or <italic>pain</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>), indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients also reflect normal neuronal activities that depend on the heat-activated channels. Irradiation to the dendritic arbor also evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, although this required higher IR-laser power compared to the stimulation of the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Once a Class IV neuron elicited a transient, that neuron then responded more weakly to the repetitive IR-laser irradiations onto the same location in the cell (data not shown). In contrast to the sharp Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises throughout dendrites upon IR irradiations to somata, Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations within the somata were relatively slow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; 'soma' and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The L-type voltage-gated calcium channel is necessary for the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient</title><p>We next explored the molecular basis of the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient. Excitability of Class IV neurons was prerequisite for this Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient, as shown by the fact that the occurrence of the transients was completely blocked by overexpression of the inward-rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which hyperpolarizes neurons and decreases their resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hardie et al., 2001</xref>). This raised the possibility that the transient was caused by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from extracellular space (see another possibility discussed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and its legend) and that some of the voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) were involved. To verify these possibilities, we screened genes encoding α subunits of VGCCs for those necessary for the occurrence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients; specifically, we recorded and analyzed probabilities and amplitudes of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in various VGCC loss-of-function mutants. A dramatic phenotype was found in mutants of the L-type VGCC gene (<italic>Ca-α1D</italic><sup>X7/AR66</sup> and <italic>Ca-α1D</italic><sup>X10/AR66</sup>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eberl et al., 1998</xref>); normal Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients hardly occurred in those mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). A similar defect was observed in the wild type when a selective inhibitor of L-type VGCC, Nimodipine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gielow et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grey and Burrell, 2010</xref>), was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These results showed that L-type VGCC-mediated excitability is required for the occurrence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in Class IV neurons (see our negative results of other types of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> VGCC family in 'Materials and methods').</p><p>As for mammalian neurons, it has been well known that there is a link between changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, which are regulated by L-type VGCC, and cell-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greer and Greenberg, 2008</xref>). Therefore, the expression level of <italic>dTrpA1</italic> and/or <italic>pain</italic> could have been lowered in the L-type VGCC mutants. To test this possibility, we performed real-time PCR to quantitate the mRNA levels of <italic>dTrpA1</italic> and <italic>pain</italic> in neural tissues of <italic>Ca-α1D</italic> mutants, but found no significant differences between the <italic>Ca-α1D</italic> mutant and the wild type (data not shown).</p><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in Class IV neurons was reminiscent of that in rat neocortical pyramidal neurons, which are also detectable throughout the entire dendritic arbor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schiller et al., 1995</xref>). The occurrence of this transient in the pyramidal neurons requires voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels (VGSCs) that are distributed along dendritic branches. In our system, however, the addition of Tetrodotoxin (TTX) had no effect on the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in Class IV neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C and E</xref>), indicating that VGSCs are required neither for the occurrence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients nor for the regenerative propagation of membrane potential along the dendritic branches.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are most likely generated by accumulations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes producing the pauses in firing</title><p>To elucidate the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and neuronal activities, we performed extracellular single-unit recording and the ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

In live animals, <italic>Ca-α1D</italic>-knockdown larvae displayed rolling when the continuous firing pattern was evoked, and the rolling occurred more efficiently by the pulsatile optogenetic activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; [Continuous] 65.3 ± 9.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 75, [Intermittent] 86.3 ± 5.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 95, mean ± 95% confidence interval based on Clopper-Pearson method; p = 0.0017, Fisher’s exact test). Although the probability of rolling was rather high in the continuous activation condition (see 'Discussion'), this result is, nevertheless, consistent with the idea that the intermittent firing pattern facilitates the rolling behavior. However, it should be stressed that the intermittent pattern produced under our optogenetic experiment was distinct from the pattern of the wild-type neuron upon noxious thermal stimulations according to two quantitative features. First, the maximum firing rate of the optogenetic pattern was 40~50 Hz (data not shown) and lower than that of wild-type neurons (~80 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Second, none of the spike trains generated in our optogenetic condition fully met the definition of US (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore, we reconsidered our idea that the occurrence of the US is a reliable metric for the artificial firing pattern, and we searched for other metrics that would explain all of the results of our three experimental settings: the effect of Nimodipine application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and H</xref>), the <italic>Ca-α1D</italic>-knockdown phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and the optogenetics (the top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>We noticed that fluctuations of firing rate were prominent around the time when each US occurred (the recording trace of Δ Firing rate of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To express such fluctuations quantitatively, we first speculated that the number of the peaks of the firing rate during IR stimuli might be an appropriate metric and computed the firing rate by using the Gaussian kernel method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>; see also below). Although we defined the peak of the firing rate using different parameter sets, we did not find statistically significant differences in the peak number between the controls and the samples in the above three experimental settings (data not shown).</p><p>Next, we focused our attention on the local steepness of the firing rate fluctuation during heat stimulation because a precipitous change in the firing rate is one essential component of burst firing. To quantify 'up' and 'down' of the firing rate fluctuation, we calculated the time derivative of the firing rate fluctuation during IR irradiation, defined peaks of firing rate fluctuation, and scored the total number of the peaks ('total peak number') as follows: first, the firing rate estimation was computed by using the Gaussian kernel method (<italic>σ</italic> = 25 ms); second, a threshold was configured as 0.5 of the primal peak value; finally, peaks of the time derivative above the threshold were specified (red circles in the bottom graphs of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). With this analysis, the 'total peak number' showed a significant correlation with the total US number in control neurons (p = 3.17 x 10<sup>–5</sup>, <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.79; Spearman’s rank correlation test; <italic>n</italic> = 20 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). We then showed a significant decrease in the total peak number in Nimodipine-applied neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>; [Control] 2.00 ± 0.21 total peak number, [Nimodipine] 1.09 ± 0.091; p = 0.0034; Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test). Furthermore, the total peak number was significantly decreased in <italic>Ca-α1D</italic>-knockdown neurons compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; [<italic>white RNAi</italic> <sup>GL00094</sup>] 1.55 ± 0.20 total peak number, [<italic>Ca-α1D RNAi</italic> <sup>HMS00294</sup>] 1.00 ± 0.00; p = 0.027). As is intuitively obvious in the optogenetics experiment, the total peak number under the continuous activation was significantly different from that of the intermittent one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; [Continuous] 1.11 ± 0.11, [Intermittent] 5.00 ± 0.00; p = 4.11 x 10<sup>-5</sup>).</p><p>To conclude, we consider the 'total peak number' is a reliable metric that can represent the complex burst and pause patterns and designate the peak of the time derivative of firing rate fluctuation as the peak of firing rate fluctuation for short. These results suggest that the total number of peaks of firing rate fluctuation in Class IV neurons plays a key role in increasing the likelihood of rolling locomotion upon noxious heat input. We designate this hypothesis as the 'burst number-coding' model because the burst (i.e., high-frequency firing) is accompanied by the peak of firing rate fluctuation.</p><p>To explore another potential impact of the 'burst and pause' firing pattern on escape behaviors, we tested whether it plays an important role in evoking the 'fast crawling' after noxious heat stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ohyama et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2015</xref>). To evaluate a causal link between the firing patterns and the fast crawling, we performed a set of optogenetic experiments as follows: First, we confirmed that ChIEF-expressing Class IV neurons could be activated with lower-power blue light (0.056 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>; 470 nm) and displayed lower-frequency firings (10~20 Hz) with no 'burst and pause' pattern in <italic>Ca-α1D</italic>-knockdown larvae (data not shown). Then, we observed that such a firing pattern triggered the fast crawling, even when no rolling behavior was evoked (Maximum speed of crawling stride: [before activation] 6.37 ± 0.29 mm/s, [after activation] 10.51 ± 0.66 mm/s, mean ± s.e.m., <italic>n</italic> = 24 larvae; p = 0.0269, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; see 'Materials and methods' for details). These findings indicate that lower frequency firing is sufficient for eliciting the fast crawling, whereas the occurrence of 'burst and pause' firing pattern is not required.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>The <italic>Ca-α1D</italic> gene expression in Class IV neurons is not required for photo-avoidance behavior</title><p>Finally we addressed two questions that are relevant to the polymodality of Class IV neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>). The first one was whether the L-type VGCC is also required for the avoidance of the short-wavelength light stimuli (the directional shift of locomotion), for which dTrpA1-dependent neural activity of Class IV neurons was essential. <italic>Ca-α1D</italic>-knockdown larvae avoided blue light, as did the control larvae, when they were illuminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This finding indicates that not only L-type VGCC is dispensable for the photo-avoidance behavior, but also the synaptic transmission at the NMJ is not severely affected under our <italic>Ca-α1D</italic> knockdown condition.</p><p>The second question was whether the wild-type Class IV evokes the 'burst and pause' firing pattern in response to the blue light as it did upon the noxious thermal stimuli. We illuminated larvae expressing TN-XXL in Class IV with short-wavelength light of four different intensities, and found the following (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>): (1) The firing change and the Max firing rate increased with the light intensity, but the firing rate was 32.1 Hz even at the strongest intensity (182.3 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>), which exceeds the level that larvae normally experience in natural environments. This firing rate was far smaller than that in response to the thermal stimuli (83.9 ± 7.3 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). (2) 'US-like spikes' (compare its definition in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> with that of US in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) were detected only under the strongest light condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). (3) Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were not observed at a light intensity (146.7 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>; data not shown). These observations indicate that the wild-type Class IV did not generate L-type VGCC-dependent US in response to the blue light.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12959.022</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Firing responses of Class IV neurons upon illumination with blue light.</title><p>Extracellular single-unit recordings of blue light (460–495 nm)-stimulated Class IV neurons in fillet-mounted larvae.

With the help of this system, we showed that the thermotransduction machinery is present in the dendrite.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Identified and unidentified ion channels coordinate to generate the putative thermocurrent and the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient</title><p>The hypothetical thermotransduction machinery includes dTrpA1 and Painless of the TRPA channel family, which are required for the stereotype avoidance behavior to noxious heat stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Neely et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tracey et al., 2003</xref>). Class IV neurons in the <italic>dTrpA1</italic> mutant displayed a much longer latency time prior to the increase in the firing rate compared to the wild type. On the other hand, the rising profile of the firing rate in the <italic>pain </italic>mutant was comparable to that of the wild type, but the rate reached only 65% of that of the wild-type neurons. Therefore the temporal pattern of the wild-type firing response was not a simple summation of those of the two TRPA mutants. If dTrpA1 and Painless are the unique cation channels for the conductance of the putative thermocurrent, the time course of the firing in <italic>painless</italic> mutants may represent that of dTrpA1 activation, and vice versa. If this inference is the case, our results can be interpreted in a way that dTrpA1 can become activated to some extent by itself and that it is prerequisite for Painless to be properly activated. A previous electrophysiological analysis of Painless showed that Painless is a noxious-heat activated, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-requiring, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sokabe et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we suppose that noxious heat stimulation activates dTrpA1 and causes local Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in the dendrite, followed by the robust increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance of Painless, leading to large depolarization. This results in gating of L-type VGCC and generation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient, most likely by accumulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, throughout the dendrites of Class IV neurons.</p><p>Although little is known about subcellular localization of dTrpA1 and Painless in Class IV neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hwang et al., 2012</xref>), they may distribute along the entire dendritic arbors. Among the subunits presumably composing the functional VGCC in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Straightjacket (Stj) of the α2δ family is expressed in da neurons and required for the heat avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neely et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, Stj may coexist with Ca-α1D in the dendrite. It remains to be elucidated how the burst is followed by the pause. We assumed that any of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sub>Ca</sub> channels) and/or other channels might be engaged in generating the pause through production of an after-hyperpolarization current.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Roles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in nociception of Class IV neurons</title><p>In general, specialized sense organs such as nociceptors have thresholds at or near noxious levels, and increase activity with stronger noxious stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perl, 2007</xref>). Likewise, the probability of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient occurrence in Class IV neurons arose abruptly at around an IR-power that was estimated to raise the temperature close to 47°C, and the neuron increased the magnitude of the responses at the suprathreshold temperature. What would be the potential advantages for Class IV to set the threshold by employing Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes? One advantage would be the improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio of the thermosensation. The cellular threshold of the response to the noxious heat could become precipitous by multiplying a physical property of the high-threshold channel (dTrpA1) by the probability of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike generation.</p><p>Another advantage would be to utilize the generation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes to winnow a heterogeneous modality in a selective manner. Our observations highlighted two features of the neuronal response to the different noxious stimuli: (1) the presence or the absence of multiple peaks of firing rate fluctuation and (2) the high or low absolute value of maximum firing rate. We hypothesize that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike can be a key signal encoding a specific modality: the total number of peaks of firing rate fluctuation transmits the noxious heat input by way of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes; in contrast, the continuous firing train at a lower rate encodes the noxious light sensation (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>). This means that the thermal stimuli induce the high-threshold and larger generator currents (orange line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> bottom), while blue light inputs evoke the low-threshold and smaller currents (blue line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> bottom). We showed that the heat-induced unique firing patterns of Class IV were conducted along the axon, which projects to the putative central pattern generator(s) driving the thermal nocifensive responses. It has been shown that Channelrhodopsin2-mediated activation of Class IV provokes the thermal nocifensive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2007</xref>) and the photo-avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>). We predict that inward currents would be larger in the former.</p><p>Our optogenetic activation experiment shows that the multiple peaks of firing rate fluctuation is not essential for the nocifensive escape locomotion (rolling), but enhances its occurrence rate. Therefore, we speculate that such unique firing rate fluctuation may be decoded as a facilitating signal of rolling (the 'burst number-coding' hypothesis). It has also been shown in olfactory behaviors of <italic>C. elegans</italic> that specific activity patterns may modulate the probability of action selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordus et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that combining mechanosensory and nociceptive cues synergistically enhances the selection of rolling behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>). Altogether, the likelihood of rolling locomotion upon noxious heat stimulation can be potentiated by the input(s) from other sensory modalities and multiple peaks of firing rate fluctuation. We also noticed that the probability of rolling was rather high in the continuous activation condition (66.0%; gray bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We assume that almost all of the Class IV neurons were activated under our optogenetic conditions, so that such a high behavioral reactivity was elicited. On the other hand, lower probabilities of rolling were detected in the initial periods of the heat probe assay of <italic>Ca-α1D</italic> knockdown larvae (~20%, &lt;2 s; <italic>Ca-α1D RNAi</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This low reactivity can be explained by local heat-stimulation that may activate a small number of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Robertson et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>How are the firing patterns discriminated downstream of Class IV neurons?</title><p>The neural circuits in the central nervous system must read out the activity of Class IV neurons and distinguish one firing pattern from another to decode the polymodal sensory input. How are the two types of firing patterns in response to the distinct noxious inputs decoded and transformed into differential escape behaviors? Previous studies have shown that the burst coding is a behaviorally relevant mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krahe and Gabbiani, 2004</xref>). For instance, the bursts in an ultrasound-sensitive acoustic sensory neuron of the field cricket <italic>Teleogryllus oceanicus</italic> code for a conspicuous increase in amplitude of an ultrasound stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sabourin and Pollack, 2009</xref>). It is well known that in the cerebellar cortex, climbing fiber inputs evoke characteristic complex spikes in Purkinje neurons, which induce the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes and a subsequent pause in the spike train (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kitamura and Häusser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Llinas and Sugimori, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mathews et al., 2012</xref>). The firing response of Purkinje neurons is remarkably similar to that of Class IV neurons in terms of the pattern and the underlying mechanism. It should be noted that the pause of firing in Purkinje neurons evokes the high-frequency firing response in the target neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei via the post-inhibitory rebound (PIR) mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, it has been proposed that the pauses of firings per se convey signals (the ‘pause coding’ theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Schutter and Steuber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hong and Optican, 2008</xref>). Another circuit evoking the nocifensive light-avoidance behavior may receive direct excitatory inputs from Class IV neurons; this would be consistent with our hypothesis that the dual codes of the polymodal sensory information are decoded and segregated as distinctive command signals in the downstream circuit. Recently, the candidate synaptic partner(s) of Class IV neurons were identified through functional and anatomical assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vogelstein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>); thus, our hypothesis can be tested by investigating the neuronal responses of these candidate neurons to noxious thermal stimulations of Class IV neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant and transgenic strains</title><p>The following fly strains were generated and/or used: (1) The overall structure of our construct for expressing the FRET-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator TN-XXL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mank et al., 2008</xref>) in Class IV neurons was as follows: The TN-XXL ORF was flanked by 1.9 kb <italic>pickpocket (ppk</italic>) promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grueber et al., 2003</xref>) and a SV40 polyA signal sequence.

The light intensity at 2.5X magnification was measured by a radiometric sensor head (UP17P-6S-H5-DO, Gentec-EO, Quebec, Canada) coupled with a power meter (UNO, Gentec-EO) and it was determined to be 0.72 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> in the light spot. Sixty-five to 104 animals were tested in each condition and the percentage of positive responses was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Optogenetic neural activation</title><p>Larvae for optogenetic activation experiments, harboring the <italic>UAS-ChIEF-tdTomato</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), were grown in the dark at 25°C for 4 days on fly food containing all trans-retinal (R2500; Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 0.5 mM. For behavioral experiments, one larva at a time was separated from food and placed into the center of a 9.5 x 13.5 cm square plastic dish filled with 2% agar (Bacto Agar; Becton Dickinson, Franclin Lakes, NJ). After 5 min of acclimation, the dish with larva was placed into the behavior rig. 5 cycles of 100 ms pulses followed by 100 ms pause intervals or a single 1 s long pulse of blue light (0.234 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), or a single 1 s long pulse (0.056 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> for the crawling assay below) were applied by using a collimated LED light source (M470L3-C1; ThorLabs, Newton, NJ) with an emission peak at around 470 nm. A data acquisition system (USB-6212 BNC; National Instruments, Austin, TX) provided the triggering TTL signals, with timing controlled by a custom LabVIEW program (National Instruments). We recorded videos of larval behavior by using a GE60 CCD image sensor (640 x 480 pixels; Library) at 30 frames per second. For the analyses of crawling stride speeds, larval locomotions were traced in videos by using 'Manual Tracking' Fiji plugin (ImageJ 1.46J, NIH, Bethesda, MD), and then the maximum stride speeds for 5 s before and after optogenetic activation were calculated. For electrophysiological recordings, 5 cycles of 100 ms pulses with 100 ms pause intervals or a single 1 s long pulse of blue light (0.294 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), or a single 1 s long pulse (0.056 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was applied from above through external saline solution. The Digidata 1440A digitizer (Molecular Devices) generated the triggering TTL signals, with timing controlled by a custom Clampex protocol (Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantitative PCR</title><p>RNA was purified from four larval CNS complexes for each genotype using an RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany).

Your article has been favourably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor) and three peer reviewers, one of whom, Leslie Griffith, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study describes the response of Class IV sensory neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae to distinct noxious stimuli (heat and light). Using a highly sophisticated experimental setup combining UV-mediated focal heat application, electrophysiology and calcium imaging, the authors show that &quot;burst and pause&quot; activity pattern of Class IV neurons accompanying a calcium transient is induced by heat but not light. In <italic>dTrpA1</italic> mutants or L-type voltage-gated calcium channel mutants, the &quot;burst and pause&quot; activity pattern, calcium transients and the behavioral response to noxious heat (rolling) are blocked. Optogenetic induction of an activity pattern mimicking the &quot;burst and pause&quot; activity slightly increased the frequency of rolling. From these results, the authors propose an interesting hypothesis that specific pattern of neural activity mediates transmission of specific modality.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The one concern was that the linkage between burst coding and rolling is not as strong as the prose indicates. The authors should reword their conclusions in the Abstract, Results and Discussion in more conservative language and make it clear that rolling can (and does) occur without bursting. Bursting appears to enhance rolling, but it is not necessary. In particular, the phrase &quot;necessary and sufficient&quot; needs to be removed since the data do not support this claim.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12959.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: The one concern was that the linkage between burst coding and rolling is not as strong as the prose indicates.

Also, we fully agree with the notion that bursting appears to enhance rolling, but it is not essential. In our revised manuscript, we rephrased our conclusions in more modest and cautious manner. In particular, we removed the phrase &quot;necessary and sufficient”. All the revised phrases or sentences are positioned in the following sections in the revised version: Abstract; Introduction, last paragraph; Results, subsection “Optogenetic experiments strongly suggest that multiple fluctuations in firing rate in Class IV neurons enhances robust rolling behavior” heading and second paragraph; Discussion, subsection “Roles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in nociception of Class IV neurons”, third paragraph.</p></body></sub-article></article>
