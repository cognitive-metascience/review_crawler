In particular, pre-mRNA splicing was reported to be associated with slowed RNAPII elongation. Here, we identify a site of ubiquitination (K1246) in the catalytic subunit of RNAPII close to the DNA entry path. Ubiquitination was increased in the absence of the Bre5-Ubp3 ubiquitin protease complex. Bre5 binds RNA in vivo, with a preference for exon 2 regions of intron-containing pre-mRNAs and poly(A) proximal sites. Ubiquitinated RNAPII showed similar enrichment. The absence of Bre5 led to impaired splicing and defects in RNAPII elongation in vivo on a splicing reporter construct. Strains expressing RNAPII with a K<sub>1246</sub>R mutation showed reduced co-transcriptional splicing. We propose that ubiquinitation of RNAPII is induced by RNA processing events and linked to transcriptional pausing, which is released by Bre5-Ubp3 associated with the nascent transcript.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA processing</kwd><kwd>UV crosslinking</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin protease</kwd><kwd>protein modification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>109916</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tollervey</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kudla</surname><given-names>Grzegorz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104648</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beggs</surname><given-names>Jean D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>108504</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rappsilber</surname><given-names>Juri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>093853</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reid</surname><given-names>Jane E A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>097383</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kudla</surname><given-names>Grzegorz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>092076</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tollervey</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>200885</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allshire</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ubiquitination close to the active site of RNAPII occurs in response to RNA processing events and is linked to transcriptional pausing, which is released following Bre5-Ubp3 mediated deubiquitination associated with the nascent transcript.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over recent years, it has become increasingly clear that there are numerous, functionally important links between co-transcriptional RNA processing and the changes occurring on the transcribing RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Most attention has focused on modifications of the regulatory C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large, catalytic subunit of RNAPII, which promote the ordered recruitment of numerous RNA packaging and processing factors to the nascent pre-mRNAs. However, there is also evidence that RNA processing events can affect the transcription machinery. In particular, it has been proposed that pre-mRNA splicing is associated with slowed RNAPII elongation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2010</xref>), which presumably favors cotranscriptional splicing. In addition, an elongation ‘checkpoint’ exists upstream of the 3’ cleavage and polyadenylation site in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laitem et al., 2015</xref>). These are predicted to reflect changes in the transcription machinery that are distinct from phosphorylation of the RNAPII CTD.</p><p>Analyses of the effects of UV-induced DNA damage revealed that RNAPII stalled at sites of DNA lesions undergo ubiquitination of the large polymerase subunit (termed Rpo21 or Rpb1 in yeast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kvint et al., 2008</xref>). RNAPII ubiquitination following DNA damage was reported to be a multi-step process, with initial mono-ubiquitination by Rsp5, followed by polyubiquitination by an Ecl1-Cul3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harreman et al., 2009</xref>). The stalled polymerase can be deubiquitylated by the ubiquitin protease Ubp3, and failure of this activity leads to increased degradation of the polymerase by the proteasome. During the DNA damage response Ubp3 functions together with a cofactor Bre5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bilsland et al., 2007</xref>), with which it stably associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, Ubp3 was identified as a factor physically associated with the transcription silencing factor Sir4 and loss of Ubp3 was reported to increase the efficiency of gene silencing near telomeres and at the inactive <italic>HML</italic> mating type locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moazed and Johnson, 1996</xref>). The Bre5-Ubp3 heterodimer also protects the TATA-binding protein Tbp1 against degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chew et al., 2010</xref>), as well as functioning in a number of other, apparently unrelated pathways, including vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baxter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ossareh-Nazari et al., 2010</xref>) and starvation-induced autophagy of mature, cytoplasmic ribosomes (ribophagy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kraft et al., 2008</xref>). Possibly related to this, Bre5-Ubp3 also interacted genetically with the ribosome synthesis factor Nep1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schilling et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, Bre5 was identified in a proteomic screen for proteins associated with poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitchell et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In order to identify new factors involved in RNA surveillance in yeast, genetic screens were performed, in which collections of strains individually deleted for each of the ~5000 non-essential genes were crossed <italic>en masse</italic> to strains lacking a single test gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Decourty et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Milligan et al., 2008</xref>). Following sporulation of the diploids generated, double mutant haploids were selected and allowed to grow for several generations. The mixed culture was then harvested, and the representation of each gene in the collection determined by microarray analysis. Unexpectedly, these competitive growth tests identified Bre5 and Ubp3 as showing the strongest, synergistic, negative growth defects with the non-essential, nuclear RNA surveillance factors Rrp47, which binds and activates the nuclease Rrp6, and the Air1 and Trf5 components of the TRAMP5 nuclear polyadenylation complex, which functions together with the exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Decourty et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Houseley and Tollervey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Losh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Milligan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schuch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stuparevic et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The initial aim of this work was therefore to determine whether and how Bre5 and Ubp3 are linked to nuclear RNA metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bre5 is an RNA-binding protein that shows preferential association with exon 2 of spliced pre-mRNAs</title><p>In genome-wide synthetic lethal screens <italic>bre5∆</italic> and <italic>ubp3∆</italic> were each identified as showing strong synergistic negative growth with the exosome cofactors <italic>rrp47∆</italic>, <italic>air1∆</italic> and <italic>trf5∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Decourty et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Milligan et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The crystal structure of Bre5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2005</xref>) suggested the presence of a C-terminal RNA-recognition motif. The ability of Bre5, Ubp3 and the Bre5-Ubp3 dimer to bind RNA and single-stranded DNA was therefore tested in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Recombinant Bre5 and Ubp3 were expressed by in vitro translation singly or in combination using a TNT kit (Promega) and tested for binding to biotinylated oligos (A, A/U and dT) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Milligan et al., 2008</xref>). This showed that Bre5 bound to weakly to oligo(A), more strongly to oligo(U/A), and best to oligo(dT). Ubp3 alone showed little binding activity, but was recovered in the bound fraction when expressed together with Bre5. We concluded that Bre5 and the Bre5-Ubp3 complex can bind RNA and single-stranded DNA in vitro.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27082.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Bre5 binds RNA in vitro and in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bre5 and Ubp3 plus Bre5 bind RNA in vitro.

For this, Bre5 was expressed as fusion with a C-terminal, tripartite HTP tag (His6-TEV cleavage site-2x Protein A) under the control of the endogenous <italic>BRE5</italic> promoter. Bre5-HTP was purified by binding to an IgG column under native conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As negative control a lysate from the wild type strain (BY4741) lacking the tagged form of Bre5 was also mock purified on IgG. As positive control the RNA-binding protein Nab3-HTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holmes et al., 2015</xref>) was purified and assessed for binding. Radiolabeled RNA oligonuclotides (oligos) were incubated with the IgG column and then washed extensively. Bound oligos were eluted, gel purified and quantified using a phosphor screen and Fuji scanner. The oligos used included the homopolymers, A<sub>20</sub>, U<sub>20</sub>, G<sub>20</sub> and C<sub>20</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, in vivo Bre5-binding sites identified by CRAC were analyzed to identify enriched motifs (see below). This identified the motif UUUG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) as the preferred in vivo target for Bre5. Oligos were generated with three copies of UUUG, interspersed and flanked with either A residues (oligo Bre5-A) or U (oligo Bre5-U) (see legends to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The consensus Nab3-binding site (UUCU) was used to generate similar oligos (Nab3-A and Nab3-U).</p><p>Relative to the column loaded with lysate from the untagged strain, the column loaded with Bre5-HTP recovered ~1.5 fold more oligo(A), two fold more oligo(U), but similar levels of oligo(G) and oligo(C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Strikingly, the strongest binding was observed for the Bre5-U oligo on the Bre5 column; six fold greater than the BY control. Substantial binding was also seen for the Nab3-U oligo, which differs in only three positions from Bre5-U (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Binding to the Nab3 column was significantly different from Bre5, with strong association of the Nab3-A and Nab3-U oligo, but low association with the Bre5 target oligos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table S2). We conclude that Bre5 can bind RNA in vitro, with some sequence specificity.</p><p>To determine whether Bre5 also directly binds RNA in vivo, we used the approach of UV crosslinking and analysis of cDNA (CRAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Granneman et al., 2009</xref>). Actively growing cultures expressing Bre5-HTP were briefly UV-irradiated (100 s) and Bre5-HTP was recovered under stringent, denaturing conditions. Bound RNA was partially degraded, amplified by RT-PCR and identified by illumina sequencing. Mapping the reads to the yeast genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) showed a predominance of RNAPII targets, particularly protein-coding genes, although hits in rRNA and tRNAs were also recovered at lower frequency. Compared to Bre5, the untagged control recovered an average of ~15 fold fewer total reads following PCR amplification. Numbers of mapped reads are indicated below the bar graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.</p><p>A metagene analysis of the distribution of Bre5 binding across all protein-coding genes was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–G</xref>). Alignment by the transcription start site (TSS) revealed marked depletion of Bre5 over the promoter proximal region of ~150 nt relative to sites further 3’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, strong enrichment was seen for Bre5 binding ~200 nt upstream from the mRNA 3’ cleavage and polyadenylation sites, followed by a sharp decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Comparison of Bre5 binding on intron-containing, protein-coding genes aligned by the 3’ splice site showed enrichment on the exon 2 regions relative to exon 1 or introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Since Bre5 binding is elevated close to the poly(A) site, it seemed possible that this was responsible for the apparent exon 2 signal. However, stratifying the data by exon 2 length revealed that the high signal at the 5’ end of exon 2 persisted even on genes with exon 2 longer than 600nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Bre5 binding was most marked on genes with relatively short exon 2 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), on which transcription pausing is reported to be stronger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2010</xref>). We also examined the distribution of Bre5 on individual genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This showed the same trends as the metagene analysis.</p><p>To identify preferred targets for Bre5 binding in vivo, sequences generated by CRAC were analyzed to identify potential recognition motifs using MEME (see Experimental Procedures). Analyses of two independent, replica data sets each identified the motif UUUG as the strongest interaction target, present in 70% of target sequences analyzed (e &gt; 10<sup>−120</sup>). As a positive control, CRAC data for the RNA-binding protein Nab3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bresson et al., 2017</xref>) were similarly analyzed and identified the previously reported UUCU-binding site. Analysis of negative control data from the BY control strain, Rpo21 (the large subunit of RNAPII) or the histone methyl-transferases Set1 and Set2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sayou et al., 2017</xref>), identified no clearly enriched motifs.</p><p>Bre5 forms a stable dimer with the ubiquitin protease Ubp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that Bre5 might be recruited to nascent transcripts through binding of Ubp3 to ubiquitinated forms of RNAPII or other transcription factors. To assess this, crosslinking of Bre5-HTP was performed in a <italic>ubp3∆</italic> strain. In the absence of Ubp3, we saw increased relative Bre5 binding close to the TSS, whereas binding in exon 2 and close to the poly(A) site was not clearly altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E and F</xref>). This observation indicates that the major pathway for Bre5 recruitment does not involve Ubp3 binding to ubiquitinated substrates. Rsp5 was previously reported to ubiquitinate Rpo21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harreman et al., 2009</xref>), so Bre5-HTP crosslinking was also tested in an <italic>rsp5-3</italic> temperature sensitive (ts) strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neumann et al., 2003</xref>) following transfer to non-permissive temperature (37°C). No clear differences were observed close to the TSS or poly(A) sites. A modest reduction was observed in Bre5 binding to RNAPII transcripts at the 5’ ends of exon 2 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G, H and I</xref>). It is unclear whether this is a direct consequence of reduced activity of Rsp5, which is highly pleiotropic. We conclude that Bre5 can bind RNAPII transcripts independently of Ubp3, with elevated binding in exon 2 regions of spliced pre-mRNA and upstream of the 3’ cleavage and polyadenylation sites.</p><p>To assess binding of Bre5 to unspliced pre-mRNAs relative to splicing products, the number of reads spanning the spliced (exon-exon, EE) to unspliced junctions (exon-intron, EI and intron-exon, IE) was calculated as 2EE/(EI + IE) for each transcript and averaged between replicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Milligan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tuck and Tollervey, 2013</xref>). An 2EE/(EI + IE) ratio &gt;1 indicates preferential binding after pre-mRNA splicing. For the large subunit of RNAPII, Rpo21, the 2EE/(EI + IE) ratio was 0.2, showing the expected association with unspliced nascent transcripts. For Bre5, the ratio was 30, indicating preferential binding to the spliced products (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table S2). Notably, the 2EE/(EI + IE) ratio was further increased for Bre5 in the <italic>ubp3∆</italic> strain, largely due to reduced intron binding, indicating that Upb3 does contribute to early pre-mRNA recruitment of Bre5. In contrast, no clear differences were seen in the Bre5 strain also carrying the ts-lethal <italic>rsp5-3</italic> mutation at either 23°C or 37°C.</p><p>We interpret the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table S2, as indicating that Bre5-Ubp3 associates with the transcript following the successful completion of splicing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Loss of Bre5 results in RNAPII stalling and decreased mRNA on an inducible reporter</title><p>Inspection of the distribution of Bre5 hits over exon 2 of pre-mRNAs, showed that binding was highest on genes with short exon 2 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G and H</xref>).

In the wild-type strain, pre-mRNA was detected after 5 min, followed by the appearance of spliced mRNA at 6 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The mRNA levels then climbed progressively while pre-mRNA levels remained relatively constant. In the <italic>bre5∆</italic> strain, pre-mRNA and mRNA were also detected after 5 min and 6 min, respectively. However, subsequent pre-mRNA levels were higher than in the wild-type, and mRNA failed to strongly accumulate. We conclude that splicing of the pre-mRNA reporter is strongly inhibited in the absence of Bre5.</p><p>In the wild-type, RNAPII levels show a striking periodicity following induction of the reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–G</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2010b</xref>). In the <italic>bre5∆</italic> strain, this periodicity was disrupted, with longer apparent pause durations. Notably, at the 5’ splice site there is little clear pausing in the wild-type but much stronger signals in <italic>bre5∆</italic> strains (Probe 2). In contrast, the wild-type RNAPII signals are high in the 3’ region of exon2 (Probe 5), but much lower in <italic>bre5∆,</italic> suggesting that RNAPII is delayed or lost prior to this region in the mutant. The accumulation of RNAPII in the vicinity of the 5’ splice site (probe 2) was initially surprising, but there is a clear precedent in a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chathoth et al., 2014</xref>) that defects in pre-mRNA splicing lead to the accumulation of RNAPII at the 5’ SS.</p><p>We interpret the data as showing that the oscillation in RNAPII association with the splicing reporter seen following initial induction is slower in the <italic>bre5∆</italic> strain.

To affinity purify RNAPII, we made use of a C-terminal fusion between Rpb3 and a tripartite tag containing calmodulin-binding peptide, a TEV-cleavage site and protein A (Rpb3-TAP). This was expressed from the chromosomal <italic>Rpb3</italic> locus under the control of the endogenous promoter and was fully functional with growth being indistinguishable from the wild type. Ubiquitinated RNAPII subunits were affinity purified from wild-type, <italic>ubp3∆</italic> and <italic>bre5∆</italic> strains by a His6-Ubiquitin expressed from the <italic>P<sub>CUP1</sub></italic> promoter on a <italic>CEN</italic> plasmid, gel purified, subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and analyzed by MS. This identified a number of sites that carried an additional lysine residue, derived from cleavage of attached ubiquitin molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Ubiquitination of Rpo21 was detected at sites K452, K695 and K1246 in the wild-type strain. However, only ubiquitination of K1246 was detected in the <italic>bre5∆</italic> strain. In the <italic>ubp3∆</italic> strain, ubiquitination was detected at K695, and multiple peptides were recovered for K1246. Ubiquitination at K695 was not clearly altered in the <italic>ubp3∆</italic> strain. In the <italic>bre5∆</italic> strain, ubiquitination was detected only at K1246. A site of ubiquitination was also detected at Lys886 in Rbp2, the second largest RNAPII subunit, but ubiquitination at this site was not clearly altered by the absence of either Bre5 or Ubp3. Ubiquitin with both K48 and K63 linkages was identified in the wild-type and <italic>ubp3∆</italic> samples, making it unclear what linkage is present at K1246.</p><p>Multiple sites of ubiquitination were detected in RNAPII, and all should be enriched by purification. If ubiquitination is increased only at one site, this should be elevated relative to linear, unmodified peptides, which reflect the total recovery of Ub Rpo21. The intensities corresponding to modified peptides in each sample were normalized to the intensities of multiple, linear, non-modified peptides from Rpo21. Relative to total Ub Rpo21, the level of K1246 ubiquitination was estimated to be approximately five fold higher in <italic>ubp3∆</italic> than the wild type, while the level of K695 was not clearly altered. This calculation is expected to under estimate the increased since the K1246 ubiquitination will contribute to total Ub Rpo21. Comparison to peptides from ‘background’ proteins indicated that the abundance of K1246 ubiquitination was approximately 10 fold elevated in the <italic>ubp3∆</italic> strain.</p><p>To generate better quantitation by MS, we applied a targeted acquisition methodology - PRM (parallel reaction monitoring). PRM or SRM (selected reaction monitoring) are widely adopted strategies utilized to perform sensitive and reproducible quantitation of peptides including ubiquitinated peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallien et al., 2014</xref>). In brief, during acquisition, the mass spectrometer isolates only precursors corresponding to peptides of interest. The selected mass (precursor) is fragmented and obtained fragment ions are recorded. The intensity of selected fragment ions is then used for quantitation. For the analyses, Rpb3 was purified as described above, FASP digested and analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos operated in PRM mode. Both modified (VVRPK*SLDAETEAEEDHMLK) and unmodified (VVRPK) peptides were readily detected in all samples containing Rpo21 co-purified with Rpb3-TAP (wild type, <italic>bre5Δ</italic> and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>) and not in an untagged strain. Quantitation was performed on y10-y18 fragment ions by averaging intensity of the most intense ions between the replicas. These analyses indicated that levels of K1246-Ub in <italic>bre5Δ</italic> and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> are 1.6 and 10.5 times higher, respectively, than in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

However, the position of the base of this loop (P1245 and E1253; residues shown as space filling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) strongly indicates that the site of ubiquitination lies close to the entrance to the active site of the polymerase. Ubiquitin in this position appears likely to clash with the entry of the DNA duplex into the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), and may also interfere with binding of transcription elongation factors, potentially explaining the basis for stalling of RNAPII by ubiquitination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Ubiquitinated RNAPII is enriched over exon 2 of intron-containing genes</title><p>To map the locations of RNAPII containing ubiquitinated Rpo21, we applied modification CRAC (mCRAC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Milligan et al., 2016</xref>).

However, a double mutation of Rpo21 K330R plus K695R was lethal, showing that these sites functionally overlap despite being far apart in the RNAPII structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Somesh et al., 2007</xref>). Our analysis, in the absence of UV damage, identified ubiquitination at K1246 and K695, but not K330. This suggests the possibility that in RNAPII stalled by different mechanisms, splicing versus DNA damage, alternative ubiquitin ligases are recruited that lead to different primary ubiquitination sites, K1246 versus K330, respectively, with K695 providing an alternative site in each case. Based on genetic interaction data, we tested Ubr2 as a candidate E3 ligase, but saw no effects in the splicing reporter construct. A plausible alternative candidate is the splicing factor Prp19, an E3 ligase that adds K63 ubiquitin chains to Prp3 during the spicing reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Song et al., 2010</xref>). However, the ubiquitin ligase activity of Prp19 is required for splicing to proceed, making it difficult to determine whether it is also involved in splicing-dependent transcription pausing. Prp3 is deubiquitinated by Usp4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Song et al., 2010</xref>), and is therefore unlikely to be a target for Bre5-Ubp3.</p><p>The striking similarities between sites of Bre5 binding and elevated Ub-RNAPII, and the anti-correlated pattern in the Rpo21K1246R mutant, strongly support the model that this is the major, functionally relevant ubiquitination site under normal growth conditions. Bre5 binding and Ub-RNAPII were both depleted close to the TSS and elevated upstream from the poly(A) site and in exon 2. The preferential binding of Bre5 and RNAPII ubiquitination in exon 2 suggested a potential functional relationship to reports of splicing-induced transcription pausing in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this, the absence of Bre5 or the loss of its RNA-binding activity had the effect of increasing co-transcriptional splicing efficiency, presumably as a consequence of increased pausing. Dramatic effects on a splicing reporter construct were seen in the absence of Bre5 following rapid induction, which were consistent with strongly enhanced transcription pausing. We postulate that during the initial rounds of cotranscriptional splicing on a naïve template, the system is more sensitive to perturbation.</p><p>These findings suggest the model that the normal function of splicing-linked RNAPII ubiquitination is to transiently slow or pause the polymerase to promote cotranscriptional splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we expressed the ubiquitation-resistant Rpo21K1246R mutant, with the expectation that lack of ubiquitation would reduce transcriptional pausing and, hence, the efficiency of cotranscriptional splicing. This was shown to be the case for individual genes, which showed increased levels of pre-mRNAs that were unspliced but 3’ cleaved and polyadenylated. RNA-seq analyses on total poly(A)<sup>+</sup> selected RNA confirmed this result transcriptome wide, when either all reads mapping to exons vs intron were compared, or splicing was more specifically assessed by comparing the ratio of sequence reads spanning exon<underline>–</underline>exon junction (spliced RNA) to exon<underline>–</underline>intron plus intron<underline>–</underline>exon junctions (unspliced). The finding that splicing was impaired by loss of the ubiquitination site in RNAPII, supports the model that efficient cotranscriptional splicing involves a ubiquitination/deubiquitination cycle.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27082.026</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for splicing-linked RNAPII ubiquitination and de-ubiquitination.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transcription on intron-containing gene.

Previous analyses have identified important roles for RNAPII modification in promoting the recruitment of splicing factors. However, this involved the reversible phosphorylation of residues in the repetitive, regulatory C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNAPII large subunit. In contrast, the K1246 ubiquitination site is distant from both the CTD and the RNA exit channel, making it less likely to directly interact with either the nascent transcript or the splicing machinery. Alternatively, the K1246R mutation might be postulated to alter the RNAPII elongation rate independent of RNA-processing events. The sequence data show only relative distribution of RNAPII along genes, not absolute levels, making changes in global elongation rates hard to assess. However, previously reported mutations that alter elongation rates map to the trigger loop, which is located in the enzymatic center of the polymerase distant from the position of K1246 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaplan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Given that the large majority of yeast genes lack introns, poly(A) site proximal changes in RNAPII occupancy and Bre5 binding are presumably generally independent of splicing. Conversely, elevated Bre5 occupancy at the 5’ end of exon 2 appears to be independent of cleavage and polyadenylation, since it was observed even on genes with long exon 2 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Previous reports of slowed RNAPII elongation on exon 2 regions have posited both splicing-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2010b</xref>) and splicing-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2010</xref>) mechanisms. It may be that both conclusions are correct, with different mechanisms operating at different locations. The mechanism by which ubiquitination might slow elongation has not been determined but, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, the position of the ubiquitin moiety on the catalytic component of RNAPII might be expected to interfere with entry of the DNA duplex into the active site. An alternative, non-exclusive, possibility might that ubiquitin addition interferes with back-tracking of stalled RNAPII complexes.</p><p>Major changes in RNAPII phosphorylation and apparent processivity take place close to the site of pre-mRNA 3’ cleavage and polyadenylation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conaway and Conaway, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hsin and Manley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Porrua and Libri, 2015</xref>]). We speculate that a surveillance or RNAPII remodeling step may occur upstream of the poly(A) site, as recently proposed for human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laitem et al., 2015</xref>). This location is apparently associated with RNAPII ubiquitination as shown by the peaks of Ub-RNAPII and Bre5 binding at this position. RNAPII that is ubiquitination-resistant due to the Rpo21K<sub>1296</sub>R mutation showed a notably reduced density upstream of the poly(A) site relative to total RNAPII. This indicates that it may be less prone to pausing in this region and potentially avoids this surveillance activity. However, the Rpo21K<sub>1296</sub>R RNAPII shows increased occupancy downstream of the poly(A) site. We speculate that changes to RNAPII that would normally accompany the pause upstream of the poly(A) site are absent or reduced in the Rpo21K<sub>1296</sub>R mutant, leading to subsequent impairment of transcript release.</p><p>Finally, we note that Ubp3 was previously reported to interact with the chromatin-silencing factor Sir4, along with Sir2 and Sir3, while loss of Ubp3 was reported to increase the efficiency of gene silencing near telomeres and the inactive <italic>HML</italic> mating type locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moazed and Johnson, 1996</xref>). Based on our data, we hypothesize that this reflects increased RNAPII pausing or stalling in silenced genomic regions in the absence of Bre5-Ubp3-mediated deubiquitination. We also note that several recent reports link changes in alternative pre-mRNA splicing in human cells to RNAPII elongation rates (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Naftelberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saldi et al., 2016</xref>]) and speculate that reversible ubiquitination of the transcribing polymerase may participate in regulating this activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and yeast culture</title><p>Standard procedures were used for the propagation and maintenance of yeast.

Frozen yeast pellets from untagged and Rpb3-TAP, Rpb3TAP/ ∆bre5 and Rpb3-TAP/∆ubp3 cells, obtained from exponentially growing cells in YPDA (optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm), were resuspended in TMN150 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% NP-40, 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 20 μM Lactacystin, 2 mM N-ethylmalemide). Clarified extract was incubated with Dynabeads M-270 Epoxy (Invitrogen) coupled to rabbit IgG (Sigma) as described (ref Fridy et al. Nature Protocols 2014) for 1 hr at 4°C. Bound protein was denatured off the column in 0.1% Rapigest (Waters) for 30 min at 60˚C. The samples were then prepared for Mass spectrometry by Filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wiśniewski et al., 2009</xref>). In brief, proteins were reduced in 10 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37°C, alkylated in 55 mM iodoacetamide for 20 min at room temperature in the dark, and digested at 37°C overnight with 12.5 ng/μl trypsin (Proteomics; Grade; Sigma). Following digestion, samples were then acidified with equal volume of 0.1% of trifluoroacetic acid and spun onto StageTips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rappsilber et al., 2003</xref>).

To prepare an analytical column with a self-assembled particle frit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishihama et al., 2002</xref>), C<sub>18</sub> material (3 μm ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ; Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany) was packed into a spray emitter (75 μm inner diameter, 8 μm opening, 70 mm length; New Objectives, United States) by using an air pressure pump (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water and mobile phase B of 80% acetonitrile in0.1% formic acid. Peptides were loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 0.5 μL min<sup>−1</sup> and eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 μL min<sup>−1</sup> according to the following gradient: 2% to 40% mobile phase B in 150 min and then to 95% in 11 min. Mobile phase B was then reduced to 2% until 180 min. FTMS spectra were recorded at 60,000 resolution (scan range 300–1700 m/z) and the twenty most intense peaks with charge ≥2 of the MS scan were selected with an isolation window of 2.0 Thomson in the ion trap for MS2 (normal scan, wideband activation, filling 5.0E5 ions for MS scan, 1.0E4 ions for MS2, maximum fill time 100 ms, dynamic exclusion for 60 s). Searches were conducted using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science) against the complete <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> protein database (<italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database, November 2009). MS accuracy was set to 6 ppm and MS/MS tolerance to ±0.6 Da. Trypsin was used as enzyme allowing two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was chosen as fixed modification, while oxidation of methionine and di-glycine of lysine were chosen as variable modifications.</p><p>For quantitative MS, all targeted analyses were performed on high resolution/accurate mass Orbitrap Fusion Lumos instrument (Thermo) coupled to Ultimate3000 RSLC system fitted with EasySpray column (50 cm 2 μm particles). Targeted analyses were performed in scheduled tSIMtMS2 mode with a following parameters – 1.6 m/z isolation window, AGC target was set to 5e4 for both MS1 and MS2 and injection time was set to 70 ms. Retention time and m/z of targeted peptides were selected on the base of the prior experiments. Data analysis was performed in Skyline 3.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacLean et al., 2010</xref>), using the following filtering settings: retention time was considered within 4 min of MS/MS ID, and mass tolerance at fragment ion level – 4ppm.

The figure showed enrichment of ubiquitinated Rpo21, purified via the expression of Ub-His6. However, Ub-His is expressed under the control of a P<sub>CUP</sub> promoter, whereas endogenous ubiquitin is largely generated from fusions with ribosomal proteins. In consequence, the fraction of Ub that is expected to be expressed with the tag is low, lead to poor signal to noise ratio.</p><p>In the revised text, we point out that data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> show an increase in RNA recovery with Rpo21-Ub in the <italic>bre5∆</italic> strain (subsection “Ubiquinated RNAPII is enriched over exon 2 of intron-containing genes”, first paragraph).

First, we estimated 5-fold relative enrichment of K1246 in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> background normalized to several peptides representing global Rpo21 ubiquitination. This estimate is based on Ub-his enriched data, and therefore reflects levels of ubiquitination at K1246 relative to other all sites ubiquitination. This clearly indicated that only K1246 was elevated in the <italic>ubp3∆</italic> strain. In addition, we applied targeted acquisition (PRM) to assay level of K1246-Ub modification in affinity purified Rpo21-Rpb3TAP. Targeted methodologies such as PRM or SRM are utilized for precise and sensitive quantitation of K-GG modified peptides. The modified peptide containing K1246-Ub was readily detected by PRM experiment in all strains containing Rpo21 and not in untagged strain as expected. We quantified intensity of y13-y19 fragment ions originating from the modified peptide in two independent biological replicas and conclusively established that level of Rpo21 K1246-Ub is 1.6 fold higher in <italic>bre5∆</italic> and at least 10.5 fold higher in <italic>upb3∆</italic> than in the wild type.

Treatment of RNAPII with Ubp3-Bre5 is very likely to result in deubiquitination at all sites. Establishing a specific deubiquitination system would be very useful for future analyses, but we feel that this lies beyond the scope of the current manuscript. Clearly the K1246R site cannot be deubiquitinated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> data is hard to follow: mCRAC protocol is poorly explained especially the nature of GST-MD and MultiDsk.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text (subsection “Ubiquinated RNAPII is enriched over exon 2 of intron-containing genes”) and the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to make these points clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is 5C showing?</p></disp-quote><p>This panel was of limited use and for clarity it has been omitted from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5D-F lack statistical analysis (confidence intervals).</p></disp-quote><p>Confidence intervals are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does this data match the Bre5 CRAC data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, CRAC data are not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

We show these data together with Ub-Rpo21 because, if Ub-RNAPII is associated with slowed elongation, we would expect its distribution to be anti-correlated with the non-Ub mutant K1246R. This was indeed seen for both 3’SS and poly(A) proximal regions. We have altered the text (subsection “Ubiquinated RNAPII is enriched over exon 2 of intron-containing genes”) to better explain this important point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="SA3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27082.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Proudfoot</surname><given-names>Nick J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of Oxford</institution><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

In consequence, amplification of the experimental background generates sequence reads in the negative control samples. This is always seen in CLIP and CRAC analyses. As noted in the text, the untagged control recovered ~15 fold fewer total reads than Bre5 following PCR amplification. We have altered the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> to indicate the relative recoveries, in numbers of mapped reads, above the bar graphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> reporter data looks very nice. However the probe 2 data needs more discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The accumulation of RNAPII in the vicinity of the 5’ splice site (probe 2) was initially surprising, but there is a clear precedent for this. Work by the Beggs lab (Chathoth et al., 2014) showed that other defects in pre-mRNA splicing lead to the accumulation of RNAPII at the 5’ SS. We discuss this in the revised text (subsection “Loss of Bre5 results in RNAPII stalling and decreased mRNA on an inducible reporter”, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Should comment on why generally there is a reduction in RNAPII ChIP oscillation with BRE ko except for probe 2 which gives an opposite effect. Clearly the loss of mRNA accumulation (panel B) is very significant.</p></disp-quote><p>We interpret the data as showing that the oscillation is slower but covers a greater region of the transcription unit. This would be consistent with a delay in the release of the paused polymerases. We have altered the text (subsection “Loss of Bre5 results in RNAPII stalling and decreased mRNA on an inducible reporter”, fifth paragraph) to include this interpretation of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: These data are barely described (especially 3B and 3C).</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a more complete description of these results in the revised text (subsection “Loss of Bre5 affects splicing on endogenous genes”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3A appears to contradict <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> CRAC data.</p></disp-quote><p>No CRAC data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

The figure showed enrichment of ubiquitinated Rpo21, purified via the expression of Ub-His6. However, Ub-His is expressed under the control of a P<sub>CUP</sub> promoter, whereas endogenous ubiquitin is largely generated from fusions with ribosomal proteins. In consequence, the fraction of Ub that is expected to be expressed with the tag is low, lead to poor signal to noise ratio.</p><p>In the revised text, we point out that data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> show an increase in RNA recovery with Rpo21-Ub in the <italic>bre5∆</italic> strain (subsection “Ubiquinated RNAPII is enriched over exon 2 of intron-containing genes”, first paragraph).

First, we estimated 5-fold relative enrichment of K1246 in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> background normalized to several peptides representing global Rpo21 ubiquitination. This estimate is based on Ub-his enriched data, and therefore reflects levels of ubiquitination at K1246 relative to other all sites ubiquitination. This clearly indicated that only K1246 was elevated in the <italic>ubp3∆</italic> strain. In addition, we applied targeted acquisition (PRM) to assay level of K1246-Ub modification in affinity purified Rpo21-Rpb3TAP. Targeted methodologies such as PRM or SRM are utilized for precise and sensitive quantitation of K-GG modified peptides. The modified peptide containing K1246-Ub was readily detected by PRM experiment in all strains containing Rpo21 and not in untagged strain as expected. We quantified intensity of y13-y19 fragment ions originating from the modified peptide in two independent biological replicas and conclusively established that level of Rpo21 K1246-Ub is 1.6 fold higher in <italic>bre5∆</italic> and at least 10.5 fold higher in <italic>upb3∆</italic> than in the wild type. Three additional authors have been included in respect to these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also the direct demonstration that K1246 (but not K1246R) is deubiquitinated by Ubp3-Bre5 is required.</p></disp-quote><p>Our understanding is that reproducing site-specific deubiquitination in vitro is very difficult. Treatment of RNAPII with Ubp3-Bre5 is very likely to result in deubiquitination at all sites. Establishing a specific deubiquitination system would be very useful for future analyses, but we feel that this lies beyond the scope of the current manuscript. Clearly the K1246R site cannot be deubiquitinated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> data is hard to follow: mCRAC protocol is poorly explained especially the nature of GST-MD and MultiDsk.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text (subsection “Ubiquinated RNAPII is enriched over exon 2 of intron-containing genes”) and the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to make these points clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is 5C showing?</p></disp-quote><p>This panel was of limited use and for clarity it has been omitted from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5D-F lack statistical analysis (confidence intervals).</p></disp-quote><p>Confidence intervals are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does this data match the Bre5 CRAC data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, CRAC data are not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

We show these data together with Ub-Rpo21 because, if Ub-RNAPII is associated with slowed elongation, we would expect its distribution to be anti-correlated with the non-Ub mutant K1246R. This was indeed seen for both 3’SS and poly(A) proximal regions. We have altered the text (subsection “Ubiquinated RNAPII is enriched over exon 2 of intron-containing genes”) to better explain this important point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
