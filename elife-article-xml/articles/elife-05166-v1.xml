of pathogen variation, we sequenced all available specimens from patients diagnosed over 15 years in a whole district in Malawi. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> lineages were assigned and transmission networks constructed, allowing ≤10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) difference. We defined disease as due to recent infection if the network-determined source was within 5 years, and assessed transmissibility from forward transmissions resulting in disease. High-quality sequences were available for 1687 disease episodes (72% of all culture-positive episodes): 66% of patients linked to at least one other patient. The between-patient mutation rate was 0.26 SNPs/year (95% CI 0.21–0.31). We showed striking differences by lineage in the proportion of disease due to recent transmission and in transmissibility (highest for lineage-2 and lowest for lineage-1) that were not confounded by immigration, HIV status or drug resistance. Transmissions resulting in disease decreased markedly over time.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05166.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05166.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05166.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tuberculosis is an important public health threat around the globe and is particularly common in developing countries. It is difficult to control the spread of the disease because the bacteria that cause it can spread when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. It may take years for an infected individual to develop symptoms of tuberculosis so it can be hard to trace the source of an outbreak, and people infected with HIV are particularly susceptible to the disease.</p><p>The bacterium that causes the majority of cases of tuberculosis is called <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. There are several different varieties or ‘lineages’ of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and it is thought that they may vary in their ability to spread and cause disease. However, the results of previous studies have been inconsistent and there also seems to be a lot of variation between strains within the same lineage.</p><p>In this study, Guerra-Assunção et al. used an approach called whole genome sequencing alongside more traditional methods to study the spread of tuberculosis in Malawi. They sequenced the genomes of every available sample of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> collected from patients in the Karonga district of Malawi over a 15-year period. This produced high-quality DNA sequence data about the bacteria responsible for almost 1700 cases of disease.</p><p>Using this massive amount of data, Guerra-Assunção et al. constructed networks that showed how the bacteria had spread in the community. This revealed that there were differences between the ability of the various <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> lineages to cause disease and to spread in communities. For example, lineage 1 was less likely than the other lineages to cause disease soon after infecting an individual and was less able to spread.</p><p>The data also show that the proportion of cases of disease due to recent infection declined substantially during the 15-year period. This indicates that the tuberculosis and HIV control programmes in the area have been successful.</p><p>Guerra-Assunção et al.'s findings show that it is possible to understand how tuberculosis is transmitted on a large scale. The next challenge is to understand why the lineages differ in their ability to cause disease and spread between individuals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05166.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05166.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>transmission</kwd><kwd>Malawi</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>096249/Z/11/B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crampin</surname><given-names>AC</given-names></name><name><surname>McNerney</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Parkhill</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>TG</given-names></name><name><surname>Glynn</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A study of tuberculosis cases in the Karonga district of Malawi reveals that the main lineages of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> differ in their transmission patterns and virulence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite the huge global burden of tuberculosis, the factors influencing transmission remain poorly understood. Compared to other bacteria, the genome of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is stable and genetic variation was thought to be limited, but with increased sequencing, greater diversity has been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Homolka et al., 2010</xref>). Based on the genotype, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has seven lineages: three ‘ancient’ (lineage-1 and two <italic>Mycobacterium africanum</italic> lineages), and three ‘modern’ (lineages-2, 3, 4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Comas et al., 2009</xref>), and one intermediate (lineage-7), recently described in Ethiopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Firdessa et al., 2013</xref>). The lineages may vary in propensity to transmit and cause disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thwaites et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Homolka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parwati et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gagneux, 2012</xref>), but results are inconsistent and there is considerable strain-to-strain variation within lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Portevin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mathema et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Lineage-2 (Beijing) strains are associated with increasing spread and drug resistance in some areas but not others (European Concerted Action on New Generation Genetic Markers, 2006), and with a lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Click et al., 2012</xref>) or higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kong et al., 2007</xref>) proportion of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. <italic>M. africanum</italic> has been associated with lower virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Jong et al., 2008</xref>), and lineage-1 with faster sputum smear conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Click et al., 2013</xref>). In low incidence settings, lineage is often associated with immigrant sub-groups, and while host–pathogen co-evolution has been suggested, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of lineage and host susceptibility on pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reed et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gagneux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pareek et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Since the 1990s, methods such as RFLP based on the insertion element IS6110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Embden et al., 1993</xref>) have been used to distinguish clusters of patients with shared DNA-fingerprint patterns, suggesting recent transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Small et al., 1994</xref>), but within the clusters, these methods cannot distinguish who transmitted to whom. Whole genome sequencing provides far greater resolution, and if data are collected in a whole population over several years, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be used to construct transmission networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bryant et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walker et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2014</xref>). In low-incidence settings small numbers of SNPs have been found between epidemiologically linked patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kato-Maeda et al., 2013</xref>), although the maximum SNP difference to ‘confirm’ a link is not yet established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Perez-Lago et al., 2014</xref>). No population-based study to-date has applied long-term large-scale whole genome sequencing in a high prevalence area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Walker et al., 2014</xref>), it is much more challenging to interpret transmission networks when there are many possible sources of infection. Yet understanding transmission in high prevalence areas would have the greatest public health benefit.</p><p>As part of the Karonga Prevention Study in Malawi, we assess transmission using whole genome sequencing in the whole district over 15 years. We show decreasing transmission over time and marked variation between <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> lineages 1–4 which are unconfounded by host differences.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Between September 1995 and September 2010, there were 2332 person-episodes of culture-confirmed tuberculosis in Karonga District. Whole genome sequences that passed quality control were available for 1687 (72%). The distribution of patients with and without sequences available was very similar by age, sex, and HIV status. The proportion with sequences available was the highest in 2002–2006 (82%) and was higher in those with smear-negative pulmonary disease (78%) than in those with smear-positive disease (71%) and extra-pulmonary disease (67%).</p><p>The phylogenetic tree is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Most <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains (68%) were lineage-4, with 16% lineage-1, 4% lineage-2, and 12% lineage-3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Lineage-4 strains were more common in the earlier years. Lineage-1 strains were more common in HIV-positive and older patients and less common in recurrent tuberculosis. Lineage-2 strains were more common in younger patients and were all drug sensitive. Lineage-3 strains were associated with recurrent tuberculosis and with isoniazid resistance. There was no association between lineage and having been born or recently resident outside the district. The associations of lineage with HIV status and recurrent tuberculosis persisted after adjusting for age, sex, and year. The association between lineage and recurrent tuberculosis was also present when restricted to those with drug-sensitive strains, and the association between lineage and isoniazid resistance was also present when restricted to those with first episode tuberculosis.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05166.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic tree of all samples from Karonga.</title><p>Lineages form monophyletic groups within the phylogeny, as expected.

Place of birth and recent residence were weakly associated with onward transmission, and further adjusting for these or the other factors in the table did not affect the results.<table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05166.013</object-id><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Characteristics associated with transmissibility</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05166.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05166.013</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Characteristic</th><th colspan="2">Any Linked/Total</th><th>Association with links</th><th rowspan="2">p</th><th>Adjusted for age, sex, year, lineage, smear status</th><th rowspan="2">p (lrtest)</th></tr><tr><th>n/N</th><th>%</th><th>OR (95% CI)</th><th>OR (95% CI)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Overall</td><td>431/1346</td><td>32.0</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="7">Lineage</td></tr><tr><td> 1</td><td>59/217</td><td>27.2</td><td>0.87 (0.63–1.2)</td><td/><td>0.94 (0.66–1.3)</td><td/></tr><tr><td> 2</td><td>27/61</td><td>44.3</td><td>1.7 (1.0–2.7)</td><td/><td>1.9 (1.1–3.2)</td><td/></tr><tr><td> 3</td><td>65/154</td><td>42.2</td><td>1.6 (1.2–2.3)</td><td/><td>1.9 (1.4–2.7)</td><td/></tr><tr><td> 4</td><td>280/914</td><td>30.6</td><td>1</td><td>0.006</td><td>1</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7">Age</td></tr><tr><td> &lt;20</td><td>20/50</td><td>40.0</td><td>2.3 (1.2–4.4)</td><td/><td>1.9 (0.98–3.7)</td><td/></tr><tr><td> 20–29</td><td>134/349</td><td>38.4</td><td>2.3 (1.5–3.3)</td><td/><td>2.2 (1.5–3.3)</td><td/></tr><tr><td> 30–39</td><td>159/490</td><td>32.5</td><td>1.7 (1.2–2.5)</td><td/><td>2.0 (1.3–2.9)</td><td/></tr><tr><td> 40–49</td><td>71/238</td><td>29.8</td><td>1.6 (1.0–2.4)</td><td/><td>1.7 (1.1–2.7)</td><td/></tr><tr><td> 50+</td><td>47/219</td><td>21.5</td><td>1</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>1</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7">Sex</td></tr><tr><td> Female</td><td>239/718</td><td>33.3</td><td>1</td><td/><td>1</td><td/></tr><tr><td> Male</td><td>192/628</td><td>30.6</td><td>0.87 (0.69–1.1)</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.93 (0.73–1.2)</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7">Year</td></tr><tr><td> 1995–1998</td><td>159/314</td><td>50.6</td><td>1</td><td/><td>1</td><td/></tr><tr><td> 1999–2001</td><td>119/345</td><td>34.5</td><td>0.49 (0.36–0.66)</td><td/><td>0.42 (0.31–0.58)</td><td/></tr><tr><td> 2002–2004</td><td>95/389</td><td>24.4</td><td>0.30 (0.22–0.41)</td><td/><td>0.27 (0.19–0.37)</td><td/></tr><tr><td> 2005–2007</td><td>58/298</td><td>19.5</td><td>0.22 (0.16–0.32)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>0.20 (0.14–0.29)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7">TB type</td></tr><tr><td> Smear pos pulm</td><td>338/1003</td><td>33.7</td><td>1</td><td/><td>1</td><td/></tr><tr><td> Smear neg pulm</td><td>93/343</td><td>27.1</td><td>0.72 (0.55–0.94)</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.73 (0.55–0.96)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7">HIV status</td></tr><tr><td> HIV−</td><td>91/318</td><td>28.6</td><td>1</td><td/><td>1</td><td/></tr><tr><td> HIV+ no ART</td><td>170/540</td><td>31.5</td><td>1.1 (0.83–1.5)</td><td/><td>1.1 (0.81–1.6)</td><td/></tr><tr><td> HIV+ on ART</td><td>11/48</td><td>22.9</td><td>0.70 (0.35–1.4)</td><td>0.3</td><td>1.4 (0.62–3.1)</td><td>0.6</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7">Previous TB</td></tr><tr><td> No</td><td>391/1200</td><td>32.6</td><td>1</td><td/><td>1</td><td/></tr><tr><td> Yes</td><td>40/146</td><td>27.4</td><td>0.77 (0.53–1.1)</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.85 (0.58–1.3)</td><td>0.4</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7">INH resistance</td></tr><tr><td> No</td><td>402/1237</td><td>32.5</td><td>1</td><td/><td>1</td><td/></tr><tr><td> Yes</td><td>29/100</td><td>29.0</td><td>0.86 (0.55–1.3)</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.86 (0.54–1.4)</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7">Recent residence</td></tr><tr><td> Karonga</td><td>284/942</td><td>30.2</td><td>1</td><td/><td>1</td><td/></tr><tr><td> Other Malawi</td><td>80/234</td><td>34.2</td><td>1.2 (0.89–1.6)</td><td/><td>1.0 (0.74–1.4)</td><td/></tr><tr><td> Other country</td><td>20/74</td><td>27.0</td><td>0.88(0.52–1.5)</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.57 (0.33–0.98)</td><td>0.09</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7">Birth place</td></tr><tr><td> Karonga</td><td>276/811</td><td>34.0</td><td>1</td><td/><td>1</td><td/></tr><tr><td> Other Malawi</td><td>80/272</td><td>29.4</td><td>0.83 (0.62–1.1)</td><td/><td>0.82 (0.60–1.1)</td><td/></tr><tr><td> Other country</td><td>64/234</td><td>27.4</td><td>0.77 (0.56–1.1)</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.71 (0.51–0.99)</td><td>0.08</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>The numbers of likely transmissions (‘forward links’) were compared by individual characteristics using ordered logistic regression.

We show that this approach is feasible and that with long-term, population-wide data, important inferences can be made about transmission. In this population, although lineage-4 has been present for longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glynn et al., 2010</xref>), lineages are not now associated with area of birth or recent residence, so differences by lineage are unlikely to be confounded by associations with host sub-populations.</p><p>The mutation rates in this study are consistent with those from other settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bryant et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walker et al., 2013</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ford et al., 2013</xref>). This is the largest study to measure between-patient mutation rates. Although the confidence intervals on the estimate are narrow, there is considerable variation as others have found. The measure assumes the correct source has been identified and uses the time interval between dates of when the disease was first diagnosed or specimen collection as necessarily crude approximations of the time since divergence of the samples from their common ancestor. Furthermore, there is a bottleneck on transmission: most infections probably arise from one or very few organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lurie, 1964</xref>), which may be minority strains in the first case. The within-patient estimate of mutation rate does not have the same measurement problems and gave a consistent result.</p><p>We showed striking differences between the lineages in cluster size, the proportion of disease due to recent transmission and transmissibility. Lineage-1 formed the smallest clusters, with the largest SNP differences. Patients with lineage-1 strains were the least likely to have disease due to recent transmission and were less likely to transmit and cause new cases than those with lineages 2 or 3. These observations suggest a lower propensity to cause disease, which may explain lineage-1's association with HIV infection, if it is less likely to cause active disease in those who are not immunosuppressed. Lineage-1 strains have been associated with lower virulence in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Narayanan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reiling et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Lineage-2 formed large clusters with small SNP differences. It had the highest proportion of disease due to recent transmission and the highest proportion of transmissions. Increased virulence in lineage-2 has been suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parwati et al., 2010</xref>), often in association with drug resistance, but in this population all lineage-2 strains were drug sensitive. Despite these associations that suggest higher virulence and transmissibility, the proportion of cases due to lineage-2 did not increase over the period. We have previously reported that lineage-2 was first detected in this area in 1991, initially increased, and then plateaued from around 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glynn et al., 2005a, 2010</xref>). This may explain the lower proportion of lineage-2 strains in the oldest age group. The high proportion of linked cases with lineage-2 could reflect few imported (and therefore unlinked) cases, although there was no association between lineage and immigration.</p><p>In contrast, lineage-3 increased as a proportion of tuberculosis cases over time. It was associated with an intermediate proportion of disease due to recent infection and high transmission. In this population, it is also associated with relapse. Lineage-4 had smaller cluster sizes than lineages 2 and 3. It remains the most common lineage in this population, although the proportion has fallen over time.</p><p>Over the period of the study, the proportion of cases due to recent transmission decreased from 46% to 30%, and the proportion of cases transmitting and giving rise to new cases of tuberculosis also fell markedly. This correlates with a reduction in tuberculosis incidence over this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mboma et al., 2013</xref>). It suggests a considerable success of the tuberculosis and HIV control programmes, despite the potential for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> transmission in antiretroviral clinics.</p><p>We found no association with HIV infection in the proportion of disease due to recent infection (in contrast to our findings with RFLP in the earlier period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Houben et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2010</xref>]) or in transmissibility. Social clustering of HIV-infected individuals may increase the opportunities for transmission to susceptible individuals who manifest disease, balancing out any decreased transmissibility. The change from our earlier findings could be due to the reduced transmission in the population and to the increasing use of isoniazid prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy in HIV-positive individuals.</p><p>In this study, we had high quality whole genome sequence data on 72% of culture-positive patients over 15 years. While this is a high proportion, links will be missed, and the best link found may not be the correct one (especially when there are multiple patients with identical strains). Missing links will lead to underestimation of the proportion of disease due to recent transmission and of transmissions. The missing and wrongly attributed links are likely to be randomly distributed, leading to non-differential misclassification of linkage, and underestimation of associations with lineage and other factors.</p><p>This large, long-term study provides strong evidence for differences in transmission patterns and virulence between the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> lineages, particularly high transmissibility and virulence for lineages 2 and 3 and low transmissibility and virulence for lineage-1, which are unrelated to drug resistance, HIV infection, or host sub-population.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patients</title><p>In Karonga District, northern Malawi (population approximately 300,000), project staff at the hospital and peripheral health centres identify individuals with suspected tuberculosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crampin et al., 2009</xref>), and sputum and other specimens are taken.

This builds a minimum-spanning tree, minimizing the genomic distance between links and keeping the disease onset dates coherent. Based on our data, we allowed up to 10 SNPs difference for inclusion in the networks. The suitability of the cut-off was assessed by examination of the SNP differences within and between patients. We have previously shown in 92 patients in this data set with repeat samples from the same or different episodes of disease that, using the same pipeline, there is a clear bimodal distribution, with pairs of samples either having up to 8 SNPs between them or more than 100 SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guerra-Assuncao et al., 2014</xref>).

We estimated the between-patient mutation rate using linear regression of the number of SNPs by time between disease onset dates (taken as the date of first evidence of tuberculosis—the earliest of date of collection of the first positive sample, or registration or treatment) in the patients connected in the network. This analysis was repeated using dates of specimen collection. For comparison, we calculated the within-patient mutation rate, in individuals with more than one specimen from the same episode of disease or from a relapse, also using a cut-off of ≤10 SNPs.</p><p>We compared the size of the clusters by lineage. Among the likely transmissions (≤10 SNPs), we examined the number of SNP differences and mutation rates by lineage, and characteristics of the index and subsequent case, using non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon rank-sum and the equality-of-medians test).</p><p>For the analyses of risk factors for disease due to recently acquired infection and for transmissibility, we classified links with 6–10 SNPs different as uncertain unless the mutation rate was &lt;0.003 SNPs/day, to allow for larger changes over long time periods.

How are epidemiological transmission clusters related to the clusters from the RFLP analysis?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>This manuscript reports the results of a large-scale whole genome sequencing analysis of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates obtained in a population-based study in Malawi spanning 15 years. The study is unique in its scope and size. The analyses provide important insights in transmission dynamics, in particular in relation to major lineages. The manuscript is well written, the analyses are sound and the tables and figures are clear. In summary, an important contribution to the subject that deserves publication provided that some (overall rather minor) concerns are addressed.</p><p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> it seems that there are different individuals with isolates within the same RFLP that have up to 50 SNPs difference. Authors took a rather arbitrary cut-off for distinguishing links of up to 10 SNPs difference. It would be important to see to what extent their main findings are sensitive to this choice of cut-off, in particular the associations with, and differences in mutation rates for lineages. This could be done by repeating the main analyses at a higher cut-off.</p><p>In the Methods section: “We estimated the between-patient mutation rate (…) between disease onset dates (…)”. How were disease onset dates ascertained? Were diagnostic delays estimated and if so, how? How robust are these estimates? I would suspect that dates of onset are associated with date of diagnosis with certain elasticity, as will be the dates of specimen collection. Therefore predictor estimates may be confounded by determinants of (reported) delay. I am not sure that the multivariable analyses take this confounding sufficiently into account, and authors should acknowledge this potential shortcoming and its consequences for their conclusions in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>The authors should be commended for this excellent study which describes the largest collection of whole genome sequences of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates assembled to date. The central aim of the study was to use whole genome sequences to construct a transmission network of cases resident in a high prevalence setting. This is a challenging exercise as the complexity of transmission networks increases with incidence. The authors also used their data to estimate the evolutionary rate of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genome and the proportion of recent transmission events. This study extends the current knowledge of transmission and genetic variability occurring in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates from a high incidence setting.</p><p>The hypothesis that genetic distance is a measure of transmission is not validated within this setting: the authors should provide additional data to support the notion that isolates differing by less than 10 SNPs reflect transmission.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05166.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Kindly elaborate the analysis plan in relation to unraveling the transmission clusters</italic>, <italic>e.g. were there a priori hypothesis and criteria set out or was this determined in an ad hoc manner?

I am not sure that the multivariable analyses take this confounding sufficiently into account, and authors should acknowledge this potential shortcoming and its consequences for their conclusions in the Discussion section</italic>.</p><p>We have clarified that we used the date of first evidence of tuberculosis. (We have not attempted to estimate diagnostic delay). We have added this to the Discussion.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>The hypothesis that genetic distance is a measure of transmission is not validated within this setting: the authors should provide additional data to support the notion that isolates differing by less than 10 SNPs reflect transmission</italic>.</p><p>See our response above to reviewer 1. We have now added further data to justify this decision, based on repeat specimens from individuals and on comparisons between individuals with known epidemiological links.</p></body></sub-article></article>
