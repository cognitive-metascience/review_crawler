However, despite its clinical prevalence, very little is known about the action of TMS at the cellular level let alone what effect it might have at the subcellular level (e.g. dendrites). Here, we examine the effect of single-pulse TMS on dendritic activity in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex using an optical fiber imaging approach. We find that TMS causes GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated inhibition of sensory-evoked dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. We conclude that TMS directly activates fibers within the upper cortical layers that leads to the activation of dendrite-targeting inhibitory neurons which in turn suppress dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. This result implies a specificity of TMS at the dendritic level that could in principle be exploited for investigating these structures non-invasively.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13598.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13598.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13598.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain’s billions of neurons communicate with one another using electrical signals. Applying a magnetic field to a small area of the scalp can temporarily disrupt these signals by inducing small electrical currents in the brain tissue underneath. The currents interfere with the brain’s own electrical signals and temporarily disrupt the activity of the stimulated brain region.</p><p>This technique, which is known as transcranial magnetic stimulation, is often used to investigate the roles of specific brain regions. By examining what happens when a region is briefly taken ‘offline’, it is possible to deduce what that area normally does. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is also used to treat brain disorders ranging from epilepsy to schizophrenia without the need for surgery or drugs. But despite its widespread usage, little is known about how transcranial magnetic stimulation affects individual neurons.</p><p>Neurons are made up of a cell body, which has numerous short branches called dendrites, and a cable-like structure called the axon. Neurons signal to each other by releasing chemical messengers across junctions called synapses. The chemical signals are generally released from the axon of one neuron and bind to receptor proteins on a dendrite on another neuron to stimulate electrical activity in the receiving neuron.</p><p>Murphy et al. have now investigated how transcranial magnetic stimulation affects the activity of dendrites from neurons within the cortex of the rat brain. This revealed that the magnetic fields stimulate other neurons that inhibit the activity of dendrites from neurons within the deeper layers of the cortex. The inhibition process depends on a type of receptor protein in the dendrites called GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors; blocking these receptors prevents transcranial magnetic stimulation from altering the activity of stimulated brain regions.</p><p>The processes occurring in these dendrites have been linked to cognitive function. The next challenge will be to integrate the non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation approach with cognitive tests in humans that can now manipulate dendritic activity to test their importance under various circumstances.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13598.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13598.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>dendritic integration</kwd><kwd>transcranial magnetic stimulation</kwd><kwd>in vivo</kwd><kwd>GABAB inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SystemsX.ch (NeuroChoice)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Sean C</given-names></name><name><surname>Palmer</surname><given-names>Lucy M</given-names></name><name><surname>Larkum</surname><given-names>Matthew E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1085708</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palmer</surname><given-names>Lucy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1063533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palmer</surname><given-names>Lucy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 257 NeuroCure</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larkum</surname><given-names>Matthew E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_130694</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larkum</surname><given-names>Matthew E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Studying the activity of cortical neurons in rats reveals the subcellular effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation, which is used for the non-invasive treatment of a variety of brain disorders.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) holds great promise as a non-invasive method that can be used to both enhance and impair cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eldaief et al., 2013</xref>). As such, it has proved to be an important tool for addressing basic questions about brain function as well as for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fregni and Pascual-Leone, 2007</xref>). Stimulation is produced by generating a brief, high-intensity magnetic field by passing a brief electric current through a magnetic coil. As a general rule, TMS affects the action of feedback projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Juan and Walsh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Camprodon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zanto et al., 2011</xref>) leading to a disruption in perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shimojo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kammer et al., 2005</xref>). Due to this influence on higher order cognitive processing, TMS is not only useful for examining the interactions of different brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pascual-Leone and Walsh, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Silvanto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murd et al., 2012</xref>), but it has also been used as a therapeutic method to alleviate some of the symptoms of hemispatial neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nyffeler et al., 2009</xref>), schizophrenia including auditory hallucinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giesel et al., 2012</xref>), pain, depression and epilepsy. Despite great interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mueller et al., 2014</xref>), the cellular influence of TMS has yet to be ascertained since the precise effects of TMS at the level of a single neuron are very difficult to gauge, particularly in humans.</p><p>The neural architecture of the brain means the neural processes which receive and transform most synaptic inputs, the dendrites, extend into the upper layers where TMS would be most effective. Since dendrites can shape synaptic input to be greater or less than their linear sum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Polsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>) thereby altering the firing properties of the neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Larkum et al., 1999</xref>), the active properties of dendrites have attracted attention and have been linked to cognitive processes and feature selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lavzin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cichon and Gan, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, it has been suggested that active dendritic processing underlies a more general principle of cortical operation that facilitates parallel associations between different cortical regions and the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larkum, 2013</xref>) which is controlled by dendritic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Palmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lovett-Barron and Losonczy, 2014</xref>). Establishing the validity of this hypothesis will have important ramifications for understanding brain function as a whole. TMS presents a most promising way to study the causal relationship between active dendritic properties and cognition but only if its effect on dendrites can be understood and ultimately controlled.</p><p>Using an optical fiber imaging approach, here we present a study examining the effect of TMS on sensory-evoked dendritic activity in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex. We find that TMS suppresses dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity evoked by tactile stimulation and that this suppression can be abolished by blocking GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and excitatory transmission in the upper layers of the cortex. We uncover the cellular mechanisms underlying TMS-evoked inhibition, demonstrating that TMS of the rat brain activates long-range fibers that leads to the activation of dendrite-targeting inhibitory neurons in the upper cortical layers which in-turn suppress dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. Since indirect brain stimulation shows immense promise in treating many neurological disorders, such as epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berenyi et al., 2012</xref>), this study not only illustrates the cellular mechanisms underlying TMS but also highlights dendrites as potential targets for therapeutic approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in populations of layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neuron dendrites in the hindlimb somatosensory cortex of urethane anesthetized rats using a custom-made fiber optic 'periscope' in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Murayama et al., 2007</xref>) oriented horizontally for use in tandem with a TMS coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Pyramidal neurons located approximately 800 μm below the cortical surface were loaded with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Oregon Green BAPTA1 AM (OGB1 AM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> inset and see 'Materials and methods'). Using this approach, large dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to brief hindpaw stimulation (100 V, 1 ms) were reliably evoked after 70 min loading with OGB1 AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To investigate the effects of TMS on evoked cortical network activity, the TMS coil was positioned just above the craniotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and a single brief TMS pulse was evoked together with the stimulation of the hindpaw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) greater than 70 min post loading with OGB1 AM. TMS caused a significant decrease in the hindpaw-evoked dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> response when triggered 50 ms before hindpaw stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), both in the maximum amplitude (control, 7.3 ± 1.5 △F/F versus TMS, 5.0 ± 1.1 △F/F, n = 17, p&lt;0.05) and integral (control, 4.3 ± 0.9 △F/F•s versus TMS, 2.4 ± 0.6 △F/F•s; n = 17; p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

The lack of a direct response to TMS in L5 pyramidal neuron dendrites implies that the inhibition of sensory evoked dendritic transients was mediated by the action of inhibitory neurons.

TMS alone did not directly activate L5 pyramidal dendrites but instead activated axonal processes coursing through the upper layers and synapsing onto GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediating interneurons in L1. A similar form of synaptic activation of interneurons leading to inhibition in L5 pyramidal neuron dendrites has been shown previously with activation of callosal input to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Palmer et al., 2012</xref>). This form of 'silent' inhibition involves the activation of inhibitory conductances which are not detectable at the soma except through their eventual influence on the generation of action potential output. These results therefore highlight an effect of single-pulse TMS on the cortical network, which involves the activation of a specific cortical microcircuit.</p><p>The action of TMS at the cellular and network levels is extremely complex and likely constitutes the activation of a range of different cell types leading to multiple effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rossi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Siebner et al., 2009</xref>). A recent combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the biophysical underpinnings of TMS suggested that the generation of a magnetic field is most likely to evoke firing in cell bodies as opposed to dendrites or axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pashut et al., 2014</xref>). This is consistent with our finding that no dendritic activity was observed with TMS stimulation alone indicating there was no direct activation of the pyramidal cell dendrites and contrasted with the signals found in both L1 and L2/3 neurons following a TMS pulse. It is also consistent with the activation of neurogliaform interneurons in L1 that target the dendrites of L5 pyramidal neurons and suppress Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ziemann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Terao and Ugawa, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pashut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tamás et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oláh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oláh et al., 2009</xref>). This form of dendritic inhibition arises from the metabotropic inactivation of L-type (Ca<sub>v</sub>1) channels in the apical dendrite that underlie the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wozny and Williams, 2011</xref>) and can last several hundred milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pérez-Garci et al., 2006</xref>). The suppression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels can significantly reduce the action potential firing of the pyramidal neuron even when the driving input to the pyramidal neuron is not predominantly dendritic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Palmer et al., 2012</xref>). The long time-scale of this form of inhibition (~500 ms) raises interesting consequences for the participation of pyramidal neurons in the cortical network. The similarity of some of the effects of TMS to interhemispheric inhibition has been noted previously in human studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pérez-Garci et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferbert et al., 1992</xref>) including its mediation via GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferbert et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kobayashi et al., 2003</xref>), although these investigations could not examine the cellular mechanisms.</p><p>For this study, we used a large coil typically used in humans and a smaller (25 mm) coil designed for use in rodents. The effect on dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was the same in both cases. Clearly, the use of TMS coils with rats where the magnetic field generated is comparable to the size of the rat brain itself raises the possibility that the effects in humans may differ. However, the cortical feedback fibers which synapse onto the tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons are located in the part of the cortex closest to the magnetic coil (i.e. L1) in both rats and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Larkum et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larkum, 2013</xref>), suggesting there would be overlap with respect to the influence of TMS.</p><p>The aim of this study was to examine the effect of TMS on dendritic activity in L5 neocortical neurons rather than a general study on the overall effects of TMS at the cellular level. We were interested in this, in particular, because we have previously hypothesized that cell assemblies over different cortical regions might be associated through the activation of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larkum, 2013</xref>). According to this hypothesis, dendritic activity in these neurons is a marker of important cognitive processes. The finding that TMS targets this mechanism is therefore highly relevant to the rationale of the study and may be instructive in understanding current applications of TMS. For instance, TMS has been used to alleviate some of the symptoms of hemispatial neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nyffeler et al., 2009</xref>) and auditory hallucinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giesel et al., 2012</xref>) via unknown inhibitory processes.</p><p>In conclusion, the results presented here indicate that the inhibitory actions of TMS is due to the recruitment of upper cortical layer interneurons mediating both GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub>-receptor-activated inhibition in the dendrites of pyramidal neurons. This may have implications for the interpretation of results in humans using TMS as a form of 'virtual lesion' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and Surgery</title><p>Male or female Wistar rats (P30-P40) were used in these experiments.

OGB-1 AM (50 µg; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was mixed with 5 µL of pluronic acid (Pluronic F-127, 20% solution in DMSO, Molecular Probes) for 15 min. The solution was then diluted in 28 µL of HEPES-buffered solution (125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES) and mixed for a further 15 min.

The pipette was withdrawn and the area of the craniotomy was then resubmerged with rat ringer for 2 hrs. For epifluorescence Ca<sup>2+</sup> recordings, light from a blue light-emitting-diode (LED, IBF+LS30W-3W-Slim-RX, Imac Co., Ltd., Shiga, Japan) was passed through an excitation filter, dichroic mirror, and emission filter (as a filter set 31001, Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT) and focused onto a fiber bundle by a 10× objective (Model E58-372, 0.45 NA, Edmund Optics GmbH, Germany). The fiber bundle (IGN-06/17, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Tokyo, Japan) was used as a combined illuminating/recording fiber and consisted of 17,000 fiber elements. The end face of the bundle was fitted with a prism-lens assembly, which consisted of a right-angle prism (dimension of 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm, GrinTech, Jena, Germany) attached to a GRIN lens (a diameter of 0.5 mm and a NA of 0.5, GrinTech). In previous studies, the fiber optic ‘periscope’ was vertically inserted 500 μm into the brain at a 90° angle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murayama et al., 2009</xref>). This ensured that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were recorded from the upper cortical layers. However, in this study, the fiber optic could not be inserted vertically due to the positioning of the TMS coil. Instead, the fiber optic was positioned horizontally on the brain surface (‘flat’ periscope). In this configuration, the ‘flat’ periscope was able to capture the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses as the ‘vertical’ periscope. As previously reported by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murayama et al., 2009</xref>), TTX application into L5 caused a dramatic increase in L5 dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to hindpaw stimulation using both the ‘flat’ periscope and the ‘vertical’ periscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). With a focal length nominally 100 μm and 0.73 × magnification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Murayama et al., 2007</xref>), the flat periscope configuration resulted in a field of view of 685 μm diameter restricted to the upper layers of the cortex. A cooled CCD camera operating at either 100 Hz (MicroMax, Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) or 2.7 kHz (Redshirt imaging, Decatur, GA) was used for collecting fluorescence. The fluorescence signals were quantified by measuring the mean pixel value of a manually selected ROI for each frame of the image stack using Igor software.

TTL digital pulses triggered a single pulse TMS at 80–100% stimulation intensity (unless otherwise stated) with an inter-trial interval of at least 9 s to limit fluorescence bleaching. Given this experimental design, the electric field should be approximately ~150–200 V/m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen et al., 1990</xref>) magnetic stimulation is comparatively indifferent to the conductive properties of the skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wagner et al., 2006</xref>), and since the small (3 × 4.4 mm) craniotomy is therefore unlikely to change the currents produced by the coil.

When paired with hindpaw stimulus, the TMS was activated 50 ms before the contralateral hindpaw stimulus (&gt; 10 trials per animal). Electrical stimulation of the contralateral hindpaw was achieved by applying a brief (1 ms; 100 V) current onto conductive adhesive strips (approximately 1 cm wide by 2 cm long) placed on the contralateral hindpaw pad. Where stated, hindpaw stimulation was also achieved by a triggered airpuff delivered to within 1 cm of the hindpaw (~40 psi; ~400 ms). All trials were interleaved in each experiment to limit time-dependent effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Drug application</title><p>The GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP52432 (1 μM; Tocris) and the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist Gabazine (3 μM; Tocris) were applied to the cranial surface, AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX (50 μM) was either applied to the cranial surface or pressure injected into layer 2/3. TTX (1 μM) was pressure injected into layer 5.

Brain tissue was imaged to a depth of 500 μm using a two-photon microscope (Thorlabs A-scope) with a titanium sapphire laser (860 nm; 140 fs pulse width; SpectraPhysics MaiTai Deepsee) passed through a 40x water immersion objective (Olympus; 0.8 NA). Images were obtained in full-frame mode (512 x 512 pixels).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The fluorescence signals in vivo were quantified by measuring the mean pixel value of a manually selected (offline) ROI for each frame of the image stack using IgorPro software (Wavemetrics). ROIs included the entire field of view and Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes were expressed as ΔF⁄F = F<sub>t</sub> ⁄ F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>t</sub> was the average fluorescence intensity within the ROI at time t during the imaging experiment and F<sub>0</sub> was the mean value of fluorescence intensity before stimulation. Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were measured as the maximum value (amplitude) and total area under the positive trace (integral) within 1 s of the hindpaw stimulation. All numbers are indicated as mean ± s.e.m. Significance was determined using parametric tests (paired/unpaired student t-test) or non-parametric tests (Unpaired, Mann-Whitney test; paired, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test) as appropriate. p&lt;0.05 (*), p&lt;0.01 (**) and p&lt;0.001 (***).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by SystemsX.ch (NeuroChoice). We would like to acknowledge the software assistance of Juan Nunez-Iglesias at the Victorian Life Sciences Computation Initiative.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) inhibits cortical dendrites&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favourably assessed by Timothy Behrens (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Marlene Bartos, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another is Alon Korngreen.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Both reviewers evaluated your study on the cellular mechanisms underlying the TMS-mediated effects on the activity of layer 5 Pyramidal cells of the somatosensory cortex as highly relevant for the neuroscience community. TMS stimulation is used as non-invasive technology in humans for the treatment of various diseases including epilepsy and schizophrenia. It is therefore pivotal to understand how TMS influences cortical neuronal network activity. Despite the high relevance of the study some major criticisms have been formulated with the aim to improve the value of the work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Major criticism: First, the usage of TMS requires a precise calibration of the stimulus intensity above the motor cortex. Intensity is increased until the contralateral limb is moved. It is therefore important to add controls or calibrations to the study ('Materials and methods' section). Refinement of TMS strength will have a high impact on the activated neuron types. Interneurons have a lower a spike threshold during TMS stimulation than principal cells. Thus, setting the stimulus intensity will have a large impact on the results. Second, the size of the coils used in the study is usually applied for human studies. This can be considered as focal stimulation for human cortex. However, it may be far from focal for a rat cortex. Thus, the authors should address the issues of locality by changing the location of magnetic stimulation while recording from the same cortical location. Finally, the conclusions from the experimental results point to the direct activation of GABAergic cells by TMS. The manuscript would be markedly improved if the direct activation of GABAergic interneurons could be shown. Finally, the study was focused on GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated actions. However, a contribution of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors should also be expected and thus discussed in the manuscript. A discussion on possible pre- versus postsynaptic effects of GABA<sub>B</sub> in relation to the obtained results should be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Murphy et al. examine in their study the cellular mechanisms underlying the TMS stimulation-mediated effects in layer 5 Pyramidal cells of the somatosensory cortex. By using fiber optics and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in vivo, the authors showed that TMS stimulation reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in distal dendrites of Pyramidal cells evoked by tactile stimuli. This suppression could be abolished by GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor blockers, or by abolishing dendritic synaptic excitatory transmission. TNS is an important non-invasive tool in humans and used for the treatment of various diseases including epilepsy and schizophrenia. Therefore it is important to understand what precisely TMS is doing to the activity of feedback projections.</p><p>Major criticisms:</p><p>1) It remained unclear why the planned examination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in Pyramidal cell dendrites during application of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist Gabazine in combination with TMS stimulation was impossible. If the authors believe that blocking GABARs induced such a strong activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels that TMT could not result in detectable changes in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients than lower concentrations of Gabazine could have been tested. Please include an explanation on why this experiment was not possible.</p><p>2) Although the evidences/conclusion from the experiments are plausible and point to the direct activation of GABAergic cells by TMS, it would be great if the authors could directly show that this is indeed is the case by using for example a transgenic mouse line in which GABAergic cells are tagged with tdT (GAD65/67-Cre &amp; viral injection of a construct which allows tdT expression under Cre control) to visually identify interneurons in the upper layers and to obtain 2P imaging from the interneuron activity during tactile stimulation with and without TMS application. Please consider whether this proposed experiment or another one directly testing interneuron recruitment wit TMS would be possible in a short time window.</p><p>3) The Discussion should include a chapter on the possible cellular mechanisms by which TMS selectively recruits GABAergic cells.</p><p>4) Is the effect of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor blocker pre- or postsynaptic? Please discuss possible contributions of both cellular mechanisms on the observed effects.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Murphy et al. combine for the first time transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and in-vivo calcium imaging to record neuronal activity from superficial cortical layers during magnetic stimulation. The authors clearly show that TMS triggers neuronal activity in cortical neurons. They present evidence arguing that the activity recorded from dendrites in L1 is due to poly synaptic activation of superficial inhibitory interneurons. This is an important step towards a mechanistic understanding of magnetic stimulation of the nervous system. Unfortunately, due to the way the authors use, or rather abuse, TMS the manuscript is out of context with the general body of scientific knowledge. This manuscript can potentially be of importance to the TMS community. I think the authors may have a true impact on the field if they perform some additional experiments and change the focus of the manuscript.</p><p>The paramount problem, as I see it, is the experimental design. The authors use the TMS device without regard to its proper use. In a standard TMS experiment stimulation intensity is first calibrated over the motor cortex. The intensity is increased until the contralateral limb moves. This is called the motor threshold and all results in the TMS field are normalized to this value which changes from subject to subject. The motor threshold is not an abstract point. It has been shown that responses below motor threshold are often inhibitory whereas exceeding motor threshold is considered excitatory. Several in-vitro studies (Rotem and Moses Biophys J 2008, Bonmassar, Nat.Commun. 2012, Pashut, Front. Cell. Neuro. 2014) have shown that low intensity stimulation stimulates first neurons with low action potential threshold. In the cortex, these are probably low threshold interneurons.</p><p>In contrast to the available knowledge and established procedures the authors used the Magstim at 100%. No explanation is given for these settings. This setting is meaningless when it is not calibrated to motor threshold. Since the authors did not detect any behavioural changes that were induced by TMS I suspect that they were below motor threshold. This directly leads to their observation of the inhibitory effect of TMS. To allow comparing their study to the general TMS literature it is imperative that they calibrate their TMS device by observing limb movement or by recording MEP from the limb's muscle. Many human TMS studies predict that as the intensity increases there will be larger activation of neurons in deeper layers of the cortex. At motor threshold it is possible to predict that L5 pyramidal neurons will fire. The authors are uniquely poised to demonstrate these effects with only a few more experiments and proper calibration of the stimulus.</p><p>Another problematic point is the use of the 70 mm and 25 mm butterfly coils. These coils were designed for humans. The largest magnetic field (at the intersection of the two coils) occupies, roughly, a volume of 10 mm cubed. This can be considered as focal stimulation for human cortex. However, it is far from focal for a rat cortex. Thus, the authors should address the issues of locality by changing the location of magnetic stimulation while recording from the same cortical location. I predict that they will observe effects quite similar to those they already report because their stimulus is so distributed.</p><p>The logic presented by the authors is somewhat circumvent. TMS is just another way to electrically stimulate neurons in the brain. Thus, it triggers action potentials leading to release of neurotransmitter. Why focus on GABA<sub>B</sub>? It is clear that GABA is released activating both GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. The authors point this later in the manuscript. However, placing the metabotropic aspect of the stimulus in the front weakens their argument. This will further be weakened if indeed, at higher TMS intensities, they will observe excitation. As it is written the reader may think that your primary interest in cortical inhibition and not explaining how TMS excites cortical tissue (which is what you end up showing).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13598.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>Major criticism: First, the usage of TMS requires a precise calibration of the stimulus intensity above the motor cortex.

Thus, setting the stimulus intensity will have a large impact on the results.</italic> </p><p>We have added controls to the manuscript including a new figure supplement which illustrates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to increasing TMS strength in layer 5 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>Second, the size of the coils used in the study is usually applied for human studies. This can be considered as focal stimulation for human cortex. However, it may be far from focal for a rat cortex.</italic> </p><p>Although the larger 70 mm coil is indeed typically applied for human studies, the smaller 25 mm coil we use is designed for use with rodents and is even described by the manufacturer, Magstim, as the “rat coil” (despite the claim of the 2nd reviewer). The influence of the different coils were investigated and were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The spatial extent of the stimulation is discussed in the text and is not referred to as focal.</p><p><italic>Thus, the authors should address the issues of locality by changing the location of magnetic stimulation while recording from the same cortical location.</italic> </p><p>We now include a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), which illustrates the influence of the TMS coil location on the sensory-evoked dendritic response. TMS-evoked inhibition of dendritic sensory responses was only measurable when the TMS coil was located near (within 10mm) to the somatosensory cortex.</p><p><italic>Finally, the conclusions from the experimental results point to the direct activation of GABAergic cells by TMS. The manuscript would be markedly improved if the direct activation of GABAergic interneurons could be shown.</italic> </p><p>The experimental results illustrate that GABAergic cells are active during TMS. This is illustrated firstly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> which clearly shows a large Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in layer 1 (which consists of only interneurons) during TMS. We further show that this is not due to direct activation of these interneurons by TMS, but is because TMS activates axons which synapse onto these interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>Finally, the study was focused on GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated actions. However, a contribution of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors should also be expected and thus discussed in the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We now include a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>), which illustrates that the application of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blocker, Gabazine, during TMS does not cause additional dendritic activation over and above GABA<sub>B</sub> block with CGP52432. As evident from the large increase in the sensory evoked dendritic response in the presence of a GABA<sub>A</sub> blocker (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition is tonically active. This is now further discussed in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>A discussion on possible pre- versus postsynaptic effects of GABA<sub>B</sub> in relation to the obtained results should be discussed.</italic> </p><p>The possible pre- and postsynaptic effects of TMS-evoked GABA<sub>B</sub> mediated dendritic inhibition is now discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>Major criticisms:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) It remained unclear why the planned examination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in Pyramidal cell dendrites during application of the GABA<sub>A</sub>receptor antagonist Gabazine in combination with TMS stimulation was impossible. If the authors believe that blocking GABARs induced such a strong activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels that TMT could not result in detectable changes in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients than lower concentrations of Gabazine could have been tested. Please include an explanation on why this experiment was not possible.</italic> </p><p>We actually did do this experiment but decided the data was relatively uninformative so didn’t include it. In hindsight, we agree with the reviewer that the reader should be able to see the results. GABA<sub>A</sub> block significantly increased the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to the control hindpaw stimulation, as we showed in a previous publication (Murayama et al., 2009). Since this pharmacological manipulation severely alters dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics regardless of TMS stimulation, its use for investigating the effect of TMS on GABA<sub>A</sub> activation is problematic. That said, we now include an additional supplementary figure where we have applied Gabazine to the cortical surface and we find there is no additional effect above the GABA<sub>B</sub> block (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, block of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, while not significantly affecting the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to hindpaw stimulation completely occluded the effect of TMS which we take to indicate that the TMS effect on dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> is either predominantly or entirely through GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors.</p><p><italic>2) Although the evidences / conclusion from the experiments are plausible and point to the direct activation of GABAergic cells by TMS, it would be great if the authors could directly show that this is indeed is the case by using for example a transgenic mouse line in which GABAergic cells are tagged with tdT (GAD65/67-Cre &amp; viral injection of a construct which allows tdT expression under Cre control) to visually identify interneurons in the upper layers and to obtain 2P imaging from the interneuron activity during tactile stimulation with and without TMS application. Please consider whether this proposed experiment or another one directly testing interneuron recruitment wit TMS would be possible in a short time window.</italic> </p><p>Firstly, the experiments illustrate that GABAergic cells are not directly activated by TMS in the region we are recording, and their activity during TMS is due to synaptic input from directly activated axons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> which shows a significant decrease in the TMS-evoked calcium response in layer 1 neurons – which are all GABAergic interneurons – in the presence of CNQX).</p><p>Secondly, the proposed experiments would be wonderful if they were possible – however, technically, it is not possible to put a TMS coil over the craniotomy during 2P imaging as the 2P objective (and associated laser path) would be in the way.</p><p><italic>3) The Discussion should include a chapter on the possible cellular mechanisms by which TMS selectively recruits GABAergic cells.</italic> </p><p>We now make it clearer in the Discussion that GABAergic cells are recruited via the direct activation of axons coursing through the upper layers of the cortex.</p><p><italic>4) Is the effect of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor blocker pre- or postsynaptic? Please discuss possible contributions of both cellular mechanisms on the observed effects.</italic> </p><p>Our previous findings have illustrated that the GABA<sub>B</sub> -mediated dendritic inhibition evoked by upper layer fibers is due to the activation of postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (Perez-Garci et al., 2006; Palmer et al., 2012). We have no reason to expect different mechanisms are at play in this study, since a similar micro-network is activated. That said, we now include the possible contributions of pre- and postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors during TMS in the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>[…] The paramount problem, as I see it, is the experimental design. The authors use the TMS device without regard to its proper use. In a standard TMS experiment stimulation intensity is first calibrated over the motor cortex. The intensity is increased until the contralateral limb moves. This is called the motor threshold and all results in the TMS field are normalized to this value which changes from subject to subject. The motor threshold is not an abstract point. It has been shown that responses below motor threshold are often inhibitory whereas exceeding motor threshold is considered excitatory. Several in-vitro studies (Rotem and Moses Biophys J 2008, Bonmassar, Nat.Commun. 2012, Pashut, Front. Cell. Neuro. 2014) have shown that low intensity stimulation stimulates first neurons with low action potential threshold. In the cortex, these are probably low threshold interneurons.</italic> </p><p><italic>In contrast to the available knowledge and established procedures the authors used the Magstim at 100%. No explanation is given for these settings. This setting is meaningless when it is not calibrated to motor threshold. Since the authors did not detect any behavioural changes that were induced by TMS I suspect that they were below motor threshold. This directly leads to their observation of the inhibitory effect of TMS.</italic> </p><p>We now include a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), which illustrates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in Layer 5 pyramidal neuron dendrites to different intensities of TMS. An excitatory response was not observed in layer 5 pyramidal neuron dendrites at any intensity. Our results show inhibition of sensory-evoked responses by TMS in layer 5 pyramidal neuron dendrites, however, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, layer 2/3 neurons have an excitatory response. Due to the necessary imprecision of the stimulation (given the comparative sizes of the coil and the rat brain), the motor cortex would be expected to be affected similarly to the somatosensory cortex in our experiments particularly since these cortical areas overlap in rats. The reviewer is correct that TMS pulses were below motor threshold as we never detected movement. Nevertheless, we also saw no evidence for direct activation of low threshold inhibitory neurons as evidenced by the complete occlusion using CNQX.</p><p><italic>To allow comparing their study to the general TMS literature it is imperative that they calibrate their TMS device by observing limb movement or by recording MEP from the limb's muscle. Many human TMS studies predict that as the intensity increases there will be larger activation of neurons in deeper layers of the cortex. At motor threshold it is possible to predict that L5 pyramidal neurons will fire. The authors are uniquely poised to demonstrate these effects with only a few more experiments and proper calibration of the stimulus.</italic> </p><p>We do not induce motion or limb movement while using maximum TMS intensity and therefore we are unable to increase the TMS strength to induce excitation in layer 5 pyramidal neurons. This may be because our experiments are conducted under urethane anaesthesia. This is necessary to be able to record Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during hindpaw stimulation and TMS in vivo, however, this may occlude any expected limb movements.</p><p><italic>Another problematic point is the use of the 70 mm and 25 mm butterfly coils. These coils were designed for humans. The largest magnetic field (at the intersection of the two coils) occupies, roughly, a volume of 10 mm cubed. This can be considered as focal stimulation for human cortex. However, it is far from focal for a rat cortex. Thus, the authors should address the issues of locality by changing the location of magnetic stimulation while recording from the same cortical location. I predict that they will observe effects quite similar to those they already report because their stimulus is so distributed.</italic> </p><p>The 25 mm butterfly coil was designed for use in animal models and is even described by the manufacturer (Magstim) as the “rat coil” – that said, we did not see influence of coil size on the effect of TMS on the sensory evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> response (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Further, we now include a figure illustrating the effect of moving the TMS coil to different locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>The logic presented by the authors is somewhat circumvent. TMS is just another way to electrically stimulate neurons in the brain. Thus, it triggers action potentials leading to release of neurotransmitter. Why focus on GABA<sub>B</sub>? It is clear that GABA is released activating both GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. The authors point this later in the manuscript. However, placing the metabotropic aspect of the stimulus in the front weakens their argument. This will further be weakened if indeed, at higher TMS intensities, they will observe excitation. As it is written the reader may think that your primary interest in cortical inhibition and not explaining how TMS excites cortical tissue (which is what you end up showing).</italic> </p><p>Our primary interest with these experiments was to examine the effect of TMS on dendritic activity. While this may not be the reviewer’s main interest, we were nevertheless excited to find that TMS lead to a down-regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in L5 pyramidal dendrites without any direct stimulation of these neurons. This points to a specificity of TMS that was unexpected and is potentially extremely useful. The reviewer asks, “Why the focus on GABA<sub>B</sub>? It is clear that GABA is released activating both GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors”. As we have shown here and in other studies (cf Palmer et al., 2012), counter-intuitively the primary effect of stimulating certain projections to</p><p>L1 can be the activation of specific dendrite-targeting, GABA<sub>B</sub> mediating inhibitory neurons. This cell type (the neurogliaform neuron) has been well characterized and predominantly mediates its effect through GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors probably due to volume transmission. Furthermore, activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors has a remarkably specific effect blocking dendritic L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (cf Perez-Garci et al., 2013). Here we report that TMS appears to recruit this sub-population of cells and that blocking GABA- B receptors completely occluded the effect of TMS on dendritc Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. Given this, it would seem unwise to assume that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors played any significant role in suppressing dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, the experiments do suggest that TMS could be used as a tool to investigate dendritic excitability non-invasively in other preparations (e.g. humans) that may give us a window into this otherwise tricky subject. Of course, further tests need to be made for the extension of these results to other preparations, and these were clearly out of the scope of this study, but the implications of these initial data in rodents could, in our opinion, be enormous. If the reviewer is correct, that under other conditions the situation might change (“at higher TMS intensities, they will observe excitation”), this would not change the prediction that TMS can in principle be used to down-regulate dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity non-invasively (e.g. at lower intensities).</p></body></sub-article></article>
