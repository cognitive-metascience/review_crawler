Here, we show that membralin mutant mice manifest a severe and early-onset motor neuron disease in an autosomal recessive manner, dying by postnatal day 5–6. Selective death of lower motor neurons, including those innervating the limbs, intercostal muscles, and diaphragm, is predominantly responsible for this fatal phenotype. Neural expression of a membralin transgene completely rescues membralin mutant mice. Mechanistically, we show that membralin interacts with Erlin2, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein that is located in lipid rafts and known to be important in ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Accordingly, the degradation rate of ERAD substrates is attenuated in cells lacking membralin. Membralin mutations or deficiency in mouse models induces ER stress, rendering neurons more vulnerable to cell death. Our study reveals a critical role of membralin in motor neuron survival and suggests a novel mechanism for early-onset motor neuron disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06500.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06500.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06500.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As new proteins are built inside a cell, many will pass into a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum for processing. There, the proteins are folded into the specific three-dimensional shapes that allow them to carry out their respective jobs. Sometimes the folding process goes awry, leading to a build-up of unfolded proteins that stress the endoplasmic reticulum and can kill the cell. Brain cells are particularly vulnerable to death from endoplasmic reticulum stress. To combat a deadly build-up of unfolded proteins, each cell has systems that respond when the endoplasmic reticulum is under stress.</p><p>Unchecked stress on the endoplasmic reticulum has been linked to diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (called ALS for short). In diseases like ALS, the nerve cells that control muscle movements gradually die off, causing a loss of muscle control and eventually death. Scientists suspect that these nerve cells (called motor neurons) are particularly sensitive to endoplasmic reticulum stress because they are highly active. Drugs that help counteract stress on the endoplasmic reticulum extend the lives of mice with motor neuron disease, suggesting this may be a useful strategy for treating such diseases in humans.</p><p>Now, Yang, Qu et al. identify a new protein that appears necessary for a healthy endoplasmic reticulum. Mice that lack the gene for a protein called membralin die within five or six days after birth because their motor neurons die off. Further experiments showed that re-introducing membralin in their nervous system can rescue these membralin-deficient mice.</p><p>Yang, Qu et al. found that membralin interacts with another protein that helps eliminate poorly folded or unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, and thus relieves stress on the cell. Mutations in this endoplasmic reticulum stress response protein have previously been linked to motor neuron diseases. The motor neurons in membralin-deficient mice show signs of endoplasmic reticulum stress and are extra vulnerable to chemicals that induce protein misfolding. Together, the experiments show membralin plays an important role in mitigating stress on the endoplasmic reticulum. More studies of mice lacking membralin may help explain why the endoplasmic reticulum stress increases in motor neuron diseases and may point to possible treatments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06500.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06500.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>motor neuron disease</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>ER membrane protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS43434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Dongxian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 HD29587</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lipton</surname><given-names>Stuart A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 NS076411</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lipton</surname><given-names>Stuart A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS086890</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lipton</surname><given-names>Stuart A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Membralin mutant mice manifest a severe and early-onset motor neuron disease with defects in endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a membrane-enclosed cellular organelle that plays an essential role in the folding of membrane-bound and secreted proteins, synthesis of lipids and sterols, and storage of free Ca<sup>2+</sup>. ER stress is often triggered by the accumulation of unfolded proteins due to pathological conditions, such as DNA sequence mutations, transcriptional and translational errors, or protein folding failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). Mammalian cells have evolved an intricate system with multiple signaling pathways to respond to ER stress, collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). If unchecked, ER stress eventually causes cell death, including neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lindholm et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scheper and Hoozemans, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hetz and Mollereau, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Increased ER stress is thought to play an early role in motor neuron diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishitoh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kanekura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saxena et al., 2009</xref>). Manifestations and consequences of ER stress have been studied in the pathogenesis of SOD1 mutant mice, a commonly used model of ALS that expresses mutant human SOD1 protein as found in some inherited forms of ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kanekura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saxena et al., 2009</xref>). Many ER stress-related molecules are upregulated in SOD1 mice at an early stage of the disease, and some are specific to motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tobisawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kikuchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saxena et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, reduction in the ER co-chaperone SIL1 has been found to be associated specifically with ER stress-prone, fast-fatigable motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Filezac de L'Etang et al., 2015</xref>). ER upregulation of the UPR and aberrant modification of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) also occur in human tissues from sporadic ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atkin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walker et al., 2010</xref>). Our studies on the activation of the type I interferon signaling in astrocytes at pre-symptomatic stages of SOD1 mice also suggest that ER stress in motor neurons may play a crucial role in disease onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, genetic interruption of UPR signaling molecules, such as XBP-1 or apoptosis signal-regulating kinase1 (ASK1), protects motor neurons in SOD1 mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishitoh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hetz and Mollereau, 2014</xref>). It has been suggested that the unusually heavy metabolic demand of motor neurons may make them particularly susceptible to ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vinay et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carrascal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, ER stress inhibitors, such as salubrinal, guanabenz, and sphin1, delay disease onset and prolong the survival of these mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saxena et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Das et al., 2015</xref>). This finding suggests that ER stress-related molecules may represent rational drug targets for motor neuron diseases.</p><p>Previously, membralin had been predicted by genome sequencing to encompass an open reading frame (<italic>orf61</italic> in mouse and <italic>c19orf6</italic> in human), but the function of the encoded protein has, heretofore, remained unknown. <italic>Orf61</italic> is highly conserved and found in the genome of most species except yeast and bacteria. cDNAs for membralin have been cloned from human and mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersson and von Euler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2005</xref>), and the protein encoded by <italic>orf61</italic> was named membralin because it was predicted to be a membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersson and von Euler, 2002</xref>). Given the absence of known protein domains, membralin may represent a novel class of proteins.</p><p>Here, we discovered during our cloning and characterization of the glutamate receptor subunit 3B gene (GluN3B, formerly designated NR3B, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nishi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chatterton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matsuda et al., 2002</xref>) that the 3′ end of the GluN3B gene overlaps with the 3′ end of the membralin gene on the opposite strand. Thus, our GluN3B knockout (KO) mice also carry a C-terminal truncation of membralin. We observed that GluN3B/membralin C-terminal double-knockout (DKO) mice die at postnatal day 5–6 of paresis due to severe motor neuron degeneration. Transgenic expression of membralin, but not GluN3B, rescued the phenotypes of DKO mice. Additionally, we generated membralin-specific KO mice and found that they phenocopied the DKO mice. These data suggest that membralin plays a critical role in motor neuron survival. We also demonstrate that membralin interacts with Erlin2, a protein that is enriched in ER lipid rafts and important for ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ikegawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Browman et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, neurons from membralin mutant mice display increased basal ER stress and increased vulnerability to ER stress-inducing agents. Our discovery that membralin mutations result in motor neuron disease provides mechanistic insight into pathophysiology and may offer a novel target for therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Membralin KO mice manifest severe motor neuron loss</title><p>We generated GluN3B-deficienct mice by deletion of the 8-kb region encoding the entire GluN3B gene and found that it also resulted in partial deletion of membralin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Sequence analysis confirmed that the translation frame of the altered membralin transcript in null mice terminates 147 nucleotides (nts) beyond the end of partial exon XI, resulting in a slightly truncated membralin protein with 49 unrelated amino-acid (aa) residues replacing the wild-type (WT) 89 C-terminal aa residues. Thus, our targeting strategy generated a GluN3B/membralin C-terminal DKO mouse line.</p><p>DKO mice appeared normal at birth but unexpectedly died at postnatal day 5–6 (P5-6).

The number of motor neurons in DKO mice was unchanged at P0 and P3, but reduced by 40% at P5, compared to littermate WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The remaining motor neurons appeared smaller than those of WT mice. Motor neuron loss and surrounding astrogliosis were also apparent in the cervical spinal cords of P5 DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We next examined Isg15 expression (interferon-induced 17 kDa protein), which is thought to play a role in innate immunity and is upregulated at both pre-symptomatic stages and post-symptomatic stages in a mouse model of ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). WT mice manifested minimal Isg15 expression throughout the brain and spinal cord. In contrast, by P3, DKO mice had increased Isg15 expression in the ventral horn of the cervical and lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). By P5, DKO mice showed increased Isg15 expression in additional areas containing primary motor neurons, with highest expression in the ventral horn of all segments of the spinal cord and moderate expression in the facial nucleus of the brainstem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). No Isg15 expression was detectable in other brain areas, even in late-stage DKO mice. These results suggest that the motor neurons are progressively injured in DKO mice, starting with those in the spinal cord. Since the normal process of programmed cell death in embryonic motor neurons is complete at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lance-Jones, 1982</xref>), the loss of motor neurons in DKO mice was most likely due to cellular events occurring perinatally.</p><p>To confirm specific loss of motor neurons in DKO mice, we examined the spinal roots of the lumbar spinal cord by electron microscopy. Motor neuron axons in the ventral root of DKO mice showed advanced degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), whereas sensory neuron axons in the dorsal root were intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Under high magnification of motor neuron axons, we saw intra-axonal vacuoles and the loss of axoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), as well as disintegrated myelin and amorphous lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), as typically seen in Wallerian degeneration. The percentage of degenerated axons in the ventral root of DKO mice reached 48.0 ± 4.1% by P5, which was significantly greater (p &lt; 0.01) than in WT mice (8.6 ± 1.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). In contrast, the percentage of degenerated axons in the dorsal root of DKO mice (10.5 ± 1.9%) was similar to that of the WT ventral root, consistent with the normal background level of axonal degeneration that occurs during development. Moreover, the sensory afferent terminals in the spinal cord of DKO mice appeared normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). In contrast, we found degeneration of phrenic motor nerve fibers and terminals in P5 DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). These results further confirm the selective death of motor neurons in DKO mice, potentially leading to respiratory failure due to loss of motor neuron innervation of the intercostal muscles and diaphragm. Taken together, our DKO mice present a phenotype of early-onset and apparently selective motor neuron degeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Causality of membralin deletion in motor neuron degeneration</title><p>Since both membralin and GluN3B are mutated in DKO mice, we needed to determine which gene was responsible for the motor neuron degeneration. Therefore, we tested whether transgenically expressed intact membralin or GluN3B could rescue DKO mice. We generated a transgenic mouse line carrying full-length membralin under the control of the murine <italic>prion</italic> promoter, followed by internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) cDNA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The membralin transgenic mice [Tg (membralin)] were fertile, normal in size, and did not display any gross physical or behavioral abnormalities compared with their littermate controls. When Tg (membralin) mice were crossbred with DKO mice, the DKO/Tg (membralin) mice were apparently normal, manifesting neither paresis nor premature death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, the membralin transgene rescued DKO mice, even though membralin mRNA levels remained somewhat lower than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). GFP immunostaining in the ventral horn of the spinal cord showed that membralin/GFP transgene expression was predominantly neuronal, although we could not rule out relatively weak expression in glial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The DKO/Tg (membralin) mice showed no sign of motor defects or motor neuron loss, despite the absence of GluN3B expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, the GluN3B transgene did not rescue DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), and GluN3B KO mice generated by deleting the first exon did not show any defect in motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niemann et al., 2007</xref>).

We designed experiments to verify the membralin/Erlin2 interaction. We found that GFP-tagged membralin not only co-localized with but also manifested a strong FRET signal with mCherry-tagged Erlin2 in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The FRET efficiency was significantly higher for GFP-tagged membralin and mCherry-tagged Erlin2 (18.00 ± 0.70%) than the negative control (GFP and mCherry, 0.15 ± 0.05%), consistent with a direct interaction of the two molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Additionally, Myc-tagged full-length membralin co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged Erlin2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This interaction of membralin with Erlin2 further supports the notion that membralin is an ER membrane protein and also suggests that loss of membralin could potentially increase ER stress by interrupting ERAD. Indeed, we found that the ER membrane protein, CD3-δ, was cleared more slowly in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) prepared from membralin KO mice than from WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), whereas there was no change in the clearance of the ER lumenal protein, NHK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In contrast to proximal HMN, distal HMN represents a heterogeneous group of peripheral neuropathies affecting mainly distal muscles with both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Irobi et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Irobi-Devolder, 2008</xref>). Seven subgroups of distal HMN were initially proposed based on age of onset, mode of inheritance, and clinical features of a limited number of affected families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harding, 1993</xref>). Additional forms of distal HMN were subsequently reported, adding more genetic complexity. A dozen of causal gene loci and other associated genes have been identified for distal HMN (exclusive of type I); these genes encode for a functionally heterogeneous group of proteins, as summarized in recent reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Irobi et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Irobi-Devolder, 2008</xref>). The biological functions of the affected proteins include stress responses (small heat shock proteins HSP22, HSP27), housekeeping (GARS, glycyl tRNA synthetase), protein glycosylation in the ER (seipin), RNA processing (immunoglobulin μ-binding protein 2 [LGHMBP2] and senataxin), and axonal transport (dynactin). It is not clear, however, how these mutated proteins of diverse cellular function converge to affect motor neuron survival selectively. In fact, their expression is not even restricted to motor neurons. A similar case is found for membralin in this study. Therefore, further studies on molecular mechanisms underlying the selectivity of motor neuron death in distal HMN will be critical to understanding the disease. A hint towards pathogenesis may be found in prior work in conjunction with our new findings and involves an unusual susceptibility of motor neurons to various forms of cell stress, particularly ER stress.</p><p>Accordingly, the membralin KO mouse generated in our laboratory provides a good model to study selective motor neuron vulnerability. These mice display severe motor neuron loss and muscle wasting, leading to paresis and death. Although the early disease onset in membralin KO mice is similar to that seen in an SMA mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsieh-Li et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Monani et al., 2000</xref>), the pattern of motor neuron injury in membralin KO mice is reminiscent of human distal HMN rather than proximal HMN, as observed in SMA. Of the dozen known causal genes for distal HMN, only a few show autosomal recessive inheritance, and no mouse model has, heretofore, been generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Irobi et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Irobi-Devolder, 2008</xref>). Therefore, the membralin null mouse represents a novel model for human distal HMN. Additionally, our studies demonstrate the previously unknown function of membralin in motor neuron survival. Our findings from endogenous and heterologous expression studies suggest that membralin is mainly located in the ER. Relatively low expression of membralin seems sufficient for normal function, as heterozygotes of the membralin KO survived, and transgene rescue of the membralin KO did not require high expression levels. Importantly, in our rescue experiments, membralin transgene expression was primarily in brain, not muscle, consistent with the notion that the pathogenic process is predominantly neural in origin. The exact mechanisms underlying motor neuron death in membralin KO mice are not yet clear, although death occurs very rapidly at an early and well-defined postnatal stage. Thus, membralin KO mice can be used not only as an early-onset model of motor neuron disease but also to determine if there are features in common with late-onset motor neuron disease, such as motor neuron-specific vulnerability to ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saxena et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roselli and Caroni, 2015</xref>), dying back axonopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coleman, 2005</xref>), or non-cell autonomous death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boillee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previously, membralin was predicted to encode a transmembrane protein, but it lacked homology with any known protein domains and was not known to interact with other membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersson and von Euler, 2002</xref>). In the present study, we found that membralin interacts with Erlin2, an ER membrane protein potentially involved in ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christianson et al., 2012</xref>). The exact cellular functions of Erlin2 are not clear, although it has been reported to interact with several ER resident E3 ligases such as GP78 and Hrd1 that are important for ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christianson et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, Erlin2 has been shown to regulate ER membrane proteins such as Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pearce et al., 2007</xref>). It is conceivable that membralin assists Erlin2 in a complex that retrotranslocates unfolded proteins from the ER lumen to the cytosol, thus facilitating their ubiquitination for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schulze et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carvalho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Denic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vembar and Brodsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brodsky, 2012</xref>). Consequently, membralin deficiency might increase both basal ER stress and vulnerability to ER stress-induced cell death, and this is exactly what we observed. We also found differences in Isg15 levels in membralin KO mice, leading to ISGylation, a process that represents a type I interferon-dependent, ER stress-triggered event. This observation is interesting in light of prior findings showing that ISGylation is a pre-symptomatic event observed in a mouse model of ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that the loss of membralin may contribute to degeneration by increasing ER stress in motor neurons, which are especially vulnerable to such stress due to their large metabolic demand. This demand is particularly prevalent postnatally when maturation of motor neurons requires synthesis of proteins for production of dendritic trees, synaptic connections, and ionic conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vinay et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carrascal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, disruption of ERAD in SOD1 mutant mice is known to induce ER stress, activation of ASK1, and motor neuron cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishitoh et al., 2008</xref>). Mutations in Erlin2 have been linked to human disease, including intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and juvenile primary lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Saif et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Yahyaee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alazami et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wakil et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yildirim et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, disturbance in various other components of ERAD, including OS-9, erasin, ubiquilin2, torsinA, and Derlin1, causes ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishitoh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alcock and Swanton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nery et al., 2011</xref>), and some of these genes have been linked to ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishitoh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alcock and Swanton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alazami et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nery et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yildirim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Saif et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wakil et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, future elucidation of the exact role of membralin in ERAD will undoubtedly be important for understanding the contribution of ER stress to motor neuron diseases. Interestingly, there are more than 50 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of human membralin that result in missense mutations (NBCI SNP database). The minor allele frequency of most SNPs is either low or has not been determined, suggesting that these SNPs are not common in the human population. Thus, our studies point to a specific role of membralin in motor neuron survival and potentially open a new avenue for research in the field of human motor neuron diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructing a target vector</title><p>We used the 3.6 kb (Apa I/Spe I) and 3.2 kb (BamH I/Kpn I) DNA fragments flanking the target region as the 5′- and 3′-arms, respectively, for the ∼11.4 kb pGTN29/GluN3B/membralin targeting vector (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript describes a potential function for a novel protein, membralin, in the ER stress response and survival of neonatal motor neurons. These findings have clinical significance given the dramatic motor neuron degeneration phenotype seen in the membralin KOs, and the finding that the membralin-binding partner Erlin2 is implicated in human motor neuron disorders. In general, the study is well-performed, and the conclusions are intriguing. In addition, the work describes an interesting function for a previously poorly-characterized protein. However, the reviewers felt that additional data was required to strengthen the major conclusions of the paper, as follows.</p><p>1) One of the key conclusions of the manuscript is that membralin knockout causes motor neuron death. However, while there is nice evidence for functional loss of motor neurons and motor axon degeneration, the evidence for motor neuron cell death is not completely convincing. The tissue sections shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3">Figures 1B and 3C</xref> do not match between wildtype and knockouts with respect to anatomical position, and it would be better if the authors counted motor neurons from serial sections in a specific population of neurons, such as L1-L5 or facial nucleus. It would also be helpful if more details about the methods of quantification were provided.</p><p>2) The cell biological data with membralin should be strengthened. The data on colocalization, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, are not convincing as presented. This may be because the images are so low-magnification. In addition, it would greatly strengthen the paper to show that endogenous Erlin2 and membralin interact either in the brain or in the MEFs studied for much of the cell biology here. While the membralin antibodies might not work for immunoprecipitations, could the authors use Erlin2 antibodies for this experiment, since the membralin antibodies work well on westerns? Finally, the co-immunoprecipitation experiments require controls and more of the western blots should be shown.</p><p>3) The number of animals in the rescue experiment seems very low. Could the authors clarify how many animals were used in this experiment, and how many independent litters they came from?</p><p>4) Protein data confirming the loss of membralin in the two mouse models is important, particularly given the nature of the construct used in the double knockout. This appears to be shown for the single knockout in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, bottom panel, but the figure legend doesn't indicate this. Is that the case? A similar western blot should also be shown for the double knockout.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows upregulation of GRP78 and ATF4 in P3 spinal cord. It would be interesting to see whether this upregulation is also observed at earlier stages, before any motor defect is observed, in order to correlate the upregulation with the onset of disease symptoms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06500.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) One of the key conclusions of the manuscript is that membralin knockout causes motor neuron death.

Briefly, consecutive sections (12 µm in thickness) of the lumber enlargement (L1-L5) were collected for immunostaining with anti-Hb9 antibody to identify motor neurons. The number of motor neurons in each section was counted based on stereological counting methods using adjacent sections as a reference and look-up section, respectively (physical disector). We have added these details to the Methods section (in the subsection headed “Immunostaining and histological analysis”). We believe this counting method represents the best estimation in determining the average number of motor neurons in the spinal cord of each genetic group. We found that matching exactly the anatomical location in the brain or spinal cord tissue of WT and KO mice at postnatal day 5 was not achievable due to the variation in size and fragility of the tissue (which lacks fully developed white matter).</p><p><italic>2) The cell biological data with membralin should be strengthened.

Finally, the co-immunoprecipitation experiments require controls and more of the western blots should be shown.</italic></p><p>We have now repeated co-localization experiments with some modification such as using an improved mitochondrial marker. Also, images of higher resolution were taken by confocal microscopy. These results are presented in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>We have also attempted the co-IP experiment three times to demonstrate the interaction between endogenous membralin and Erlin2. However, these experiments were not successful due to either the low quality of the antibody or very low concentration of the endogenous proteins. In the reviewed manuscript, we have improved our co-IP experiments by adding more controls and by using anti-Erlin2 antibody directly (replacing anti-HA antibody), so we are more confident that the detected bands indeed represent Erlin2 protein.</p><p><italic>3) The number of animals in the rescue experiment seems very low</italic>. <italic>Could the authors clarify how many animals were used in this experiment, and how many independent litters they came from</italic>?</p><p>The number of animals shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> is an example of data obtained from all littermates in the same litter. We have observed a consistent rescue effect in 5 independent litters (representing breeding among independent heterozygous DKO mice positive for the membralin transgene). We have clarified this procedure in the revised text (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> legend). We bred homozygous DKO mice with the membralin transgene rather than heterozygous because it reduces the number of mice used and conserves funds.</p><p><italic>4) Protein data confirming the loss of membralin in the two mouse models is important, particularly given the nature of the construct used in the double knockout.

A similar western blot should also be shown for the double knockout</italic>.</p><p>We chose Southern and Northern blots for the analysis of membralin deletion in double KO (DKO) mice, as knockout membralin protein has a similar size as WT membralin, so the two cannot be distinguished on a western blot. In addition, it is extremely difficult to detect the endogenous protein due to either the low amount of endogenous membralin or the poor quality of the available antibody. The membralin protein data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> were obtained by using the membrane fraction of protein purified from approximately half of the brain (this is now indicated in the figure legend). We currently do not have the DKO mice to perform additional western blots and cannot obtain additional animals in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Editor for resubmission.</p><p><italic>5)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>shows upregulation of GRP78 and ATF4 in P3 spinal cord.
