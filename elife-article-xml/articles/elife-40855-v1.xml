While a subset of individuals displays vulnerability to stress, others remain resilient, but the molecular basis for these behavioral differences is not well understood. Using a model of chronic social defeat stress, we identified region-specific differences in myelination between mice that displayed social avoidance behavior (‘susceptible’) and those who escaped the deleterious effect to stress (‘resilient’). Myelin protein content in the nucleus accumbens was reduced in all mice exposed to stress, whereas decreased myelin thickness and internodal length were detected only in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of susceptible mice, with fewer mature oligodendrocytes and decreased heterochromatic histone marks. Focal demyelination in the mPFC was sufficient to decrease social preference, which was restored following new myelin formation. Together these data highlight the functional role of mPFC myelination as critical determinant of the avoidance response to traumatic social experiences.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

Scientists have started to investigate how these differences may find their origin in biological processes, mainly by focusing on the role of neurons. However, neurons represent only one type of brain cells, and there is increasing evidence that interactions between neuronal and non-neuronal cells play an important role in the response to stress.</p><p>Oligodendrocytes are a common type of non-neuronal cells which shield and feed nerve cells. In particular, their membrane constitutes the myelin sheath, a protective coating that insulates neurons and allows them to better communicate with each other using electric signals.</p><p>Bonnefil et al. explored whether differences in oligodendrocytes could affect how mice responded to social stress. The rodents were exposed to repeated attacks from an aggressive mouse five minutes a day for ten days. After this period, ‘susceptible’ mice then avoided future contact with any other mice, while resilient animals remained interested in socializing.</p><p>Comparing the brain areas of resilient and susceptible mice revealed differences in the oligodendrocytes of the medial prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that controls emotions and thinking. Susceptible animals had fewer mature oligodendrocytes and their neurons were covered in thinner and shorter segments of myelin sheaths. There was also evidence that, in these animals, the genes that regulate the maturation of oligodendrocytes were more likely to be switched off. Taken together, these results may suggest that, in certain animals, social stress disrupts the genetic program that controls how oligodendrocytes develop, potentially leading to neurons communicating less well.</p><p>To explore whether reduced amounts of myelin could be linked to decreased social behavior, Bonnefil et al. then damaged the myelin in the medial prefrontal cortex in another group of rodents. The mice were then less willing to interact with other animals until new sheaths had formed.</p><p>The results by Bonnefil et al. undercover how changes in non-neuronal cells can at least in part explain differences in the way individuals respond to stress. Ultimately, this knowledge may be useful to design new strategies to foster resilience.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myelin</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>social stress</kwd><kwd>medial prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>oligodendroccyte</kwd><kwd>resilience</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2R37NS042925-10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Casaccia</surname><given-names>Patrizia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS52738</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Casaccia</surname><given-names>Patrizia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CenterCore Grant 5P30 NS047463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dupree</surname><given-names>Jeffrey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cancer Center Grant P30 CAO16059</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dupree</surname><given-names>Jeffrey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006545</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MD007599</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burghardt</surname><given-names>Nesha S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006462</institution-id><institution>City University of New York</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21MH114182</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burghardt</surname><given-names>Nesha S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Myelination in the medial prefrontal cortex defines behavioral consequences to social stress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Exposure to stress increases the risk of developing affective disorders such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. While stress leads to maladaptive behavioral responses in a subset of humans, others are capable of coping and remain resilient. Differences in the behavioral response to stress can also be detected in experimental mouse models, thereby highlighting the degree of conservation of this response. However, the cellular and molecular basis underlying resilience or susceptibility to negative experiences remains poorly defined.</p><p>We and others have previously reported that animal models of psychosocial stressors, such as social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Makinodan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Makinodan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Makinodan et al., 2012</xref>), chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cathomas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lehmann et al., 2017</xref>), and chronic variable stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), lead to transcriptional, translational, or ultrastructural changes in oligodendrocytes and myelination. Here we tested the hypothesis that myelinating glia serves a causal role in behavioral susceptibility or resilience following stress exposure. We examined social behaviors, ultrastructural changes in myelination as well as epigenetic modifications in oligodendrocytes in brain regions that have been implicated in depressive-like behavior after a well-established social defeat paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Golden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hodes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krishnan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vialou et al., 2010</xref>). We also provide mechanistic insights into the region-specific differences between the phenotypes, which we attributed to defective oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation. To provide direct causal evidence, we carried out focal demyelination in the medial prefrontal cortex and showed aversive social behavior in animals undergoing demyelination and a resolution of the behavioral effect consequent to new myelin formation. Together, we suggest the functional role of region-specific myelination in determining depressive-like social behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chronic social defeat stress causes region-specific changes in myelination</title><p>We adopted a mouse model of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Golden et al., 2011</xref>), in which mice were exposed to an aggressor challenge for 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and tested for social behavior afterwards.

We focused our analysis on the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), two brain regions shown to play a critical role in determining stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heshmati et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Han and Nestler, 2017</xref>) and displaying myelin transcriptional or structural impairment after a stressful experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Makinodan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lehmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). In the NAc, a significant reduction of myelin basic protein (MBP) was detected in all defeated mice, regardless of their behavioral responses (control, 3.6 ± 0.4%; susceptible, 2.4 ± 0.3%; resilient 2.0 ± 0.3%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). However, no significant differences were detected in the length of myelinated segments measured by MBP immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>) or in myelin thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–K</xref>) among groups. Pearson coefficients correlation showed no significant correlation between the length of MBP-covered segments and social interaction ratio in either control or defeated group (control, r = −0.2242, p=0.5934, defeated, r = −0.3483, p-0.3240, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that myelination in the NAc uniformly responds to stress and does not distinguish susceptibility and resilience following CSDS.</p><p>In contrast, the mPFC displayed a unique myelination phenotype following CSDS. While the levels of MBP did not significantly differ between susceptible and resilient mice (control, 6.2 ± 0.5%; susceptible, 6.1 ± 0.9%; resilient, 5.3 ± 0.8%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>), the length of myelinated segments indicated by MBP immunoreactivity showed a significant positive correlation with social interaction in defeated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). Importantly, such correlation was not detected in the control (unstressed) group, suggesting that changes in the length of myelinated segments represent an adaptive response to the social defeat stress. To more accurately quantify internodal length, we conducted immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies specific for the contactin-associated protein (Caspr), which marks the paranodal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Also in this case, a significant positive correlation between internodal length and social interaction ratio was detected only in the defeated mice, with shorter internodal lengths identified in susceptible mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). Myelin was also thinner in the susceptible - but not in the resilient – mice, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–K</xref>). Therefore, region-specific myelination differences in the mPFC could -at least in part- explain the behavioral differences between susceptible and resilient mice in response to stress.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40855.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Myelination in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) distinguished resilient from susceptible mice following stress.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Representative confocal images and quantifications of myelin basic protein (MBP) counterstained with DAPI.

To test the causality of this finding, we induced myelin loss by focal injection of lysolecithin (LPC) into the mPFC and asked whether this manipulation would be sufficient to induce behavioral changes. LPC injection is a well characterized model of toxic demyelination, with early myelin loss (detectable one week after injection) followed by spontaneous repair, due to the formation of new myelin by newly differentiated oligodendrocytes (occurring three weeks after injection) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jeffery and Blakemore, 1995</xref>). We reasoned that behavioral differences detected in mice at these two time points after LPC injection would support a causal link between social preference performance and myelin content in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Indeed, the kinetics of demyelination and remyelination after LPC injection was validated by the detection of reduced MBP immunoreactivity at the 7dpi followed by spontaneous recovery of immunoreactivity by 21dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). At the early time point (7dpi), LPC-injected mice displayed reduced social preference behavior compared to saline-injected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This difference in social interaction behavior was no longer detectable after 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), when myelination recovered to normal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that myelin content in the mPFC is a critical determinant of social behavior.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40855.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Focal demyelination in the mPFC reduced social preference behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The experimental paradigm for lysolecithin (LPC) injection and behavioral testing.

We have previously reported that myelination defects were detected in socially isolated adult mice, prior to the appearance of social avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we show that social avoidance behavior can be detected after chronic social defeat stress as well as after focal demyelination in the mPFC, and could therefore be caused by hypomyelination. Furthermore, promoting myelination has been shown to rescue depressive-like behavior in socially isolated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). On the same note, normal social behavior was restored following the spontaneously occurring remyelination in LPC-injected mice. However, it is important to note that, social stress did not induce a toxic effect on myelin, whereas LPC did. No cellular toxicity was detected in the mPFC of susceptible mice or in mice undergoing social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, we detected fewer mature oligodendrocytes and more progenitors lacking epigenetic marks of differentiation, suggesting an altered epigenetic program. For this reason, we interpret the lower myelin content in the mPFC of susceptible mice as resulting from impaired oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation, possibly as maladaptive response to social stress. While our data support an inefficient production of new myelin, the detection of a positive correlation between intermodal length and social avoidance behavior, suggests that reorganization of paranodal loops could also be affected. Indeed, shorter internodal length, consequent to impaired myelin formation, has been previously shown to decrease nerve conduction in the optic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Etxeberria et al., 2016</xref>). It is, therefore, conceivable that the reduced length of myelinated segments detected in the mPFC of susceptible mice may result in slower conduction and functionally result in the characteristic social avoidance behavior in response to the social stress.</p><p>Finally, we suggest that new myelin is formed in the mPFC of resilient mice as an adaptive mechanism to the repeated episodes of aggression. It is conceivable that the formation of new myelin in resilient mice could favor the establishment of neuronal circuits allowing the escape of negative impact following traumatic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krishnan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fagundes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fenster et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ménard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Russo et al., 2012</xref>), as oligodendrocytes are known to regulate conduction speed and play a crucial role in synchronizing neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saab and Nave, 2017</xref>). This explanation is in agreement with the increasing evidence from mice and squirrel monkeys, which suggests stress resilience may arise from active coping strategies, rather than a passive response, defined as lack of adaptive response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Russo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lyons et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The molecular basis for resilience has been studied extensively in the context of neuronal cells, the immune and neuroendocrine systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ménard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Russo et al., 2012</xref>). Here we proposed an alternative, although not mutually exclusive explanation involving myelinating glia. One possibility for new myelin formation as a coping strategy is associated with increased neuronal activity in the resilient mice, as reported by a greater degree of FosB, or ΔFosB expression in glutamatergic neurons of mPFC of resilient mice following social defeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Covington et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lehmann and Herkenham, 2011</xref>). Optogenetic stimulation of mPFC has been shown to help resilience phenotype in social defeated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Covington et al., 2010</xref>). Although not characterized in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Covington et al., 2010</xref>), optogenetic stimulation has been shown to promote oligodendrogliogenesis and new myelin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gibson et al., 2014</xref>). An alternative mechanism could involve inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6 has been identified as a major cytokine that contributes to the development of depression in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dowlati et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Erta et al., 2012</xref>). In animal models of stress, systemic IL-6, was the only differentially regulated cytokine that distinguished resilient mice from susceptible and control mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hodes et al., 2014</xref>). Although systemic changes of IL-6 could not account for the region-specific differences in myelination in susceptible and resilient mice, it is known that IL-6 can be produced by neurons, astrocytes, microglia or endothelial cells in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Erta et al., 2012</xref>). Several transcriptomic studies suggest that oligodendrocyte progenitors express IL-6 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is intriguing to think that IL-6 could be up-regulated in a region-specific pattern with the ability to impact oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation and new myelin formation in specific regions of the adult brain.</p><p>Overall this study extends our knowledge on the functional role of adult myelination by providing a mechanism for adaptation to social stress encounters, which ultimately result in the expression of resilience.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>M. musculus</italic> (C57Bl/6J)</td><td>mouse</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td><italic>M. musculus</italic> (CD-1)</td><td>mouse</td><td>Charles River</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_CRL:22">IMSR_CRL:22</ext-link></td><td>Retired breeder</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-MBP</td><td>Covance</td><td>Cat # SMI99 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2564741">AB_2564741</ext-link></td><td>IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-Caspr</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab34151, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_869934">AB_869934</ext-link></td><td>IHC (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-OLIG2</td><td>Millipore</td><td>Cat# MABN50, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10807410">AB_10807410</ext-link></td><td>IHC (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-OLIG2</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab81093, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1640746">AB_1640746</ext-link></td><td>IHC (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit anti-H3K9me3</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab8898, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_306848">AB_306848</ext-link></td><td>IHC (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-NG2</td><td>Millipore</td><td>Cat# AB5320, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_91789">AB_91789</ext-link></td><td>IHC (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-APC</td><td>EMDMillipore</td><td>Cat# OP80, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2057371">AB_2057371</ext-link></td><td>IHC (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>DAPI</td><td>Thermofisher</td><td>Cat# D1306, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2629482">AB_2629482</ext-link></td><td>IHC (1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat# L4129</td><td/></tr><tr><td>software, algorithm</td><td>ImageJ</td><td/><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>software, algorithm</td><td>Ethovision XT</td><td>Noldus</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000441">SCR_000441</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>software, algorithm</td><td>Graphpad Prism 8</td><td/><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experimental C57Bl/6J male mice (7 weeks) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine) and allowed one-week acclimation prior to the start of experiment.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Studying the resilience or susceptibility to stress with a focus on the role of myelin is important and timely, given the recent advances in our understanding myelin plasticity and its impact on higher brain functions. Overall, this is an exciting study demonstrating such a role of myelin in social behaviour and maladaptive social behavior. The authors present evidence that resilience to stress requires maintenance of healthy myelin in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and that stress susceptible subjects exhibit impaired oligodendrocyte differentiation dynamics following the stressful condition specifically in mPFC.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>The authors interpret the data shown in Figure 1B as proof that exposure to the aggressive mouse changed the behavior of the test mice. However, they do not show that the social behaviors were changed by the experience of aggression since they do not compare the social behavior before and after exposure.</p><p>The question emerges whether PFC myelination affects the performance in social interactions and/or is affected itself by social defeat. The authors need to show that there is no correlation between the characteristics of PFC myelin and social interactions in control mice (this appears critical as Liu et al. previously reported a link between PFC myelin and social interactions).</p><p>Throughout the text, authors should give exact definition of &quot;n&quot; and state when it is number of mice, number of axons etc. Also, &quot;imaging volumes&quot; should be defined.</p><p>Throughout the study, authors use MBP immunohistochemistry alone to measure the myelin internode length. However, MBP alone may not differentiate the difference between an internode and an axon leaving the obrvational field in z-axis. Co-staining with Caspr should clarify that distinction. Rather than re-analyze all of the internode data this way, the authors could demonstrate in a sample group that Caspr co-staining validates the original internode quantifications.</p><p>At 21dpi, authors show a recovery of social interaction with the recovery of myelination. Does the recovery of internode length also occur?</p><p>The authors should plot individual data points in the bar graphs to better estimate group size and distribution of the data. How exactly were resilient and vulnerable animals defined?</p><p>The first experiment included a large number of mice, while all follow-up analyses only used very few animals per group (e.g. 3 or 4). How were these animals selected from the respective groups? What was the social avoidance behavior of the selected mice?</p><p>The differences in histone modification are interesting, but only correlative. The authors should avoid claiming a causal relationship with myelination or stress susceptibility.</p><p>One is not convinced by the conclusions drawn from the LPC experiment. At 7 days following treatment, the authors observed a reduction in MBP levels. However, MBP levels were not significantly different between stress resilient and susceptible mice. The manipulation does therefore not reflect the stress-induced situation, even though a similar behavioral phenotype was observed.</p><p>The authors tend to overstate their conclusions, as all observations are correlational and no experiments were performed that would indicate a causal relationship between the observed differential myelination phenotype of resilient and susceptible animals with their social behavior or epigenetic regulation.</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The study by Bonnefil et al. explores &quot;the cellular and molecular basis underlying resilience or susceptibility to negative experiences&quot;, focusing on the role of myelin. This is an important and timely question, given the recent advances in the understanding of CNS myelin plasticity and its impact on behavior. However, several of the key experiments have major issues and the results do not convincingly support the author's conclusions.</p><p>Main concerns:</p><p>The authors use a well-established social defeat paradigm to differentiate between mice that are susceptible and resilient based on how they behave on a social interaction test after exposure to an aggressive mouse. Later, they use this difference to explore the role of myelination on social interactions. I'm concerned with the basic assumptions of this approach. The authors interpret the data shown in Figure 1B as proof that exposure to the aggressive mouse changed the behavior of the test mice. However, there are two significant problems. 1) They do not really show that the social behaviors were changed by the experience of aggression since they do not compare the social behavior before and after exposure. 2) It is not clear that there is a significant difference between the naïve (control) group and all the exposed mice (resilient and susceptible groups together). A lack of difference would suggest that the important question is whether PFC myelination impacts the performance in social interactions rather than have anything to do with the social defeat. The authors need to show there is no correlation between the characteristics of PFC myelin and social interactions in control mice before justifying looking at the effects of the defeat paradigm. This is critical as Liu and Casaccia and others previously reported a link between PFC myelin and social interactions. Moreover, the observation that lysolecithin-induced focal demyelination in the mPFC leads to social avoidance by itself further suggests that the social defeat might be irrelevant.</p><p>The characterization of the differences between the susceptible and resilient mice at the cellular levels (Figure 3) has several problems.</p><p>1) It is my understanding that Olig2 is a transcription factor and therefore should be detected in the nucleus. However, the olig2 staining seems to extend beyond the nucleus. I would have expected to colocalize with the H3K9me3, which for sure should be nuclear. The authors need to use a nuclear dye to prove that the stainings are in the right cellular compartments.</p><p>2) The olig2 staining in panel A is very different from the one shown in panel D both in density and quality, raising doubts about the results.</p><p>3) It is not clear that measuring the intensity of the H3K9me3 is the right variable to compare. It seems that% of olig2+ cells with H3K9me3 staining is necessary as well.</p><p>4) How can the density of CC1+ and olig2+ cells be the same? it is my understanding that CC1 marks mature oligodendrocytes, while olig2 also labels precursors.</p><p>Based on the results shown in Figure 3A, the authors conclude that the exposure doesn't affect survival of cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage, yet they found a reduction in CC1+ cells (3C). Do they propose that mature oligodendrocyte revert to a progenitor state?</p><p>In the Introduction (second paragraph) the authors claim that this study provides &quot; mechanistic insights into the region-specific differences between the phenotypes, which we attribute to defective epigenetic regulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation.&quot; Given the issues with Figure 3, I don't believe that the results support this conclusion.</p><p>In the third paragraph of the Results section the authors mention that susceptible mice display significantly shorter myelinated segments. How was the internode length measured?</p><p>In the Discussion, the authors state that &quot;new myelin is formed in the mPFC of resilient mice as an adaptive mechanism to the repeated episodes of aggression&quot;. What data do they use to reach this conclusion ?</p><p>Other concerns:</p><p>In the Introduction the statement that &quot;multiple&quot; brain regions were evaluated is not appropriate given that only NAc and mPFC were described in the study.</p><p>Even though no significant correlation was seen between myelination in the NAc and social interaction in mice after chronic social defeat stress, the manuscript would benefit with a discussion on what mechanisms would possibly underlie the region-specific differences observed in the NAc and mPFC. How is the profile of expression of OLIG2, NG2, CC1 and H3K9me3 in the NAc in susceptible and resilient mice? Is the NAc somehow protected from the effects of defeat stress on myelination?</p><p>How was the proper sample size determined in each protocol of the study? The figure legend 1 indicates that 66 controls, 67 susceptible and 50 resilient mice were used in the chronic social defeat stress paradigm. On the other hand, the immunohistochemistry data that strongly support the assumptions of the study were obtained from only 2 to 3 mice per group, according to the Materials and methods section. Such small n for the histology studies does not generate confidence in the results.</p><p>All graphs in the results, particularly for the behavior assessment, should show the distribution of each individual sample, as points in the bar graph.</p><p>For rigor and reproducibility, the time of the day for the behavioral assessments and the anesthetic used for the stereotaxic surgery need to be added to the Material and methods section.</p><p>How did the authors confirm that lysolecithin injection hit the desired site in the mPFC? What is the success rate of the stereotaxic surgery?</p><p>Were the same mice tested for social interaction at 7- and 21- days post lysolecithin injection? Is it possible that those mice present any adaptation to the experimental protocol that could bias the results of social interaction?</p><p>The images in the Figure 4B do not clearly show an increase of MBP expression in mice 21 days after LPC injection, compared to 7 days post treatment. Higher magnification images might better represent the remyelination process after 21 days.</p><p>Because IL-6 circulating levels or mRNA expression were not assessed, the discussion on IL-6 role in resilience and susceptibility to stress seems unwarranted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This study investigates the relationship between myelin structure and chronic social defeat stress to pinpoint the cellular basis underlying susceptibility or resilience to negative social experiences. A well-established chronic social defeat paradigm is used to identify the different behavioural responses to stress. Two distinct phenotypes emerge as the susceptible mouse group shows social withdrawal and resilient mouse group continues to exhibit normal social interaction.</p><p>These two group of mice also show differences in myelin and in oligodendrocyte cell linage differences in the mPFC region but not the NAc. Authors investigate the causal relationship between myelination and behavioural susceptibility to stress using a focal demyelination model. Demyelination of mPFC causes a decrease in the social interaction, similarly to stress exposure, and remyelination rescues that behavioural phenotype.</p><p>Overall, this is an exciting study demonstrating the role of myelin in social behaviour and maladaptive social behaviour following stress conditions in functionally relevant brain regions. The authors present evidence that resilience to stress requires maintenance of healthy myelination in mPFC, and that a susceptible subject exhibits impaired oligodendrocyte differentiation dynamics following the stressful condition specifically in mPFC, implicating disordered mPFC myelination in susceptibility to stress-induced social withdrawal. Together, the manuscript represents an important contribution to the field and lends compelling support for the concept that dysmyelination can play important roles in vulnerability to stress, and mood disorders.</p><p>I have the following suggestions for improvement to better support the interesting claims:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Regarding statistical rigor: Throughout the text, authors should give exact definition of &quot;n&quot; and state when it is number of mice, number of axons etc. Also, &quot;imaging volumes&quot; should be defined.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Figure 1A. The social defeat paradigm could be explained better by including the social interaction test that is performed in the end of chronic social defeat setting. This will make it clearer for the reader and it would be more coherent for Figure 4, and also help explain Figure 1B which shows the time spent in interaction zone that is measured during social interaction test.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Figure 1B. Including social interaction ratio as well will make it more consistent with the rest of the figure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Including more information on control group animals in the text would make it easier to understand the differences between mice groups. For example, &quot;control group, mice that were not exposed to any aggressor&quot; would be helpful in understanding the comparisons.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Throughout the study, authors use MBP immunohistochemistry alone to measure the myelin internode length. However, MBP alone may not differentiate the difference between an internode and an axon going into the field in z-axis. Co-staining with caspr should clarify that distinction. Rather than re-analyze all of the internode data this way, the authors could demonstrate in a sample group that caspr co-staining validates the original internode quantifications.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Including a scatter plot (g-ratio vs axon calibre) is a more informative way to present g-ratio data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>What does% MBP+ area measurement represent? Unaffected N.Ac. shows reduction in susceptible and resilient mice, but the affected mPFC show no difference for% MBP+ area. Maybe there are fewer myelinated axons in N.Ac for susceptible and resilient mice groups, does the EM data give any suggestion towards this?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Figure 4. Regarding social interaction test, presentation of time spent in the interaction zone or distance travelled in the presence and absence of a target mouse would show that subject mouse is fine to leave the interaction zone (i.e. motor abilities). In other words, unpacking the social interaction ratio.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Figure 4. At 21dpi, authors show that there is recovery of social interaction with the recovery of myelination in mPFC. Does the recovery of internode length also occur?

When the CDS animals were stratified by their social avoidance behavior in susceptible (high social avoidance) and resilient (low social avoidance, comparable to un-stressed controls), the authors observed that only in the mPFC susceptible animals were characterized by shorter myelinated segments and decreased myelin thickness. In parallel, susceptible mice had a reduced number of mature oligodendrocytes and decreased H3K9 methylation marks. Finally, the authors chemically and transiently induced demyelination in the mPFC and observed social avoidance behavior only under conditions of demyelination, not following spontaneous remyelination. The data are potentially interesting. At the same time I have a number of questions and concerns, which I believe the authors should address:</p><p>a) It would be helpful if the authors would plot individual data points in the bar graphs to better estimate group size and distribution of the data.

However, they do not show that the social behaviors were changed by the experience of aggression since they do not compare the social behavior before and after exposure.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully note that the reviewer’s comment addresses the validity of the model of social defeat. While our manuscript has adopted this methodology, we kindly refer previous literature on the characterization of this model in mice (Golden et al., 2011). We also note that a large literature supports social stress as modulator of social behavior in mice. A PubMed search querying for ‘Social Defeat Stress In Mice’ returned over 600 studies conducted between 1984 and 2019, with over 400 references within the past 5 years. Several previous publications (e.g. Mul et al., Neuropsychopharmacology, 2018; Muir et al., Neuropsychopharmacology, 2018), have reported that depressive-like behaviors -such as sucrose preference and social interaction – were indistinguishable between susceptible and resilient mice prior to the aggressor encounter, and were discriminated only after the social defeat stress. Importantly, mice in the two groups were carefully controlled for sex, age, and genetic background at the beginning of each experiment. Although one could posit that sporadic differences in social behavior might have pre-existed the encounter with the aggressor, it is important to note that differences in social avoidance behavior were only detected in susceptible mice after the aggressor encounter and not in the control group, which was not exposed to any aggressor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The question emerges whether PFC myelination affects the performance in social interactions and/or is affected itself by social defeat.

In agreement with this suggestion, we have revised Figure 2 and included additional panels (Figure 2D, 2E, 2G, and 2H) showing lack of correlation between myelin and behavior in the control group and the existence of a correlation between internodal length and social behavior only in mice after the aggressor encounter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Throughout the text, authors should give exact definition of &quot;n&quot; and state when it is number of mice, number of axons etc. Also, &quot;imaging volumes&quot; should be defined.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the rigorous review.

However, MBP alone may not differentiate the difference between an internode and an axon leaving the obrvational field in z-axis. Co-staining with Caspr should clarify that distinction. Rather than re-analyze all of the internode data this way, the authors could demonstrate in a sample group that Caspr co-staining validates the original internode quantifications.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid concern, which led us to perform additional experiments using immunohistochemistry with antibodies for Caspr and MBP, in order to carefully determine the internodal length in co-stained axonal segments.

Susceptible and resilient mice were defined on the basis of the social interaction test results (Golden et al., 2011). Social interaction ratio was determined by the time spent in the interaction zone with a conspecific mouse divided by the time spent in the absence of a mouse. A mouse with social interaction ratio below 1 would be classified as “susceptible”, whereas a mouse with a ratio above 1 would be classified as “resilient”. A detailed description on the classification of mice as susceptible and resilient is also included in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The first experiment included a large number of mice, while all follow-up analyses only used very few animals per group (e.g. 3 or 4).

As mentioned, resilient and susceptible groups were based on their social interaction ratio. The number of mice in the follow-up analysis was based on the experimental outcome, with resilient and susceptible mice from the same cohort being analyzed in each independent determination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The differences in histone modification are interesting, but only correlative.

Although the differences in histone modifications may not be causally linked to stress susceptibility, it is conceivable to interpret decreased histone methylation and defective lineage progression in the susceptible mice as being causally related. Nevertheless, we have attempted to better clarify this concept in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One is not convinced by the conclusions drawn from the LPC experiment.

This is an important and timely question, given the recent advances in the understanding of CNS myelin plasticity and its impact on behavior. However, several of the key experiments have major issues and the results do not convincingly support the author's conclusions.</p><p>Main concerns:</p><p>The authors use a well-established social defeat paradigm to differentiate between mice that are susceptible and resilient based on how they behave on a social interaction test after exposure to an aggressive mouse. […] The authors need to show there is no correlation between the characteristics of PFC myelin and social interactions in control mice before justifying looking at the effects of the defeat paradigm. This is critical as Liu and Casaccia and others previously reported a link between PFC myelin and social interactions. Moreover, the observation that lysolecithin-induced focal demyelination in the mPFC leads to social avoidance by itself further suggests that the social defeat might be irrelevant.</p></disp-quote><p>These concerns have been addressed above, in the response to the editor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The characterization of the differences between the susceptible and resilient mice at the cellular levels (Figure 3) has several problems. 1) It is my understanding that Olig2 is a transcription factor and therefore should be detected in the nucleus. However, the olig2 staining seems to extend beyond the nucleus. I would have expected to colocalize with the H3K9me3, which for sure should be nuclear. The authors need to use a nuclear dye to prove that the stainings are in the right cellular compartments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a nuclear DAPI staining to demonstrate that Olig2 is clearly located inside the nucleus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The olig2 staining in panel A is very different from the one shown in panel D both in density and quality, raising doubts about the results.</p></disp-quote><p>This is likely due to a suboptimal rendering of the figure. We have revised the figure to include distinct image selection, that we hope will address the reviewer’s concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is not clear that measuring the intensity of the H3K9me3 is the right variable to compare. It seems that% of olig2+ cells with H3K9me3 staining is necessary as well.</p></disp-quote><p>While the reviewer’s suggestion is very appropriate in case of marker expression, H3K9me3 is a histone modification which defines heterochromatin and, as such, present in all the cells. The intensity measurement takes into account the fact that H3K9me3 is a histone mark which is deposited during the differentiation of progenitors into oligodendrocytes. For this reason, one would expect that progenitors are characterized by lower levels of intensity for H3K9me3 staining than differentiated oligodendrocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) How can the density of CC1+ and olig2+ cells be the same? it is my understanding that CC1 marks mature oligodendrocytes, while olig2 also labels precursors.</p></disp-quote><p>The similar density of CC1+ and Olig2+ cells is due to the fact that Olig2 persists in mature cells. We have carefully re-evaluated the cell density of all populations. While the majority of Olig2+ cells are also CC1+, the density of Olig2+ cells was slightly higher than CC1+, as noted by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on the results shown in Figure 3A, the authors conclude that the exposure doesn't affect survival of cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage, yet they found a reduction in CC1+ cells (3C). Do they propose that mature oligodendrocyte revert to a progenitor state?</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to distinguish between overall reduction in number of CC1+ in the presence or absence of increased NG2+ cells. The latter is shown in Figure 3C, and suggests that the reduction of CC1+ cells is due to halted differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Introduction (second paragraph) the authors claim that this study provides &quot; mechanistic insights into the region-specific differences between the phenotypes, which we attribute to defective epigenetic regulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation.&quot; Given the issues with Figure 3, I don't believe that the results support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for allowing us to clarify the interpretation of the data. We have previously demonstrated a critical role of histone methylation in regulating oligodendrocyte lineage progression (Liu et al., 2015). In this manuscript we show the concomitance of impaired oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation and decreased histone methylation in susceptible, compared to resilient mice. By inference, we suggest that the detected alterations of oligodendrocyte lineage progression in susceptible mice could be due to aberrant histone modifications. In agreement with the reviewer, we have toned down the interpretation of the experimental results and clarified the statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the third paragraph of the Results section the authors mention that susceptible mice display significantly shorter myelinated segments. How was the internode length measured?</p></disp-quote><p>The internodal length was measured by quantifying MBP+ immunoreactive segments, flanked by Caspr+ immunoreactivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Discussion, the authors state that &quot;new myelin is formed in the mPFC of resilient mice as an adaptive mechanism to the repeated episodes of aggression&quot;. What data do they use to reach this conclusion?</p></disp-quote><p>It is technically very challenging to directly demonstrate new myelin formation in a behavioral setting experiment and we have reached the conclusion based in suggestive cumulative assessment of the experimental results. We found that resilient mice displayed longer internodal length and were characterized by higher numbers of differentiated oligodendrocytes, higher levels of histone marks and increased myelin thickness, compared to susceptible mice. We reasoned that these differences between the two groups could either be explained by the “escape” from an injury in resilient mice or by an active compensatory mechanism to the social stress. We tend to favor the latter. In addition, the positive correlation between internodal length and social interaction behavior detected only in mice exposed to the aggressor, but not in controls, further suggested the existence of an active response to social stress. This explanation is in agreement with the increasing evidence from mice and squirrel monkeys, which suggests stress resilience may arise from active coping strategies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other concerns:</p><p>In the Introduction the statement that &quot;multiple&quot; brain regions were evaluated is not appropriate given that only NAc and mPFC were described in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text to replace “multiple” with “two brain regions”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even though no significant correlation was seen between myelination in the NAc and social interaction in mice after chronic social defeat stress, the manuscript would benefit with a discussion on what mechanisms would possibly underlie the region-specific differences observed in the NAc and mPFC. How is the profile of expression of OLIG2, NG2, CC1 and H3K9me3 in the NAc in susceptible and resilient mice? Is the NAc somehow protected from the effects of defeat stress on myelination?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point and would need additional experiments to address. However, we did examine the profile of oligodendrocyte lineages cells in the NAc but did not include in the manuscript due to the limit of numbers of illustrations as a short report. We did not detect significant differences in OLIG2+ in the NAc. The density of CC1+ cells showed a trend of increase in both susceptible and resilient mice but did not reach statistical significance. We have included a discussion on potential mechanisms accounting for the region-specific differences observed in the NAc and mPFC, which we attributed to potential differences in local IL-6 levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How was the proper sample size determined in each protocol of the study? The figure legend 1 indicates that 66 controls, 67 susceptible and 50 resilient mice were used in the chronic social defeat stress paradigm.

Such small n for the histology studies does not generate confidence in the results.</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to highlight here that the experimental design required the generation of very large cohorts of mice to be exposed to the social defeat stress paradigm and then further classified as susceptible or resilient- based on the behavioral response. For each follow up analysis we then compared susceptible and resilient mice from each cohort. Due to the nature of the behavioral experiments and the reproducible results in the additional follow up analyses (e.g. qPCR, immunohistochemistry on several brain regions with various antibodies, and electron microscopy), we used a large number of mice for the initial assessment and then repeated the experiments in several cohorts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All graphs in the results, particularly for the behavior assessment, should show the distribution of each individual sample, as points in the bar graph.</p></disp-quote><p>Bar graphs have been replaced with individual data points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For rigor and reproducibility, the time of the day for the behavioral assessments and the anesthetic used for the stereotaxic surgery need to be added to the Material and methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>The information has been included in the Materials and methods Section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How did the authors confirm that lysolecithin injection hit the desired site in the mPFC?

Because the injection sites based on stereotaxic coordinates were only visible at 7dpi, we confirmed the injection in the mPFC in five mice that were sacrificed at 7dpi. In the subsequent cohorts, we collected mice only at 21dpi in order to follow them up longitudinally and assess the social behavior on the same mouse at 7dpi and 21dpi.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were the same mice tested for social interaction at 7- and 21- days post lysolecithin injection? Is it possible that those mice present any adaptation to the experimental protocol that could bias the results of social interaction?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. The same mice were tested for social interaction at 7dpi and 21 dpi so that we could directly compare the social behavior at the time of demyelination and after remyelination. It is theoretically possible that mice could have developed some adaptation to the experimental protocol, but it is quite unlikely based on our previous experience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The images in the Figure 4B do not clearly show an increase of MBP expression in mice 21 days after LPC injection, compared to 7 days post treatment.

In addition, based on the comments of the other reviewers, we examined internodal length at higher magnification and demonstrated indistinguishable internodal length after remyelination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Because IL-6 circulating levels or mRNA expression were not assessed, the discussion on IL-6 role in resilience and susceptibility to stress seems unwarranted.</p></disp-quote><p>The circulating IL-6 level before and after social defeat has been assessed in previous publications (e.g. Hodes et al., 2014). The local <italic>Il6</italic> mRNA level has been assessed and presented in the previous version of the manuscript but was removed due to the length limit of a short report and replaced with LPC experiments suggested by the editor. However, we believe this is an important aspect that could potentially explain the region-specific differences in oligodendrocyte response observed in the mPFC and NAc. Therefore, we kept it in the Discussion.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Overall, this is an exciting study demonstrating the role of myelin in social behaviour and maladaptive social behaviour following stress conditions in functionally relevant brain regions.
