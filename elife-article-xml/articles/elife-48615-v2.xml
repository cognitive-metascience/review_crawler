(PV) interneurons are frequently myelinated in the cerebral cortex. However, the factors governing the topography of cortical interneuron myelination remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that segmental myelination along neocortical interneuron axons is strongly predicted by the joint combination of interbranch distance and local axon caliber. Enlargement of PV+ interneurons increased axonal myelination, while reduced cell size led to decreased myelination. Next, we considered regular-spiking SOM+ cells, which normally have relatively shorter interbranch distances and thinner axon diameters than PV+ cells, and are rarely myelinated. Consistent with the importance of axonal morphology for guiding interneuron myelination, enlargement of SOM+ cell size dramatically increased the frequency of myelinated axonal segments. Lastly, we confirm that these findings also extend to human neocortex by quantifying interneuron axonal myelination from ex vivo surgical tissue. Together, these findings establish a predictive model of neocortical GABAergic interneuron myelination determined by local axonal morphology.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myelination is the insulating ensheathment of axons by oligodendrocytes to enhance action potential propagation and provide metabolic support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simons and Nave, 2015</xref>). Recent studies have shown that a large fraction of neocortical myelination arises from axons of fast-spiking, parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Micheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>). Nearly every cortical PV+ interneuron is myelinated, and most frequently with a proximally-biased axonal topography consisting of short internodes interspersed with branch points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stedehouder et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, other neocortical GABAergic interneuron subtypes are more rarely and sparsely myelinated, raising the question of what factors determine this cell type-restricted pattern of neocortical interneuron myelination.</p><p>Axonal diameter has been previously demonstrated as an important neuronal factor influencing myelination. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), a critical threshold of axonal diameter ofÂ ~1 Âµm has been identified, which largely predicts myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duncan, 1934</xref>). However in the central nervous system (CNS), the pattern is much less clear. Axons with diametersÂ ~200 nm can become myelinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hildebrand et al., 1993</xref>), while axon diameters as large asÂ ~800 nm can remain unmyelinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hildebrand et al., 1993</xref>). In vitro, oligodendrocytes reliably initiate myelination of synthetic nanofibers above a critical diameter ofÂ ~300 nm but rarely do so for smaller diameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bechler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goebbels et al., 2017</xref>). The diameter findings appear to extend to grey matter in vivo, where myelinated axonsÂ &lt;300 nm are rarely observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Micheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goebbels et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, following acute demyelination regenerated myelin sheaths often re-establish their pre-morbid pattern of myelination, suggesting that intrinsic axonal factors are primary determinants of myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Auer et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, oligodendrocytes appear to sense axonal diameters in vitro, and adjust their internode length based on fiber diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bechler et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, axonal diameter is firmly established as an important determinant underlying internode formation. However, in contrast to its high predictive validity in the PNS, axonal diameter is only moderately predictive of myelination topography in the CNS.</p><p>Here we examine the relationship between cortical interneuron myelination and axonal morphology in adult mouse prefrontal cortex. We find that the topography of myelination along individual PV+ axons is strongly predicted by the joint combination of axonal diameter and interbranch distance. The bivariate model combining axonal diameter and interbranch distance was superior to univariate models involving either axonal diameter or interbranch distance alone. We further explored the model robustness by implementing bidirectional manipulations of PV+ interneuron size. Enlargement of PV+ interneuron size resulting from cell-type specific deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic> increased the incidence of myelinated segments. Conversely, reduction of PV+ interneuron size by cell-type specific deletion of <italic>Ube3a</italic> decreased the frequency of myelinated segments. Yet notably, in both cases, the joint combination of interbranch distance and local axon caliber remained highly predictive of myelin topography. Lastly, we considered regular-spiking SOM+ cells, which normally have relatively shorter interbranch distances and thinner axon diameters than PV+ cells, and are rarely myelinated. However, enlargement of SOM+ cell size by cell type-specific deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic> dramatically increased the frequency of myelinated axonal segments and with a topography accurately predicted by the bivariate model. Lastly, we find that interneurons reconstructed from human ex vivo surgical tissue also exhibit similar rules governing their axonal myelination. Together, these results establish a highly predictive model of neocortical GABAergic interneuron myelination topography based on local axonal morphology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Super-resolution imaging of individual fast-spiking, PV+ interneuron axons</title><p>To examine the relationship between the axonal morphology of PV+ interneurons and their myelination, we targeted fluorescent PV+ interneurons in the adult medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of <italic>Pvalb</italic>::cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</xref>),Ai14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Madisen et al., 2012</xref>) mice for whole-cell patch-clamp recording and biocytin filling (<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 8 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

However, similar to the relationship with axonal diameter, a substantial proportion of interbranch segmentsÂ &gt;17.4 Âµm were unmyelinated (48%, 35 of 73 segments).</p><p>Therefore, we implemented a bivariate ROC analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jin and Lu, 2009</xref>) to explore whether the intersection of interbranch distance and axonal diameter might yield improved estimates of segmental myelination. Using a bivariate ROC analysis, the optimal interbranch distance and axonal diameter were 13.7 Âµm and 334 nm, respectively (AUCÂ =Â 0.99; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f,g</xref>). The joint combination of these two thresholds correctly predicted whether 128 of 132 segments contained an internode (97.0% accuracy), a significant improvement over the univariate models (interbranch distance: 70.5% accuracy, Fisherâs Exact Test p&lt;0.001; axonal diameter: 87.9% accuracy, Fisherâs Exact Test p=0.005). In particular, the bivariate model correctly predicted 35 of 36 myelinated internodes (sensitivityÂ =Â 97.2%), matching that of the univariate predictors (Fisherâs Exact Test p=0.99). However, the joint combination of interbranch distance and axonal diameter also predicted with high accuracy those segments in which myelination was absent (93 of 96 segments, specificityÂ =Â 96.9%), in contrast to the univariate models (Fisherâs Exact Test; axonal diameter: p=0.004, interbranch distance: p&lt;0.001). These findings suggest that the combination of interbranch distance and axonal diameter are highly predictive of segmental myelination along PV+ interneurons.</p><p>To independently corroborate the findings from supra-resolution imaging, we utilized electron microscopy (EM) for assessing the morphology and myelination of PV+ cell axons. We utilized a genetic labeling method to enhance the electron dense contrast of PV+ cell axons by stereotactic injection of a cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV2) into the mPFC of <italic>Pvalb</italic>::cre mice. Virus-transduced <italic>Pvalb</italic>::cre cells expressed the EM marker APEX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karube et al., 2004</xref>) fused with membrane-targeted GFP (mGFP-APEX2), permitting cell-type specific visualization of labeled PV+ cells in both fluorescence and electron micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3aâc,e,f</xref>). Prior to ultrastructural analysis, we used confocal microscopy to confirm that GFP+ neurons resembled PV+ cells morphologically. We also confirmed that nearly all of the virally labeled cells were immunopositive for PV (93.9 Â± 1.3%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3bâd</xref>). We then used APEX2-mediated peroxidase histochemistry to produce intracellular electron dense labeling. PV+ cells were readily detected by their darkened cytoplasmic staining in electron micrographs. This allowed us to identify axonal processes belonging to PV+ interneurons, whether myelinated or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e,f</xref>). The distributions of axon shaft diameter and bouton diameter, and their relationship with axonal branch order, were also highly comparable to previous ultrastructural analyses of fast-spiking, PV+ interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karube et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">NÃ¶renberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu and Jonas, 2014</xref>). Consistent with the fluorescence microscopy analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), myelination was observed exclusively around PV+ axonal fibers with shaft diametersÂ &gt;Â 330 nm. Mean diameter was significantly larger in myelinated than in unmyelinated segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>).

PV+ myelination exhibits a proximally-biased topography consisting of short internodes interspersed by branch points, whereas more distal axonal segments decorated with frequent <italic>en passant</italic> boutons remain unmyelinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stedehouder et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, other interneuron subclasses, such as irregularly spiking SOM-positive interneurons, are sparsely myelinated and contribute minimally to the total content of neocortical myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>). However, it has remained unknown why PV+ interneurons are preferentially myelinated compared to other neocortical interneuron subtypes. Here, we have provided evidence suggesting that axonal morphology is a strong determinant of the topography of myelination along individual axons.</p><p>Using single-cell axonal reconstructions, we revealed a high co-variation between segmental myelination and the joint combination of interbranch distance (~14 Âµm) and axonal diameter (~330 nm) thresholds. These parameters were remarkably similar across two interneuron subtypes (PV <italic>vs.</italic> SOM) and independent of genetic manipulation of their morphologies. Moreover, our results appear to provide an explanation for the proximally-biased topography of PV+ interneuron myelination, in which internodes are consistently present at the first axonal branch order with a declining probability at increasing branch orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stedehouder et al., 2018</xref>). Given that axonal shaft diameter decreases with increasing branch order (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>, but also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu and Jonas, 2014</xref>), distal axonal segments would therefore remain unmyelinated by virtue of their thinner axon shafts, despite often retaining supra-threshold interbranch distances. Differences in axon morphology presumably also account, at least in part, for the more robust myelination of neocortical PV+ interneurons relative to other interneuron subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Micheva et al., 2016</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether the myelination rules revealed here for interneurons extends to neocortical pyramidal cells, which also exhibit interspersed unmyelinated segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomassy et al., 2014</xref>). Prior studies using serial EM have identified aÂ ~Â 300 nm threshold of axon diameter for both GABAergic as well as non-GABAergic axons, suggesting the morphological parameters could well extend to excitatory axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Micheva et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We find here that an uninterrupted interbranch distance ofÂ ~14 Âµm is a strict requirement for segmental myelination in both PV+ and SOM+ interneurons. This threshold approximates the length of the smallest myelinated internodes found on neocortical axons of PV+ interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>) and pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomassy et al., 2014</xref>), and more generally across unspecified cell types in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chong et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, pre-myelination nodal clustering â the clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels which later form nodes of Ranvier â exists in similar intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Freeman et al., 2015</xref>). One possibility is thatÂ ~14 Âµm is the minimum biophysical length compatible with oligodendrocyte ensheathment.</p><p>The functional consequence of cortical interneuron myelination is currently unknown. Fast-spiking PV+ interneurons have demanding metabolic requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kann et al., 2014</xref>). As myelination has been established to function critically in providing axonal metabolic support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">FÃ¼nfschilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saab et al., 2016</xref>), myelination of PV+ interneurons could function by helping to optimize axonal energy utilization. Moreover, PV+ interneurons coordinate fast synchronizing network activity in the gamma frequency range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2014</xref>), for which segmental interneuron myelination could enhance synchronized inhibition through local modulation of action potential conduction velocity. This is particularly interesting given recent findings that distance-dependent inhibition functions in regulating gamma synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">StrÃ¼ber et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Only a small fraction of neocortical myelin localizes along the axons of irregular-spiking SOM+ interneurons, even though these cells representÂ ~30% of interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Markram et al., 2004</xref>). Accordingly, we found that the limited myelination of SOM+ interneurons was highly consistent with their generally thinner axon diameter and shorter interbranch distances compared to PV+ cells. Enlargement of SOM+ interneurons by cell-type restricted deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic> led to a dramatic increase in the frequency and extent of axonal myelination. Notably, this de novo myelination of SOM::TSC1 cells was also accurately predicted by the same joint axonal diameter and interbranch distance parameters as identified in PV+ interneurons. However, compared to the PV::TSC1 cell manipulation, SOM::TSC1 mice exhibited a more robust increase of global myelination in the mPFC, which was accompanied by an increased number of CC1+ mature oligodendrocytes. One possibility for this finding is that PV<sup>+</sup> cell morphology is already largely optimized for supra-threshold morphology permissive of myelination, in contrast to SOM<sup>+</sup> cells which are predominantly unmyelinated under normal conditions and therefore exhibit a greater magnitude increase of myelination when their morphology is enlarged by deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic>. A second non-mutually exclusive possibility is that SOM::TSC1 deletion results in additional non-cell autonomous effects that enhance global myelination and recruitment of mature oligodendrocytes.</p><p>An important outstanding question is whether the axonal morphology rules of PV+ and SST+ interneurons extend to neocortical glutamatergic pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Timmler and Simons, 2019</xref>). Some evidence exists to suggest that analogous morphological thresholds might also extend to non-GABAergic cells in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Micheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Micheva et al., 2018</xref>). For example, the more frequently myelinated first-order axonal segment of PV<sup>+</sup> GABAergic axons has aÂ ~Â 2.5 fold larger caliber than glutamatergic pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmidt et al., 2017</xref>). However, the highly discontinuous topography of internodes along glutamatergic pyramidal cells also suggests a major influence of factors beyond morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomassy et al., 2014</xref>). One possibility is that myelination of pyramidal neurons involves a combination of attractive and/or repulsive molecular cues, such as neuregulin-ErbB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lundgaard et al., 2013</xref>) or glutamatergic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gautier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Habermacher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kougioumtzidou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berret et al., 2017</xref>), in addition to axonal morphological thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Makinodan et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study observed that a subset of neocortical oligodendrocytes exclusively ensheath GABAergic interneurons, raising the possibility that distinct subtypes of oligodendrocytes might have neuronal cell type-specific rules governing axonal myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zonouzi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Myelination of neocortical glutamatergic pyramidal neurons is modulated in vivo by experience, as well as direct manipulation of neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fields, 2015</xref>). Activity-dependent myelination also extends to neocortical PV+ interneurons, a finding associated with concordant alterations in axonal morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stedehouder et al., 2018</xref>). When considered together with the current findings, it is therefore possible that neuronal activity-dependent myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibson et al., 2014</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitew et al., 2018</xref>) in the cerebral cortex might be mediated by axonal morphological plasticity.</p><p>The current studies were focused primarily on locally-projecting GABAergic interneurons in prefrontal cortex. However, several studies have identified long-range GABAergic projecting cells including, but not limited to, PV+ and SOM+ subclasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caputi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Melzer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). The high proportion of cerebral cortex PV+ cells exhibiting axonal myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>) makes it likely that long-range PV+ cells are also myelinated. However, due to technical limitations of slicing and intracellular biocytin labeling, it was not possible to definitively identify and reconstruct long-range GABAergic axons. Thus, the question remains open whether long-range GABAergic axons are also frequently myelinated and whether axonal morphology is similarly predictive of their myelination. Moreover, a related issue regards whether the present findings acquired in grey matter also extend to white matter, especially given regional differences among oligodendrocyte lineage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dimou and Simons, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spitzer et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Myelination of GABAergic interneurons has been observed in multiple mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stedehouder and Kushner, 2017</xref>). Notably, human neocortical fast-spiking PV+ interneurons appear to have more extensive total myelination per cell than is observed in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Micheva et al., 2018</xref>). This raises the possibility that neocortical interneuron myelination might have a crucial influence on higher cognitive function, as well as potentially in the pathophysiology of disorders involving CNS myelination impairments, such as multiple sclerosis or schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stedehouder and Kushner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Habermacher et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, it is important to determine the extent to which the morphological determinants of interneuron myelination are evolutionarily conserved. Here, we have performed axonal reconstructions and determined the topographical distribution of myelin internodes along human fast-spiking interneurons from acutely resected ex vivo neocortical tissue. We found that segmental neocortical interneuron myelination conforms to similar bivariate morphological thresholds as observed in mouse neocortex, on the basis of interbranch distance and axonal diameter, suggesting a species conservation of the biophysical constraints on the myelinating function of oligodendrocytes.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that the joint combination of interbranch distance and axonal shaft diameter accurately predicts the topography of neocortical interneuron myelination in vivo in both mouse and human.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All experiments were approved by the Dutch Ethical Committee and in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines.

Similarly, in SOM::TSC1 and SOM::WT mice, SOM+ interneurons were visualized by expression of eGFP using a GFP filter. Whole-cell recordings were made from layer III-V of the prelimbic area of the mPFC (betweenÂ ~200 and 600 Âµm from midline; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>; bregma: +2.10 till +1.54 mm) at betweenÂ ~20 Âµm andÂ ~60 Âµm of the slice surface using borosilicate glass pipettes (3.5â5.5 MÎ© resistance) with intracellular solution containing (in mM) 120 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 K-phosphocreatine, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.4 GTP, and 5 mg/ml biocytin (pH was adjusted to 7.4 using KOH, and osmolarity measured 285â290 mOsm).</p><p>Recordings were performed in aCSF at near-physiological temperatures (32â33Â°C) using HEKA EPC10 quattro amplifiers and Patchmaster software (40 Hz sampling rate). Series resistance was typicallyÂ &lt;25 MÎ© and fully compensated for bridge balance and capacitance; recordings in which the series resistance exceeded 25 MÎ© were not included in the pooled averages. No correction was made for liquid junction potential. Data analysis was performed offline using Igor Pro v6 (Wavemetrics). Individual interneurons were recorded and filled for at least 20 min. In addition, cells were injected at least 10 times with large depolarizing currents in current clamp mode (500 pA, 5 Hz, 2 s) to facilitate biotin diffusion into fine axonal arbors.</p><p>Basic physiological characteristics were determined from voltage responses to square-wave current pulses of 500 ms duration, ranging from â100 pA to +400 pA, and delivered in 20 pA intervals. Input resistance was determined by the slope of the linear regression through the voltage-current curve. Sag was determined as the voltage difference between the lowest voltage response and the steady-state response at the last 50 ms to a square-wave current pulses of 500 ms duration at â100 pA. Single action potential (AP) characteristics were obtained from the first elicited action potential. AP threshold was defined as the inflection point at the foot of the regenerative upstroke. AP amplitude was defined as the voltage difference between the threshold and peak voltage. AP half-width was measured at half of the peak amplitude. AP rise time was quantified as duration from 10% to 90% of the peak amplitude. The fast after-hyperpolarizing potential (fAHP) amplitude was measured as the peak hyperpolarizing deflection from AP threshold following AP initiation. AP frequency was determined from the number of APs in response to a square-wave current pulse of 500 ms duration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Human</title><p>Ex vivo recordings of acutely resected frontal cortex were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>).

A confocal whole-cell overview image and full reconstruction were used to track the centrifugal branch order of each traced segment. Segments were traced from the center of a branch point along the axon till the center of the next branch point using the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin for Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Longair et al., 2011</xref>). Traces always followed the centrifugal direction away from the soma. Next, along the trace, perpendicular lines of 50 pixels (equals 2 Âµm) were placed on every pixel (~40 nm) along the trace. On these perpendicular lines, biotin fluorescence intensity values were determined and a Gaussian curve was fitted on the intensity profile. Only fits with r<sup>2</sup>Â &gt;0.9 were included in further analysis, resulting in a loss of approximatelyÂ ~10% of axonal pixel measurements. Subthreshold fits (r<sup>2</sup>Â &lt;0.9) occurred due to occasional high background fluorescence, other processes in close proximity (axons/dendrites), extensive axon curvature, or rare axonal filopodia. Next, from the Gaussian fit the full width at half maximum (FWHM) was calculated. Consecutive FHWM values were not averaged, and individual pixel FWHM values are provided. Diameter profiles of full axon segments (excluding branch points and <italic>en passant</italic> boutons) were generated and analyzed further. Axonal segments that exited the slice before reaching the next branch point would be excluded from further analysis.

topography of interneuron myelination in mouse and human neocortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Sacha B Nelson as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Maria Cecilia Angulo (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors use structured illumination microscopy and EM to visualize myelinated axons of PV+ GABAergic interneurons in prefrontal cortex of the mouse and in ex vivo tissue samples from human patients. Following up on their prior work showing these neurons are frequently myelinated, the authors develop a bivariate model that accurately predicts the dependence of myelination on interbranch distance and axonal diameter. They test the model by genetically altering axon caliber using mutations of <italic>Tsc1</italic> and <italic>Ube3a</italic> both in the PV+ neurons and in a second population of interneurons (SST+) which normally have reduced myelination.</p><p>This study is well-performed, very interesting and timely. It tackles an important question in an emerging topic in the field of oligodendrocytes which concerns the mechanisms governing the myelination of local GABAergic interneurons. The measurements appear to have been carefully made and are well illustrated. The bivariate model is convincingly improved relative to univariate models of branch distance or diameter alone. Nevertheless, there are some points that need to be addressed to support the conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The modifications in the myelination of PV and SST interneurons should be specific for each cell type in the different knockout mice since these cells were targeted using PV-Cre and SST-Cre. It would be important to verify two points: (a) is there an impact on the global pattern of myelination in the PFC in the different knockout mice? (b) Are these differences attributable specifically to myelination changes in PV or SST cells (according to the knockout mouse). Figure 8D shows a strong increase in the general myelination of SOM::TSC1 mice compared to controls.

It would be important to verify two points: (a) is there an impact on the global pattern of myelination in the PFC in the different knockout mice? (b) Are these differences attributable specifically to myelination changes in PV or SST cells (according to the knockout mouse). Figure 8D shows a strong increase in the general myelination of SOM::TSC1 mice compared to controls. This increase seems high compared to the proportions of both SST interneurons and myelinated GABAergic interneurons in the PFC (Stedehouder et al., 2017). Authors did not show similar images for PV::TSC1 and PV::UBE3A.

Therefore, we have now quantified total myelin content across each of the mouse lines examined, which has been added as a new Figure 5âfigure supplement 1. Across the different PV-Cre knockout lines, we found no discernible changes in MBP labeling. In contrast, SST::TSC1 mice exhibit a robust increase in MBP labeling compared to littermate controls (updated Figure 8D and E). We have now modified the Results section to reflect the quantification of global MBP labeling across the different knockout lines:</p><p>Subsection âBi-directional manipulation of PV+ axon morphology alters myelinationâ: âDespite these PV cell type-specific alterations in myelination, no robust changes were observed in global myelination (Figureâfigure supplement 1A and B) or CC1+ mature oligodendrocyte density (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C and D).â</p><p>Subsection âGenetic manipulation of SOM+ axon morphology induces de novo myelinationâ: âConsistent with the high proportion of SOM+ cell myelination, the mPFC of SOM::TSC1 exhibited a marked increase of global myelination (Figure 8D and E) and a higher density of CC1+ mature oligodendrocytes (Figure 8F and G).â</p><p>In addition, we have also performed the requested cell counts across the different knockout lines in the PFC. No significant changes of PV (Figure 4âfigure supplement 3) or SST (Figure 7âfigure supplement 2) interneuron density were observed. These findings have been added to the revised manuscript in the Results section:</p><p>Subsection âBi-directional manipulation of PV+ axon morphology alters myelinationâ: âNotably, mPFC PV cell density was similar across PV::UBE3A, PV::TSC1, and PV::WT mice (Figure 4âfigure supplement 3A and B).â</p><p>Subsection âGenetic manipulation of SOM+ axon morphology induces de novo myelinationâ: âSOM<sup>+</sup> cell density was unchanged in the mPFC of SOM::TSC1 mice (Figure 7âfigure supplement 2A and B).â</p><p>We acknowledge that this does still leave open the question of whether the increase of myelination observed in the SST::TSC1 mice is specifically restricted to myelination along axons of SST+ cells, or whether an increase in myelination might also occur on other cell types. However, we hope the reviewers agree that definitively addressing this issue would require a considerable amount of additional work to answer a question that is beyond the central focus of this manuscript. Moreover, we have been very careful not to make any claims in the manuscript about potential non-cell autonomous effects of deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic> in SST+ cells and explicitly acknowledge this possibility in the Discussion section:</p><p>âHowever, compared to the PV::TSC1 cell manipulation, SOM::TSC1 mice exhibited a more robust increase of global myelination in the mPFC, which was accompanied by an increased number of CC1+ mature oligodendrocytes. [â¦] A second non-mutually exclusive possibility is that SOM::TSC1 deletion results in additional non-cell autonomous effects that enhance global myelination and recruitment of mature oligodendrocytes.â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A related question is: Does cell-specific deletion of Tsc1 or Ube3a have direct or indirect effects on myelination independent of changes in axon caliber and cell soma size?a) Changes in the pattern and extent of myelination of GABAergic axons require changes to oligodendrocytes. Do these cell-specific deletions effect numbers of oligodendrocyte precursors and mature oligodendrocytes? Figure 8D suggests the answer maybe yes. The current model the authors propose does not include these parameters, which are essential to determining whether changes in axonal morphology that are driving these changes in myelination pattern or other effects that are contributing to this phenotype. Thus, the claim that axonal morphology is necessary and sufficient to govern GABAergic myelination is too strong.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that an examination of the impact of the cell-type specific deletions on oligodendrocyte lineage cells would provide a more comprehensive picture. Accordingly, we have now performed quantification of mature oligodendrocytes across each of the different knockout lines. Consistent with the results of global MBP labeling, we found no differences across the PV mutant lines (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1), but a significant increase in oligodendrocytes in the PFC of the SOM::TSC1 mice (Updated Figure 8F and G). These findings have been added to the revised manuscript in the Results section:</p><p>Subsection âBi-directional manipulation of PV+ axon morphology alters myelinationâ: âDespite these PV cell type-specific alterations in myelination, no robust changes were observed in global myelination (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A and B) or CC1+ mature oligodendrocyte density (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C and D).â</p><p>Subsection âGenetic manipulation of SOM+ axon morphology induces de novo myelinationâ: âConsistent with the high proportion of SOM+ cell myelination, the mPFC of SOM::TSC1 exhibited a marked increase of global myelination (Figure 8D and E) and a higher density of CC1+ mature oligodendrocytes (Figure 8F and G).â</p><p>We have also moderated the ânecessary and sufficientâ claim in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Is there a cell-autonomous effect of gene deletions on axonal myelination?

Due to the relatively small proportion of nonrecombined cells, addressing this question would require breeding triple transgenic mice (e.g., SOM-cre x Cre-dependent fluorescent reporter x <italic>Tsc1<sup>f/f</sup></italic>), followed by two independent groups of biocytin labeling/reconstruction for recombined and non-recombined cells, for which the latter group would be very low yield since the rate of non-recombination is small and only definitively visualizable by post-hoc immunohistochemistry, thereby precluding targeted biocytin filling of the non-recombined population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Since the axon morphology and size of the cells are modified in knockout mice, we would expect drastic changes in the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of the target cells.

The reason for the overall limited effect is unknown, however likely to be due to homeostatic compensation due to the early neurodevelopmental deletion. With regard to the additional requested analyses, regrettably our recordings neglected to allow for measurement of cell capacitance. However, as suggested by the Reviewers, we have additionally analyzed the distributions for all parameters, but have not uncovered any significant differences. In addition, we have analyzed the second AP for all datasets, which also did not reveal differences between groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Does the diameter/morphology of GABAergic axons increase with maturity and subsequently affect the relationship with myelination?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fascinating, important and largely unexplored question.

In an effort to improve the statistical power of the model fit, we now succeeded to reconstruct another human fast-spiking interneuron from an additional patient, which has further strengthened our results. Nevertheless, we have moderated the strength of our conclusions regarding the robustness of the model fit for the human cells, and the correspondence between the mouse and human data, in the Introduction, Results section and in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
