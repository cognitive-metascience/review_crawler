satellites. <italic>PCM1</italic> null human cells show marked defects in ciliogenesis, precipitated by the loss of specific proteins from satellites and their relocation to centrioles. We find that an amino-terminal domain of PCM1 can restore ciliogenesis and satellite localization of certain proteins, but not others, pinpointing unique roles for PCM1 and a group of satellite proteins in cilium assembly. Remarkably, we find that PCM1 is essential for tethering the E3 ligase, Mindbomb1 (Mib1), to satellites. In the absence of <italic>PCM1</italic>, Mib1 destabilizes Talpid3 through poly-ubiquitylation and suppresses cilium assembly. Loss of PCM1 blocks ciliogenesis by abrogating recruitment of ciliary vesicles associated with the Talpid3-binding protein, Rab8, which can be reversed by inactivating Mib1. Thus, PCM1 promotes ciliogenesis by tethering a key E3 ligase to satellites and restricting it from centrioles.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12950.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12950.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>centriolar satellites</kwd><kwd>ciliogenesis</kwd><kwd>E3 ligase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000071</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01HD069647</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dynlacht</surname><given-names>Brian D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ciliogenesis is regulated by a certain group of centriolar satellite proteins, among which an E3 ligase is tethered by PCM1 to maintain the normal level of pro-ciliogenic protein on centrioles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primary cilia are antenna-like organelles that protrude from the surface of many differentiated cells and serve to orchestrate key signaling events required for development (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kobayashi and Dynlacht, 2011</xref>). The cilium and centrosome comprise several hundred polypeptides, although the functions of many of these proteins remain uncharacterized. Recent efforts, however, have begun to shed considerable light on processes and constituents that play a key role in the biogenesis, structure, and function of these organelles.</p><p>Cilium assembly is initiated in cultured cells that have exited the cell cycle after mitogen deprivation. The process commences with the docking of ciliary vesicles at the distal appendages of the basal body, proceeds with the elongation of an axoneme concomitant with recruitment of Rab8-associated vesicles, and culminates with the fusion of the nascent cilium with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kobayashi and Dynlacht, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sorokin, 1962</xref>). Other proteins, including the BBSome and Intraflagellar Transport (IFT) complexes, contribute to growth, assembly, and maintenance of the cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>). An extensive array of centriolar and basal body proteins has also been shown to play a critical role in ciliogenesis. Among these key regulators, Talpid3 is essential for ciliogenesis, and mutations in the gene encoding this protein lead to a panoply of developmental defects in model organisms and human ciliopathies, including Joubert Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alby et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachmann-Gagescu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bangs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Malicdan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Roosing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stephen et al., 2015</xref>). We have shown that Talpid3 associates with Rab8, a component of ciliary vesicles, and silencing Talpid3 compromises the efficient recruitment of ciliary vesicles to basal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kobayashi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Other proteins, including Mindbomb 1 (Mib1), act to antagonize ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Villumsen et al., 2013</xref>). Mib1 was first reported as an E3 ligase associated with Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Itoh et al., 2003</xref>), although connections, if any, between a role for Mib1 in Notch signaling and ciliogenesis remain unknown. More recently, Mib1 was shown to associate with centriolar satellites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Villumsen et al., 2013</xref>), electron-dense, cytoplasmic granules defined by the presence of PCM1. Centriolar satellites (CS) are thought to play a role in trafficking of cargoes to the centrosome and cilium and are thought to promote ciliogenesis. Recently, an inhibitory role for centriolar satellite proteins has also been proposed, although many questions remain regarding the assembly of these granules and their function in ciliogenesis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tollenaere et al., 2015</xref>). For example, Mib1 was shown to associate with AZI1/Cep131 (hereafter Cep131) and PCM1 at centriolar satellites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Villumsen et al., 2013</xref>), and while Mib1 over-expression was shown to promote ubiquitylation of both proteins, no impact on their stability was observed. Thus, although Mib1 over-expression inhibits ciliogenesis, the mechanistic connections, if any, between Cep131 and PCM1 ubiquitylation and the inhibition of ciliogenesis were unclear. In other studies, centriolar satellites were shown to play a second, restrictive role in ciliogenesis by regulating the timely redistribution of the BBSome subunit, BBS4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stowe et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, centriolar satellites could play opposing roles by promoting or antagonizing initiation of the ciliogenesis program.</p><p>Here, we find that PCM1 plays a prominent role in ciliogenesis by sequestering proteins in the centriolar satellite compartment. Importantly, PCM1 restricts Mib1 to satellites, preventing its translocation to centrioles, which would otherwise promote Talpid3 destabilization, a failure to recruit Rab8a, and inhibition of cilium assembly. Moreover, using PCM1 knock-out cells, we show that the ability of this protein to promote ciliogenesis by partitioning satellite proteins is not universal, allowing us to identify distinct roles in cilium assembly. Our studies provide novel insights into mechanistic roles for PCM1 in ciliogenesis and explain how centriolar satellites can play a positive role in ciliogenesis by antagonizing inhibitors of this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>PCM1</italic> knock-out cells display a constellation of defects and cannot ciliate</title><p>In an effort to study the role of centriolar satellites in the assembly of primary cilia, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene-editing in retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE1) to ablate <italic>PCM1</italic>, a central CS component.

Interestingly, the disappearance of each of these proteins at satellites was accompanied by their appearance at centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with these observations, the satellite proteins Cep72, Cep90, and Cep290 were also retained at centrosomes upon PCM1 knock-down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lopes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stowe et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, we observed an overall reduction in abundance of several satellite proteins, including Cep131, BBS4, and Cep90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). On the other hand, Mib1 levels were elevated upon loss of PCM1, and other proteins that populate the satellite compartment, centrioles, or ciliary vesicles, such as Cep290, Ofd1, Rab8, and Rab11, were unaffected, suggesting that the complete loss of PCM1 has specific effects on distinct centrosomal and peri-centrosomal components. We ruled out the possibility that these alterations resulted from changes in transcript levels or stability, rather than protein stability, by assessing steady state levels through quantitative reverse transcriptase-coupled PCR (qRT-PCR)(data not shown).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12950.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The amino-terminal domain of PCM1 recruits specific centriolar satellite proteins.</title><p>Control and PCM1 KO RPE1 cells were infected with lentivirus containing empty vector or the indicated Myc-mPCM1 fragments for 3days and stained with the antibodies against Myc, GT335, Cep90, Mib1, and Cep131. Diffuse cytoplasmic staining of PCM1 was observed with the fragment spanning residues 601–2025.

Consistent with the notion that PCM1 serves as a platform to assemble centriolar satellites, we found that PCM1 interacted with Cep90 and C2CD3 through domains that overlapped with Cep131- and OFD1-binding regions but that were distinct from the CEP72- and Mib1-interacting domain. In line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kamiya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lopes et al., 2011</xref>), PCM1 could associate with OFD1 through residues 600–1200 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). We also showed, for the first time, that PCM1 interacts with Mib1, Cep72, Cep90, C2CD3, and Cep131 through distinct, but sometimes overlapping, binding domains. Cep290 interacted with multiple PCM1 fragments, preventing us from more precisely mapping interacting regions (data not shown). Most strikingly, the PCM1 fragment spanning residues 1–1200, which could restore cilia and centriolar satellites, interacted with Mib1, OFD1, Cep131 and Cep290, but not Cep90 or C2CD3. In contrast, the PCM1 fragment containing residues 601–2025, which failed to restore cilia or centriolar satellites, interacted strongly with most of the proteins we analyzed, except for Mib1 and Cep72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results indicate a potentially important role for PCM1-Mib1 and PCM1-Cep72 interactions in both ciliogenesis and satellite assembly, while suggesting that other PCM1 interactions are not sufficient to restore these processes.</p><p>Next, we asked whether the interactions identified above are required for the centriolar satellite localization of each of these factors. We re-introduced full length mouse PCM1, or several truncations, in <italic>PCM1</italic> null cells and visualized centriolar satellite staining for Mib1, Cep90, and Cep131. Consistent with our mapping data, the amino-terminal 1200 residues of PCM1 rescued the centriolar satellite localization of Mib1 and Cep131, but not Cep90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further, the rescue of Cep131 centriolar satellite localization by the amino-terminal 1200 residue fragment of PCM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) could be explained by binding to PCM1, through a PCM1-Mib1-Cep131 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Villumsen et al., 2013</xref>), or a combination of interactions.</p><p>These results lead to several important conclusions. First, PCM1 promotes ciliogenesis, most likely through interactions with a specific cohort of proteins, including Mib1, OFD1, Cep131, Cep72, Cep290, and/or other proteins that we have not tested here, whereas interactions with other satellite proteins, namely, Cep90 and C2CD3 do not appear to be required for ciliogenesis. Our results also suggest that proper centriolar satellite localization of certain pro-ciliogenic proteins, such as Cep90, is not universally required for ciliogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PCM1 anchors Mib1 at centriolar satellites</title><p>Next, we investigated the potential interplay between PCM1 and Mib1 because Mib1 levels were elevated in <italic>PCM1</italic> knock-out cells, in striking contrast with the behavior of other centriolar satellite proteins that we examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and because the domain in PCM1 essential for ciliogenesis can interact with Mib1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). First, we examined the localization of Mib1 in wild-type and <italic>PCM1</italic> null cells. To help visualize centrosomes more accurately without the confounding effects of centriolar satellites, within which they are interspersed, we also treated cells with nocodazole, which effectively eliminates the latter, microtubule-dependent structures. Consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Villumsen et al., 2013</xref>), Mib1 did not co-localize with the centriolar marker, centrin, but primarily localized to satellites in untreated control cells, and this observation was made more evident by treatment of these cells with nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, we found that in <italic>PCM1</italic> knock-out cells, the loss of satellites, observed in the presence or absence of nocodazole, was accompanied by re-localization of Mib1 to centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). Furthermore, we observed identical results when PCM1 was ablated with an siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that depletion of PCM1 triggers the destabilization of satellites and thereby promotes the re-localization and accumulation of Mib1 protein at centrioles. Indeed, trafficking to centrioles might stabilize Mib1 at this location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). PCM1 could therefore function to actively sequester Mib1 at satellites. To test this possibility, we rescued <italic>PCM1</italic> null cells with Myc-PCM1 and examined centriolar staining in nocodazole-treated cells. We found that re-expression of PCM1 restored both the exclusion of Mib1 from centrosomes and native levels of this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C,D</xref>). Re-expression of the amino-terminal PCM1 1–1200 fragment also restored the exclusion of Mib1 from centrosomes and reduced Mib1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with an ability of PCM1 to actively sequester Mib1. Moreover, ectopic expression of Mib1 resulted in its re-localization to centrioles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>), suggesting that the number of binding sites for Mib1 (within centriolar satellites) may be saturable.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12950.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mib1 re-locates to centrosomes in <italic>PCM1</italic> null cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Control and <italic>PCM1</italic> KO RPE1 cell were incubated with DMSO or nocodazole (NZ; 1μg/ml) for 8 hr and then immuno-stained with Mib1 (green) and centrin (red) antibodies (<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>). Representative images of centrosomes are shown (<bold>A</bold>).

To this end, we performed analogous experiments in <italic>TALPID3</italic> null RPE1 cells, which we generated using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene-editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Like the <italic>PCM1</italic> knock-out, <italic>TALPID3</italic> null cells were unable to ciliate, but unlike our findings with <italic>PCM1</italic> null cells, <italic>TALPID3</italic> loss had no impact on Mib1 localization and was not rescued by Mib1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These results suggest that PCM1, and by extension, centriolar satellites, play an important role in promoting primary ciliogenesis by sequestering and functionally antagonizing the Mib1 E3 ligase.</p><p>The loss of PCM1 led to the near-disappearance of several centriolar satellite proteins, namely, Cep131, Cep90, and BBS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>). We speculated that if PCM1 anchoring plays a critical role in restricting the localization and levels of Mib1 and other centriolar satellite proteins, then <italic>PCM1</italic> ablation could mimic the effects of ectopically expressing Mib1, which likewise suppresses cilium assembly. Consistent with this idea, ectopic expression of wild-type, but not catalytically inactive, Mib1 prompted the disappearance of PCM1, Cep131, and, to a lesser extent, Talpid3, in RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This result was not restricted to RPE1 cells, since we observed similar or even more dramatic down-regulation of each of these proteins, particularly Talpid3, in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The impact of Mib1 was specific, since ectopic expression of Mib1 led to diminished levels of certain centriolar satellite proteins (PCM1, Cep131, Cep290, Cep90), but not others (Ofd1, BBS4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, the abundance of centriolar/centrosomal proteins (Sas6) or modified tubulins (acetylated tubulin) was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). <italic>PCM1</italic> null cells have dramatically reduced overall levels of Cep131, which also localizes to centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and expression of wild-type, but not inactive, Mib1 completely eliminated centrosomal Cep131 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Expression of Mib1 led to the near-complete dissolution of centriolar satellites typified by PCM1 and Cep290 enrichment, whereas inactive Mib1 dramatically led to their stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Consistent with this observation, depletion of Mib1 with two distinct siRNAs led to dramatic up-regulation of centriolar satellites, concomitant with Cep131, Cep290, and PCM1 stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).

In our previous proteomic screen for Talpid3-interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kobayashi et al., 2014</xref>), we identified Mib1 as a robust interactor. We confirmed this interaction by expressing either Mib1 or Talpid3 in cells and performing reciprocal immunoprecipitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We did not observe an interaction between endogenous Mib1 and Talpid3, since these proteins normally reside in discrete compartments; instead, we found that ectopic Mib1 could bypass this restriction. We generated a series of Talpid3 truncation mutants and showed that an amino-terminal fragment spanning residues 1–1000 interacted most strongly with Mib1, although individual fragments spanning either half of this fragment also interacted with Mib1, albeit much more weakly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Next, we assessed whether ectopic Mib1 expression could promote ubiquitylation of Talpid3 in vivo. We co-expressed Talpid3, with either wild-type or catalytically inactive Mib1 and His-tagged ubiquitin, then affinity purified all ubiquitylated proteins through metal chelation chromatography. We found that Mib1 was highly ubiquitylated, most likely through auto-ubiquitylation, since the catalytically inactive mutant did not exhibit a similar high molecular weight ladder, in line with previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Villumsen et al., 2013</xref>). More importantly, expression of active Mib1 led to poly-ubiquitylation of Talpid3, suggesting that the ubiquitin ligase activity of Mib1 is required to target this substrate for degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12950.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Mib1 promotes poly-ubiquitylation of Talpid 3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mib1 interacts with Talpid3. GFP-Mib1 was expressed in HEK293T cells, lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with control IgG, anti-GFP, or Talpid3 antibodies, and western blot analysis was performed with the indicated antibodies.

We reasoned that the aberrant localization of Mib1 brought about by removal of PCM1, its centriolar satellite tether, could perturb the abundance of Talpid3, if indeed the latter protein were a substrate of this E3 ligase. Accordingly, we found that ablation of the <italic>PCM1</italic> gene led to a strong reduction in Talpid3 levels at centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Next, we tested whether Mib1 sequestration by PCM1 is indeed a key limiting factor in the regulation of Talpid3 levels by depleting Mib1 in <italic>PCM1</italic> knock-out or control cells. Remarkably, silencing Mib1 with either of two siRNAs fully restored wild-type Talpid3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). Conversely, expression of active, but not inactive, Mib1 likewise drastically reduced the levels of centriolar Talpid3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>). These studies established for the first time that Mib1, once released from PCM1, can relocate to centrioles and result in the ubiquitylation of Talpid3, promoting its down-regulation.</p><p>These experiments, however, did not address whether Mib1 was acting on cytoplasmic pools of Talpid3 or whether it could act locally within the centrosome if it were constitutively transported to that compartment in the presence of wild-type PCM1. To address this question, we fused Mib1 to the PACT domain, which results in transport of linked proteins to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gillingham and Munro, 2000</xref>). As expected, in the presence of PCM1, the PACT-Mib1 protein localized to centrosomes, whereupon this fusion protein, but not the catalytically inactive mutant, provoked a notable reduction in Talpid3 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). In addition, expression of PACT-Mib1, but not the inactive mutant, led to a dramatic reduction in ciliation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Thus, within the limits of our assay, we conclude that Mib1 can act locally at centrioles to de-stabilize Talpid3 (and likely other substrates) and abolish ciliogenesis.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12950.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Centrosomal targeting of Mib1 destabilizes Talpid3 and inhibits ciliogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (<italic>Left</italic>) RPE1 cells were infected with empty (-), myc-PACT-Mib1-WT, or myc-PACT-Mib1-C985S lentiviruses for 72 hr and western blotting performed to detect the fusion protein. (<italic>Middle</italic>) Visualization of centrosomal localization of Mib1 in cells infected as in (A).

Assembly of this organelle is initiated when mother centrioles mature to form basal bodies and dock ciliary vesicles with the assistance of their distal appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim and Dynlacht, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kobayashi and Dynlacht, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sorokin, 1962</xref>). One of the earliest events, detectable within 90 min post-serum deprivation, is the accumulation of Golgi- and endosome-derived Rab8 vesicles at mother centrioles and emergence of a Rab8-positive axoneme. It is known that Rab8 interacts with the distal appendage protein, Cep164 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, Rab8 also associates with the distal centriolar protein, Talpid3, and depletion of Talpid3 abolishes Rab8 localization to basal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kobayashi et al., 2014</xref>). We found that Cep164-positive basal bodies were decorated with Rab8 in serum-starved, control cells, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). In striking contrast, <italic>PCM1</italic> null cells failed to recruit Rab8 to basal bodies. We showed that this defect stemmed from loss of PCM1, since it was rescued by expression of this protein. Importantly, the failure to recruit Rab8 could not be explained by the reduced overall abundance of Rab8 or its upstream regulator, Rab11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

These studies strongly suggest that the arrest of ciliogenesis accompanying PCM1 ablation is due to a failure to accrete Rab8–associated vesicles at the basal body and is a direct result of the mis-localization of Mib1. Further, given that (1) Cep164 localization is unaffected and (2) centriolar Talpid3 levels are sharply reduced in <italic>PCM1</italic> null cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>), we propose that the striking ciliary defects in these cells stem, at least in part, from enhanced Mib1 localization to centrioles, triggering depletion of Talpid3 and a concomitant loss of Rab8a recruitment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Use of <italic>PCM1</italic> null cells to dissect a required role for specific proteins in ciliogenesis</title><p>Centriolar satellites are comprised of numerous pro- and anti-ciliogenic proteins, and many of these proteins also localize to centrioles, independently of centriolar satellites (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tollenaere et al., 2015</xref>). This complexity makes it challenging to investigate whether the defects in ciliogenesis resulting from depletion of these proteins can be attributed to centriolar satellite dysfunction, abnormal centriole function, or both. This observation limits our ability to circumscribe the set of centriolar satellite proteins required for ciliogenesis. To this end, we focused on PCM1, as it is an essential organizer of centriolar satellites. By generating <italic>PCM1</italic> knock-out cells and performing structure-function analyses, we found that the pro-ciliogenic function of PCM1 is likely to depend on its interactions with a limited group of satellite proteins, a subset of which have been analyzed here. Thus, we showed that PCM1-dependent centriolar satellite tethering of Mib1, but not Cep90, is required for ciliogenesis. Use of these tools will accelerate our understanding of the contributions of individual satellite proteins to ciliogenesis through their function at one location or the other. Ongoing proteomic searches for satellite proteins that preferentially interact with the pro-ciliogenic N-terminal domain of PCM1 versus other PCM1 fragments should be most informative.</p><p>Cells with defects in cilium assembly frequently exhibit abnormal distributions or morphology of centriolar satellites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klinger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kobayashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sedjaï et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stowe et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is not clear whether the distribution and morphology of satellites have a direct impact on ciliogenesis. Specifically, it has been shown that over-expression of BBS4 and Cep72 disrupts centriolar satellite distribution and results in the formation of aggregates that sequester PCM1, which seems to negatively impact ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stowe et al., 2012</xref>). We observed similar PCM1-associated foci when we re-introduced PCM1 fragments spanning 1–1200 or 1–1500 into null cells. We found that these foci co-stained with Mib1 and Cep131. Furthermore, these cells ciliated with a frequency comparable to wild-type cells. Our data therefore suggest that the formation of PCM1 foci, particularly those that co-recruit Mib1 and Cep131, does not, per se, inhibit ciliogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A novel model linking PCM1 and its satellite function to an E3 ligase, Talpid3 destruction, and Rab8 recruitment</title><p>In this study, we have identified novel roles for the centriolar satellite protein, PCM1, in regulating the localization of an E3 ligase, Mib1, which controls the abundance of key centriolar satellite and centriolar targets. We have elucidated a biochemical pathway linking PCM1 to Mib1, which is able to regulate the abundance of Talpid3—and, most likely several other proteins at centrioles and centriolar satellites--through ubiquitylation, and Rab8 recruitment, which is required for the early stage of ciliogenesis. Although such a linear pathway is the most straightforward model for our observations, other possible explanations cannot be ruled out at this time. For example, it is possible that Mib1 and Talpid3 function through independent pathways and that Talpid3 is required for cilium assembly irrespective of PCM1 status and Mib1 activity. It will therefore be important to expand our view of the Mib1 regulatory network and to identify additional Mib1 targets. Nevertheless, our data vastly extend a model wherein centriolar satellites sequester proteins, such as BBS4, temporally modulating the assembly of the BBSome and the onset of cilium assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stowe et al., 2012</xref>). BBSome components, including BBS4, have been implicated in cilium assembly, although other studies have not observed such a role for BBS4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mykytyn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hernandez et al., 2013</xref>). Using these <italic>PCM1</italic> null cells, it should now be possible to investigate additional roles for PCM1 in sequestering key components at satellites. It is notable that inactivation of a single protein, Mib1, is able to restore Rab8 recruitment in <italic>PCM1</italic> null cells, as this finding suggests that fine-tuning of Mib1 abundance—and therefore localization--may play a key, rate-limiting step in controlling ciliogenesis.</p><p>It is likely that Mib1 will target for destruction other proteins critical for ciliogenesis, in addition to Talpid3. For example, knock-out mice deleted for both isoforms of Rab8 (<italic>Rab8a/Rab8b</italic>) are viable, and it is possible that another Rab (<italic>Rab10</italic>) compensates for the loss of this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sato et al., 2014</xref>), although the ability of <italic>Rab10</italic> to functionally substitute for Rab8 remains to be shown. It is also possible that Mib1 could target other components involved in ciliary vesicle assembly. It is also not known whether the related <italic>Mib2</italic> gene can play a role in ciliogenesis. These studies will be accelerated by the use of <italic>Mib1</italic> and <italic>Mib2</italic> knock-out mice, which have been created. These animals display strong Notch phenotypes, similar to zebrafish <italic>Mib1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Itoh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koo et al., 2007</xref>). Thus far, ciliary phenotypes have not been observed or examined in these mice, to our knowledge. It would be interesting to examine cilium assembly in these knock-out mice and cells derived from them.</p><p>Our work confirms novel findings implicating Mib1 in the regulation of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Villumsen et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, Mib1 was shown to interact with PCM1 and Cep131, and, interestingly, induction of cellular stress resulting from UV or heat shock led to the p38 MAPK-dependent inactivation of Mib1, reduced ubiquitylation of Cep131, PCM1, and Cep290, and enhanced ciliogenesis. While our respective studies are in agreement that Mib1 regulates ciliogenesis, our results differ in several significant ways. First, we have observed that each of the centriolar satellite Mib1 substrates (Cep131 and PCM1) are highly poly-ubiquitylated by ectopic Mib1, rather than being mono-ubiquitylated, and this leads to the de-stabilization of both proteins, in contrast with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Villumsen et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to these centriolar satellite proteins, we show that Talpid3, a centriolar protein required for ciliogenesis, is also poly-ubiquitylated under these conditions. Further, we found that removal of Mib1 led to the stabilization of both Cep131 and PCM1, enhancing the stability of centriolar satellites. We have replicated these findings in two cell lines. At present, we cannot explain the apparent discrepancy between our findings and the previous study and ascribe them to experimental differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Villumsen et al., 2013</xref>). We note that a recent study indicated that Mib1 could regulate the stability of another centrosomal protein, Plk4, through lysine 11-, 29-, and 48 ubiquitin linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Čajánek et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it should be most interesting to identify additional components regulated by Mib1 and, potentially, to link these findings to the original role of Mib1 in Notch signaling.</p><p>It is possible that the loss of satellite integrity could play important roles in human pathological conditions. For example, we note that ~15% of prostate tumors exhibit deletions in the <italic>PCM1</italic> gene (cBioPortal). Given that the loss of cilia is an early event in the transformation of this tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hassounah et al., 2013</xref>), our studies suggest that further investigation of a role for <italic>PCM1</italic> in prostate tumorigenesis is warranted. One prediction of our model is that Mib1 may be aberrantly up-regulated or mis-localized in these tumors as a result of <italic>PCM1</italic> mutations, which, we have shown, could abolish cilium assembly. In this setting, and perhaps others, loss of <italic>PCM1</italic> and satellite tethering could play a signature role in the transformative process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human telomerase-immortalized retinal pigment epithelial cells (hTERT RPE-1, ATCC CRL-4000, passage 3–6) were obtained from ATCC and were confirmed to be free of mycoplasma.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers found the manuscript contained a significant amount of high quality data (like the PCM1 KO phenotypes) that could constitute an important contribution to the field. However, the proposed model does not seem to fit together as outlined below and the in vivo function of Mib1 seems at odds with this work as pointed out by the second reviewer. Based on the comments of the experts, we cannot proceed further with your manuscript for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Should you manage to obtain experimental support for the issues raised by the reviewers, we would be willing to consider a new manuscript for a full review. In any case, we hope you will find our reviewers comments helpful in strengthening your proposal for submission elsewhere or as mentioned above to <italic>eLife</italic> as a new manuscript.</p><p>The major issues follow.</p><p>The model pathway of PCM1 controlling MIB1, which in turns controls TALPID3 is not fully supported by the data and that other models are not considered.</p><p>Issues around the model include: a) The model suggests that MIB1 is a critical regulator of cilia formation, which is at odds with the mouse knock-out phenotype as pointed out by reviewer 2.b) TALPID3 levels do not appear to be affected in RPE1 cells with altered MIB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The data in U2OS cells is better, but there are no cilia formation assays with these cells. c) The alternative interpretation of the epistasis relationship between MIB1 and TALPID3 is that they are on independent pathways and that TALPID3 is required for cilia formation regardless of PCM1/MIB1 status. d) A further complication is that your group reported that TALPID3 depletion causes defects in centriolar satellites (Kobayashi et al., 2014, JCB 204:215-229). What is the status of MIB1 in the TALPID3 KO cells?</p><p>Additionally, the discussion of Villumsen et al. (2013, EMBO J. 32:3029-3040) seems dismissive. This study should be discussed in more detail.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper examined the function of PCM1 by knocking it out in RPE1 cells. The paper has a lot of nice, convincing data but the paper is poorly written and over interpretation is rampant. No alternatives are considered for experiments and the possibility that additional proteins may participate in the phenotypes is not considered.</p><p>Most of my concerns could be addressed with a careful rewrite of the manuscript. However, a major conclusion of the paper is that the loss of PCM1 allows Mib1 to relocate to the centrioles and destabilize a number of proteins thus preventing ciliogenesis. The support for this happening at the centriole is weak. For this conclusion to be made, the authors need to relocalize Mib1 to centrioles even when PCM1 is present and show that this has the same phenotype as loss of PCM1.</p><p>&quot;These results lead to several important conclusions. First, PCM1 promotes ciliogenesis through interactions with a specific cohort of proteins, including Mib1, OFD1, Cep131, Cep72 and Cep290…&quot;. No evidence that is true. It could be one of these proteins or it could be something else.</p><p>Subsection “PCM1 anchors Mib1 at centriolar satellites”: &quot;because the PCM1-Mib1 interaction is essential for restoration of ciliogenesis in PCM1 knock-out cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).&quot; This was not demonstrated.</p><p>In the same section: &quot;Moreover, ectopic expression of Mib1 promoted its association with the centriolar protein Talpid3, indicating re-localization to centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and suggesting that the number of binding sites for Mib1 (within centriolar satellites) may be saturable.&quot; Nothing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows relocalization to centrioles.</p><p>Subsection “PCM1 regulates ciliogenesis through sequestration of Mib1”: &quot;Expression of Mib1 led to the near-complete dissolution of centriolar satellites typified by PCM1 enrichment, whereas inactive Mib1 dramatically led to their stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).&quot; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5 supplement 3A</xref> shows that PCM1 is mostly gone when Flag-Mib1-WT is expressed. Thus one cannot say anything about satellites using PCM1 as the marker.</p><p>In the same section: &quot;Consistent with this observation, depletion of Mib1 with two distinct siRNAs led to dramatic up-regulation of centriolar satellites, concomitant with Cep131 and PCM1 stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).” There is nothing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> to address this point. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> shows western blots to support the increase in Cep131 and PCM1, but I cannot find the data to support the up-regulation of centriolar satellites.</p><p>Subsection “PCM1 sequestration of Mib1 regulates Talpid3 abundance and ciliogenesis”: &quot;These studies established for the first time that Mib1, once released from PCM1, can relocate to centrioles and result in the ubiquitylation of Talpid3, promoting its down regulation.&quot; No evidence that Mib1 is acting at the centrioles; it could be acting in the cytoplasm.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: the BBS4 mapping is not convincing. This needs to be improved or removed.</p><p>Legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: &quot;We surmise that the Cep131 band in cells expressing fragment 1-800 is cross-reactive and reproducibly migrates with higher mobility than native Cep131.&quot; I have no idea what this means.</p><p>The reported aberrant localization of Mib1 and Cep131 to centrioles in PCM1 KO cells is not convincing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It looks like these proteins are at the centrioles in the controls. These need to be examined in nocodazole treated cells as was done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4. I</xref> agree that the 1-1200 fragment is displacing them from the centriole region, the foci no longer look like satellites so it is not clear what this means.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the failure to localize Cep90 to satellites could just be a consequence of its level in the cell. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows that it is strongly reduced in the absence of PCM1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The function of centriolar satellites, which form a dispersed halo around the centriole, has been the topic of extensive speculation but has not been analyzed rigorously. This manuscript presents a solid set of data that demonstrate the importance of the pericentriolar satellite protein PCM1 in formation of cilia in RPE1 cells. Previous knockdown experiments had shown a mild effect of PCM1 deletion on ciliogenesis. Here, the investigators make null mutant cells using CRISPR/Cas and document the complete absence of cilia in mutant cells.

In published papers reporting the Mib1 null mice, however, ciliogenesis was not studied. Indeed, the dominant phenotype in Mib1 knockout mice reflects defects in Notch signaling. It is not known whether MIB1-/- MEFs have a higher ciliation rate compared to wild-type cells, but since this has not been examined, it is not accurate to state that the knock-out study disagrees with our work. Apart from this fact, it is also well known that mutants often show compensation (and there is a second Mib gene, Mib2). This point is further driven home by the Rab8 knock-out data cited by Reviewer 2. These animals are indeed viable, as we point out in our revised manuscript, but they are viable most likely because there is compensation by other Rab family members. Thus, additional mouse models will be needed in the future to address the role of Mib1 (and, potentially, Mib2) in ciliation and development.</p><p>b) TALPID3 levels do not appear to be affected in RPE1 cells with altered MIB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The data in U2OS cells is better, but there are no cilia formation assays with these cells.</p><p>We believe that key data were overlooked here. First, we showed that ablation of the PCM1 gene led to a strong reduction in Talpid3 levels at centrioles, specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>), and this coincides with the relocation of Mib1 from centriolar satellites to centrioles. We also definitively show that over-expression of Mib1 results in a decrease in Talpid3 levels on centrioles in RPE1 cells, while knock-down of Mib1 could rescue Talpid3 levels on centrioles in PCM1-/- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C-F</xref>). However, the total, steady-state levels of Talpid3 were not affected in PCM1 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), strongly reinforcing our model that Mib1 regulation of Talpid3 occurs on centrioles. We have now performed additional experimentation in response to this critique by fusing Mib1 to the PACT domain, which targets proteins to centrosomes. These data, in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, definitively show that Talpid3 levels are indeed reduced at centrioles, strengthening our prior conclusions regarding Talpid3 regulation at centrosomes by Mib1.</p><p>Parenthetically, it is worth pointing out that U2OS cells do not ciliate, so ciliation could not be tested in these cells.</p><p>c) The alternative interpretation of the epistasis relationship between MIB1 and TALPID3 is that they are on independent pathways and that TALPID3 is required for cilia formation regardless of PCM1/MIB1 status.</p><p>Using standard epistasis-type experiments in mammalian cells, we provide several lines of evidence to demonstrate that PCM1, Mib1, and Talpid3 are in the same pathway during ciliogenesis: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) Ablation of PCM1 leads to the translocation of Mib1 from centriolar satellites to centrioles and decreased Talpid3 protein levels on centrioles; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) Mib1 interacts with Talpid3 and promotes poly-ubiquitylation of Talpid3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) over-expression of Mib1 results in defective ciliogenesis, whereas knock-down of Mib1 rescues the ciliation defect in PCM1-/- cells; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) over-expression of Mib1 (with or without an attached PACT domain directing the protein to centrosomes) results in decreased Talpid3 on centrioles, whereas knock-down of Mib1 rescues Talpid3 levels on centrioles in PCM1-/- cells. Therefore, the most straightforward interpretation is to place these proteins in a linear pathway, as we have done. Nevertheless, it is formally possible that an alternative pathway exists, and we have now revised our Discussion to incorporate this idea.</p><p><italic>d) A further complication is that your group reported that TALPID3 depletion causes defects in centriolar satellites (Kobayashi</italic> et al.<italic>, 2014, JCB 204:215-229). What is the status of MIB1 in the TALPID3 KO cells?</italic></p><p>Based on the totality of our data described above, Mib1 is an upstream regulator of Talpid3, and we do not expect Mib1 to be de-regulated in Talpid3 KO cells. However, to address this point, we have now examined Mib1 levels in Talpid3 KO cells. As anticipated from our prior work, PCM1 and centriolar satellites are more highly concentrated in the Talpid3 KO cells. In the Talpid3 KO cells, Mib1 localizes normally on the centriolar satellites without going to centrioles. Please see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> (Discussion section).

This study should be discussed in more detail.</italic></p><p>We make several references to this work. In addition, we have modified and vastly expanded the discussions in several sections to more fully discuss the results of this paper.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p> <italic>This paper examined the function of PCM1 by knocking it out in RPE1 cells. The paper has a lot of nice, convincing data but the paper is poorly written and over interpretation is rampant. No alternatives are considered for experiments and the possibility that additional proteins may participate in the phenotypes is not considered. Most of my concerns could be addressed with a careful rewrite of the manuscript. However, a major conclusion of the paper is that the loss of PCM1 allows Mib1 to relocate to the centrioles and destabilize a number of proteins thus preventing ciliogenesis. The support for this happening at the centriole is weak. For this conclusion to be made, the authors need to relocalize Mib1 to centrioles even when PCM1 is present and show that this has the same phenotype as loss of PCM1.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her constructive comments. The reviewer is concerned that we have not provided sufficiently strong support for the conclusion that loss of PCM1 causes Mib1 to relocate to centrioles, and he/she suggested that we perform an experiment in which we re-localize Mib1 to centrioles in cells with normal PCM1 levels. We have performed this experiment and now provide these data in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Specifically, we localized Mib1 to centrioles by expressing a PACT-Mib1 fusion protein in RPE1 cells, as this will constitutively target Mib1 to centrosomes, and examined Talpid3 levels on centrioles decorated with the PACT-Mib1 protein. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>, there was a significant diminution in Talpid3 levels on centrioles in these cells, whereas the catalytically inactive Mib1 C985S mutant showed slightly elevated Talpid3 levels. Furthermore, PACT-Mib1 expression also led to strong inhibition of ciliogenesis. These results are discussed in subsection “PCM1 sequestration of Mib1 regulates Talpid3 abundance and ciliogenesis” of the manuscript. PACT-Mib1 expression did not result in complete loss of Talpid3, most likely owing to limiting quantities of proteasomes within the centrosomal compartment.</p><p>We would like to emphasize that, apart from these new data, several other lines of evidence also support our conclusion. First, ablation of PCM1 leads to the translocation of Mib1 from centriolar satellites to centrioles and decreased Talpid3 protein levels on centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and 7 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, Mib1 interacts with Talpid3 and promotes poly-ubiquitylation of Talpid3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Third, over-expression of Mib1 results in defective ciliogenesis, whereas knock-down of Mib1 partially rescues the ciliation defect in PCM1-/- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Finally, over-expression of Mib1 (with or without an attached PACT domain) results in decreased Talpid3 on centrioles, whereas knock-down of Mib1 rescues Talpid3 levels on centrioles in PCM1-/- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, we believe that our data strongly support the conclusion that loss of PCM1 allows Mib1 to relocate to centrioles where it destabilizes Talpid3 and other proteins required for ciliogenesis.</p><p>&quot;These results lead to several important conclusions. First, PCM1 promotes ciliogenesis through interactions with a specific cohort of proteins, including Mib1, OFD1, Cep131, Cep72 and Cep290…&quot;. No evidence that is true.

This manuscript presents a solid set of data that demonstrate the importance of the pericentriolar satellite protein PCM1 in formation of cilia in RPE1 cells. Previous knockdown experiments had shown a mild effect of PCM1 deletion on ciliogenesis. Here, the investigators make null mutant cells using CRISPR/Cas and document the complete absence of cilia in mutant cells. They also show that PCM1 is required for the focal localization in satellites of all tested PCM proteins, demonstrating the central role of PCM1 in these structures. The investigators show that the phenotypes can be rescued by expression of full-length PCM1 and then use standard structure-function experiments to identify regions of PCM1 that are required to rescue the ciliogenesis defect and that bind to other satellite proteins. The authors then focus on Mib1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which was recently shown by another group to be enriched in centriolar satellites and suggested that Mib1 can suppress cilia formation. The authors show Mib1 and some other satellite proteins relocalize from satellites to centrioles in the PCM1 KO cells.

However, several pieces of evidence support our model.

It would be interesting to examine ciliation in Mib1-/- mice, but since this has not been examined, these earlier studies do not have a direct bearing on our work. Further, as mentioned by the reviewer, Rab8 knock-out animals are indeed viable, but the likely explanation is that there is compensation by another Rab family member, in particular, Rab10, suggesting functional redundancy of these proteins during ciliogenesis.
