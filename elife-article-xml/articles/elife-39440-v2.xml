Recent nanoscale resolution studies revealed that vesicle release is organized in multiple discreet release sites, which are distributed throughout the AZ and spatially coincide with the clusters of presynaptic docking factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). While the spatial organization and molecular architecture of release sites are beginning to emerge, the mechanisms that dynamically regulate the release site properties and reuse remain poorly understood.</p><p>Following a fusion event, refilling of a release site with a new vesicle is believed to represent a critical rate-limiting step in the release site reuse capacity thereby governing the ability of synapses to sustain release during repetitive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neher, 2010</xref>). How this process is organized and regulated at the AZ is largely unknown due to the difficulty of directly visualizing the refilling process at the AZ, whosedimensions are typically at or below the diffraction limited resolution of conventional microscopy.</p><p>Presynaptic terminals are rich in actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cingolani and Goda, 2008</xref>) and recent studies suggested that refilling of release sites in cerebellar synapses is actin-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). The major unanswered question is what role actin cytoskeleton and actin-based vesicle transport play in release site refilling: an active, structural, or both? An active, actin-dependent role occurs via molecular motors, for which only myosin V has been identified as a presynaptic vesicle-associated protein in central neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prekeris and Terrian, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watanabe et al., 2005</xref>). Major synaptic defects were observed in cortical neurons of myosin V dominant-negative mutant mice <italic>flailer</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoshii et al., 2013</xref>) and due to myosin V knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Correia et al., 2008</xref>). Myosin V null mice exhibit severe seizures and human mutations in myosin V gene cause severe nervous system dysfunction known as Griscelli syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hammer and Wagner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kneussel and Wagner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pastural et al., 1997</xref>). These findings point to a major role of myosin V in synaptic function; yet whether or how myosin V regulates neurotransmitter release remains largely unexplored. Single-vesicle tracking experiments showed that a majority of recycling vesicles undergo large-scale motion within synaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gramlich and Klyachko, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Westphal et al., 2008</xref>) including a substantial component of directed actin-dependent motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gramlich and Klyachko, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2012</xref>). Myosin V may thus regulate release by supporting vesicle transport to the release sites. In addition to being a processive motor, myosin V is also known to function as a tether and to interact with the SNARE proteins in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner to promote the SNARE complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krementsov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohyama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prekeris and Terrian, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watanabe et al., 2005</xref>), leading several studies to suggest a role for myosin V in vesicle docking and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desnos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eichler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Porat-Shliom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rudolf et al., 2011</xref>). Whether in central synapses myosin V plays a role in the vesicle transport to refill release sites, or at the later stages of the refilling process by tethering the vesicle to the release site machinery, or in the vesicle exocytosis itself is poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we sought to address these questions by employing a nanoscale detection of individual vesicle release events at the AZ in the hippocampal boutons, together with single-vesicle tracking to visualize release site refilling and reuse. Our results uncover a major role for myosin V in release site refilling, but not the exocytosis process itself. Surprisingly, rather than a unidirectional vesicle flow towards the release sites, we observed a dynamic vesicle shuttling between a plasma membrane pool and an inner pool, which is regulated by neuronal activity and requires myosin V as a vesicle tether rather than a transporting motor. These results, supported by ultrastructural analyses, suggest a major role for myosin V in regulating neurotransmitter release by controlling vesicle retention at the release sites rather than vesicle transport to the release sites or the exocytosis process itself.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inhibition of myosin V reduces release site re-use in hippocampal synapses</title><p>To understand the role of myosin V in presynaptic release mechanisms, we employed a nanoscale imaging modality to examine the effects of myosin V inhibition on spatiotemporal features of individual release events in hippocampal boutons. Our imaging approach takes advantage of a pH-sensitive indicator pHluorin targeted to the vesicle lumen via vGlut1 (vGlut1-pHluorin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balaji and Ryan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voglmaier et al., 2006</xref>) to permit detection of single vesicle release events with a 27 nm precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>). vGlut1-pHluorin was expressed in cultures of excitatory hippocampal neurons using a lentiviral infection at DIV3 and imaging was performed at DIV 16 – 19 at 37°C. Robust detection of individual release events evoked by 1 AP stimulation at 1 Hz was achieved within individual synapses at 40 ms/frame rate throughout the observation time period of 120 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Using this approach, we examined the effects of myosin V inhibition on vesicle release in basal conditions and during repetitive stimulation to distinguish two hypothesized functions of myosin V in synaptic transmission:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Myosin V may regulate refilling of the release sites with a new vesicle. In this case, myosin V inhibition would not strongly affect the basal release probability from a resting state when release sites are presumed to be largely occupied. In contrast, we expect to observe a significant effect of myosin V inhibition on vesicle release probability during repetitive activity. This effect should be more pronounced as stimulation frequency increases when demand for the new vesicles is higher.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Myosin V may function downstream of release site refilling, as a mediator of the exocytosis process itself. In this case, the requirement for myosin V should be apparent independently of the stimulation frequency. Thus, inhibition of myosin V is expected to reduce the vesicle release probability from a resting state as well as during repetitive activity, and the magnitude of the effect should be similar for a wide range of stimulus frequencies.</p></list-item></list><p>To discern these models, we first examined effect of myosin V inhibition on basal release probability, which we estimated based on a number of single release events evoked by 100 APs at 1 Hz. Inhibition of myosin V with either MyoVin-1 or PBP had no or only a small effect on basal release probability (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), arguing against the major role for

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>). In this analysis, for each stimulus pair, we identified a subset of boutons in which release events were detected for both stimuli in the pair; we then determined the probability that the two release events occur at the same release site. This protocol measures vesicle refilling of the release site on short timescales. We found that both myosin V inhibitors, MyoVin-1 or PBP, markedly reduced the reuse probability of release sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), while DMSO alone had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that this effect of myosin V inhibition dissipated with increase in time between release events, and was no longer apparent when release events were separated by more than ~5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These findings suggest that myosin V regulates rapid refilling of release sites. However, on longer timescales, once the release sites are refilled, the release process itself appears not to depend on myosin V.</p><p>The change in release site reuse probability could reflect the role of myosin V in refilling the sites with a new vesicle, but this effect could also arise if the number of release sites is altered by myosin V inhibition. We thus examined whether inhibition of myosin V affects the number and basic structural organization of release sites. The number of clusters/release sites in individual boutons was not affected by myosin V inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Ultrastructural analysis using a Large-Area Scanning Electron Microscopy (LaSEM) further indicated that the AZ size was also not altered by myosin V inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, we noted a small, but significant effect of myosin V inhibition on increasing the average distance from release events to the AZ center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). One possible interpretation of this result is that peripheral release sites are engaged more frequently when myosin V is inhibited (see below for additional analyses).</p><p>Thus far these results favor the first model that myosin V has an important role in the refilling of release sites rather than the exocytosis itself.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Myosin V controls release site refilling during high-frequency stimulation</title><p>If myosin V plays a role in refilling of the release sites, inhibition of myosin V should have a larger effect on release magnitude at higher stimulation frequencies when demand for vesicles is increased. To determine if this is the case, we measured the magnitude of release at individual boutons (as given by the total vGlut1-pHluorin signal) evoked by high-frequency trains. Both MyoVin-1 and PBP reduced the magnitude of synaptic release evoked by 20 stimuli at 50 Hz to half compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), while DMSO alone had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Inhibition of myosin V also slowed the kinetics of release to a similar degree (as evident by the change in the slope of the vGlut1-pHluorin signal increase during stimulation, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), which is consistent with slower refilling of the release sites when myosin V is inhibited. We further examined how release magnitude is affected in a wide range of stimulus frequencies from 0.1 Hz to 50 Hz. We found that inhibition of myosin V had a larger effect on the magnitude of release at higher stimulus frequencies while it did not have any measurable effect on release at a very low 0.1 Hz stimulation frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

We thus further examined this function of myosin V during high-frequency stimulation. Inhibition of myosin V significantly exacerbated the use of peripheral release sites during high frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) suggesting its role in controlling not only temporal but also the spatial distribution of release site reuse. One plausible explanation for the spatial effects of myosin V inhibition is its involvement in endocytosis independently of its role in refilling of release sites. If this is the case, inhibition of myosin V could cause an increase in the distance of peripheral release sites to the center because of an activity-dependent accumulation of vesicle components on the plasma membrane and an increase in the AZ size. Ultrastructural EM analysis showed no significant changes in the AZ size by myosin V inhibition both at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and during KCl-induced depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) arguing against major effects of myosin V inhibition on endocytosis. To confirm this observation, we further examined if inhibition of myosin V affects endocytosis in live and active synapses. The decay of vGlut1-pHluorin signal following a stimulus train is determined by endocytosis and subsequent vesicle reacidification. Changes in the decay of the vGlut1-pHluorin signal in our measurements can thus be interpreted to reflect predominantly changes in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atluri and Ryan, 2006</xref>). We found that inhibition of myosin V had no measurable effect on the decay of the vGlut1-pHluorin signal following 50 Hz trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-E</xref>). Moreover, if inhibition of myosin V blocks endocytosis, application of sequential stimulus trains would be expected to cause surface accumulation of VGlut1-pHluorin and a corresponding increase in the bouton fluorescence. We compared the amplitudes of VGlut1-pHluorin signal in five consecutive 50 Hz trains separated by 20 s each, and did not observe any measurable changes from one train to the next under control conditions or in the presence of myosin V inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F-H</xref>). Combined, these results indicate that the shift in spatial localization of release events upon myosin V inhibition is not caused by an increase in the AZ size and is unlikely to be mediated by altered endocytosis.</p><p>Together these observations support the first model in which myosin V plays a major role in regulating the refilling of the release sites rather than the exocytosis or endocytosis processes themselves. Our results further suggest a role for myosin V in regulating spatial distribution of release, with a shift towards more peripheral release sites when myosin V is inhibited.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Inhibition of myosin V causes a vesicle docking defect during sustained activity</title><p>If myosin V indeed plays a role in release site refilling, we predicted that inhibition of myosin V should reduce the number of docked vesicles at the AZ during sustained activity. We tested this idea using a scanning electron microscopy (LaSEM) of hippocampal cultures treated or not with MyoVin-1 for 20 min and stimulated via a KCl-induced depolarization for 10 min (with a 10 min delay after beginning of MyoVin-1 treatment), and fixed immediately thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

As a result, the fractional curves in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>) representing these two processes are visually different, although the actual rates are constant in both cases. Specifically, only vesicles that were detected at T = 0 were counted in disappearance analysis <italic>and</italic> only a single disappearance event was counted per bouton.

As a result of these initial conditions, the number of labeled vesicles that could disappear is maximal at T = 0 and is continuously drawn down with time leading to a visually apparent reduction in the disappearance rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This effect is caused by un-labeled vesicles replacing the labeled ones and also disappearing at the same rate but without being counted. This reduces the apparent disappearance rate, while the actual rate remains constant. In contrast, these limits on initial conditions do not affect the appearance rate because the number of labeled vesicles that can disappear is constantly replenished and appearance events are counted every time even if they appear multiple times in the same bouton.

These vesicle disappearance/appearance observations may thus be mechanistically explained by a model hypothesis of vesicle transitions between two distinct pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), one of which is in the focal plane, and the other one is outside of the focal plane. If the total number of vesicles exchanged between the two pools is constant in our model, the α-rate and δ-rate infer the fraction of total vesicles in each pool, then the 2 – 3 fold differences in the α- and δ-rates can be accounted for by assuming that the Pool II is 2 – 3 times larger than Pool I. Experiments below are designed to provide evidence to support this 2-pool model and will examine how vesicle mobility between (and retention at) these pools are regulated by activity and myosin V. We will then provide evidence that the smaller Pool I is a RRP-like membrane pool localized close to the source of calcium influx into the synapse, while the larger Pool II is farther away from the calcium influx and thus represents an inner pool.</p><p>While we hypothesize that vesicle disappearance can be explained by loss of detection due to large-scale displacement away from the focal plane within the synaptic bouton, vesicle disappearance can also be caused by either exocytosis or a vesicle leaving the synapse via axonal transport in a process known as an inter-synaptic vesicle exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gramlich and Klyachko, 2017</xref>). To distinguish these possibilities we quantified changes in the integrated intensity of the entire synapse in which vesicle disappearance occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The total synapse intensity arises predominantly from the intensity of the labeled vesicle and a nonspecific background; it is thus expected to undergo a stepwise decrease upon vesicle fusion and loss of the dye. We found that the integrated synapse intensity remained unchanged at the time point of vesicle disappearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>) for the vast majority of disappearing vesicles (~97%). Further, the few cases when integrated intensities did decrease matched the gradual intensity decrease profile observed for inter-synaptic vesicle exchange events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). These results suggest that the vast majority of disappearance events are not caused by exocytosis, but rather by loss of detection due to vesicle moving out of focus.</p><p>The shape of the vesicle image is represented by the point-spread function (PSF), which becomes increasingly broader as vesicle goes out of focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) eventually causing loss of detection when a preset threshold is reached. This notion is evident in the corresponding increase in the PSF σ (half-width) at the time points of vesicle disappearance and a decrease in the PSF σ at time points of subsequent vesicle reappearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). These changes were not caused by differential bleaching of vesicle signal vs background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>). We were also able to correlate the observed range of vesicle PSF σ values (~120 – 150 nm) with the range of detectable vesicle motion along the Z-axis of ~100 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>), suggesting that the two vesicle pools are at least 100 nm apart from each other. To further clarify the causes of vesicle disappearance we re-analyzed the trajectories of disappearing vesicles under less strict detection criteria by allowing detection of the more out of focus vesicles with broader images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). We found that with less stringent detection criteria, the vast majority of disappearing vesicles could be tracked beyond the initial disappearance point, supporting the notion that loss of tracking occurred due to vesicle motion out focus rather than fusion. Finally, we observed that the vesicle velocity and displacement both increased significantly in the last 2 s before disappearance, consistent with vesicle acceleration immediately prior to disappearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These results provide further evidence that vesicle disappearance was caused by loss of detection due to vesicle motion away from the focal plane rather than vesicle fusion.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39440.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Inhibtion of myosin V does not affect vesicle mobility before disappearance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spatial analysis of vesicle displacement based on the radius of a circle encompassing 95% of vesicle trajectory for the first 5 s (50 frames, black circle) and for the last 5 s (red circle) before disappearance.

Here we found that the rate of vesicle disappearance was reduced 2 – 3-fold during high-frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This activity-evoked change in the rate had a very fast onset (&lt;0.5 s) but persisted long after the end of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), consistent with the rapid rise of presynaptic calcium at the beginning of stimulus trains and a slow calcium clearance following the cessation of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>). Importantly, we observed that inhibition of myosin V with either Myo1 or PBP eliminated the effect of activity on vesicle disappearance during stimulation, without affecting the baseline disappearance rate before stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), while DMSO alone had no effect (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, the rate of subsequent vesicle appearance in the same set of boutons was not strongly affected by either high-frequency stimulation or myosin V inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These results suggest that myosin V mediates the activity-dependence of vesicle disappearance, but not vesicle re-appearance.</p><p>To better understand the vesicle disappearance, we used Monte Carlo simulations to model this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, and solid lines in 5B, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Vesicle disappearance rate was calculated using a computational model that simulates individual vesicle disappearances from a pool of vesicles (see cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and Appendix for model details). A single constant disappearance probability captures the baseline vesicle disappearance rate (P<sub>δ, baseline</sub>= 8.5×10<sup>−2</sup> fraction/sec). This result suggests that vesicles are randomly exchanged in and out of focus without preference for residence time (i.e. newly arrived vesicles are just as likely to leave as established vesicles). The model shows that the experimentally observed reduction in disappearance rate upon stimulation can be modeled with an instantaneous 3-fold reduction in disappearance probability (from P<sub>δ, base-line</sub> = 8.5×10<sup>−2</sup> fraction/sec, to P<sub>δ, stim</sub> = 3.0×10<sup>−2</sup> fraction/sec) and the effect of myosin V inhibition is captured by an increase in the disappearance probability during stimulation back to the baseline rate (P<sub>δ</sub>=8.5×10<sup>−2</sup> fraction/sec). These results support the above observations that the vesicle disappearance is rapidly modulated by activity and that this modulation is myosin V dependent.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Vesicle shuttling represents transitions between a membrane pool and an internal pool</title><p>How are vesicle disappearance and reappearance related to vesicle location inside the synaptic bouton and specifically the AZ? We hypothesized that the smaller Pool I, which is rapidly regulated by activity/calcium influx, is an RRP-like membrane vesicle pool localized close to the source of calcium influx into the synapse, while the larger Pool II represents an inner pool, further away from the calcium sources. The 2 – 3 fold difference in size between the Pools I and II in our model is also consistent with a smaller membrane-bound RRP and larger internal recycling pool described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denker and Rizzoli, 2010</xref>).</p><p>To test this model prediction and relate the location of the two pools to the source of calcium influx, we used a slow calcium chelator EGTA. EGTA is too slow to buffer rapid calcium rise in the close proximity to voltage-gated calcium channels at the plasma membrane, but is effective in buffering subsequent slow calcium elevation in the interior of the bouton due to diffusion. Indeed, it has been shown that EGTA does not affect vesicle release, but effectively blocks facilitation and augmentation, the two forms of short-term synaptic enhancement that dependent on residual calcium elevation during repetitive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng and Klyachko, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Regehr, 2011</xref>). We thus pre-incubated neurons with a cell-permeable EGTA-AM for 20 min. Calcium buffering with EGTA had no effect on the activity-dependent change in the disappearance rate during high-frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) suggesting that vesicle disappearance occurs from a pool located in a close proximity to the source of calcium influx, that is the AZ. In contrast, the appearance rate in the same set of boutons was significantly reduced by EGTA indicating efficiency of EGTA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These results suggest that in contrast to vesicle disappearance, the appearance represents transition from a pool located farther away from the source of calcium influx. We note that although we did not detect a measurable effect of activity on the appearance rate, it is possible that the calcium-dependence of this process is already close to saturation even in the basal conditions, but is unmasked by lowering the basal calcium levels by EGTA.</p><p>The finding that EGTA strongly affects only the vesicle appearance rate (and thus vesicles in Pool II) also provides a simple way to estimate the ratio of vesicles that start in each pool in beginning of our observations. Since disappearance is the only criteria for the vesicle inclusion in our initial analysis <italic>and</italic> due to the arbitrary relationship between the focal plane and the AZ at any given synapse, there is no <italic>a priori</italic> information that would allow us to make the initial assignment of the vesicles to Pool I or Pool II. Our measurements of the disappearance rate thus reflect a mixture of vesicles that are in Pool I and Pool II at the beginning of observation. To perform this analysis, we assumed that only the vesicle appearance rate is truly affected by EGTA (based on our observation that disappearance rate for EGTA and Ctrl during stimulation are the same), while the small effect of EGTA on the disappearance rate (vesicles in Pool I) is caused by contribution from Pool II vesicles. Within these assumptions, the model (Appendix) and EGTA results suggest that among all vesicles assumed to be in Pool I in the beginning of observations, 75 ± 11% actually start in Pool I, while 25 ± 11% are physically located in Pool II. This result is consistent with the Pool II being larger, and having a slower exit rate, because the probability that a given labeled single vesicle in our experiment will leave the Pool II is smaller than if it would be in Pool I and thus less likely to be included in our disappearance analysis.</p><p>Together these results support the model that vesicle shuttling occurs between the smaller membrane and larger internal pools, with vesicle transitions away from (but not towards) the plasma membrane pool being both activity- and myosin V dependent. In contrast with widely assumed model of unidirectional vesicle flow during recycling towards the AZ, our results suggest an ongoing vesicle shuttling and exchange between an inner pool and a membrane pool.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The role of myosin V in vesicle tethering at the membrane pool vs vesicle transport</title><p>Our results suggest that vesicle disappearance rate (translocation away from the membrane pool) is strongly reduced by activity in a manner that requires myosin V. Myosin V, a vesicle-associated protein, may function in this process as a vesicle-transporting motor and/or as a tethering/docking factor that retains vesicles in a membrane pool in an activity-dependent manner. To distinguish these possibilities, we examined whether inhibition of myosin V alters vesicle mobility immediately prior to disappearance.</p><p>First, we employed a spatial analysis of vesicle displacement we developed previously based on calculating the radius of a circle encompassing 95% of the vesicle track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2012</xref>). We compared the spatial extent of vesicle motion over the first 5 s of observations and the last 5 s before disappearance. Vesicle displacement increased significantly just before disappearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and the magnitude of the increase was similar in all conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Importantly, this increase in displacement was not affected by inhibition of myosin V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>We corroborated this result by examining changes in the instantaneous vesicle velocity during a 2 s period immediately before disappearance compared to the first 2 s of observation because analysis of instantaneous vesicle velocity permits higher time resolution than analysis of spatial displacement (which provides a more global assessment of vesicle mobility). Consistent with the above results, the vesicle velocity increased significantly just before disappearance under all conditions, and again this increase was not affected by inhibition of myosin V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that the activity-induced increase in vesicle mobility was not driven by myosin V.</p><p>Finally we examined the changes in vesicle angular displacement immediately prior to disappearance relative to the beginning of observation, which provides a measure of how directed the vesicle motion is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gramlich and Klyachko, 2017</xref>). The instantaneous angular displacement was the same under all conditions and was not affected by inhibition of myosin V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The combined total displacement, velocity, and angular displacement results suggest that vesicles that are initially tethered at the plasma membrane, become un-tethered and more mobile just before tracking is lost. Activity regulates this process by increasing the vesicle retention (by strengthening tethering) at the membrane pool in a myosin V dependent manner. These analyses further indicate that myosin V does not function in this process to drive vesicle transport away from the membrane pool. Thus the requirement for myosin V in activity-dependent vesicle retention strongly suggests the role for myosin V as a vesicle tether at the plasma membrane.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We took advantage of nanoscale detection of individual vesicle fusion events together with single-vesicle tracking during recycling to examine the mechanisms governing release site refilling in hippocampal synapses. Our results support three key observations: (i) Myosin V plays a major role in refilling of the release sites during repetitive stimulation, but not directly in vesicle release process. Myosin V also regulates spatial distribution of release by preferentially promoting release at more central release sites. (ii) Recycling vesicles undergo a continuous bi-directional shuttling between a membrane pool and an inner pool and the rate of vesicle ‘undocking’ but not ‘docking’ is regulated by neural activity (iii) myosin V functions as a tether that retains vesicles at the plasma membrane in an activity-dependent manner, rather than a motor driving vesicle transport to the release sites. These results uncover a complex dynamic mechanism that governs vesicle availability for release in central synapses.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Myosin V in release site refilling</title><p>As highly processive motors, class V myosins have been recognized to play multiple roles in synaptic development and function, particularly in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kneussel and Wagner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rudolf et al., 2011</xref>). Myosin Va supports neuronal mRNA transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoshimura et al., 2006</xref>), while myosin Vb mediates transport of recycling endosomes into dendritic spines and is required for induction of several key forms of long-term synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rudolf et al., 2011</xref>). Although presynaptic terminals are also rich in actin filaments, the role of actin-dependent transport and specifically myosin V in presynaptic processes remains debatable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kneussel and Wagner, 2013</xref>). Myosin Va is the only member of the myosin family identified as a synaptic vesicle associated protein and is known to directly interact with the SNARE machinery, including syntaxin 1A and synaptobrevin, in a calcium-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krementsov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohyama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prekeris and Terrian, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watanabe et al., 2005</xref>). Yet the role(s) of myosin V/Va in presynaptic processes remains controversial due to contradictory results from different knockout studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kneussel and Wagner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rudolf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schnell and Nicoll, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoshii et al., 2013</xref>). This discrepancy could arise from developmental or compensatory effects and from the difficulty of separating pre- and postsynaptic effects of myosin V inhibition in electrophysiological recordings of postsynaptic currents. We were able to bypass both of these complications using direct recordings of vesicle release and recycling in presynaptic boutons together with an acute approach to inhibit myosin V in developed neurons.</p><p>Myosin V has been implicated in the exocytosis of secretory granules in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eichler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Porat-Shliom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rudolf et al., 2011</xref>) and of large dense-core vesicles in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bittins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kögel et al., 2010</xref>). Here we found that in the case of synaptic vesicles, the process of exocytosis itself was not directly affected by myosin V inhibition in hippocampal synapses. In contrast, our results support a major presynaptic role for myosin V in the release site refilling process as a vesicle tether at the plasma membrane. This function of myosin V is supported by our EM results demonstrating a marked docking defect caused by inhibition of myosin V during sustained stimulation. This is in line with the published EM observations that the number of docked secretory granules in neuroendocrine cells is reduced by myosin V inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desnos et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, our finding of increased retention/tethering of vesicles at the membrane during high-frequency stimulation is consistent with the calcium-dependent interaction of myosin V with the SNARE machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krementsov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohyama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prekeris and Terrian, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watanabe et al., 2005</xref>). While elucidating the specific molecular interaction mediating this function of myosin V is beyond the scope of the current study, the submicromolar calcium-dependent binding of myosin V to syntaxin-1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watanabe et al., 2005</xref>) may serve as a mechanism by which vesicles are specifically targeted to the release sites at the plasma membrane.</p><p>We note that our results do not argue against a possible additional role of actin cytoskeleton and myosin motors in transporting vesicles during some of the earlier steps of the recycling process, prior to vesicle tethering/docking. Indeed, we and others described a directed actin-dependent component of vesicle motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kisiel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2012</xref>) and another member of the myosin family, myosin II, has been implicated in supporting multiple stages in the vesicle recycling, including vesicle translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chandrasekar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chandrasekar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayashida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kisiel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seabrooke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takagishi et al., 2005</xref>). Notably, myosin II does not possess a significant vesicle-transporting ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kneussel and Wagner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Porat-Shliom et al., 2013</xref>) and is likely to act indirectly by generating tension and promoting actin dynamics which is required for processive motion of other myosin isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Semenova et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, myosin V is a highly processive motor and we previously found that it supports vesicle transport in the axon during inter-synaptic vesicle exchange in central neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gramlich and Klyachko, 2017</xref>). Inhibition of myosin V also slightly, but significantly, reduced directionality of vesicle motion inside the synaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gramlich and Klyachko, 2017</xref>). Myosin V may thus play a dual role in vesicle recycling both as a tether at the release sites and as a transporting motor. Yet the specific stage(s) of the recycling process mediated by actin-dependent transport and myosin V or other members of the myosin family remains to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Myosin V in the differential engagement of central vs peripheral release sites</title><p>Our analyses of spatial distribution of release events within individual AZs suggest that central release sites are engaged more frequently under basal conditions and this preferential re-use is determined, in part, by myosin V. Moreover, we previously found that during high-frequency stimulation reuse of release sites shifts towards periphery, and here we observed that this shift is exacerbated by inhibition of myosin V. These results suggest that release sites have a spatial gradient of basal reuse probability from the center to periphery, and that the spatial shift in release site reuse is activity- and myosin V-dependent. Our analyses suggest that this spatial shift is unlikely to arise from myosin V involvement in endocytosis. The center vs periphery differences in release site reuse may arise, for example, if density of actin filaments is larger near the center of the AZ, which could increase the basal probability of vesicle tethering at the more central release sites. A shift of release towards periphery during stimulation could arise because central release sites, which are engaged first, would have a reduced availability during the progression of sustained high-frequency activity. It remains to be determined whether the spatial effect of myosin V inhibition is a reflection of myosin V’s function in vesicle tethering or relies on an independent mechanism. Notably, differential spatial distribution of functionally distinct modes of release has been observed for kiss-and-run (closer to the AZ center) vs full fusion events (more peripheral) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2012</xref>). While our tools do not currently permit distinguishing these modes of release, our findings of an activity-dependent shifts toward increased reuse of peripheral release sites is consistent with the shift from prevalent kiss-and-run to full fusion observed with increase in calcium elevation or increased stimulation frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richards, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Our results further predict that by spatially controlling release site reuse, myosin V may play a role in setting the balance between kiss-and-run and full fusion modes of release.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A myosin V- and activity-dependent reversible vesicle tethering in release site refilling</title><p>A widely held view of vesicle recycling in central synapses assumes a unidirectional flow of vesicles from the sites of endocytosis to the RRP directly or via another recycling/reserve pool(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rizzoli, 2014</xref>). Our results suggest an important revision to this view with a model of sustained bidirectional vesicle shuttling between a membrane pool and an inner pool. Within this model, vesicles that are tethered at the membrane pool by myosin V have a residential time on the order of twenty seconds in resting conditions and undergo repeated cycles of detaching and transitioning to the inner pool and back to the membrane. Our results further indicate that elevated activity shifts the equilibrium towards vesicle retention at the plasma membrane in a Myosin V-dependent manner by reducing the detachment rate 2 – 3 fold, presumably by strengthening myosinV/SNARE interactions. Although to the best of our knowledge this bi-directional shuttling process has not been described in central synapses, vesicle undocking has been reported in hippocampal synapses to occur at rates three times higher than the occurrence of spontaneous exocytosis (Murphy and Stevens, 1999). Taking the rate of spontaneous exocytosis of ~1 – 2 events per minute at 37°C under our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2012</xref>), this gives a rough estimate for the vesicle residence times at the plasma membrane of ~10 – 20 s, similar to our results. Our observations are also reminiscent of the vesicle docking/undocking observed in ribbon synapses, which had an escape rate of 1 in 4 s, comparable to our estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zenisek, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zenisek et al., 2000</xref>). Notably, much faster vesicle ‘approach and bounce’ events have also been observed in the Calyx of Held synapses using TIRF with a residence time of 88 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Midorikawa and Sakaba, 2015</xref>). Such rapid events, if present in our model system, would not be reliably detectable in our measurements because their duration is comparable to our time resolution. Interestingly, the same single-vesicle tracking measurements in the calyx of Held revealed a tethering step prior to vesicle docking with a time constant of 3 – 4 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Midorikawa and Sakaba, 2015</xref>) which is comparable to our estimates for the vesicle residence time at the membrane pool. Thus cycles of vesicle approaching, tethering and reversal might be a common feature in different classes of synapses. The two-pool shuttling observed here could also provide a mechanistic basis for the two-step actin-dependent model of RRP refilling, which was recently proposed for cerebellar synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miki et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The important limitation of the current study is in defining the functional identity of the two vesicle pools involved in vesicle shuttling/tethering. Our EGTA experiments provide evidence that the activity/myosin V-dependent pool is localized in the close proximity to the sources of calcium influx, that is the plasma membrane, but to what extent this pool represents the functionally defined RRP remains to be determined. Our estimate of the relative sizes of the two pools is also comparable to the differences between functional RRP and recycling pools defined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harata et al., 2001</xref>). Nevertheless, our single vesicle tracking measurements do not distinguish whether vesicles travel along or perpendicular to the AZ plane. The effect of EGTA could thus in principle be also explained by two vesicle pools both localized at the AZ, but at a systematically distinct distance to the source of calcium influx, that is calcium channels. However, this model is unlikely for two reasons: (i) a large proportion (~60%) of the calcium channels are mobile in the AZ plane with the median surface area explored by individual channel molecules of ~200 – 250 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>) comparable to dimensions of the entire AZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schikorski and Stevens, 1997</xref>); (ii) the large spatial domain of vesicle motion that we observed in our tracking experiments, which commonly spans several hundred nanometers over our observation period and includes epochs of fast diffusion and directed motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forte et al., 2017</xref>); such extensive vesicle mobility is difficult to reconcile with the motion restricted along the AZ given the very limited AZ dimensions and the vesicle crowding at the AZ which unlikely to allow fast diffusion or directed motion. Further studies are needed to define the precise spatial localization of these two pools and their correspondence to the RRP and recycling pool. Revealing spatial identity of these pools would require a 3D localization of the AZ with a fluorescence marker in each individual bouton and a simultaneous dual-color imaging of vesicle motion/tethering. Such measurements are currently difficult to perform because even a very small bleed through of the AZ signal to the vesicle channel increases the background noise and reduces localization accuracy. Furthermore, in the absence of a single labeling method that permits simultaneous monitoring of both vesicle motion and release, it is not currently feasible to unambiguously combine these two measurements for the same vesicle, and thus to directly link vesicle motion and tethering inside the synaptic boutons with the functional vesicle pool identity. Nevertheless, our findings provide the first step towards understanding of the mechanisms governing release site refilling and vesicle availability for release.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">MyoVin-1 (Myo-1)</td><td valign="top">EMD <break/>Millipore</td><td valign="top">Cat.

With this configuration the effective pixel size was 80 nm. Focal plane was continuously monitored, and focal drift was automatically adjusted with 10 nm accuracy by an automated feedback focus control system (Ludl Electronics). Field stimulation was performed by using a pair of platinum electrodes and controlled by the software via Master-9 stimulus generator (A.M.P.I.). Images were acquired using two frames with an acquisition time of 40 ms, one 45 ms before stimulation and one coincidently (0 ms delay) with stimulation.

The samples were then stained according the methods described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deerinck et al., 2010</xref>. In brief, coverslips were rinsed in cacodylate buffer 3 times for 10 min each, and subjected to a secondary fixation for one hour in 2% osmium tetroxide/1.5% potassium ferrocyanide in cacodylate buffer for one hour, rinsed in ultrapure water 3 times for 10 min each, and stained in an aqueous solution of 1% thiocarbohydrazide for one hour. After this, the coverslips were once again stained in aqueous 2% osmium tetroxide for one hour, rinsed in ultrapure water 3 times for 10 min each, and stained overnight in 1% uranyl acetate at 4 ˚C. The samples were then again washed in ultrapure water 3 times for 10 min each and en bloc stained for 30 min with 20 mM lead aspartate at 60 ˚C. After staining was complete, coverslips were briefly washed in ultrapure water, dehydrated in a graded acetone series (50%, 70%, 90%, 100% x2) for 10 min in each step, and infiltrated with microwave assistance (Pelco BioWave Pro, Redding, CA) into Durcupan resin. Samples were flat embedded in a polypropylene petri dish and cured in an oven at 60 ˚C for 48 hr. Post resin curing, the coverslips were exposed with a razor blade and etched off with concentrated hydrofluoric acid. Small pieces of the resin containing the cells was then cut out by saw and mounted onto blank resin stubs before 70 nm thick sections were cut in the cell culture growing plane and placed onto a silicon wafer chips. These chips were then adhered to SEM pins with carbon adhesive tabs and large areas (~330×330 µm) were then imaged at high resolution in a FE-SEM (Zeiss Merlin, Oberkochen, Germany) using the ATLAS (Fibics, Ottawa, Canada) scan engine to tile large regions of interest. High-resolution tiles were captured at 16,384 × 16,384 pixels at 5 nm/pixel with a 5 µs dwell time and line average of 2. The SEM was operated at 8 KeV and 900 pA using the solid-state backscatter detector.

Consequently, we were able to track disappearing vesicles longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>), and also track few vesicles that left their synapses and traveled to the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3-4"><title>Identification of vesicles that exited from synapse</title><p>We determined if vesicle detection was lost because vesicles exited the synapse to the axon using definitions and analysis we described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gramlich and Klyachko, 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). To quantify the change in integrated synapse intensity upon vesicle exit to the axon, we used tracks of the vesicles known to exit a synapse without loss of detection: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref> shows the intensities of 4 different synapses with apparent vesicle exit, aligned relative to vesicle exit, so that T = 0 is defined as the time a vesicle is &gt;600 nm from its position in the first frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gramlich and Klyachko, 2017</xref>). The intensity remains constant before exit followed by a 20–30% reduction after the vesicle exits the synapse. The rate at which the intensity drops depends upon the speed of the vesicle as it exits the synapse, with faster vesicles exhibiting a faster drop in intensity. Thus we used the average curve (black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) as the baseline to determine if loss of detection was due to vesicle exit from the synapse to the axon.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Alain Marty (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Here Maschi et al. examine how active zone release sites are replenished with new vesicles following exocytosis, specifically focusing on the role for myosin V in this process, using nano-scale imaging to track the behavior of single vesicles. They identify that vesicle replenishment is sensitive to myosin V inhibition and provide evidence that vesicle undocking from the plasma membrane – i.e. the rate of vesicle exit from the field of view – is suppressed by activity, which in turn, helps strengthen the tether in a myosin V-dependent manner. The study is timely and imaginative, and it reports a series of provocative new observations. Methods are appropriate, analysis and modeling are generally well done (except for some caveats below), and the writing is clear. Overall, the study should be of general interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, in its present form, the paper has two major issues.</p><p>Firstly, myosin V inhibitor is shown to have effects on the measurements of single release site exocytosis (Figure 1), activity-dependent vesicle recruitment to the release site (Figure 2), and single vesicle tracking inside the presynaptic terminal (Figure 3-4). The authors present the case that these effects are related to each other. However, there remains a possibility that such effects represent distinct actions of myosin V that are based on interactions with different molecular processes, similarly to a role for myosin V in inter-bouton trafficking of vesicles that have been previously reported by the Klyachko group. For example, the results in Figure 1-2 suggest a very local action of myosin whereas the results of Figure 3-4 suggest a longer range action. Secondly, the analysis of vesicular movement based on standard deviation, and the accompanying double pool model contains several weakness that require careful consideration. The specific points relating to the concerns are outlined below. The reviewers have agreed that these concerns are addressable, in principle, by additional experiments, re-analysis of data, and re-writing of the text over a two-month period.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 2: The two pool model involving tethered vesicles and vesicles remote from the docked pool (inner recycling pool or reserve pool) is not necessarily compatible with myosin V inhibitor-dependent spatial distribution of release site re-use (Figure 2D-F), and this point requires further clarifications. What is the relationship between myosin V-dependent tethering and the location of release sites with respect to VGCCs responsible for the calcium influx that drives exocytosis? An attractive interpretation of the results in Figure 2D-E would be that myosin V is involved in endocytosis. By inhibiting endocytosis, Myo1 would then enhance the size of the AZ in an activity dependent manner, thus increasing the distance of peripheral release sites to the center.</p><p>2) Figure 2A-C: A control should be added showing the (lack of?) effects of a previous stimulation in control conditions, without addition of Myo1.</p><p>3) Figure 2H-I: The control with Myo1 but no KCl is missing.</p><p>4) Figure 3 and 4: Orientation of the synapse with respect to the imaging plane. The analysis makes the implicit assumption that the AZ is orthogonal to the Z-axis. In Figure 1, the argument can be made that AZs displaying several release sites must be mainly orthogonal to the Z-axis, introducing a sample bias in favor of synapses displaying a horizontal orientation. With the protocol of Figure 3-4 no such argument can be made, so that a change in the Z-axis may represent a movement parallel to the AZ plane. This challenges the identification of pool I and pool II as representing two sets of SVs positioned at different distances of the AZ membrane.</p><p>In addition to the assumption of a horizontal orientation, the analysis implicitly assumes that the imaged SV is initially in pool I, near the AZ membrane. Since pool II is larger than pool I, it would seem more likely that it would be initially in pool II, away from the AZ membrane. One way out of this conundrum may be to assume an experimental bias towards pool I by selection of slowly moving vesicles.</p><p>5) Figure 3 and 4: Lack of calibration of σ changes. The main argument linking disappearance to z movement is that σ increases. However the extent of z movement associated with the observed change in σ remains unclear. In view of the results of Figure 2 the z movement is expected to take place in a range of 10s of nm, but since the size of the point spread function is on the order of 1 micron in the Z-axis, the z movements corresponding to the observed σ changes are likely to be larger, in a range of 100s of nm. This issue could perhaps be settled by measuring σ values as a function of z for a fluorescent bead of small size.</p><p>6) Figure 3 and 4: Interpretation of the σ change. The proposed change in z position is one possibility, but an alternative interpretation is that the SGC5 fluorescence bleaches more rapidly than the background fluorescence. To distinguish between these possibilities, it would be good to see whether σ returns near its initial value when the SV reenters pool I (e.g. in Figure 3C).</p><p>7) Figure 3: The data in Figure 3B suggest a continuous drift. By contrast, the scheme of Figure 3D suggests abrupt changes with probabilities linked to α and δ. A possible explanation for the drift could be a movement of the preparation with respect to the imaging plane. Yet another interpretation would be a diffusion process, without the intervention of distinct vesicular pools. This point needs to be clarified.</p><p>8) Figure 4: Regarding EGTA's effect on disappearance and appearance rates, in Figure 4B it seems like EGTA has a role in baseline disappearance rate (although it appears to be non-significant, the extent of reduction comparing +Ctrl and +EGTA in Figure 4B-Basal looks similar to the level of change shown in Figure 4D-Activity for the same groups, the significance seems to be a consequence of reduced dispersion in 4D compared to 4B). Would this mean that calcium regulates the stability/immobility of docked synaptic vesicles in basal conditions?</p><p>9) The plots showing spatial displacement of vesicles in Figure 4E are very straightforward and allow a fast understanding for the reader. The authors should include the same plot for inhibition of Myosin V (the data is only presented in Table 1), to emphasize the result and make the conclusion easier to understand.</p><p>10) Although not mentioned in the present study, the undocking of vesicles was previously characterized by Murthy and Stevens (Murthy and Stevens, 1999) in hippocampal synapses, who reported that undocking was three times more prevalent than the occurrence of spontaneous exocytosis, similarly to the present findings.</p><p>11) Figure 1: The method used to obtain the control data in the upper panel of Figure 1B should be explicitly stated. Likewise, the method used to generate the plot in Figure 1C should be explained.</p><p>12) Figure 2: Here the main issue is time. The reloading mechanism discussed in Figure 1 and Figure 2A-F operates on a time scale of a few seconds. In Figure 2H-I however, a prolonged KCl stimulation (10 min) is applied. Notably, this might be harsh for the cultured neurons, and the authors should state the concentration of KCl used. Furthermore, the time between the end of stimulation and fixation is not specified, and this time is presumably again on the order of minutes. One day the experiments of Figure 2H-I will need to be repeated with the better time resolution of the flash and freeze technique. This is not needed for this paper, but the protocols used for EM experiments should be more precisely outlined, and caution should be applied when discussing the links between EM and single vesicle exocytosis results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39440.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 2: The two pool model involving tethered vesicles and vesicles remote from the docked pool (inner recycling pool or reserve pool) is not necessarily compatible with myosin V inhibitor-dependent spatial distribution of release site re-use (Figure 2D-F), and this point requires further clarifications.

We performed a series of analyses to examine a possibility that Myosin V is involved in endocytosis:</p><p>1) We directly examined the reviewers’ suggestion what inhibition of myosin V could increase the size of the AZ in an activity-dependent manner thus increasing the distance of peripheral release sites to the center. Our scanning EM analysis showed that AZ size remained unchanged by myosin V inhibition both at baseline (Figure 1E) and during KCl-induced depolarization(Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). This result suggests that inhibition of myosin V does not cause activity-dependent changes in AZ size.</p><p>2) We examined if inhibition of myosin V affects dynamics of endocytosis in live and active synapses. The decay of vGlut1-pHluorin signal following a stimulus train is determined by endocytosis and subsequent vesicle reacidification. Changes in the decay of the vGlut1-pHluorin signal in our measurements can thus be interpreted to reflect predominantly changes in endocytosis (Atluri and Ryan, 2006). We found that inhibition of myosin V had no measurable effect on the decay of the vGlut1-pHluorin signal following 50Hz trains (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-E).</p><p>3) If inhibition of myosin V blocks endocytosis, application of sequential stimulus trains would be expected to cause surface accumulation of VGlut1-pHluorin and a corresponding increase in the bouton fluorescence. We compared the amplitudes of VGlut1-pHluorin signal in five consecutive 50Hz trains separated by 20sec each, and did not observe any measurable changes from one train to the next under control conditions or in the presence of myosin V inhibitors (Figure 2—figure supplement 1F, G, H). While an indirect evidence, this result supports the above findings that acute inhibition of myosin V does not significantly affect vesicle endocytosis under our experimental conditions.</p><p>Combined, these results indicate that the shift in spatial localization of release events upon myosin V inhibition is not caused by an increase in the AZ size and is unlikely to be mediated by altered endocytosis. These new findings are now presented in the second paragraph of the Results subsection “Myosin V controls release site refilling during high-frequency stimulation”.</p><p>We also note that the spatial shift in the location of release Events upon myosin V inhibition was observed not only during stimulus trains but also at low frequency stimulation (Figure 1F). Under these conditions, release is very infrequent and no changes in the size of the AZ are observed (Figure 1E). The observed shift in the distribution of release events upon myosin V inhibition could thus arise without changes in the physical localization of release sites. This effect could arise, for example, from a reduced release capacity of individual release sites we observed, leading to a more spatially distributed release. Indeed, we previously described a comparable phenomenon of reduced release site re-use capacity and a shift in the distance of release events towards AZ periphery during high-frequency stimulation, and this effect was observed without myosin V inhibition (Maschi and Klyachko, 2017). While we cannot exclude the possibility that the spatial and temporal effects of myosin V inhibition arise from distinct myosin V functions, the above considerations and the parallels with the effects of activity point to a common myosin V function as the simplest and the most logical interpretation of our findings. We have expanded the Discussion of the revised manuscript to include these considerations as follows:</p><p>“Our analyses suggest that this spatial shift is unlikely to arise from myosin V involvement in endocytosis. […] It remains to be determined whether the spatial effect of myosin V inhibition is a reflection of myosin V’s function in vesicle tethering or relies on an independent mechanism”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2A-C: A control should be added showing the (lack of?) effects of a previous stimulation in control conditions, without addition of Myo1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point and have performed the suggested analysis in two different and complementary ways:</p><p>1) We examined responses to 5 consecutive trains of 20 stimuli at 50Hz used in Figure 2A-B and calculated changes in synaptic responses from one train to the next. We found that the difference between subsequent responses in control conditions was negligible (~2%) (Figure 2—figure supplement 1F). Moreover, the change in response from one train to the next was also indistinguishable in control conditions vs. in the presence of myosin V inhibitors (Figure 2—figure supplement 1F).</p><p>2) For each of the 5 consecutive stimulus trains, we plotted the magnitude of changes in synaptic response in the presence of myosin V inhibitors relative to control, and did not observe any measurable differences from one train to another (Figure 2—figure supplement 1G, H).</p><p>Finally, we note that the magnitude of changes measured using only the first train was indistinguishable from that averaged across trains (Figure 2—figure supplement 1G, H).</p><p>Together these analyses provide strong evidence for lack of measurable effects of previous stimulation in our measurements.</p><p>We also realized that the measurements in Figure 2C were not described clearly. Measurements for each frequency were performed in a separate set of dishes and normalized to its own control. Therefore there is no effect of previous stimulation in these experiments carried from one frequency to another. The n values reported in the Table 1 represent the total number of dishes for all frequencies combined, since this entire dataset was used to perform the linear regression analysis shown in Figure 2C. We have clarified the description of this experiment in the Results and the Figure 2 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2H-I: The control with Myo1 but no KCl is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point and note that this control was actually performed (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B), but it was not described clearly. We have improved the description of this experiment in Results subsection “Inhibition of myosin V causes a vesicle docking defect during sustained activity”, to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3 and 4: Orientation of the synapse with respect to the imaging plane. The analysis makes the implicit assumption that the AZ is orthogonal to the Z-axis. In Figure 1, the argument can be made that AZs displaying several release sites must be mainly orthogonal to the Z-axis, introducing a sample bias in favor of synapses displaying a horizontal orientation. With the protocol of Figure 3-4 no such argument can be made, so that a change in the Z-axis may represent a movement parallel to the AZ plane. This challenges the identification of pool I and pool II as representing two sets of SVs positioned at different distances of the AZ membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this limitation of our model. Given the previous literature on calcium channel distribution and mobility within the AZ (Schneider et al., 2015), we believe the simplest model that accounts for our observations is two pools at different distances from the AZ, for the following reasons:</p><p>1) The different exchange rates between the two pools suggest that they are different in size and dynamics.</p><p>2) Observation that disappearance and appearance rates are differentially affected by EGTA suggest that the two pools are at different distances from the AZ’s calcium channels.</p><p>3) Differential activity-dependence of the exchange rates between the two pools supports the notion that these pools have a different distance to the source of calcium influx, the AZ.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that our vesicle tracking measurements do not distinguish whether vesicles travel along or perpendicular to the AZ plane. The effect of EGTA could thus in principle be also explained by two vesicle pools both localized at the AZ, but at a systematically distinct distance to the source of calcium influx, i.e. calcium channels. However, this model is unlikely for two reasons: (i) a large proportion (~60%) of the calcium channels are mobile in the AZ plane with the median surface area explored by individual channel molecules of ~200-250 nm (Schneider et al., 2015) comparable to dimensions of the entire AZ (Schikorski and Stevens, 1997); (ii) the large spatial domain of vesicle motion that we observed in our tracking experiments, which commonly spans several hundred nanometers over our observation period and includes epochs of fast diffusion and directed motion (Forte et al., 2017); such extensive vesicle mobility is difficult to reconcile with the motion restricted along the AZ given the very limited AZ dimensions and the vesicle crowding at the AZ which unlikely to allow fast diffusion or directed motion.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ point we now discuss this limitation of our model and these considerations in the last paragraph of the Discussion subsection “A myosin V- and activity-dependent reversible vesicle tethering in release site refilling”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to the assumption of a horizontal orientation, the analysis implicitly assumes that the imaged SV is initially in pool I, near the AZ membrane. Since pool II is larger than pool I, it would seem more likely that it would be initially in pool II, away from the AZ membrane. One way out of this conundrum may be to assume an experimental bias towards pool I by selection of slowly moving vesicles.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point and agree. Because disappearance is the only criteria for the vesicle inclusion in our initial analysis and due to the arbitrary relationship between the focal plane and the AZ at any given synapse, there is no a priori information that would allow us to make the initial assignment of the vesicles to Pool I or Pool II. As a result, our measurements of the disappearance rate reflect a mixture of vesicles that are initially in Pool I and Pool II at the beginning of observation. We considered the reviewers’ suggestion to assume bias towards Pool I by selection of slowly moving vesicles to address this issue. However, we found that it was not possible to group vesicles based on their speeds in any systematic manner because vesicle speeds are highly variable during the observation time due to multiple intertwining epochs of diffusion, directed motion and pausing with speeds of different epochs varying several fold along the individual vesicle trajectories (Forte et al., 2017).</p><p>However, our finding that EGTA strongly affects only the vesicle appearance rate (and thus vesicles in Pool II) together with the finding that EGTA also has a small effect on the baseline disappearance rate (which we interpreted within our model as a contribution from vesicles in Pool II) provides a simple way to estimate the ratio of vesicles that start in each pool in beginning of our observations. To perform this analysis, we assumed that only the vesicle appearance rate is truly affected by EGTA (based on our observation that disappearance rate for EGTA and Ctrl during stimulation are the same), while the small effect of EGTA on the baseline disappearance rate (vesicles in Pool I) is caused by contribution from Pool II vesicles. Within these assumptions, the model (Appendix) and EGTA results suggest that among all vesicles assumed to be in Pool I in the beginning of observations, 75 ± 11% actually start in Pool I, while 25 ± 11% are physically located in Pool II. This result is consistent with the Pool II being larger, and having a slower exit rate, because the probability that a given labeled single vesicle in our experiment will leave the Pool II is smaller than if it would be in Pool I and thus less likely to be included in our disappearance analysis. These considerations support our model by demonstrating that the majority of the disappearing vesicles are initially located in Pool I. We have added these considerations to the third paragraph of the Results subsection “Vesicle shuttling represents transitions between a membrane pool and an internal pool”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 3 and 4: Lack of calibration of σ changes. The main argument linking disappearance to z movement is that σ increases. However the extent of z movement associated with the observed change in σ remains unclear. In view of the results of Figure 2 the z movement is expected to take place in a range of 10s of nm, but since the size of the point spread function is on the order of 1 micron in the Z-axis, the z movements corresponding to the observed σ changes are likely to be larger, in a range of 100s of nm. This issue could perhaps be settled by measuring σ values as a function of z for a fluorescent bead of small size.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting the σ calibration experiments and have performed these measurements (Figure 4—figure supplement 1G). This calibration allows us to correlate the observed range of vesicle σ values (~120-150 nm) with the range of detectable vesicle motion along the Z-axis of about 100 nm (Figure 4—figure supplement 1G). However, we also note that this concern likely arose from lack of clarity in our description of the results in Figure 2, rather than a problem with the results themselves. The reviewers referred to the results in Figure 2 to estimate relevant distances for the expected vesicle Z-movements between the two pools. However, these measurements in Figure 2 represent changes in the vesicle distance to the AZ upon myosin V inhibition, but do not represent distances in vesicle localization in Pools I and II under normal conditions. Therefore our data in Figure 2 does not provide any estimates for how far apart the pools are expected to be. We also note that only the σ changes in XY plane are used as one of the detection criteria, with the typical σ value of ~120nm. Most importantly, the actual numerical changes in σ values are not used in any of the analyses in the manuscript. We have clarified these points in the fifth paragraph of the Results subsection “Tracking individual synaptic vesicles during recycling supports a model of continuous 238 vesicle shuttling between two vesicle pool”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3 and 4: Interpretation of the σ change. The proposed change in z position is one possibility, but an alternative interpretation is that the SGC5 fluorescence bleaches more rapidly than the background fluorescence. To distinguish between these possibilities, it would be good to see whether σ returns near its initial value when the SV reenters pool I (e.g. in Figure 3C).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point and have performed both of the suggested analyses.</p><p>First, we performed the analysis of bleaching and showed that the σ changes were not caused by differential bleaching of vesicle signal vs. background (Figure 4—figure supplement 1I).</p><p>Second, we compared the σ changes just before vesicle disappearance and right after reappearance (Figure 4—figure supplement 1H). σ values increased just before disappearance, and then decreased just after re-appearance.</p><p>Together these results support our interpretation that vesicle going out of focus due to changes in zposition is the predominant cause of vesicle disappearance/loss of detection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 3: The data in Figure 3B suggest a continuous drift. By contrast, the scheme of Figure 3D suggests abrupt changes with probabilities linked to α and δ. A possible explanation for the drift could be a movement of the preparation with respect to the imaging plane. Yet another interpretation would be a diffusion process, without the intervention of distinct vesicular pools. This point needs to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ point and we believe it is based on a misnomer we used in the figure description: Y-axis in the original Figure 3B was labeled ∆X, but this represents the localization error of the vesicle position (which can increase with vesicle moving away from the focal plane) and not the actual position itself and therefore does not show drift. We performed extensive controls for the drift in our imaging system and found that the drift of the preparation in our measurements is extremely small (6-8nm) (Maschi and Klyachko, 2017; Forte et al., 2017) and is below the localization uncertainty (~15-20nm). We apologize for the confusion in the labeling of original Figure 3B and have re-labeled the figure axis (the new Figure 4B and 4E) as “localization error” to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 4: Regarding EGTA's effect on disappearance and appearance rates, in Figure 4B it seems like EGTA has a role in baseline disappearance rate (although it appears to be non-significant, the extent of reduction comparing +Ctrl and +EGTA in Figure 4B-Basal looks similar to the level of change shown in Figure 4D-Activity for the same groups, the significance seems to be a consequence of reduced dispersion in 4D compared to 4B). Would this mean that calcium regulates the stability/immobility of docked synaptic vesicles in basal conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ point. Our measurements of the disappearance rate reflect a mixture of vesicles that are in Pool I and Pool II at the beginning of observation. Because EGTA only strongly affects the appearance rate (and thus vesicles in Pool II), we interpreted the effect of EGTA on baseline disappearance rate to reflect a mixture of vesicles that are in Pool I and Pool II at the beginning of observation. We estimated the ratio of vesicles that start in each pool (as we described in response to point 4 above), assuming that only the vesicle appearance rate is truly affected by EGTA (based on our observation that disappearance rate for EGTA and Ctrl during stimulation are the same), while the small effect of EGTA on the disappearance rate (vesicles in Pool I) is caused by contribution from Pool II vesicles. Within these assumptions, our results suggest that among all vesicles assumed to be in Pool I in the beginning of observations, 75 ± 11% actually start in Pool I, while 25 ± 11% are physically located in Pool II. As we pointed out in our response to the concern #4 above, this result is consistent with the Pool II being larger, and having a slower exit rate, because the probability that a given labeled single vesicle in our experiment will leave the Pool II is smaller than if it would be in Pool I and thus less likely to be included in our disappearance analysis. We have added these considerations to the third paragraph of the Results subsection “Vesicle shuttling represents transitions between a membrane pool and an internal pool” and Appendix.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The plots showing spatial displacement of vesicles in Figure 4E are very straightforward and allow a fast understanding for the reader. The authors should include the same plot for inhibition of Myosin V (the data is only presented in Table 1), to emphasize the result and make the conclusion easier to understand.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and have included the same plot for inhibition of myosin V accordingly (Figure 6B, C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Although not mentioned in the present study, the undocking of vesicles was previously characterized by Murthy and Stevens (Murthy and Stevens, 1999) in hippocampal synapses, who reported that undocking was three times more prevalent than the occurrence of spontaneous exocytosis, similarly to the present findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this oversight to our attention.

Likewise, the method used to generate the plot in Figure 1C should be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and have expanded the description of the methods in the Results and in the Materials and methods subsections “Whole synapse intensity quantification” and “Release site re-use probability analysis” accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 2: Here the main issue is time. The reloading mechanism discussed in Figure 1 and Figure 2A-F operates on a time scale of a few seconds. In Figure 2H-I however, a prolonged KCl stimulation (10 min) is applied. Notably, this might be harsh for the cultured neurons, and the authors should state the concentration of KCl used. Furthermore, the time between the end of stimulation and fixation is not specified, and this time is presumably again on the order of minutes. One day the experiments of Figure 2H-I will need to be repeated with the better time resolution of the flash and freeze technique. This is not needed for this paper, but the protocols used for EM experiments should be more precisely outlined, and caution should be applied when discussing the links between EM and single vesicle exocytosis results.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ point and have expanded and clarify the protocols for the EM experiments and stated the concentration of KCl (55 mM). We also clarified that the fixation was performed immediately following KCl application with only a few second delay. Finally, we avoided making strong conclusions based on the links between the EM and single-vesicle imaging data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
