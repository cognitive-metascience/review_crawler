homeostasis. If stress resolution fails, the UPR commits the cell to apoptotic death. Here we show that in hematopoietic cells, including multiple myeloma (MM), lymphoma, and leukemia cell lines, ER stress leads to caspase-mediated cleavage of the key UPR sensor IRE1 within its cytoplasmic linker region, generating a stable IRE1 fragment comprising the ER-lumenal domain and transmembrane segment (LDTM). This cleavage uncouples the stress-sensing and signaling domains of IRE1, attenuating its activation upon ER perturbation. Surprisingly, LDTM exerts negative feedback over apoptotic signaling by inhibiting recruitment of the key proapoptotic protein BAX to mitochondria. Furthermore, ectopic LDTM expression enhances xenograft growth of MM tumors in mice. These results uncover an unexpected mechanism of cross-regulation between the apoptotic caspase machinery and the UPR, which has biologically significant consequences for cell survival under ER stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>BAX</kwd><kwd>XBP1</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>hematopoietic</kwd><kwd>myeloma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors declare that there was no funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical and biological studies reveal that caspases feed back onto the Unfolded Protein Response by cleaving the ER-stress sensor IRE1 to produce a cytoprotective N-terminal fragment that inhibits BAX-dependent apoptosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) mediates three-dimensional folding of newly synthesized proteins that are destined for membrane insertion or extracellular secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hetz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang and Kaufman, 2016</xref>). Excess demand for protein assembly in the ER causes accumulation of unfolded proteins – a condition known as ER stress. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an intracellular sensing-signaling network that detects ER stress and orchestrates ER adaptation to reestablish cellular homeostasis. The UPR drives physical and biochemical expansion of the ER, while temporarily abating protein-translational load, and promoting disposal of unfolded proteins through ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In metazoan cells the UPR consists of three ER-transmembrane proteins: inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), protein kinase R-like kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hetz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang and Kaufman, 2016</xref>). These proteins directly or indirectly detect ER stress via their ER-lumenal and transmembrane domains; in response, they transduce signals to the cytosol and nucleus to promote cellular adaptation. The ER chaperone BiP/GRP78 plays an important role in keeping UPR activation in check (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin-Wetzel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karagöz et al., 2017</xref>). IRE1 possesses tandem cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase and endoribonuclease (RNase) enzymatic modules, tethered to the ER membrane through an 80-amino-acid linker region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Upon sensing ER stress, IRE1 forms homodimers, which perform trans-autophosphorylation of the kinase moiety, leading to RNase engagement. The RNase activates the transcription factor spliced X-box protein 1 (XBP1s) through non-conventional mRNA editing. In turn, XBP1s activates numerous genes that promote ER adaptation, ERAD, and cytoprotection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta-Alvear et al., 2007</xref>). The RNase module also helps reduce ER-associated translational load through regulated IRE1-dependent mRNA decay (RIDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hollien et al., 2009</xref>), which also can contribute to cytoprotection by regulating specific, functionally relevant genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae et al., 2019</xref>). IRE1α (sometimes called ERN1) is the most evolutionarily conserved of the UPR sensors, displaying structural and functional homology in yeast, flies, worms, fish and primates. PERK harbors a similar lumenal domain and a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase module, but lacks an RNase moiety. In response to ER stress, PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic translation-initiation factor α (eIF2α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). This suppresses general translation, yet induces expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). In turn, ATF4 stimulates a number of genes that support ER adaptation, including one encoding the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). The main function of the eukaryotic UPR is to adapt the ER to dynamic changes in demand for protein folding. However, the metazoan UPR performs an important additional function: it triggers apoptotic cell elimination in the event that ER-stress mitigation fails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>). Teleologically, this mechanism probably evolved to limit the threat to the whole organism posed by potentially rogue cells with a severely damaged ER.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47084.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ER stress induces caspase-mediated cleavage of IRE1 in the cytoplasmic linker region.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the human IRE1 protein and comparison of the amino acid sequences surrounding the predicted caspase cleavage sites in the linker region of IRE1 from different species (zFish, zebrafish; Dros, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>).

The core intracellular apoptotic machinery entails a family of cysteine-dependent, aspartate-specific proteases, called caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thornberry and Lazebnik, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Salvesen and Ashkenazi, 2011</xref>). Two interconnected signaling cascades control caspase activation in response to severe cellular stress or damage: the intrinsic (or mitochondrial) pathway and the extrinsic (or death-receptor) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin and Green, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004</xref>). These signals often converge on the proapoptotic BCL2 family protein BAX (and/or its relative BAK), which mediates mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) through oligomerization and pore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Youle and Strasser, 2008</xref>). This releases cytochrome C from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol. In the cytosol, cytochrome C helps nucleate the apoptosome complex, which sets off an enzymatic cascade involving the initiator protease caspase-9 and the executioner proteases caspase-3 and caspase-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Slee et al., 1999</xref>). It is believed that these caspases bring about the cell’s apoptotic demise through ‘death by a thousand cuts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin and Green, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Taylor et al., 2008</xref>). The PERK branch of the UPR plays a key role in driving apoptosis in the context of irresolvable ER stress, through mechanisms that involve ATF4 and CHOP and converge on BAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Puthalakath et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Han et al., 2013</xref>). An additional proapoptotic signal involves the ER-resident BCL2 family protein BOK, which is kept at low levels by ERAD but accumulates when ERAD is diverted toward unfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Llambi et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to PERK, physiological levels of IRE1 suppress apoptosis activation, by mediating degradation of DR5 mRNA via RIDD during the early phase of the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). If ER stress persists, PERK-dependent attenuation of IRE1 via the phosphatase RPAP2 inhibits RIDD, allowing DR5 levels to rise and thereby driving apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While the UPR exerts tight regulation over apoptotic cell commitment in the face of ER stress, it remains poorly studied whether the caspase machinery exerts reverse controls over the UPR. In mouse liver cells, BAX and BAK support activation of IRE1 by direct interaction with its cytoplasmic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hetz et al., 2006</xref>). Conversely, the ER-resident antiapoptotic protein BAX inhibitor-1 inhibits IRE1 activation through cytoplasmic association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lisbona et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, there is preliminary evidence that caspases may cleave PERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shimbo et al., 2012</xref>) and IRE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tang et al., 2018</xref>); however, this has not been further investigated at the molecular and cellular levels. In the present study, we uncover a novel, unexpected mechanism of cross-regulation between apoptotic caspases and the UPR, which regulates cell survival during ER stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ER stress promotes caspase-mediated cleavage of IRE1</title><p>Human IRE1α (herein IRE1) is a 977 amino-acid protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), composed of an N-terminal ER-lumenal domain (LD), a single-pass transmembrane (TM) domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (CD). The CD segment consists of three parts: a membrane-proximal ‘linker’ region, followed by a serine/threonine kinase domain, and an endoribonuclease (RNase) moiety. In exploring the biochemical fate of the IRE1 protein during ER stress, we obtained western blot (WB) evidence suggesting that full-length IRE1 undergoes proteolytic processing in cell lines derived from cancer patients with a B cell malignancy called multiple myeloma (MM) (see below). To follow up on these initial findings, we immunized mice with a purified recombinant human IRE1 LD protein and isolated a mouse IgG2a monoclonal antibody that selectively recognizes a specific epitope within the LD (anti-IRE1α LD). We then used this antibody, alongside a commercially available rabbit polyclonal antibody that specifically detects IRE1’s RNase domain (anti-IRE1α CD), to further characterize the apparent processing of IRE1. We first interrogated two MM cell lines, KMS11 and OPM2, in which ER stress can be induced with classical pharmacological agents, i.e., thapsigargin (Tg), tunicamycin (Tm), brefeldin A (BfeA), and dithiothreitol (DTT), or the pathophysiological bacterial toxin subtilase AB5 (SubAB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paton et al., 2006</xref>). WB analysis with the anti-IRE1 LD antibody revealed not only the presence of the full-length ~105 kDa IRE1 protein, but also the emergence under ER stress of an additional ~55 kDa band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), indicating the formation of an N-terminal, LD-containing IRE1 fragment. Parallel analysis with the anti-IRE1α CD antibody also revealed the full-length IRE1 protein, as well as the formation in response to ER stress of one or more additional bands of ~50 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), indicating the production of one or more C-terminal, CD-containing fragments. Some variation in gel mobility of the IRE1 species occurred; although further investigation is needed, this size variation may be due to differences in N-linked glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2002</xref>) or other post-translational modifications of IRE1 under different ER stress conditions.</p><p>Unmitigated ER perturbation can lead to caspase-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>). We therefore reasoned that caspase activation might underlie the apparent proteolytic cleavage of IRE1 during ER stress. Treatment of KMS11 or OPM2 cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD blocked generation of both the LD- and CD-containing IRE1 fragments upon ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), indicating that this cleavage of IRE1 requires caspase activity. We first attempted to identify the processing site(s) by N-terminal sequencing through mass spectrometry, using either purified recombinant IRE1 proteins of various lengths or immunoprecipitated endogenous IRE1 polypeptide from ER-stressed cells; however, this approach proved unsuccessful (data not shown). Instead, we turned to the CaspDB database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://caspdb.sanfordburnham.org/">http://caspdb.sanfordburnham.org/</ext-link>) to examine the IRE1 polypeptide sequence for potential caspase recognition sites. Although a number of sites were predicted, in light of the estimated molecular mass of the observed fragments and the sequence conservation of IRE1 between diverse species, we postulated that a major cleavage site(s) resides within the linker region, after aspartic acid 507 (0.879 probability), or aspartic acid 512 (0.921 probability), or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To test this prediction, we replaced these two aspartic acids—either individually or simultaneously—with alanine residues by site-directed mutagenesis. We then transfected each mutant or a wild type (WT) IRE1 control construct into KMS11 cells harboring CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout of endogenous IRE1 and tested for caspase-mediated cleavage. Although alanine substitution of either aspartic acid 507 or 512 alone did not prevent IRE1 processing in response to ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), replacement of both residues blocked most of the cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Some residual bands were detectable by the anti-IRE1α LD antibody even with the double mutation, suggesting that cleavage can shift to alternative, less efficient sites. A band of ~85 kDa was further detected by the anti-IRE1α CD but not the anti-IRE1α LD antibody, independent of mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting the existence of another cleavage site that disrupts the LD epitope. However, given its location in the ER lumen, this site is unlikely to be targeted by caspases, which reside mainly in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Salvesen and Ashkenazi, 2011</xref>). An additional band that ran beyond the 49 kDa marker could be detected by the anti-IRE1α CD antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-E</xref>). However, this band was absent in cells expressing the double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that it may be a secondary product of cleavage at 507 and 512. Regardless, although different caspase-susceptible sites within IRE1 may be cleaved under diverse stress conditions, our data maps two prominent, adjacent cleavage sites to aspartic acids 507 and 512, within the cytoplasmic linker region of IRE1. We therefore focused our investigation on further elucidating this event and its cellular consequences.</p><p>Executioner caspase activation in response to ER stress often involves the proapoptotic protein BAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Puthalakath et al., 2007</xref>). To verify whether the processing of IRE1 under ER stress requires BAX, we disrupted the BAX gene in KMS11 cells via CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We obtained two independent BAX knockout clones, which produced no BAX protein as expected; in contrast to the WT cells, these clones showed substantially less generation of cleaved (activated) caspase-3 and lacked any detectable IRE1 fragments in response to several ER stressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Thus, caspases operating downstream to BAX in the apoptotic signaling cascade induced by ER stress in KMS11 cells mediate the proteolytic processing of IRE1. Consistent with this conclusion, purified caspase-3 and caspase-7 performed concentration-dependent cleavage of a purified recombinant protein comprising the linker, kinase and RNase domains of IRE1 (IRE1 LKR), with slightly more efficient processing by caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To verify that the cleavage of IRE1 was not a peculiarity of KMS11 and OPM2 cells, we expanded our analysis to other cell types. We observed a similar pattern of caspase-mediated IRE1 processing in additional MM cell lines, as well as in several different types of lymphoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). In contrast, a number of non-hematopoietic cancer cell lines examined, including NCI-H441 (non-small cell lung carcinoma), JHH-1 (hepatocellular carcinoma), and A2058 (melanoma), did not display appreciable IRE1 cleavage upon ER stress (data not shown).</p><p>Aspartic acids 507 and 512 are conserved between human, mouse, rat and fruit-fly IRE1, while position 512 is occupied by glutamic acid in zebrafish IRE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with the homology between the human and mouse orthologs, ER stress induced caspase-mediated cleavage of mouse IRE1 in two types of murine lymphoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and F</xref>). Similar processing occurred also in mouse primary bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC), which already exhibited some IRE1 cleavage at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Thus, the results obtained so far suggest that ER-stress-induced caspase-mediated IRE1 processing occurs more readily in hematopoietic cells, including both malignant and non-malignant types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The major fragments of IRE1 differ in their cellular disposition</title><p>The presence of prevalent caspase cleavage sites in the cytoplasmic linker region of IRE1 suggested that their hydrolysis splits the protein into an N-terminal fragment that contains both the LD and TM segments (LDTM) and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain fragment(s) containing the kinase and RNase moieties (CD). Subcellular fractionation of OPM2 cells confirmed that the LDTM polypeptide was associated primarily with the membrane compartment, whereas the CD products were found mostly in the cytosolic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To investigate the cellular persistence of these products, we tracked their levels in cells undergoing Tg-induced ER stress over an 8 hr period. We performed these studies in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit further biosynthesis of IRE1 precursor. In both OPM2 and KMS11 cells, the LDTM fragment increased in abundance over 8 hr after Tg addition, while the CD fragment accumulated over the first 4 hr and then declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Remarkably, the amount of full-length IRE1 protein substantially decreased over this period of ER stress, while caspase inhibition by zVAD blocked the drop, preserving most of the initial full-length IRE1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).

OPM2 cells showed detectable XBP1s protein at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), perhaps due to immunoglobulin overproduction by this malignant plasma cell line.

Therefore, we turned to investigate whether LDTM performs some specific cellular function. To examine this, we introduced (via stable transfection) a cDNA plasmid construct encoding a Flag-epitope-tagged LDTM protein, driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter, into the KMS11 cell line. (Because this experiment was performed before we identified the precise cleavage sites, we first used a construct encoding amino acids 1–470, which ends within the linker region upstream to the 507 and 512 positions.) Whereas the parental cells displayed bands that matched the endogenous full-length IRE1 and its Tg-induced LDTM product, the transfected cells showed an additional band corresponding to the (shorter) ectopic LDTM protein, independent of ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Surprisingly, ectopic LDTM expression improved viability and diminished caspase-3/7 activation in KMS11 cells as compared to untransfected counterparts under Tg-induced ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), indicating apoptosis attenuation. Removal of the C-terminal Flag tag from the cDNA construct did not alter LDTM’s ability to attenuate caspase-3/7 activation in response to Tg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, similar to the pooled transfected KMS11 cells, single-cell-derived clones overexpressing LDTM also displayed diminished caspase-3/7 activation as compared to parental cells upon ER stress induction by Tg or SubAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To test an LDTM construct that more faithfully reflects the precise caspase cleavage site, we generated a cDNA plasmid encoding amino acids 1–507. Reassuringly, expression of this LDTM version also reduced caspase-3/7 activation in response to diverse ER stressors, including SubAB, Tg, Tm, and BfeA, in KMS11 or JJN3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D, F and G</xref>). These results demonstrate that LDTM inhibits apoptotic caspase activation upon ER stress. By extension, caspase-mediated cleavage of IRE1 during ER stress produces a membrane-tethered, lumenal product of IRE1 that in turn feeds back onto the apoptotic signaling cascade to inhibit further caspase activation. Consistent with this localization, immunofluorescence analysis showed co-staining of the transfected LDTM fragment with the ER membrane marker Calnexin in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47084.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Ectopic expression of IRE1 LDTM attenuates apoptotic caspase activation independent of full-length IRE1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) KMS11 parental cells or cells stably expressing a cDNA plasmid encoding LDTM (1-470) driven by the CMV promoter were treated with DMSO or 100 nM Tg for 24 hr.

To test this, we engineered KMS11 cells expressing an inducible shRNA construct that targets the 3’ UTR of the IRE1 mRNA. We subsequently transfected these cells with a plasmid encoding Flag-tagged LDTM cDNA designed to resist the IRE1 shRNA. As expected, the parental cells (which harbor the shRNA but not the LDTM construct) expressed autologous full-length IRE1 and generated a corresponding LDTM product upon treatment with Tg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, these parental cells showed complete depletion of the full-length IRE1 protein upon treatment with Doxycycline (DOX) to induce the shRNA, which blocked Tg-induced production of the endogenous LDTM fragment. As further expected, LDTM-transfected cells expressed the ectopic LDTM protein across all conditions. These cells similarly displayed complete depletion of the endogenous full-length IRE1 and its LDTM product upon DOX treatment. Importantly, cells expressing ectopic LDTM showed improved viability and diminished caspase-3/7 activation under Tg- or Tm-induced ER stress, regardless of DOX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). This data demonstrates that apoptosis attenuation by LDTM is equally effective in the presence or absence of endogenous IRE1. Thus, LDTM suppresses apoptotic caspase activation independently of full-length IRE1.</p><p>The UPR governs not only cellular adaptation but also apoptosis activation in response to protein misfolding. Accordingly, a conceivable mechanism that might mediate LDTM’s antiapoptotic activity is that it binds to unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, in a manner similar to full-length IRE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>), and sequesters them away from activating the ER-resident UPR sensors, thereby abating apoptotic signaling. However, consistent with its IRE1-independent function, ectopic LDTM expression did not alter IRE1 activity in response to ER stress, as measured by the levels of XBP1s mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and by mRNA levels of the known RIDD target, DGAT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast to LDTM, ectopic expression of the CD fragment of IRE1 (LKR) did not affect caspase-3/7 activation by Tg or SubAB, nor did it impact LDTM’s attenuation of caspase activation by these ER stressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Of note, LKR expression did not alter XBP1s levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Regardless, this data indicates that the LDTM product acts independently of the CD fragment to curb apoptosis signaling. Furthermore, LDTM expression did not inhibit ATF6 activation by ER stress, as gauged by levels of the key UPR chaperone BiP—a transcriptional target of ATF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>); nor did it decrease PERK activation, as judged by the levels of the PERK-regulated transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP, both of which are implicated in driving apoptosis downstream to PERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Han et al., 2013</xref>). LDTM also provided cell protection against SubAB—which induces ER stress by proteolytically cleaving BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paton et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>).

LDTM-transfected KMS11 clones displayed approximately 1.5-fold higher baseline levels of BAX as compared to parental controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), perhaps reflecting a compensatory upregulation of BAX in response to the cytoprotection provided by LDTM. Nevertheless, ectopic LDTM expression attenuated the relative increase in mitochondrial BAX and the coordinated decrease in cytosolic BAX upon ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with its ability to decrease mitochondrial recruitment of BAX, LDTM expression also inhibited mitochondrial depolarization in cells undergoing ER stress in response to SubAB or Tg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, LDTM attenuated the uptake of calcium by mitochondria – a characteristic apoptotic event which was similarly curtailed by BAX KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). LDTM also attenuated the Tg-induced drop in mitochondrial cytochrome C levels and the corresponding gain in cytosolic cytochrome C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Moreover, LDTM attenuated Tg-induced activation of caspase-9, known to be triggered in the cytosol through cytochrome C-induced assembly of the apoptosome, as well as the activation of caspase-3/7 downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that LDTM attenuates apoptotic caspase activation at the level of, or upstream to, BAX recruitment to mitochondria, thereby blocking the consequent steps of the apoptotic cascade; i.e., MOMP, mitochondrial calcium uptake, release of cytochrome C into the cytosol, and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3/7.

Furthermore, it generates a fragment containing the lumenal domain and transmembrane segment (LDTM), which in turn suppresses further apoptotic signaling by attenuating BAX translocation to mitochondria (3) in a manner that can be reversed by the BCL2 inhibitor ABT-199.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47084-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig5s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47084.011</object-id><label>Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>LDTM augments MM tumor progression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Parental KMS11 cells or clone 13 (C13) cells expressing ectopic LDTM (1-470) were injected subcutaneously into CB-17 SCID mice (Parental n = 9, LDTM C13 n = 10) and tumor growth was monitored over 21 days.

The metazoan UPR has acquired an additional role, which may be equally as important: to eliminate cells that have sustained irreparable ER stress and as such pose a threat to the whole organism. The UPR performs this latter function by engaging the cell’s apoptotic caspase machinery. However, this requires tight control, so that cells do not commit prematurely to an irreversible apoptotic fate. We know from earlier work that PERK acts through ATF4 and CHOP to drive apoptosis in response to excessive ER stress, that is, through Bim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Puthalakath et al., 2007</xref>), DR5, and/or DR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iurlaro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dufour et al., 2017</xref>), triggering apoptotic signals that converge on BAX. BOK further drives apoptosis when ERAD is diverted toward other ER client proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Llambi et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to PERK, IRE1 opposes apoptotic signaling during the initial phase of the UPR by suppressing DR5 mRNA levels through RIDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). If stress persists, PERK activity attenuates IRE1 by driving its dephosphorylation through the RPAP2 phosphatase, thereby releasing the brake on DR5 to promote apoptosis during the terminal UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2018</xref>). These mechanisms exemplify stringent UPR control over apoptosis activation. However, whether the cell’s apoptotic caspase machinery feeds back onto the UPR to affect ultimate cell fate has been unclear.</p><p>Our present studies uncover a novel mechanism of reciprocal cross-regulation between the UPR and the apoptotic caspase cascade during ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We show that caspase activation in response to diverse ER-stress stimuli leads to proteolytic processing of IRE1. Caspases operating downstream to BAX cleave IRE1 at two adjacent sites within the cytoplasmic linker region, thus dividing the protein into two major products. Given that activated apoptotic caspases often overlap in selectivity toward intracellular substrates, we did not attempt in this study to identify which specific BAX-driven caspases are involved in the cellular cleavage of IRE1. Nevertheless, both caspase-3 and caspase-7 were capable of cleaving a purified recombinant IRE1 LKR protein. In cells, the N-terminal product of IRE1, consisting of the ER-lumenal domain, transmembrane segment, and some residual linker sequence (LDTM), remains membrane-anchored and persists for at least 8 hr after ER stress exertion. In contrast, the C-terminal product(s), which contains most of the cytoplasmic region, displays a more transient nature. By uncoupling the sensing and signaling domains of IRE1, caspase-mediated processing within the linker dampens activity of this key UPR sensor in response to ER stress.</p><p>Because the N-terminal fragment appeared more stable, we chose to focus on exploring its potential function. We found unexpectedly that upon overexpression, this product of IRE1 mediates significant negative feedback onto the apoptotic signaling cascade. In contrast, the more labile C-terminal fragment did not affect key apoptotic indicators, nor did it functionally influence the N-terminal fragment. LDTM consistently restricted caspase activation in the face of ER stress. Furthermore, it acted without requiring full-length IRE1 or altering the engagement of PERK and ATF6, and it abated apoptosis even in response to SubAB, which causes ER stress by cleaving the central ER chaperone BiP. Together, these results indicate that LDTM operates independently of the UPR to inhibit further caspase activation. Additional mechanistic studies demonstrated that LDTM inhibits the recruitment of BAX from cytosol to mitochondria, thereby attenuating a number of critical mitochondrial and cytosolic events required for cell commitment to apoptosis. Precisely how LDTM suppresses BAX recruitment at the molecular level remains an open question. We have begun to explore this through proteomics approaches, seeking to identify specific LDTM interaction partners that might mediate its regulatory effect on the apoptotic cascade. The analysis so far has excluded the possibility that LDTM directly interacts with BAX (data not shown), in contrast to the earlier reported interaction of full-length IRE1 (via its cytoplasmic region) with BAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hetz et al., 2006</xref>). Of note, the BCL2 inhibitor ABT-199 overcame the cytoprotective effect of LDTM, thus reinforcing the importance of BAX regulation by caspase-dependent IRE1 cleavage.</p><p>The processing of IRE1 by caspases during ER stress seems paradoxically to have two opposite outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>): on the one hand it enhances apoptotic signaling by disrupting IRE1’s activity, which is cytoprotective, while on the other hand it attenuates further caspase activation by restricting BAX translocation to mitochondria. A simple and plausible explanation for this apparent paradox is that the generation of LDTM through IRE1 cleavage provides a fail-safe checkpoint to ensure that cells with still remediable ER stress do not commit unnecessarily to apoptotic suicide. Only if ER stress exceeds a cell’s capacity for mitigation does sufficient caspase activity develop to override this checkpoint and fully execute apoptotic elimination.</p><p>The cytoplasmic location of the prominent cleavage sites within IRE1 is consistent with the fact that caspase activity resides primarily in the cytosol. Furthermore, the linker region of IRE1 may be more accessible to caspases than other, perhaps more buried, cytoplasmic domains. This could explain why caspase recognition sites within the linker are favored over four additional theoretical consensus sites found within the kinase and RNase domains of human IRE1. Of interest, earlier work characterizing ectopically expressed IRE1 in COS7 cells showed that presenilin-1 cleaves IRE1 within the linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Niwa et al., 1999</xref>), which suggests that this region of IRE1 can be targeted also by other types of proteases. IRE1 processing by apoptotic caspases occurred primarily in hematopoietic cell types, of both malignant and non-malignant origin. Because hematopoietic cells tend to express relatively high levels of IRE1 mRNA, it is possible that caspase-mediated processing requires abundant IRE1 protein: however, this warrants further investigation. Remarkably, in the absence of de novo IRE1 biosynthesis, most of the available cellular pool of IRE1 protein was subject to caspase-dependent cleavage in response to ER stress. This suggests that substantial amounts of LDTM can be generated within the cell, with significant consequences. Indeed, our biological studies showed that LDTM overexpression enhances restricted MM cell growth in vitro, as well as tumor progression in vivo. Thus, the production of LDTM upon caspase-mediated cleavage of IRE1 can significantly improve the fitness of cancer cells to survive and grow in stressful microenvironments. This conclusion has important potential implications for the role of IRE1 in hematopoietic malignancies such as MM, because it suggests that IRE1 promotes tumor growth not only in its general role as a cytoprotective UPR mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harnoss et al., 2019</xref>) but also in particular through its caspase-driven antiapoptotic LDTM product. Our studies open the door to further investigating caspase-mediated processing of IRE1 and other UPR sensors in response to proteotoxic as well as other types of cell stress in settings of health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

For tumor growth studies, 10 × 10<sup>6</sup> KMS11 IRE1 sh8-9, LDTM pool, LDTM C13, 1–507 C5, BAX Knockout Clone 1 or Clone 2, respectively, were suspended in HBSS, admixed with 50% Matrigel (Corning) to a final volume of 100 μl, and injected subcutaneously in the right flank of 6 to 7 week old female CB-17 SCID mice. Tumor size and body weight were measured twice per week. Subcutaneous tumor volumes were measured in two dimensions (length and width) using Ultra Cal-IV calipers (model 54–10 − 111; Fred V. Fowler Co.). The tumor volume was calculated with the following formula: tumor size (mm<sup>3</sup>) = (longer measurement × shorter measurement<sup>2</sup>) × 0.5. For IRE1 knockdown studies, tumors were monitored until they reached a mean tumor volume of approximately 150 mm<sup>3</sup>, and then to induce knockdown of IRE1α randomized into the following treatment groups: (i) 5% sucrose water (provided in drinking water, changed weekly), or (ii) doxycycline (0.5 mg/ml, dissolved in 5% sucrose water, changed 3x/week). When mice reached endpoint criteria (see below) or after a 21 day treatment cycle, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and subcutaneous xenografts harvested for immunoblot analysis.</p><p>Animals in all studies were humanely euthanized according to the following criteria: clinical signs of persistent distress or pain, significant body-weight loss (&gt;20%), tumor size exceeding 2500 mm<sup>3</sup>, or when tumors ulcerated. Maximum tumor size permitted by the IACUC is 3000 mm<sup>3</sup> and in none of the experiments was this limit exceeded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Graphs depict the mean ± SEM or SD of triplicates.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Caspase-mediated cleavage of IRE1 controls apoptotic cell commitment during endoplasmic reticulum stress&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers find that the paper describes a very interesting study of the mechanism of how IRE1 negatively regulates apoptosis during UPR stress. The authors follow up the recent discoveries on the mechanisms by which cells die in response to persistent ER stress. The work presents a novel and exciting finding by which caspase-driven processing of the ER stress sensor IRE1 leads to production of two proteolytic fragments, one of which is shorter-lived and pro-apoptotic and the other of which is longer-lived and – surprisingly – anti-apoptotic. Overexpression of the pro-survival fragment protects stressed cells from death, both normal and tumor cells. The effect seems to be limited to cells of hematopoietic origin for reasons that are unclear. Most of the data are of excellent quality and the findings greatly increase our knowledge of the mechanisms for the decision of living versus dying in cells encountering ER stress. This manuscript is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> provided the issues are addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The actual caspase required for IRE1 cleavage has not been identified. Even though the authors used z-VAD as a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, it may have significant off-target effects. Thus, it is essential that the authors provide direct evidence that IRE1 is cleaved by caspases.

Even though the authors used z-VAD as a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, it may have significant off-target effects. Thus, it is essential that the authors provide direct evidence that IRE1 is cleaved by caspases.

The involvement of caspases in IRE1 cleavage is also corroborated by the effect of BAX knockout, which prevented both caspase activation and IRE1 cleavage (Figure 1G). We attempted to disrupt caspase-3 and -7 by RNAi but were unsuccessful due to poor knockdown efficiency. Nevertheless, to examine more directly whether caspases can cleave IRE1, we generated a purified, recombinant IRE1 protein comprising the linker, kinase and RNase domains (LKR). Incubation of this protein with commercially available purified caspase-3 or -7 revealed its direct cleavage by these proteases (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). This demonstrates a direct capacity of executioner caspases to cleave IRE1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Provide mechanism on how LTDM may inhibit BAX from localizing to mitochondria.

Instead, we now provide data showing that LDTM inhibits calcium uptake by mitochondria similar to BAX knockout (new Figure 4C). We further show that the BCL2 small molecule inhibitor ABT-199 overrides the effects of LDTM on mitochondrial calcium uptake and caspase-3/7 activation (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1E and 1F), confirming that the antiapoptotic function is exerted over BAX.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Both fragments of IRE1 should be expressed in cells to see if the LTDM exerts its effect even in the presence of the pro-apoptotic fragment.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, it appears there is a misunderstanding that the cytoplasmic fragment is pro-apoptotic--we did not propose this in the original manuscript. Regardless, we now performed the suggested experiment, which showed that ectopic expression of the cytoplasmic LKR fragment by itself did not alter caspase activation under ER stress; nor did this fragment affect the anti-apoptotic activity of the lumenal fragment upon co-transfection (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Compare the effects of BAX-inactivation on KMS11 tumor growth with that of LTDM.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed an additional in vivo study to examine the effect of BAX inactivation and observed that BAX knockout and ectopic LDTM expression in KMS11 cells similarly augment in vivo tumor growth (new Figure 5C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, please tone down on claims of LTDM as most of it is from over expression studies and the physiological relevance is yet to be established.</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that the identification of LDTM as a stable product of caspase-mediated IRE1 cleavage is based primarily on the detection of <underline>endogenous</underline> IRE1 and its cleavage products. Furthermore, the endogenous IRE1 fragment accumulates during ER stress while full-length IRE1 isstabilized by caspase inhibition. Nevertheless, to acknowledge the limitation that the reviewer alluded to we added the term “overexpression” to the Discussion text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
