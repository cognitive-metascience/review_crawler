This allows the bacteria to hide from external stresses. A single bacterium can replicate itself and develop into a biofilm, and over time the bacterial cells in specific regions of the biofilm will start to interact with their neighbors in different ways. These interactions occur via structures on the surface of the bacterial cells, and the differences in these interactions resemble those that occur as cells specialize during the development of animal embryos. Previous research into embryonic development has shown how differences in the physical interactions between embryonic cells are essential for sorting the cells into their correct locations and shaping the embryo. However, little is known about which processes govern the development of biofilms.</p><p>Now, Oldewurtel et al. have asked whether differences in the physical interactions between bacteria trigger cell sorting during the early stages of biofilm development. The experiments involved measuring the force required to break the cell–cell connections (called the ‘rupture force’) in biofilms of a bacterium called <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>. Oldewurtel et al. found that, in agreement with previous predictions, physical interactions were important for sorting bacterial cells into clusters based on the structures on their surfaces. Bacterial cells actively pull on the surface structures of their neighbors, which allows the cells to sort themselves in a tug-of-war fashion. This means that a cell will move in the direction where it can pull the strongest (i.e., in the direction where the rupture force is highest).</p><p>While bacteria and embryos use different molecules to generate these pulling forces, these findings indicate that the basic physical principles are similar in both systems. One of the next challenges will be to evaluate how biofilms might benefit from the structures that develop due to cell sorting.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10811.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10811.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cellular interaction forces</kwd><kwd>cell sorting</kwd><kwd>type IV pili</kwd><kwd>molecular force</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kouzel</surname><given-names>Nadzeya</given-names></name><name><surname>Henseler</surname><given-names>Katja</given-names></name><name><surname>Maier</surname><given-names>Berenike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MA3898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kouzel</surname><given-names>Nadzeya</given-names></name><name><surname>Dewenter</surname><given-names>Lena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Differential physical interactions between bacteria in mixed microcolonies trigger cell sorting.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Physical interactions and in particular mechanical forces are involved in sorting of different cell types. These requirements have been established in the field of embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al., 2012</xref>). Cells must divide, change shape, adhere to each other, migrate, disperse, or cluster. To complete these processes, they modulate their physical properties including rigidity, position, motility, and strength of adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fagotto, 2014</xref>). The development of bacterial biofilms resembles eukaryotic development in various aspects including genetic programs that are controlled by master regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Monds and O'Toole, 2009</xref>). However, it is unclear to which extent physical forces are involved in determining the architecture of biofilms.</p><p>An early approach for understanding cell sorting on the basis of physical interactions was the differential adhesion hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Steinberg, 1963</xref>). This hypothesis states that a population of cells will sort into spatially separated subpopulations, if the strength of cell–cell adhesion differs between cell types. The biophysical explanation for this sorting is the tendency of cell clusters to minimize their surface, similar to the minimization of surface tension in liquids. Depending on the strength of cohesion between cells of the same kind and the strength of adhesion between different kinds of cells, the model predicts perfect mixing, encasement, partial segregation, and full segregation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Steinberg, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Graner and Glazier, 1992</xref>). Some of these morphotypes have been observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Steinberg and Takeichi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foty and Steinberg, 2004</xref>). Recent experiments indicate that equilibrium descriptions are not sufficient for describing the process of cell sorting during development; they provide evidence that active force generation by cells is involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Landsberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kashef and Franz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mao and Baum, 2015</xref>). In particular, the differential interfacial tension hypothesis introduces cortical contractility in addition to adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brodland and Chen, 2000</xref>). Interestingly, Harris proposed another hypothesis, the differential strength of adhesion hypothesis (DSAH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harris, 1976</xref>). He envisions a tug-of-war of cells actively moving along each other by retractions of cellular extensions pulling the cell body into the direction of the strongest and least breakable bonds. Cells with lower bond strength would be squeezed outward to the peripheral layer.</p><p>Sorting of cells also occurs during bacterial biofilm development. Cell–cell interactions and biofilm architecture are often governed by cell appendages with polymeric organization. One of the most ubiquitous appendages is the type IV pilus (T4P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry and Pelicic, 2015</xref>). It mediates surface attachment, surface motility, and its retraction can generate high mechanical force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maier and Wong, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maier, 2013</xref>). The T4P is a helical polymer consisting mainly of the major subunit PilE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Craig et al., 2004</xref>). The major subunit can be post-translationally modified by O-linked glycosylation or by phosphoform-modifications. Cell sorting based on T4P has been observed in different experimental setups. <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> can express a T4P-like system and generate toxin co-regulated pili. Cells lacking the major pilin of the toxin co-regulated pilus did not integrate into wt microcolonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirn et al., 2000</xref>). Mutations in the major pilin subunits induced different pilus morphology and affected the size of pilus bundles. However, cell sorting based on these mutations was not reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirn et al., 2000</xref>). Differential fluorescence labeling of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> showed that cells with T4P-dependent motility form a cap on top of non-motile stalks formed by cells that lacked the gene for the major pilin subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klausen et al., 2003</xref>). Swarming of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is generated by a single flagellum, but moderated by polar T4P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anyan et al., 2014</xref>). When T4P production was suppressed, swarming motility increased considerably, most likely due to reduced cellular clustering mediated by pili. When piliated and non-piliated cells were co-cultured, non-piliated cells dominated the swarm edge. <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> upregulates expression of a phosphotransferase that is required for phospho-form modification of the major pilin upon attachment to endothelial host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chamot-Rooke et al., 2011</xref>). Simulations of pilus bundling suggest post-translational modifications affecting the physical interactions between T4P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chamot-Rooke et al., 2011</xref>). All of these studies imply that T4P can generate a rich diversity of sorting phenomena. However, in contrast to embryonic development, the biophysical basis underlying cell sorting in bacterial biofilms remains elusive.</p><p>Here, we test the hypothesis that the physical interactions between bacteria govern the morphology of mixed bacterial cell clusters. The T4P of <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (gonococcus) was used as a model system for systematic variation of cell–cell interactions. We genetically engineered strains with different densities of pili and their abilities to generate force. Moreover, the breakage-force between pili of different cells could be fine-tuned by replacing a gene responsible for pilin post-translational modification. We found that on agar plates, where the dynamics are mostly determined by steric interactions caused by cell division, cells with the lowest pilus density and cells with the lowest pilus-breakage force sorted towards the colony boundary. Sorting was prominent at the front of expanding colonies but within the bulk of the colony sorting was incomplete. In liquid environment where cells actively move by pilus retractions, sorting correlating with pilus density and pilus-breakage force was nearly complete and the resulting morphotypes followed the DSAH. Active pilus retraction was essential for cell sorting, suggesting that the cells sort by a tug-of-war between cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The T4P as a tool for controlling bacterial cell–cell interactions</title><p><italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> and their type IV pili served as a model system for addressing the hypothesis that mechanical interactions control sorting and morphology of mixed clusters (aka microcolonies). Gonococci are peritrichously piliated, that is, they generate pili at random locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holz et al., 2010</xref>). Because T4P are necessary for microcolony formation, variation in the breakage force between pili directly affects cell–cell interactions. There is preliminary evidence that gonococcal microcolonies show surface tension-like behavior. Microcolonies formed by gonococci with retractile pili are spherical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Higashi et al., 2009</xref>). Upon fusion, two microcolonies rapidly form a sphere with larger radius as expected for liquid drops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dewenter et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, the retraction of T4P generates mechanical force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maier et al., 2002</xref>). Multiple pili can coordinate through a tug-of-war mechanism leading to surface motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marathe et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, cell movement inside clusters is conceivable. These properties could support cell sorting as proposed by the DSAH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harris, 1976</xref>).</p><p>To test the hypothesis of segregation of cells depending on receptor–ligand pair densities, we engineered gonococcal strains with different pilus densities. To start with, we generated a gonococcal strain that had the gene for the major pilin subunit, <italic>pilE</italic>, replaced by <italic>gfpmut3</italic> and <italic>kan</italic> (<italic>pilE::gfpmut3 kan</italic>), henceforth called <italic>P− green</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This strain did not form clusters nor did it interact with piliated bacteria. Thus, within our detection limit, the <italic>P− green</italic> bacteria show no interactions. Next, we used a strain with three copies of the <italic>pilE</italic> gene, <italic>P++</italic> (<italic>igA1::pilE pilE ermC</italic>). This strain contains two copies of the <italic>pilE</italic> gene in addition to the native copy, increasing the pilus density compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holz et al., 2010</xref>). Since the pilins are unaltered, the rupture forces between individual pili are expected to be equal to the wt forces. However, since the density of pili is higher, the total attractive force between two bacteria is higher.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10811.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Strains used in this study</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10811.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10811.003</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Strain</th><th>Relevant genotype</th><th>Source/Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>VD300</td><td><italic>wild type, opa- selected</italic></td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Ng105 <italic>P+ green</italic></td><td><italic>igA1::P</italic><sub><italic>pilE</italic></sub> <italic>gfpmut3 ermC</italic></td><td>This study</td></tr><tr><td>Ng106 <italic>P+ red</italic></td><td><italic>lctP: P</italic><sub><italic>pilE</italic></sub> <italic>mcherry aadA:aspC</italic></td><td>This study</td></tr><tr><td>Ng081 <italic>P</italic>− <italic>green</italic></td><td><italic>pilE::P</italic><sub><italic>pilE</italic></sub> <italic>gfpmut3 kan</italic></td><td>This study</td></tr><tr><td>Ng095 <italic>G− green</italic></td><td><italic>pglF::PpilE gfpmut3 kan</italic></td><td>This study</td></tr><tr><td>Ng109 <italic>P++</italic></td><td><italic>igA1::pilE pilE ermC</italic></td><td>This study</td></tr><tr><td>Ng110 <italic>P++ red</italic></td><td><italic>igA1::pilE pilE ermC; lctP: P</italic><sub><italic>pilE</italic></sub> <italic>mcherry aadA:aspC</italic></td><td>This study</td></tr><tr><td>Ng118 <italic>Q− green</italic></td><td>pilQ::m-Tn3cm; <italic>igA1::P</italic><sub><italic>pilE</italic></sub> <italic>gfpmut3 ermC; recA6ind(tetM);</italic></td><td>This study</td></tr><tr><td>Ng116 <italic>P+ red*</italic></td><td><italic>lctP: P</italic><sub><italic>pilE</italic></sub> <italic>mcherry aadA:aspC; recA6ind(tetM);</italic></td><td>This study</td></tr><tr><td>Ng119 <italic>T− green</italic></td><td><italic>pilT::m-Tn3cm; igA1::P</italic><sub><italic>pilE</italic></sub> <italic>gfpmut3 ermC</italic></td><td>This study</td></tr><tr><td>Ng120 <italic>T− red</italic></td><td><italic>pilT::m-Tn3cm; lctP: P</italic><sub><italic>pilE</italic></sub> <italic>mcherry aadA:aspC</italic></td><td>This study</td></tr><tr><td>Ng121 <italic>T−G− green</italic></td><td><italic>pilT::m-Tn3cm; pglF::PpilE gfpmut3 kan</italic></td><td>This study</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>In the next step, we investigated the effect of pilin post-translational modification on the breakage force between pili. Wt gonococci bear a disaccharide composed of a hexose residue linked to a proximal 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxyhexose (HexDATDH) at serine 63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hegge et al., 2004</xref>). PglF is involved in membrane translocation of lipid-attached carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hegge et al., 2004</xref>). Deletion of <italic>pglF</italic> strongly reduces O-linked pilin glycosylation. Hence, we generated strain <italic>G− green</italic> by replacing <italic>pglF</italic> with <italic>gfpmut3</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>When interfering with the post-translational modification of the pilins, we expect that the rupture force between pili is affected. We used laser tweezers for measuring the rupture forces, employing a previously established assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dewenter et al., 2015</xref>). The surface was coated with a crude pilus preparation extracted from the strain of interest. Subsequently, single bacteria (monococci) were caught in a laser trap and held close to the T4P-coated surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The forces applied by the optical trap kept the cell body at the center of the trap. Type IV pili can generate very large force by retraction when they bind to surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maier et al., 2002</xref>). Binding of T4P to the pilus-coated surface and subsequent retraction led to a deflection of the cell body. Upon breakage of the bond between the retracting pilus and the pili on the surface, the cell body is pulled back into the center of the laser trap. Thus, the maximum force between pili attached to the bacterium and the pili attached to the surface can be measured. Henceforth, we will call this force rupture force. The distribution of rupture forces of wt bacteria pulling on wt pili was in agreement with a Gaussian distribution with a maximum at <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>wt/wt</italic></sub> = (39 ± 1) pN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The distribution of rupture forces generated by <italic>G− green</italic> was shifted to higher values of <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>G−/G−</italic></sub> = (46 ± 1) pN. Most interestingly, the force generated by <italic>G− green</italic> onto the surface coated with wt pili, <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>G−/wt</italic></sub> = (25 ± 1) pN, was considerably lower than the interaction forces between pili of the same kind. Moreover, we monitored the frequency at which bacteria pulled onto the pilus-coated surface and found no significant difference between the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming that pilus–pilus rupture force and not the frequency of pilus retractions was responsible for the altered cell–cell interaction in response to the loss of pilin glycosylation. Taken together, we found that <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>G−/G−</italic></sub> <italic>&gt; F</italic><sub><italic>wt/wt</italic></sub> <italic>&gt; F</italic><sub><italic>G−/wt</italic></sub>.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10811.004</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rupture forces between T4P.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principle of force measurement. The surface was coated with pili. A single monococcus was trapped in an optical trap. One or multiple pili can bind to pili at the surface. When they retract they deflect the bacterium from the center of the laser trap. The deflection is proportional to the force acting on the bond between the bacterium-associated pili and the pili at the surface. When the bond between the pili is ruptured, the bacterium moved back to the center of the trap.

Time-lapse microscopy was used for following the dynamics of their off-spring. This way, we ensured that the population was clonal at the start of the experiment.

A normalized, smoothed, average of the images of all positions at the beginning of the experiment is used to correct for inhomogeneous illumination. At the beginning only single cells are present, hence only the average illumination is visible in the average image. All positions of a single time-point were stitched together. High local intensity variance in windows of 5× 5 pixels served as indicator for the presence of a growing microcolony, that is, there is a high variation of dark and bright pixels for colonies, but only small variance for pixels without colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thresholding the local variance image gives a binary image indicating the growing colonies. The binary image was further processed by binary dilations, to ensure connected segmentations of colonies, which was followed by binary erosions to reduce any segments due to noise, but, also, to shrink the contour of the segment of a colony, such that the contour lies more on top of the bacteria at the front. After filling the holes in all binary segments, the contour pixels were defined to be the pixels that are affected by a further binary erosion. A circle fit on the contour pixels of each individual segment gives the information of center and radius of the colony. The centers of all circles were tracked to find regions of interests (ROIs) of growing microcolonies that have not yet grown into another colony. Fluorescence was segmented as follows: the stitched fluorescence image was convolved with a gaussian kernel of 11 × 11 px with σ = 1.5 px. The local intensity background of each ROI was found and subtracted. Thresholding of the background corrected fluorescence inside every ROI allowed to segment the patches of fluorescent bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The radii of the colony turned out to grow exponentially for at least 10 hr. Further image analysis was restricted to this time-period. Given the center and radius of the growing colony at any time, all Cartesian coordinates can be transformed into polar coordinates. The exponential growth of the radius of the colony implies that all distances inside the colony should, also, grow in the same exponential fashion. This can be illustrated by normalizing the polar coordinates by the radius. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D</xref> show a row of brightfield and fluorescence images, with the circle fit of the colony to fill always the same proportion of the sub-image. As a result, the scale bar shrinks in time, while the apparent colony size stays constant. Due to this normalization, the apparent position of segmented patches, also, stays roughly constant. The last column in (b) shows a superposition of all time-points of the normalized coordinates onto a unit-circle at the top, and a superposition of all time-points without normalization at the bottom onto the final fluorescence image. Due to the clear separation of clonal normalized coordinates, a manual selection of areas inside the unit-circle allowed to easily define all coordinates resulting from the same clone.</p><p>The spatial variance σ<sup>2</sup> can now be calculated using the information of background-corrected intensities and the Cartesian and polar coordinates for each individual clone for all time-points. To this end, the total variance σ<sup>2</sup>, the orthogonal variances σ<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup> and σ<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup> in Cartesian coordinates are expressed as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Our experiment runs during the exponential growth phase. Following a transformation event, the number of fluorescent proteins per cell generated by the offspring of a single transformant is expected to increase and eventually saturate at an equilibrium concentration. Thus, before saturation, the overall fluorescence initially increases more quickly, but then tends to increase exponentially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In our experiments, a fraction of the growing colonies originated from initially fluorescent cells. These colonies expressed the fluorescent reporter at its equilibrium concentration right from the start of the experiment and the rate of fluorescence increase was used to measure the generation time.</p><p>The development of the total fluorescence I<sub>tot</sub> of each clone is used to deduce the number of bacteria within a clonal patch.

The assay was modified for measuring the force generated by a single surface-attached bacterium as a function of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dewenter et al., 2015</xref>). The trap was calibrated by power spectrum analysis of the Brownian motion of individual monococci assuming a bacterial diameter of 1 µm and was found to have a stiffness of 0.14 pN/nm ± 10%. The position of trapped bacteria was detected at 20 kHz using a quadrant photodiode and the sample stage was movable via a combined piezo and electric motor.</p><p>We selected for monococci, that is, round bacteria since force measurement could be performed with higher accuracy than with diplococci. Using the drag force method, we found that the linear force range of the optical trap was <italic>d</italic> = 450 nm when gonococci were trapped. Therefore, the maximum force we detected was <italic>F</italic> = 65 pN. The retraction experiments were performed in a sealed chamber using a low-density suspension of gonococci, allowing for undisturbed measurement of single bacteria over a period of minutes. During the experiment, a single bacterium was trapped near the surface using the optical tweezers. Retraction of surface-bound pili resulted in deflection of the bacterium from the center of the optical trap as measured by the four-quadrant photodiode. The force acting on a bacterium is proportional to its deflection and was calculated using the calibration described above. After several minutes, a detrimental effect of the optical trap on the bacterium became apparent and it was abandoned.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We gratefully thank Michael Koomey and Hank Seifert for the donation of bacterial strains and vectors, and Oskar Hallatschek and the Maier group for helpful discussions.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior Editor), and two reviewers, one of whom, Roberto Kolter is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a resubmitted manuscript that was previously rejected. In our rejection letter we acknowledged that there was a very interesting story that had been poorly presented. In the revised version the authors have extensively revised their presentation. Indeed, they followed our recommendations very well. For one, they now start with presentation of the theory and proceed to use the <italic>Neisseria</italic> pili system to test it. They also have removed a lot of the results they had previously presented on phase variation because they detracted and confused more that they contributed to the main aim. Thus, we feel that the new version is much improved. The data that are now included are otherwise the same as before and they remain strong. Our main comments are that the paper needs editing. In particular, parts of the Discussion are redundant with the Results section (the parts that merely summarize the results again without additional discussion, e.g. the second and third paragraphs of the subsection “Differential physical interactions drive cell sorting”). These parts should be removed. Also, we think there was an error in the equations in the subsection “Image analysis” (one of the equation still seems incorrect; please see attachment).</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled “Genetic variation alters pilus–pilus interaction force and governs gonococcal cell sorting” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior Editor), and two reviewers, one of whom, Roberto Kolter, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions involving all three. Based on our discussions we regret to inform you that your work in its current format will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>However, the reviewers all agreed that the main problem with the manuscript was in its presentation and that, indeed, the results were of significance but that their importance was hidden. The work addresses a fundamental question (though this was not obvious until the last part of the manuscript), it uses an innovative approach to address this question and it provides conclusive results and answers. Thus, we would be willing to reconsider a completely re-written manuscript, where the hypothesis is presented first and then its test.

From my perspective the experiments have been well carried out. A very important control was carried out in using cells that were mutated for the ability to vary their pili and sectoring was shown to be reduced. This is critical to me because the observed reduction (rather than complete lack) of segregation already indicates that a major contributor to segregation is indeed simply where the cells are and thus defines where their progeny will be located. So the while the forces of the cell–cell interactions are contributing to the segregation patterns observed, they are not the sole factor. This greatly dampens the claims regarding the biology of this pathogen in particular. But most importantly, from my perspective, while the finding that pilus–pilus interaction forces influence segregation is very “neat”, it is really not a great insight regarding the biology of the organism. The contribution, as currently presented, seems to be more appropriate for a more specialized journal. However, if the results were to be presented differently, first posing the importance of how theory predicts that interaction forces between cells (in general) should lead to cell progeny segregation and only after that proceed to present the findings, this could be an important contribution. This work is not so much about this pathogen in particular but in general for all biological situations where cell–cell interactions might influence the spatial arrangements of progeny cells. This significance in almost completely lost in the current format.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1) In general, I found the text hard to read. This was a consequence of two aspects. First, I often did not get a good understanding of where the text was heading – I understood the content but did not understand the direction of the writing (for example in the third and fourth paragraphs of the Introduction). The second and related point is that the authors sometimes provided pieces of information at a moment where I did not yet know why this piece of information is relevant. One example: In the first paragraph of the subsection “Spatio-temporal dynamics of a variant with reduced pilus density within an expanding colony” the authors start discussing transformation, but it only becomes clear later that transformation plays a role in this study. I realize that my points concern writing style, which is a matter of personal preference – but I wanted to mention this in case it is useful for preparing a revised version. In short, a major re-write would be necessary.</p><p>2) The Introduction and the Results are very difficult to read. For example, the Results say that the experimentally determined interaction forces <italic>explain</italic> the observed spatial arrangement – but this is only true if one has the theoretical predictions in mind. Without knowing about these predictions at this point, it is not possible to see how exactly the interaction forces can explain the spatial arrangement. The authors do mention a link between interaction forces and spatial arrangement at the end of the Introduction and in the Results section (subsection “Interaction force between pilus-variants”). However, these statements are vague and understood only much later that these explanations are on solid theoretical ground.</p><p>3) Related to the point above, the main focus of the manuscript did not become immediately clear to me. Initially, the focus seemed to be on phase variation and type IV pili, but later the main focus shifted on fundamental questions about how differential cell–cell adhesion drives spatial arrangement of cells in a multi-cell context. I would find it easier if the study would just have one main focus.</p><p>4) Also related to the two previous points: because the link to the theoretical predictions (and therefore to the fundamental question) only comes so late in the manuscript, it did not become clear to me how much is already known about the link between interaction forces and spatial arrangement. Are there many other studies that address this issue? What are the main knowledge gaps? I would welcome more presentation of this early on in the manuscript.</p><p>5) As the authors show, the positioning of the mutants with fewer pili at the front of the expanding colony is probably a consequence of both their increased growth rate and of altered cell–cell interacting forces.

Following their suggestions, we have re-structured the manuscript. The major changes are as follows:</p><p>1) All results about phase- and antigenic variation were removed. We feel that these experiments caused confusion at various levels.</p><p>2) The manuscript was re-structured to make it hypothesis-driven. The story now evolves around the question whether differential cell–cell interaction forces trigger cell sorting in early biofilms.</p><p>3) The question whether active force generation was important came up several times when talking to colleagues. We performed additional experiments showing that pilus retraction was necessary to form defined colony morphotypes. This finding strongly favors a tug- of-war as the underlying mechanism of cell sorting in agreement with the differential strength of adhesion hypothesis.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) In general, I found the text hard to read.
