However, when developing animals face adverse conditions, such as limited availability of nutrients, they reallocate essential resources to favor growth of vital organs at the expense of other organs. This phenomenon of ‘organ sparing’ is exemplified by the preferential growth of the brain in human fetuses experiencing intrauterine growth restriction, resulting in undersized newborns with disproportionately large heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gruenwald, 1963</xref>). Although changes of circulation are known to enhance oxygen and blood supply towards the brain under nutrient deprivation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Severi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>), how systemic growth control is altered at the molecular level to favor brain development remains poorly understood.</p><p>A well-characterized example of brain sparing occurs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae experiencing nutrient deprivation. Systemic larval body growth of <italic>Drosophila</italic> is controlled by the conserved insulin/insulin like growth factor (IGF) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rulifson et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptides (Dilps) secreted by the insulin producing cells (IPCs) in the larval brain promote cell proliferation and growth of peripheral tissues by activating the insulin receptor (InR) and the downstream signaling components phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt (PKB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verdu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brogiolo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ikeya et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oldham et al., 2002</xref>). Nutrient restriction suppresses insulin secretion through an intricate nutrient sensing mechanism involving inter-organ communications between the fat body and IPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ikeya et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Géminard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rajan and Perrimon, 2012</xref>), and consequently, curbs the growth of most peripheral tissues. However, the larval brain is protected against nutrient deprivation and exhibits continuous neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). This protection is mediated by the glia-derived Jelly belly (Jeb) ligand that activates the Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) receptor on neural stem cells (NSCs) to turn on the downstream PI3K pathway independent of nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). Although cell proliferation of the nervous system is spared under nutrient deprivation, whether other aspects of neural development are also subject to organ sparing is unknown.</p><p>The arbor growth of post-mitotic neurons is achieved by cell expansion rather than cell number increase and therefore represents a different type of neural growth from cell proliferation. Following innervation of the target field, the dendritic or axonal arbor of the neuron expands in coordination with the tissue it innervates. For example, the dendritic arbors of <italic>Drosophila</italic> somatosensory neurons called dendritic arborization (da) neurons are known to scale with the body wall during normal larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parrish et al., 2009</xref>). This scaling involves synchronous expansion of body wall epidermal cells and of da dendritic arbors, such that neurons maintain the same coverage of the sensory fields while the body surface area expands exponentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). Da neurons are categorized into four classes that differ in their dendrite morphology and transcription factor expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grueber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hattori et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, class IV da (C4da) neurons, which completely cover the body surface and thus are called ‘space-filling’ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grueber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grueber et al., 2003</xref>), were found to elaborate more dendrite branches when larvae develop on a low-nutrient diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that dendritic scaling of C4da neurons is regulated by the nutrient state. However, whether this dendritic hyperarborization is related to organ sparing and how nutrient stress promotes dendrite growth are unclear.</p><p>The conserved PI3K-Akt-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway promotes dendrite growth in both insects and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaworski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parrish et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Skalecka et al., 2016</xref>). Receiving signaling inputs from membrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), notably InR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sancak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vander Haar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2007</xref>), this pathway enhances translation in most cells by mTOR kinase-mediated phosphorylation of S6 protein kinase (S6K) and 4E-binding protein (4E-BP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burnett et al., 1998</xref>). At the center of this pathway, mTOR activity is also influenced by the cellular state, including nutrient availability, cellular energy levels, and stress factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zoncu et al., 2011</xref>). In particular, cellular nutrient starvation suppresses mTOR and consequently induces autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ganley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hosokawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jung et al., 2009</xref>), the self-eating process that helps to conserve and recycle vital cellular building blocks. mTOR regulates autophagy in part through the transcription factor EB (TFEB), which promotes autophagosome biogenesis but is suppressed by mTOR-mediated phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roczniak-Ferguson et al., 2012</xref>). Among the cellular stress sensors that inhibit mTOR activity, the forkhead box O (FoxO) family of transcription factors can be activated by a variety of stress signals and respond by suppressing cell growth and inducing autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eijkelenboom and Burgering, 2013</xref>). Although the regulation of mTOR activity by cellular stress has been extensively investigated in many cell types, how mTOR signaling is modulated by the nutrient state to impact neuronal arbor growth has not been examined. Furthermore, although FoxO members have been found to enhance dendritic space-filling of C4da neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sears and Broihier, 2016</xref>) and to regulate dendrite branching and spine morphology of adult-generated neurons in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schäffner et al., 2018</xref>), whether they also influence neuronal arbor growth in response to nutrient stress is unclear.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that dynamically growing <italic>Drosophila</italic> da neurons exhibit organ sparing at the level of individual cells, with dendrites growing preferentially at the expense of other non-neural tissues under nutrient stress. Mechanistically, the amplitude of Tor signaling in da neurons is attenuated less dramatically by nutrient stress than in non-neural tissues like epidermal cells, muting the induction of autophagy in neurons. The distinct sensitivities of da neurons and epidermal cells to nutrient stress are at least partly due to their differential FoxO expression levels: Foxo is lowly expressed in neurons and hence has minimal effect on dendrite growth, while it is highly expressed in epidermal cells, resulting in suppression of cell growth only under nutrient restriction. Functionally, preferential dendrite growth of da neurons increases the sensory acuity, allowing larvae to respond more nimbly to environmental stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nutrient restriction affects the growth of epidermal cells and C4da neurons differentially</title><p>A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref> reported that C4da neurons were hyperarborized when <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae developed on a low yeast diet that restricts the availability of lipids and amino acids, an interesting and surprising finding that agrees with our independent observation. In our experiments, we examined larvae reared in high yeast (HY, 8% yeast) and low yeast (LY, 1% yeast) media that otherwise contained only glucose as a carbon source. In wandering third instar larvae, C4da neurons in the HY condition showed sparse dendrites with gaps of dendritic coverage between neighboring neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, C4da neurons in the LY condition completely covered the body wall with dense dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This apparent dendrite overgrowth in the LY condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) was due to 60% more total branches and 59% more terminal branches but not increase of terminal branch length as compared to the HY condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nutrient restriction affects the growth of epidermal cells and C4da neurons differentially.</title><p>(<bold>A–B’</bold>) Double labeling of ddaC neurons by <italic>ppk-CD4-tdTom</italic> (<bold>A and B</bold>) and epidermal cells by the septate junction marker Nrg-GFP (<bold>A’ and B’</bold>) in the high yeast (HY, 8%) condition at 120 hr after egg laying (AEL) (<bold>A and A’</bold>) and in the low yeast (LY, 1%) condition at 264 hr AEL (<bold>B and B’</bold>).

To investigate this possibility, we monitored growth of C4da neurons and the body wall simultaneously during larval development in HY and LY media. We measured various parameters of the larval body wall and dendrite growth every 24 hr (hrs) starting from 48 hr after egg laying (AEL) to the wandering 3rd instar stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The body wall was measured at the levels of the whole body (body length), the body segments (segment width), and individual epidermal cells (average cell width as visualized by the septate junction marker Nrg-GFP). We found that all three parameters correlated with one another in both HY and LY conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G and H</xref>). We have therefore taken the segment width as an indicator of the larval body size.</p><p>Compared to the HY condition, LY caused a significant delay in larval body growth, with animals in LY taking 2.2 times longer (264 hr compared to 120 hr) to pupariate. Notably, larvae reared in HY and LY reached a nearly identical maximum segment width of ~600 μm before pupariation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). These observations verify that the LY medium caused the larvae to experience nutrient stress and developmental delay. The fact that the pupariation occurs at the same maximum segment width regardless of the rate of growth suggests that the segment width is not only a good proxy for body size, but it also provides a good indication of the developmental stage.</p><p>C4da neurons also grew slower in LY than in HY, as indicated by smaller increases of the total dendrite length during each 24 hr period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, because LY larvae had more time to develop, their neurons ultimately outgrew those of HY larvae, resulting in 1.39-fold longer total dendrites at the end of the larval period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To make more meaningful comparisons of dendrite growth in animals of similar developmental stages prior to pupariation, we plotted the dendrite length against the segment width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), as the segment width better indicates the developmental stage than the age of the larva. This plot shows that C4da dendrites grow 57% faster (based on the slopes of the linear fits) in LY than in HY when normalized by the segment width. Interestingly, the dendrite density (dendrite length/dendrite field size) was always higher in LY when plotted against the segment width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), even though the dendrite length was not greater in LY when the segment width was below 200 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Likely contributing to this discrepancy between dendrite density and dendrite length is that larvae reared in LY were thinner than those in HY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I and J</xref>) and consequently had smaller body wall areas to be covered by C4da dendrites.</p><p>The above data suggest that C4da neurons preferentially grow compared to epidermal cells when nutrients are limited. To determine if C4da neurons still have a growth advantage under starvation, we transferred larvae reared in HY media to agar-only media at 84 hr AEL, a time when larvae had reached the critical weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beadle et al., 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakker, 1959</xref>). Interestingly, C4da neurons showed significant dendrite growth as measured by the dendrite length normalized to the segment width (abbreviated as normalized dendrite length) over a 24 hr period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), even though the larval body size did not change in the same period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Collectively, these results show that while nutrient restriction delays overall larval growth, it differentially affects growth of C4da neurons and epidermal cells, such that C4da neurons exhibit a growth advantage, or are spared, under nutrient stress. Moreover, in the absence of nutrient intake, larvae mobilize existing nutrient storage to support the growth of C4da neurons at the expense of non-neural tissues like epidermal cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The InR-Tor pathway mediates the preferential dendrite growth under nutrient stress</title><p>Nutrient-mediated systemic control of larval growth depends on InR and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mTOR homolog Tor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulan et al., 2015</xref>). To examine effects of the InR/Tor pathway on dendrite growth during nutrient stress, we selectively inactivated InR or Tor in C4da neurons. For these assays, we measured normalized dendrite length when larvae reached a segment width of 500–550 μm, a size at which C4da neurons in control larvae exhibit a significant increase in dendrite growth in response to nutrient stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Taken together, the above results demonstrate that changes in the relative strengths of the InR/Tor signaling in neurons and epidermal cells can alter dendritic scaling: Reducing the throughput of the pathway in neurons can cause dendrite reduction, while suppression of InR/Tor in the epidermis can lead to dendrite overgrowth.</p><p>To determine how nutrient levels modulate InR/Tor signaling in neurons and epidermal cells, we examined Tor activity by immunostaining phosphorylated Ribosomal protein S6 (pRpS6), a substrate of S6K and a faithful indicator of Tor activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruvinsky and Meyuhas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). In HY, the cytoplasm of epidermal cells exhibited high and uniformly distributed pRpS6 signals, while the soma and primary dendrites of C4da neurons showed comparatively low pRpS6 intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). As a result, the ratios of pRpS6 intensity (average intensity within regions of interest) between the neuronal compartments and epidermal cells are much lower than 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>). Under nutrient stress, the overall pRpS6 staining on the larval body wall dramatically decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>), consistent with the notion that nutrient stress reduces InR/Tor signaling in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Géminard et al., 2009</xref>). However, in these animals, the pRpS6 signals were brighter and more even in C4da cell bodies and dendrites than in the epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>), causing the ratios of pRpS6 intensity between the neuronal compartments and epidermal cells to be larger than 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>). These data suggest that nutrient stress switches the relative strength of the InR/Tor signaling in C4da neurons and epidermal cells such that the neurons gain a growth advantage over epidermal cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The lack of autophagy induction protects C4da neuronal growth under nutrient stress</title><p>Nutrient stress suppresses mTOR activity to induce many cellular responses, including autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He and Klionsky, 2009</xref>). We therefore tested if autophagy is also differentially regulated by nutrient levels in C4da neurons and epidermal cells. To monitor autophagy levels, we used an mCherry-Atg8a reporter under the control of the endogenous Atg8a regulatory sequence, which labels autophagic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hegedűs et al., 2016</xref>). As expected, autophagosome levels in epidermal cells were low under the HY condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) but increased nearly 5-fold in the LY diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). In contrast, autophagosomes in C4da cell bodies were present at low levels under both HY and LY conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Similarly, epidermal expression of Lamp-mCherry, a lysosomal and autolysosomal marker driven by the endogenous <italic>Lamp1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hegedűs et al., 2016</xref>), increased by 4.8-fold under nutrient stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–1C</xref>). In contrast, the same reporter exhibited a much lower baseline labeling in C4da cell bodies (12.6% of that in epidermal cells) under HY and non-significant increase under LY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–1C</xref>). To examine the levels of autophagic flux, we overexpressed in epidermal cells and neurons a tandem fluorescent marker GFP-mCherry-Atg8a, which is converted from GFP + mCherry dual fluorescence to mCherry alone when autophagosomes mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nezis et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, increased autophagic flux results in a reduction of cytosolic GFP and an increase of vesicular mCherry, indicated by an increased ratio of mCherry area over GFP intensity. Using this marker, we found that although nutrient stress enhanced autophagic flux in both epidermal cells and C4da neuron cell bodies, the autophagic flux level was always higher in epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–1I</xref>).

Anticipating that inhibiting the responsible genes in epidermal cells would relieve growth suppression under nutrient restriction, we knocked down the candidate genes in epidermal cells using <italic>Gal4<sup>R16D01</sup></italic>. However, knockdown of none of these genes in epidermal cells yielded a statistically significant increase of the cell size under either HY or LY condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating either that these genes do not suppress epidermal cell growth or that the RNAi lines were not effective. We also examined dendrite growth in a <italic>Sirt2</italic> null mutant and noticed nutrient-independent increases of normalized dendrite length compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We next examined neuronal roles of two other components in the Tor pathway: Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb), a GTPase involved in Tor kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inoki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saucedo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>), and Slimfast (Slif), an amino acid transporter that maintains the cellular amino acid level necessary for Tor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colombani et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, knocking down <italic>Rheb</italic> in C4da neurons using a validated RNAi line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Francis and Ghabrial, 2015</xref>) caused a mild (11%) increase of dendrites in HY condition and a weak (11%) reduction in LY condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D, F, G and I</xref>), suggesting that Rheb suppresses dendrite growth under nutrient abundance but promotes dendrite growth under nutrient restriction.

The fact that dendrite reduction in LY food is greater suggests that dendrite growth under nutrient restriction may rely more on the availability of amino acid transporters.</p><p>We further asked why epidermal cells exhibit more pronounced growth suppression than C4da neurons under nutrient stress by investigating the role of FoxO, because FoxO is an important cellular stress sensor that can impact mTor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eijkelenboom and Burgering, 2013</xref>). We first examined FoxO expression in neurons and epidermal cells using a <italic>foxo-GFP</italic> transgenic line that carries a 77 kb genomic fragment containing the full <italic>foxo</italic> locus with a C-terminal GFP tag and therefore should mimic the endogenous FoxO expression. In epidermal cells, FoxO-GFP showed cytoplasmic distribution under normoxia but translocated to epidermal nuclei within several minutes of hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>), consistent with its known role as a transcription factor responsive to cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eijkelenboom and Burgering, 2013</xref>). FoxO-GFP was expressed at similar levels in epidermal cells in both HY and LY conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>) but could not be detected above the background noise level in C4da cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). To confirm these FoxO expression patterns, we stained larval body walls using a validated anti-FoxO antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Slaidina et al., 2009</xref>), which also showed much higher signals in epidermal cells than in C4da neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>).

Suspecting that the lack of nuclear FoxO-GFP in epidermal cells and neurons in LY media may be due to insufficient cellular stress, we subjected larvae to starvation or knocked down <italic>slif</italic> in all neurons to create nutrient stress. Within 4 hr of starvation, FoxO-GFP was drastically enriched in epidermal nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2H and J</xref>).

In HY, neuronal FoxO overexpression did not cause detectable changes in the ratio of pRpS6 levels between neuronal compartments and epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A, C and D</xref>). However, in LY, while pRpS6 levels in the somas of FoxO-overexpressing neurons were still higher than in epidermal cells, the dendritic pRpS6 signal was reduced to levels lower than those of epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). These data suggest that high levels of FoxO specifically suppress Tor signaling in dendrites in a nutrient-dependent manner. We further examined the autophagy level of FoxO-overexpressing neurons using mCherry-Atg8a, as higher autophagy levels suppress the growth of both C4da neurons and epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

In this assay, a temperature-controlled heat probe is used to deliver noxious thermal stimuli that elicit C4da-dependent larval rolling behavior.

Over a range of temperatures (from 40°C to 46°C), we found that a larger percentage of LY larvae exhibited nocifensive rolling responses to thermal stimuli than HY larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The temperatures required to induce response in a similar percentage of larvae were approximately 2°C lower for the LY condition than for the HY condition. At temperatures above 46°C the vast majority of larvae in both conditions exhibited nocifensive rolling. We additionally monitored response latency and found that significantly more larvae in LY responded within 5 s (fast response) of heat stimulus over a temperature range from 43°C to 48°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

This tissue-specific growth regulation by nutrient stress is at least partially determined by FoxO expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In non-neural tissues like epidermal cells, the stress sensor FoxO is expressed at sufficient levels to allow epidermal cells to respond robustly to nutrient stress. In these tissues, high nutrition elevates InR/Tor signaling and suppresses FoxO activity and autophagy, leading to a high growth rate; in low nutrients, the reduction in InR/Tor signaling combined with high FoxO activity stimulates autophagy and greatly slows down cell size increase. In contrast, PNS neurons express FoxO at much lower levels and exhibit low basal levels of autophagy. As a result, dendritic InR/Tor signaling is not further suppressed by FoxO when the systemic insulin level is low. Therefore, the low FoxO expression and the lack of autophagy induction in PNS neurons protect dendrite growth from nutrient stress. Interestingly, Rheb in neurons mildly suppresses dendrite growth in high nutrition but enhances dendrite growth under nutrient stress. Whether these effects are mediated by Tor remains to be determined.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of nutrient-regulated da neuron and epidermal cell growth.</title><p>See discussion for details.

The preferential dendrite growth of da neurons constitutes another form of nervous system sparing that bears important distinctions from <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain sparing. First, while proliferating neural stem cells in the CNS is protected against starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>), individual post-mitotic da neurons are spared at the level of neuronal arbor growth. Second, unlike CNS neuroblasts, which rely on a special extrinsic factor (the glial-derived Jeb) to sustain neurogenesis, PNS neurons possess a unique intrinsic genetic program that endows them the resistance to nutrient stress. Lastly, the CNS sparing is independent of InR and Tor, made possible by the alternative Jeb/Alk/PI3K pathway, while the PNS protection still relies on InR/Tor signaling. Therefore, our work reveals a novel mechanism of neural protection under nutrient stress.</p><p>In the mammalian brain, FoxO members are highly expressed in NSCs and are required for the long-term maintenance of the adult NSC pool critical for adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paik et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Renault et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yeo et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, FoxOs were also found to regulate dendrite branching and spine density of adult-born hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schäffner et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, FoxOs in these neurons suppress mTor signaling and maintain a level of autophagic flux that is necessary for the normal morphogenesis of the neurons. In addition, FoxOs were found to be upregulated in aged brains and function to delay aging‐related axonal tract degeneration by suppressing mTor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hwang et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> C4da neurons, FoxO was previously found to promote dendrite space-filling and to mediate polyQ-induced neuronal toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sears and Broihier, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kwon et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While these prior studies established key roles for FoxO proteins in nervous system development, the relationship between nutrition and neuronal FoxO function was previously unexplored. Likewise, FoxO expression patterns in neural and non-neural tissues have not been compared. Our results demonstrate that FoxO is expressed at a much lower level in da neurons than in non-neural larval tissues. Consequently, inhibiting <italic>foxo</italic> in neurons does not directly affect dendrite growth, even though overexpressing FoxO in neurons inhibits dendrite growth. Nevertheless, our results support that neuronal FoxO mildly promotes dendritic space-filling of C4da neurons only under nutrient restriction by reducing the size of the dendrite field though an unknown mechanism. More importantly, the lack of high FoxO expression makes neurons insensitive to nutrient stress, giving them a growth advantage over non-neural tissues that express higher levels of FoxO. Interestingly, this FoxO-dosage-dependent nutrient-insensitivity has been previously described in the adult genitalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tang et al., 2011</xref>). While adult wings and maxillary palps become small on poor diets, the size of genital arches is affected much less; these differential responses are linked to tissue-intrinsic levels of FoxO expression. However, in this example and previously described FoxO functions in growth regulation, FoxO primarily regulates cell numbers but not cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jünger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Puig et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, our study reveals a novel function for FoxO in environmental regulation of neural development. It is worth noting that although FoxO is minimally expressed in da neurons, it is expressed at a higher level in a subpopulation of CNS neurons, raising the possibility that the arbor growth of these neurons may be differentially regulated by nutrient availability.</p><p>Lastly, our results reveal a level of neuronal diversity in the response to nutrient stress. Although all da neurons we examined show similarly low FoxO expression and the lack of autophagy induction under nutrient restriction, only class III and IV but not class I neurons display preferential dendrite growth. This distinction may be related to their arbor growth mechanisms and neuronal functions. As proprioceptive neurons that detect body surface folds during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vaadia et al., 2019</xref>), C1da neurons have simple arbors covering defined territories on the larval body wall. Their dendritic arbors grow mainly by expanding the shafts of the dendritic branches established during embryogenesis. Their functional demands may require a tighter growth coupling with the epidermis but not with environmental nutrition availability. In contrast, C3da and C4da neurons have highly dynamic high-order branches that grow also by branching and tip extension. The lack of growth suppression therefore leads to dendrite hyperarborization. As these neurons sense mild to extreme levels of external stimuli, the heightened sensations allowed by their dendrite overgrowth may bestow the larva a survival advantage in an unfavorable environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Live imaging</title><p>Animals were raised at 25°C in density-controlled vials containing between 50 and 70 embryos collected in a 3 hr time window.

A ROI on neuronal or epidermal cell nucleus was drawn manually on a single slice with the strongest signal. The mean gray value of the area was calculated.</p><p>Autophagic flux levels were measured by Atg8a-mCherry area percentage divided by GFP intensity. Images of epidermal cells and ddaC neurons (1,024 × 1,024 pixels) were taken with a 40X objective and a step size 0.5 μm. Atg8a-mCherry area percentages were determined as described above. For GFP intensity, a ROI in ddaC neuron cell body or epidermal cells were drawn manually using the maximum projected image and the mean gray value of the area was calculated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistics</title><p>For statistical comparison of two samples (e.g. WT vs. KD) and comparison of two conditions (HY vs. LY) in each tissue, Student’s t-test was used. For results with one independent variable (e.g. genotype), one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s HSD test was used. For results with two variables (e.g. genotype and nutrient condition), the data were analyzed using two way ANOVA with genotype, nutrient condition and their interaction term. Posthoc contrasts with a Dunnett correction for multiple comparisons were used. For results of interaction terms (genotype: nutrient condition), two-way ANOVA was used. For additional information on number of samples, see figure legends. R studio was used for all statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Behavior assay</title><p>Larval heat-induced pain response was measured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babcock et al., 2009</xref>). Wandering third larvae were scooped out of the food and gently cleaned with water, then transferred into a small petri dish with water drops to keep the animals moist. A temperature-controlled heat probe (ProDev Engineering, TX) was used to apply the heat onto the larval body surface. The stimulus was delivered by gently touching the animals laterally on segment A4. Each animal can only be tested once. The response latency was measured from the start of touch on the animal until it initiated a complete 360° roll.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Francesca Pignoni, Gábor Juhász, Heather Broihier, and Bloomington Stock Center for fly stocks; Jongkyeong Chung and Pierre Leopold for antibodies; Cornell CSCU for advice on statistics; Michael Goldberg and Jay Parrish for critical reading and suggestions on the manuscript.

convincingly.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Low FoxO expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> somatosensory neurons protects dendrite growth under nutrient restriction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor, Hugo Bellen. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Fengwei Yu (Reviewer #1).</p><p>As you will notice, the reviews are quite positive and thorough. The reviewers have extensively discussed their reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We are enclosing the full report of the three reviewers as they are each useful and provide context. However, below we provide a summary of the key points that need to be addressed as agreed upon by the reviewers in their exchanges.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors make some comparisons between the C4 neurons and C3/C1, which leads to very interesting ideas in the Discussion. In doing this they focus on two C3 neurons that give similar results. Although they have clearly identified the C3 neurons correctly in 7D-E, I do not believe that they have identified those two C3 cells correctly in Figure 7I-J and supplemental 7-1A,B where the entire cluster is labeled.</p><p>The authors should do additional experiments using pre-existing and previously validated reagents. (We cannot assume any primacy of one study over another), nevertheless, it is necessary to compare carefully their results to the pre-existing studies – they should use foxO lof alleles, and the existing anti-FoxO antibodies.</p><p>The authors should explicitly explain what is being compared to what in statistical tests. Some are unclear – especially the 2-way ANOVA tests. If it was necessary (and we can't tell from the way data is presented), they should explicitly spell out how they did corrections for multiple tests.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>During nutrient restriction, animals favor the growth of vital organs like brain at the expense of other organs. A previous study has demonstrated that in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, larval brain sparing takes place under starvation, which is mediated by a glia-derived Jeb and the Alk receptor. In this manuscript, Chun and colleagues describe an interesting intrinsic genetic program that protects postmitotic neurons in PNS and promote their growth under nutrient restriction. They first show the differential effects of NR in the growth of epidermal cells and C4da sensory neurons, reproducing the previous findings by the Uemura lab (Watanabe et al., 2017). Although this part is not a new finding, their analyses are very detailed with nice images. Under NR, sensory neurons undergo preferential growth, in contrast to epidermal cells, which leads to dendritic overgrowth in the low nutrient condition. They then show that the InR-TOR pathway plays an important role in dendrite overgrowth under nutrient stress, whereas InR is dispensable in larval brain sparing (Cheng et al., 2011). The author further demonstrated that this dendrite overgrowth under NR is due to a lack of autophagy induction in C4da neurons under NR, in contrast to robust autophagy in epidermal cells. The authors further show that different autophagy levels in C4da neurons and epithelial cell might be due to differential expression of FoxO, a nutrient stress sensor. The overgrowth of C4da neurons under NR led to elevated sensitization of the animal in thermal nociceptive assays. In sum, the manuscript describes a novel concept that an intrinsic program promotes dendrite growth under NR. The experiments were well designed and rigorously conducted. The interpretation of their results is careful and precise in most of cases.</p><p>However, all the NR experiments were conducted with low yeast (low amino acid supply) and normal glucose level. The authors should at least examine the dendrite overgrowth under starvation (non-feeding condition), for example, they can age the larvae under normal food condition until the critical weight (60 h ALH) and switch them to the extreme starvation condition (removal of both amino acid and glucose), as shown in a previous study (Cheng et al., 2011) and others. Can the dendritic sparing phenotype be still observed at 96 h ALH under this starvation condition? This experiment is important and will help to rule out the possibility that dendrite hyper-arborization under the current NR condition may be caused by indirect effect of prolonged larval stages. Second, regarding the model in Figure 8 the authors proposed, as the authors used low-yeast medium contains less amino acid levels but normal glucose level. Low level of amino acid likely affects the amino acid sensing pathway via Slimfast/Rheb to modulate TOR activity, which I think is highly possible. The authors may examine the role of Slimfast/Rheb in dendrite overgrowth under low yeast medium (low amino acid). The above points need to be examined.</p><p>In sum, this is an interesting and important study, thus I support the publication of this manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic>, after the authors properly address the following points.</p><p>1) The dendrite hyper-arborization under the current NR condition may be due to prolonged larval stages (almost 10 days). Does dendritic sparing also take place at 96 h ALH after fasting in 60-96 h ALH?</p><p>2) The authors should examine the role of the amino acid sensing pathway Slimfast/Rheb in dendrite overgrowth under low yeast medium (low amino acid). The model in Figure 8 the author proposed may be revised if Slimfast and Rheb play an important role in the dendrite sparing under low yeast condition. If the results are not positive, the author at least need to discuss the possibility of the amino acid sensing pathway in the Discussion part.</p><p>3) Regarding the Foxo expression in epidermal cells and C4da neurons, I understand that the author did an excellent job to generate make foxo-Gal4 driver. Foxo-Gal4 reflects the level of Foxo transcripts. However, FoxO is post translationally regulated and translocate between nuclear and cytoplasm via phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. It is surprising that Foxo-GFP knockin did not show elevated levels of the protein (enriched in nuclear) under the current NR. One possibility is that the current NR condition is too mild for detecting the Foxo-GFP sensor. Can the author check its pattern change in its expression and nuclear enrichment under the extreme starvation state (non-feeding)? I also suggest the authors to make use of various published antibodies to examine the FoxO expression and translocation, for example, the antibodies from Broihier lab (Sears and Broihier, 2016) and Leopold lab (Slaidnina et al., 2009). This will strength the FoxO results, as a key intrinsic transcriptional program.</p><p>4) For Figure 7-supplement 1, the results are interesting. The author should include them in the major Figure 7 and leave the mCherry-Atg8a result in the supplement figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study from Poe and colleagues examines the property of “nervous system sparing”, which is the ability of developing animals to enable the distribution of nutrient usage between different cell types to favor brain growth over other tissues in times of nutrient restriction. This is an important question. It remains predominantly unknown which aspects of nervous system growth are spared, and the mechanisms involved in these processes.</p><p>The authors show that varying nutrient levels changes the growth rates of epidermal cells and c4da neurons. This occurs differentially between these two cell types. At low nutrient levels the neuron growth is relatively faster than the epidermal cell growth; hence the dendrites of the neurons end up covering more of the body wall. This part of the manuscript is very well described and characterized.</p><p>The authors show that the neurons are more sensitive to reductions in InR and Tor activity in low nutrient as opposed to high nutrient conditions. This is likely, however at present how the statistical analysis is done to show this is not well described. What exact data where used in each 2-way anova. Were there appropriate corrections for multiple testing if the same samples (including the controls) were used in different 2-way anova tests.</p><p>The authors show that reduction in nutrition does not lead to the upregulation of autophagy in c4da neurons, while it does in the epithelial cells. This is a key point. The data with Atg8 and Lamp are useful in this context. (The data with Mitf-GFP are not particularly useful, they can be moved to supplementary figures.)</p><p>The role of FoxO is central to this manuscript and has been extensively described in c4da neurons before. Thus, it is a responsibility of the authors to do this new analysis with a close consideration to the previous extensive work done on the role of this factor in c4da neurons by Sears and Broihier. In this present study, Poe and colleagues use two transgenic constructs to look at FoxO expression in c4da neurons; they could not see any. However, neuron intrinsic foxo loss does affect c4da neuron patterning. The mimic-derived line to look at FoxO expression and the foxo RNAi lines are very useful. Nevertheless, important well described reagents- a loss of function allele and an antibody – are available. The authors state that &quot;endogenous FoxO is likely expressed at levels too low to directly affect dendrite growth&quot;. On the other hand, Sears and Broihier already did show FoxO expression in c4da neurons, and they did extensive analyses using a foxo loss of function allele showing that loss of foxo does affect dendrite growth. The present analysis is incomplete until we can reconcile the differences (it would be best if the authors can directly compare some results using the same reagents as Sears and Broihier). Do both reports of FoxO activity fit into the same overall model?</p><p>FoxO levels are lower in c4da neurons than in the epithelium. If these low FoxO levels are a primary driver of the nervous system sparing process, there should be a process to create this imbalance of low foxO in the neurons, what is it?</p><p>Growing larvae in low nutrient conditions sensitizes the animals to easier triggering of the rolling response by touching with a hot probe. It is not clear to me that this is specifically due to dendrite patterning changes. Over-expression of FoxO may disrupt neuron function on many levels, it seems safer to argue that this experiment shows that neuron function is more sensitive to disruption when the larvae develop in low nutrient conditions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The brain has a privileged position in resource allocation in the body. Under low nutrient conditions, resources are reallocated to the brain to ensure proper functioning. Whether peripheral neuronal systems are similarly subject to such organ sparing has not been determined. Poe, Xu, and colleagues provide a convincing argument that peripheral sensory structures are in fact spared under conditions of nutrient stress. This is a very strong paper because of the novelty of the findings, the elegance of the experiments, the rigor of the analysis, the depth of the insights provided, and the clarity with which complex manipulations and molecular pathways are explained.</p><p>The authors identify a case of sensory neuron organ sparing under low nutrient conditions and show that the Insulin Receptor-Tor pathway is responsible for this preferential growth. They identify greater susceptibility of epidermal cells vs. neurons to low nutrient conditions and provide strong evidence that this difference is mediated by the lack of induction of autophagy in sensory neurons under growth stress. The authors also show, interestingly, that different types of somatosensory neurons show different preferential growth under nutrient restriction. They speculate that this difference may be due to arbor growth mechanisms and coupling to the epidermis rather than nutrition availability.</p><p>In general, the authors did a very good job of quantifying phenotypes, addressing alternative explanations for their results, and verifying their conclusions using multiple approaches. My comments are mostly minor, with the first being the only one that could potentially affect some of the conclusions.</p><p>1) The authors make some comparisons between the C4 neurons and C3/C1, which leads to very interesting ideas in the Discussion. In doing this they focus on two C3 neurons that give similar results. Although they have clearly identified the C3 neurons correctly in 7D-E, I do not believe that they have identified those two C3 cells correctly in Figure 7I-J and supplemental 7-1A,B where the entire cluster is labeled. At the least, they have not labeled them in a way that would allow them to be discriminated from others in the cluster based on anything other than cell position and cell body shape. Based on those criteria their labeling is inconsistent with what I think is the likely identity. I hope the authors excuse this assertion if they are confident in their assignment. If there is a consistent mislabeling though this could affect the data gathered and conclusions that are drawn in this part of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53351.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors make some comparisons between the C4 neurons and C3/C1, which leads to very interesting ideas in the Discussion.

We feel sorry for mislabeling C3da cell bodies in Figure 7I-J, supplement 7-1A and 1B.

Therefore, it appears that da neurons can grow by mobilizing existing nutrient storage even in the absence of any nutrient intake, further supporting the idea of sparing of dendrite growth. The results are included in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</p><p>Second, we found that <italic>slimfast</italic> (<italic>slif</italic>) knockdown in C4da neurons caused severe dendrite reduction in both HY and LY conditions, suggesting that the Slif amino acid transporter is required for proper dendrite growth regardless of the nutrient state. Interestingly, the dendrite reduction in LY food is greater, which suggests that dendrite growth under nutrient restriction may rely more on the availability of amino acid transporters. These results are included in the Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><p>On the other hand, <italic>Rheb</italic> knockdown in C4da neurons caused nutrient-state-dependent changes in dendrite growth – a mild dendrite increase in HY and a weak dendrite reduction in LY. We do not know whether this role of Rheb in nutrient-dependent dendrite regulation is dependent on Tor signaling. These results are also included in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. We also modified our model (Figure 8) and Discussion based on these new results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In sum, this is an interesting and important study, thus I support the publication of this manuscript in eLife, after the authors properly address the following points.</p><p>1) The dendrite hyper-arborization under the current NR condition may be due to prolonged larval stages (almost 10 days).

First, we subjected the larvae to starvation and examined FoxO-GFP distribution. FoxO-GFP translocated to epidermal nuclei within 4 hrs, suggesting that starvation indeed poses more stress on larvae than nutrient restriction (LY condition). Second, using an FoxO antibody from Leopold lab (we were unable to obtain the antibody from Broihier lab), we confirmed that FoxO staining coincides with FoxO-GFP patterns. FoxO expression levels visualized by the anti-FoxO antibody are consistent with those measured by FoxO-GFP in both epidermal cells and neurons, in both HY and LY conditions.

This part of the manuscript is very well described and characterized.</p><p>The authors show that the neurons are more sensitive to reductions in InR and Tor activity in low nutrient as opposed to high nutrient conditions. This is likely, however at present how the statistical analysis is done to show this is not well described. What exact data where used in each 2-way anova. Were there appropriate corrections for multiple testing if the same samples (including the controls) were used in different 2-way anova tests.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have revised descriptions of our statistical tests for all figures, in both Materials and methods and figure legends, to clarify which groups were compared and what corrections were used. We conducted the statistical tests under the guidance of the Cornell Statistical Consulting Unit (CSCU).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show that reduction in nutrition does not lead to the upregulation of autophagy in c4da neurons, while it does in the epithelial cells. This is a key point. The data with Atg8 and Lamp are useful in this context. (The data with Mitf-GFP are not particularly useful, they can be moved to supplementary figures.)</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we moved Mitf-GFP data to Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The role of FoxO is central to this manuscript and has been extensively described in c4da neurons before. Thus, it is a responsibility of the authors to do this new analysis with a close consideration to the previous extensive work done on the role of this factor in c4da neurons by Sears and Broihier. In this present study, Poe and colleagues use two transgenic constructs to look at FoxO expression in c4da neurons; they could not see any. However, neuron intrinsic foxo loss does affect c4da neuron patterning. The mimic-derived line to look at FoxO expression and the foxo RNAi lines are very useful. Nevertheless, important well described reagents- a loss of function allele and an antibody – are available. The authors state that &quot;endogenous FoxO is likely expressed at levels too low to directly affect dendrite growth&quot;. On the other hand, Sears and Broihier already did show FoxO expression in c4da neurons, and they did extensive analyses using a foxo loss of function allele showing that loss of foxo does affect dendrite growth. The present analysis is incomplete until we can reconcile the differences (it would be best if the authors can directly compare some results using the same reagents as Sears and Broihier). Do both reports of FoxO activity fit into the same overall model?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern and therefore have tested published <italic>foxo</italic> reagents. In particular, we tested <italic>foxo<sup>Δ94</sup></italic>, a <italic>foxo</italic> null allele (Sears and Broihier, 2016), and a rabbit anti-FoxO antibody from Leopold lab (Slaidina et al., 2009). We were unable to obtain the FoxO antibody from Broihier lab.</p><p>Although <italic>foxo<sup>Δ94</sup> </italic>was reported to be viable in two early studies, in our tests using HY, LY, and a standard cornmeal/molasses media, <italic>foxo<sup>Δ94</sup></italic> was lethal before 3<sup>rd</sup> instar. Therefore, we were unable to examine dendrite growth of C4da neurons in <italic>foxo<sup>Δ94</sup></italic> mutant larvae. We think the discrepancy is likely due to different media being used in ours and earlier studies. We were unable to obtain information regarding the recipes used by Sears and Broihier, 2016.</p><p>We were able to test FoxO staining using the antibody from Leopold lab. The results were consistent with data obtained using FoxO-GFP. FoxO staining signals overlapped with FoxO-GFP and is reduced upon <italic>foxo</italic> knockdown. These results are included in the new Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p><p>Although our results seem to be contradictory to those reported by Sears and Broihier, 2016, we should point out that our primary means of measuring relative dendrite growth (normalized dendrite length) is different from that used by the previous study (box counting). We in fact detected a mild reduction of dendrite density, which is more similar to the box counting method, when we knocked down <italic>foxo</italic> in C4da neurons under LY. In addition, as we demonstrated in this study, the relative dendrite growth depends tightly on the nutrient condition and the role of FoxO in dendrite growth is also nutrient-dependent. A possible reason for the discrepancy between our and the earlier studies could be due to different media used. We unfortunately could not obtain the exact information about the media used in the earlier study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>FoxO levels are lower in c4da neurons than in the epithelium. If these low FoxO levels are a primary driver of the nervous system sparing process, there should be a process to create this imbalance of low foxO in the neurons, what is it?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not know exactly how the imbalance of FoxO expression between epidermal cells and neurons is created. But we propose that the imbalance could be a result of the different genetic programs between epidermal cells and neurons that control many other differentially expressed genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Growing larvae in low nutrient conditions sensitizes the animals to easier triggering of the rolling response by touching with a hot probe. It is not clear to me that this is specifically due to dendrite patterning changes. Over-expression of FoxO may disrupt neuron function on many levels, it seems safer to argue that this experiment shows that neuron function is more sensitive to disruption when the larvae develop in low nutrient conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this experiment does not prove a causal relationship between dendrite level and neuronal function. Therefore, we added the possibility that FoxO expression may affect neuronal function independent of its effect on dendrite growth. The suggestion that neuronal function is more sensitive to disruption in low nutrient conditions is an interesting one. However, we feel that we do not have enough evidence to draw this conclusion, because we have not examined many other means of disrupting neurons under both conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The authors make some comparisons between the C4 neurons and C3/C1, which leads to very interesting ideas in the Discussion. In doing this they focus on two C3 neurons that give similar results. Although they have clearly identified the C3 neurons correctly in 7D-E, I do not believe that they have identified those two C3 cells correctly in Figure 7I-J and supplemental 7-1A,B where the entire cluster is labeled. At the least, they have not labeled them in a way that would allow them to be discriminated from others in the cluster based on anything other than cell position and cell body shape. Based on those criteria their labeling is inconsistent with what I think is the likely identity. I hope the authors excuse this assertion if they are confident in their assignment. If there is a consistent mislabeling though this could affect the data gathered and conclusions that are drawn in this part of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer very much for spotting the errors. We are sorry for mislabeling C3da cell bodies in Figure 7I-J, supplement 7-1A and 1B. Therefore, we have followed the reviewer’s suggestion and re-examined the levels of autophagy and lysosomes in C3da neurons using C3da-specific driver <italic>19-12</italic>. The results are consistent with our conclusion that autophagy and lysosome levels are low in C3da neurons. The new results are included in the new Figure 7.</p></body></sub-article></article>
