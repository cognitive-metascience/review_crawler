We demonstrate that bacterial infection of <italic>Drosophila</italic> females reduces oviposition and that peptidoglycan, the component that activates <italic>Drosophila</italic> antibacterial response, is also the elicitor of this behavioral change. We show that peptidoglycan regulates egg-laying rate by activating NF-κB signaling pathway in octopaminergic neurons and that, a dedicated peptidoglycan degrading enzyme acts in these neurons to buffer this behavioral response. This study shows that a unique ligand and signaling cascade are used in immune cells to mount an immune response and in neurons to control fly behavior following infection.

While many of these bacteria are harmless and some even help us digest our food, others can make us ill. Upon detecting harmful bacteria, our bodies therefore trigger an immune response intended to destroy them.</p><p>Some insects – including butterflies, moths and grasshoppers – have an additional way of defending themselves against bacteria besides their immune response. Whenever they detect harmful microorganisms, the insects change their behavior so as to reduce their chances of becoming infected and limit the damage an infection would cause. The insects move away from areas containing harmful bacteria, for example, and temporarily stop eating. But whereas the insects’ immune response to bacteria is well documented, little was known about the mechanisms that underlie these changes in behavior.</p><p>Kurz, Charroux et al. set out to rectify this using another insect species, the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Flies that are infected with bacteria lay fewer eggs than healthy flies: a change in behavior that helps protect the offspring from infection. Kurz, Charroux et al. show that fruit flies are able to detect a component of the cell wall that surrounds all bacteria. This substance, known as peptidoglycan, activates a set of neurons in the fly that produce a chemical called octopamine. These neurons in turn activate a signaling pathway featuring a molecule known as NF-κB, and this causes the flies to lay fewer eggs.</p><p>Notably, peptidoglycan and NF-κB are also the molecules that trigger the anti-bacterial immune response. Fruit flies thus use the same pathway in immune cells and in neurons to trigger immune responses and behavioral changes, respectively. The challenge now is to identify precisely which neurons respond to bacterial peptidoglycan, and to work out how peptidoglycan changes the activity of these cells. Furthermore, studies have recently shown that bacterial peptidoglycan can influence the development of the mouse brain, as well as mouse behavior. This suggests that mechanisms for detecting harmful bacteria may be conserved across evolution, a possibility that requires further investigation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21937.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21937.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>drosophila</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>octopaminergic neurons</kwd><kwd>NF-kB</kwd><kwd>behaviour</kwd><kwd>IMD</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24567</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Royet</surname><given-names>Julien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Equipe Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20140329541</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Royet</surname><given-names>Julien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Investissements d'avenir-Labex INFORM</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-LABx-0054</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Royet</surname><given-names>Julien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Female fruit flies sense bacteria-derived peptidoglycan via the octopaminergic neurons to adapt their egg laying behavior to their infection status.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As infectious diseases pose a threat to the host integrity and to its reproductive fitness, eukaryotes have evolved sophisticated mechanisms that detect and mobilize defenses against pathogens. Innate immunity, which is common to all metazoans, serves as a first-line defense against microbes. Its hallmarks are the recognition of microorganisms by germline-encoded non-rearranging receptors followed by rapid effector mechanisms such as phagocytosis, proteolytic cascade activation and production of antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoffmann et al., 1999</xref>). Genetic screens have identified two NF-κB-dependent pathways, IMD and Toll, as the main signaling cascades that control immune gene induction in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lemaitre et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferrandon et al., 2007</xref>). Both pathways are activated by a unique ligand, the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan (PGN). PGN from Gram-negative bacteria and bacilli preferentially activates the IMD pathway via its detection by two members of the same PeptidoGlycan Recognition Protein (PGRP) family, PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE. While PGRP-LC functions as the transmembrane signaling receptor upstream of the IMD pathway, PGRP-LE is detecting PGN intracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosco-Drayon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gottar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rämet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaneko et al., 2006</xref>). PGN from Gram-positive bacteria rather engages a Toll-dependent response involving a circulating PGRP as sensor, PGRP-SA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Michel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leulier et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, in contrast to mammalian Toll-Like-Receptors, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Toll has no capacity to directly bind microbial motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brough et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In addition to activate direct antimicrobial strategies, eukaryotes have developed behavioral mechanisms that facilitate the avoidance of pathogens or lower the impact of the infection. These phenotypes grouped under the term ‘behavioral immunity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Roode and Lefèvre, 2012</xref>) or ‘sickness behavior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hart, 1988</xref>) refer to a suite of neuronal mechanisms that allow organisms to detect the potential presence of disease-causing agents and to engage in behaviors which prevent contact with the invaders or reduce the consequences of the infection. Although such microbe-induced behavioral changes have been reported in Lepidoptera and Orthoptera, deciphering the molecular mechanisms involved is experimentally challenging in these insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sullivan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kazlauskas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamo, 2005</xref>). Indeed, such an analysis requires a model organism with genetic tools allowing the manipulation of actors and regulators of both the immune and neuronal systems. Recent reports, mainly in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, start to unravel some aspects of these peculiar host-microbe interactions. Stensmyr et al. demonstrated that <italic>Drosophila</italic> avoid food contaminated by pathogenic bacteria by using an olfactory pathway exquisitely tuned to a single microbial odor, Geosmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stensmyr et al., 2012</xref>). Produced by harmful microorganisms, Geosmin is detected by specific <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory sensory neurons which then transfer the message to higher brain centers. Activation of this olfactory circuit ultimately induces an avoidance response, and suppresses egg-laying and feeding behaviors, thereby reducing the infection risk of both the adult flies and their offspring. <italic>Drosophila</italic> not only modify their behavior to avoid contamination by microbes or parasites, but also once they have been contaminated in order to reduce the impact of infection. For instance, direct exposure to bacteria impacts sleep patterns and induces hygienic grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yanagawa et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, <italic>Drosophila</italic> plastically increases the production of recombinant offspring in response to parasite infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singh et al., 2015</xref>). Although certainly involving a neuro-immunological integration, these microbe-induced behavioral changes are rarely understood at the molecular level, namely with no information on the nature of the elicitor and on the cellular and molecular machineries that link bacteria detection to behavioral changes. Moreover, canonical immune signaling pathways were never reported as being involved in those processes.</p><p>In order to appreciate further the interactions between infecting microbes and the host nervous system, we studied the effects of bacterial infection on one specific <italic>Drosophila</italic> behavior, female oviposition. We show here that fly exposure to bacteria is sufficient to trigger an egg-laying reduction and identify bacteria cell wall PGN as the elicitor of this effect. We demonstrate that PGN-dependent NF−κB pathway activation in octopaminergic neurons is the molecular signal that triggers oviposition drop post-infection. Finally, we present data showing that this NF-κB pathway activity in neurons is fine-tuned by a specific isoform of the PGN-degrading enzyme PGRP-LB, thereby modulating a process that would otherwise leads to an exacerbated and detrimental egg-laying decrease. Altogether, this study shows that detection of a unique microbe-associated pattern is not only protecting the infected individual via immune response activation but is also reducing the impact of the bacteria on the whole population by decreasing oviposition on contaminated environments. This could constitute a case of behavioral immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bacteria infection decreases fly oviposition</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> infection by extracellular bacteria triggers a battery of cellular and humoral immune responses among which the IMD/NF-κB signaling cascade is of paramount importance. Direct recognition of bacterial peptidoglycan by membrane associated PGRP-LC or intracytoplasmic PGRP-LE triggers NF-κB nuclear translocation and signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To test whether bacteria infection has physiological consequences other than strictly antimicrobial, we analyzed the egg-laying behavior of infected flies. Septic injury with a needle contaminated with the innocuous Gram-negative bacteria <italic>E. coli,</italic> induced a strong egg-laying drop within 6 hr following infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The difference in the number of eggs laid by infected versus non-infected wild-type females was no longer seen after 24 hr demonstrating that the effects are transient and reversible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As for the immune response, bacteria-induced egg-laying drop was stronger and lasted longer in <italic>PGRP-LB</italic> mutants than in wild-type flies while the amount of bacteria within the animals were equivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2A and B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zaidman-Rémy et al., 2006</xref>). This effect was dose-dependent and not observed after sterile wound or when flies were injected with water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). This demonstrates that the effects were due to the presence of the bacteria in the body cavity and not to cuticle wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consequently, we thereafter used untreated animals as uninfected controls.

Altogether these results demonstrate that PGRP-LE-dependent PGN detection by the fly induces a reduction of female oviposition by triggering NF-κB pathway activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Bacteria infection induces a temporary retention of oocytes within ovaries</title><p>Previous studies reported that flies infected with pathogenic bacteria (<italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, <italic>Burkholderia cenocepacia</italic> and <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>) present an oviposition defect consecutive to ovary degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandt and Schneider, 2007</xref>). To identify the causes of the bacteria-induced egg-laying reduction, we dissected ovaries from untreated flies, flies stabbed only or injured with a needle contaminated with bacteria, and counted the numbers of oocytes of different maturation stages. Six hours post-exposure to <italic>E. coli</italic>, ovaries from wild-type flies contained three-times more mature stage 14 oocytes than uninfected animals and less stage 10 immature oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B and C</xref>). Egg-laying drop was reversible by 24 hr suggesting that the exposure to bacteria does not prevent oocyte maturation in the ovaries but rather blocks egg release into the oviducts, leading to an accumulation of mature oocytes in ovaries of infected flies. Since an oviposition drop could be the result of a stage-specific oocyte apoptotic death, we tested this hypothesis. Antibody staining against activated-caspase (DCP1) did not reveal any sign of increased apoptosis in ovaries from infected females compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>). These results demonstrate that the presence of bacteria within the female body cavity induces a transient retention of mature oocytes within the ovaries leading to a drop of egg laying. We then tested whether the ovulation defect was not an indirect consequence of an infection-dependent reduced food intake. As shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>, bacterial infection did not impair adult feeding behavior in both wild-type and <italic>Relish</italic> mutants 6 hr after bacterial pricking.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Immune and behavioral responses to PGN are controlled by distinct PGRP-LB isoforms</title><p>To identify the tissue(s) in which IMD pathway activation modulate egg-laying behavior in response to infection, we looked for the site(s) of action of the PGRP-LB amidase. Indeed, as an exacerbated egg-laying drop post-infection might be detrimental, we hypothesized that the cells in which PGRP-LB is modulating the immune pathway could be the ones in which IMD activation is interfering with egg-laying. Interestingly, the PGRP-LB locus generates three protein isoforms (PGRP-LB <sup>PA, PC, PD</sup>) that all have in common the enzymatic amidase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). While the secreted PGRP-LB<sup>PC</sup> cleaves the PGN in the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paredes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zaidman-Rémy et al., 2006</xref>), the site and mode of action of the two other isoforms are unknown. In contrast to PGRP-LB<sup>PC</sup>, neither PGRP-LB<sup>PA</sup> nor PGRP-LB<sup>PD</sup> possess a signal peptide, suggesting that they could act intracellularly. PGRP-LB<sup>PA</sup> is made of the amidase domain only and PGRP-LB<sup>PD</sup> contains an additional short N-terminal peptide of unknown function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To test the implication of these isoforms in immune and behavioral responses, we tested their ability to rescue <italic>PGRP-LB</italic> null mutant phenotypes. For that purpose, we cloned 3 Kb, 2.8 Kb and 3.8 Kb of genomic DNA upstream of the predicted transcription start site of each isoform upstream of the Gal4 coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These lines (called pLB1<sup>Gal4</sup>, pLB2<sup>Gal4</sup> and pLB3<sup>Gal4</sup>) were combined in vivo, with isoform specific UAS lines (called UAS-PGRP-LB<sup>PA</sup>, <sup>PC</sup> and <sup>PD</sup>) in a <italic>PGRP-LB</italic> mutant background. Surprisingly, out of the nine possible combinations, only pLB1<sup>Gal4</sup>/UAS-PGRP-LB<sup>PD</sup> was able to fully rescue the egg-laying defect of <italic>PGRP-LB-</italic>infected females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This indicated that all PGRP-LB isoforms are not functionally equivalent as far as egg-laying control is concerned. In order to show that the three isoforms retain the ability to cleave PGN, we orally infected <italic>PGRP-LB</italic> mutants that ectopically expressed the different PGRP-LB isoforms in gut cells and monitored the expression of the IMD target gene <italic>Diptericin</italic>. The exacerbated <italic>Diptericin</italic> expression measured in <italic>PGRP-LB</italic> mutant was strongly reduced by expressing any of the three isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zaidman-Rémy et al., 2006</xref>). These results suggest that although PGRP-LB isoforms are functionally equivalent in the regulation of gut immune response to bacteria, they have specific roles in regulating bacteria-induced egg-laying phenotype. To further confirm the hypothesis that a single PGRP-LB isoform, PGRP-LB<sup>PD</sup>, was implicated in the control of egg-laying behavior during bacterial infection, we generated via the CRISPR-Cas9 technology, two PGRP-LB<sup>RD</sup>specific alleles which delete part of the PGRP-LB<sup>RD</sup> specific exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Although these mutants behave as wild-type flies as far as the immune response is concerned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), their oviposition phenotype post-infection is identical to that of <italic>PGRP-LB</italic> null females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results demonstrate that by regulating PGN level, the PGRP-LB enzyme is adjusting both immune response intensity and egg-laying rate to infection levels. However, these two regulations are genetically distinct with egg laying probably controlled intracellularly in the pLB1-positive cells via the PGRP-LB<sup>PD</sup> isoform and immunity extracellularly by the PGRP-LB<sup>PC</sup> isoform.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21937.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>One specific PGRP-LB isoform controls oviposition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PGRP-LB locus organization.

GFP staining was detected in neuronal-like fibers in the lateral and common oviducts where it seems to connect the oviduct to the basal part of the ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A’’’</xref>). Projections were also specifically detected in the posterior part of the ventral nerve cord, in the abdominal ganglion and in the subesophageal ganglion of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A’ and A’’</xref>). These results suggest that the effect of PGN on oviposition could be a consequence of NF−κB pathway activation in neurons controlling egg-laying behavior in flies. To validate this hypothesis, we first tested whether the exacerbated reduction of egg deposition in infected <italic>PGRP-LB</italic> mutant females could be rescued by providing PGRP-LB<sup>PD</sup> in neurons only. <italic>PGRP-LB</italic> females in which the UAS-PGRP-LB<sup>PD</sup> construct was driven by the pan-neuronal Gal4 driver (elav<sup>Gal4</sup>) no longer show a drop in egg-laying post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, RNAi-mediated inactivation of IMD pathway component Relish or Fadd completely suppressed egg-laying drop post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To further confirm the neuronal nature of the pLB1-positive cells controlling egg laying, we expressed proteins able to modulate neuronal activity in pLB1 cells. Specific expression of the Tetanous toxin (TTX) which cleaves synaptobrevin and impairs neurotransmitter secretion in neurons controlling ovulation has been shown to severely perturb oviposition in virgins as well as in mated females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soller et al., 2006</xref>). When TTX was expressed in pLB1 cells of mated uninfected females, a strong defect in oviposition was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This was not the case when TTX was expressed in pLB3-positive cells. We then tested whether increasing the excitability of the pLB1 cells via overexpression of the TRPA1 ion channel was sufficient to promote female oviposition. Expressing the TRPA1 channel in pLB1, pLB2 and pLB3 cells at the temperature at which TRPA1 is inactive (23°) did not modify egg-laying comportment of mated females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, pLB1<sup>Gal4</sup>/UAS-TRPA1 females raised at permissive temperature (29°C) laid significantly more eggs than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Such an effect of TRPA1 expression on oviposition was not observed when other pLB<sup>Gal4</sup> drivers were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Since TRPA1 is expressed in gut entero-endocrine cells were it mediates the effect of bacteria cell wall component, lipopolysaccharide, we tested if these specific gut cells are required for egg-laying response to infection. NF-κB pathway inactivation using two entero-endocrine cells drivers, voila-Gal4 and prospero-Gal4, did not interfere with egg-laying behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that pLB1 cells activity impacts oviposition and that in neurons, the IMD pathway is modulated by the PGRP-LB<sup>PD</sup> isoform to fine tune the oviposition drop following exposure to bacteria. These data provide a functional link between the neuronal networks that control oviposition and its regulation by the presence of bacteria.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21937.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>pLB1 is expressed in cells of the nervous system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram summarizing pLB1 expression pattern (green lines) in the brain (<bold>A’</bold>), the Ventral Nerve Cord (VNC) (<bold>A’’</bold>) and the ovaries (<bold>A’’’</bold>).

However, as shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, Fadd RNAi overexpression in these neurons did not prevent egg-laying drop post-infection. In addition, overexpression of the SPR cDNA under the pLB1<sup>Gal4</sup> driver was not sufficient to rescue egg-laying behavior of SPR null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Further insights came from looking at the phenotype of unfertilized females. Egg laying in mated females is mainly controlled by signals present in the sperm stored post-mating and the phenotype we observed could be the result of a regulation of this post-mating program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kubli and Bopp, 2012</xref>). However, virgin females also produce unfertilized mature oocytes that they released regularly. Importantly, using <italic>PGRP-LB</italic> mutants, we noticed that bacterial infection was also affecting egg-laying behavior of virgin females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover, we could show that inactivation of pLB1, but not of pLB3 cells via TTX overexpression impacted wild-type virgin females oviposition rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Similar results with virgins were obtained using the inwardly-rectifying K+ channel Kir (2.1b) that inhibits neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). pLB1<sup>Gal4</sup>/UAS-TTX virgin females presented ovaries packed with stalled mature oocytes which led to an important increase of ovaries size and, in turn, of female abdomen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Both phenotypes are reminiscent of those seen in mutants for the octopamine pathway (<italic>TβH<sup>nM18</sup></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>) or in flies in which octopaminergic neurons are functionally inactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monastirioti et al., 1995</xref>). The monoamine octopamine functions as a key neurotransmitter for ovulation in flies. It is synthesized from tyrosine by the sequential actions of Tyrosine decarboxylase (Tdc2) and Tyramine-β-hydroxylase (TβH). Females defective for Tdc2 or for TβH are sterile and display swollen ovaries where stalled mature eggs are not delivered into the oviducts, mainly due to defects in muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that bacterial infection could trigger an IMD pathway activition in octopaminergic neurons that in turn would induce egg-laying drop by reducing octopamine signaling. To challenge this hypothesis, we tested whether inactivating the IMD pathway in octopaminergic neurons only, will prevent egg-laying drop after infection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>, RNAi-mediated NF-κB pathway inactivation in TβH-positive cells only, was sufficient to prevent the bacterially induced egg-laying drop in wild-type and <italic>PGRP-LB</italic> mutant background. Then, we asked whether NF-κB pathway modulation by PGRP-LB<sup>PD</sup> was also taking place in the octopaminergic neurons. As shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, PGRP-LB<sup>PD</sup> ectopic expression under the Tdc and the TβH Gal4 drivers, was sufficient to rescue <italic>PGRP-LB</italic> mutant egg-laying phenotype. Finally, we tested whether the regulation of the oviposition following exposure to bacteria was modulated via the quantity of octopamine. Thus, we increased the amount of octopamine via TβHcDNA overexpression in pLB1 cells and measured the egg-laying drop phenotype of infected <italic>PGRP-LB</italic> mutants. Providing an excess of TβH in pLB1, but neither in pLB2 nor in pLB3 cells, was sufficient to fully rescue <italic>PGRP-LB</italic> oviposition drop following infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Altogether these results indicate that bacterial infection induces in neurons a NF-κB-pathway-dependent regulation of octopaminergic signal which in turns modulates ovulation and triggers a reduction of female oviposition. These effects are fine-tuned in the octopaminergic neurons by one specific PGRP-LB isoform, PGRP-LB<sup>PD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21937.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Bacteria modulate egg-laying behavior via the octopamine pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Septic injury reduces egg laying in <italic>PGRP-LB</italic> virgin females.

In addition to activate innate immune response in fat body cells, it also blocks mature egg delivery in oviduct and hence reduces egg laying of infected females. We further demonstrate that this bacterially induced behavioral change is due to an NF-κB pathway-dependent modulation in octopaminergic neurons. We finally present evidence that both responses, that are potentially detrimental if not down-regulated, are fine-tuned by distinct and specific PGN degrading enzymes. We propose that by regulating the level of internal PGN, flies adapt their egg-laying behavior to environmental conditions. In standard environmental conditions, PGRP-LB ensures that low level of PGN does not affect egg laying. However, whenever PGN concentration reaches a certain threshold, which either reflects an infection status or the presence of a highly contaminated food supply, NF-κB pathway activation in neurons is blocking egg release. As PGN of ingested bacteria is capable of reaching the internal fluid and triggering dedicated signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basset et al., 2000</xref>), one could imagine that such a mechanism prevents flies to lay their eggs in highly contaminated food in which their development and that of the hatching larvae could be impaired by microbes. In this context, PGRP-LB mediated PGN scavenging is crucial since a non-regulated behavioral immune response would lead to a severe drop in the amount of progeny which may not be in keeping with the real threat. Another possibility could be that a reduced egg production will favor immune effector production. Indeed, it is often considered that the energy cost of an acute innate immune response needs can be balanced by a decreased offspring production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stahlschmidt and Adamo, 2013</xref>). Blocking the energy-consuming egg production in infected flies could be a way for them to mobilize resources required for full activation of innate immune defences. A similar depression of oviposition has recently been documented in females flies exposed to parasitoid wasps who lay their eggs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kacsoh et al., 2015</xref>). However, while visual perception of wasps by female flies induces a long-term decline in oviposition associated with an early stage-specific oocyte apoptosis, PGN effects are transient and rather lead to a late stage oocyte accumulation suggesting that although the final outcome is the same, the mechanisms differ.</p><p>The present data indicate that PGN sensing acts on egg-laying behavior via neuronal modulation. We identified NF-κB pathway signaling in octopaminergic neurons as the actor of this PGN-dependent oviposition reduction. It would be informative to test whether bacterial infection is also affecting other octopamine-mediated behaviors such as reward in olfactory or visual learning, male-male courtship, male aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Unoki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Certel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>) or sleep:wake regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crocker et al., 2010</xref>). This would require to further characterize the nature of the octopamine neurons whose activation is modulated by infection and to consider that the phenotypes defined as being part of the sickness behaviours might be orchestrated directly by the immune system following the perception of microbes. Indeed, as shown above, our PGRP-LB<sup>PD</sup> reporter line is not only labeling cells in the reproductive tract but also in thoraco-abdominal ganglia and in the brain with projections to proboscis, wings and legs. Likewise, octopaminergic neurons have been shown to innervate numerous areas in the brain and in the thoraco-abdominal ganglion and to project to various reproductive structures such as ovaries, oviducts and uterus, further work will be needed to exactly pinpoint the identity of the affected octopaminergic neurons, their targets and their effect on fly behavior. In addition, the question remains as to how NF-κB activation can modulate octopaminergic neurons activity. Among the possibilities is the modulation of octopamine neuron excitability, the regulation of octopamine production or its secretion. Knowing the NF-κB protein itself is required for this behavioral response and that increasing the amount of available octopamine via overexpression of the TβH enzyme rescues the oviposition drop, it is expected that IMD pathway activation in neurons will have transcriptional consequences. However, other hypotheses might be considered since Dorsal, a member of the other <italic>Drosophila</italic> NF-κB signaling cascade Toll, has been shown to function post-transcriptionally together with IκB and IRAK at the post-synaptic membrane to specify glutamate receptor density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heckscher et al., 2007</xref>). It should also be noticed that PGRP-LC has recently been shown to control presynaptic homeostatic plasticity in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris et al., 2015</xref>). One of the future challenges will be to understand how NF-κB activation is reducing octopaminergic signals.</p><p>We show here that <italic>Drosophila</italic> uses an unique bacteria associated molecular pattern to activate different processes related to host defence, namely the production of antimicrobial peptides and the modulation of oviposition behavior. Interestingly, it appears that in order to fine-tune these responses, different isoforms of the same PGN scavenging enzyme, PGRP-LB, are required. While the secreted PGRP-LB<sup>PC</sup> isoform certainly acts non cell-autonomously to dampen immune activation by circulating PGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zaidman-Rémy et al., 2006</xref>), a putatively intracellular isoform PGRP-LB<sup>PD</sup> controls the effect of PGN on oviposition. Even more remarkable, this response is not transmitted via PGRP-LC but rather by the intracytoplasmic PGRP-LE receptor. Previous work has shown that PGRP-LE is also regulating response to bacteria in some part of the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosco-Drayon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neyen et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it will be important to understand how PGN is trafficking within and through cells, and how PGRP-LB<sup>PD</sup> modulates PGRP-LE-dependent IMD pathway activation and whether it is also required to modulate other PGN/PGRP-LE-dependent responses.</p><p>In essence, our results demonstrate that PGN, when ingested or introduced into the body cavity, not only activates antibacterial immune response but also influences neuronally controlled behaviors in flies. Importantly, the sickness behavior we deciphered does not appear to be a side effect of an energetically expensive immune response, but rather the result of a specific regulation. An orchestration of different processes required for the immune response was also exemplified by a recent report linking metabolism and immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2013</xref>). Although not dissected to the molecular level, previous studies in mammals have suggested that similar interactions between PGN and neuronally controlled activities. For instance, PGN derived muropeptide MDP has been shown to display powerful somnogenic effect when injected into rabbit brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krueger et al., 1984</xref>). It has also been shown that PGN produced by symbiotic microbiota may ‘leak’ into the bloodstream and reach organs distant to the gut, such as the bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clarke et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, recent findings show that bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan traverses the murine placenta and reach the developing fetal brain where it triggers a TLR2-dependent fetal neuroproliferative response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Humann et al., 2016</xref>). A future challenge will be to test whether an NF-κB-dependent response to PGN is also taking place in mammalian neurons and directly influences the animal behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacteria</title><p>The bacterial strains used are <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain DH5α (grown at 37°C) and <italic>Erwinia carotovora carotovora 15 2141</italic> (<italic>Ecc</italic>, grown at 30°C).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mani Ramaswami as the Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Giovanni Bosco (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The work explores mechanisms through which <italic>Drosophila</italic> modulate oviposition in response to bacterial infection. An intriguing aspect of this study is that, in addition to physiological responses, <italic>Drosophila</italic> also exhibit behavioral changes in response to bacterial pathogens. The authors suggest this to be an example of a behavioral adaptation that facilitates both protection against the pathogen for the exposed individual as well as affecting fitness by modulating reproduction, e.g. &quot;behavioral immunity&quot;. The evidence supports a model whereby octopaminergic neurons act directly on ovarian tissues to modulate egg laying in response to neuronal signaling elicited by bacterial infection. In a series of convincing loss- and gain-of function experiments, the authors establish that bacterially derived peptidoglycan acting through the NF-ΚB (IMD) pathway is responsible for this effect, and describe novel isoform-specificity in the function of the PGN degrading enzyme PGRP-LB in this context. They then present some evidence that the IMD pathway exerts its effects on egg production in a subset of octopaminergic cells, some of which innervate the oviduct.</p><p>The text was clear and concisely written, and for the most part figures were easy to follow and data supported the interpretations presented in the text. This study presents a new and exciting link between the innate immune system and the nervous system that allows for a multi-system integration of physiological and behavior responses to relevant environmental challenges, such as infection.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In general, it is important to strengthen the genetic experiments concerning neuronal manipulations in order to clarify the neuronal contribution to the described phenotypes.</p><p>1) There is some confusion re: the neuronal site of NF-ΚB activation. Based on the CNS neurites in the images provided, the pLB1-expressing cells seem to include peripheral sensory (taste?) neurons and sensory neurons in the oviduct, but not efferent oviduct-innervating neurons such as the octopaminergic neurons, with cell bodies located in the posterior tip of the VNC (see, for example, Monastirioti et al. (2003) Dev Biol PMID 14623230). Puzzlingly, the authors seem to imply that the octopaminergic neurons are a subset of pLB1 neurons – in fact, the subset that matters for the PGN effects on egg laying. To make matters more complicated, some of the drivers used in the study to demonstrate neuronal effects (e.g. elav-Gal4) also target enteroendocrine cells, recently shown to sense luminal bacteria (see Du et al. (2016) PLoS Genet doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005773). While the authors are careful not to ascribe the observed effects to a specific neuronal subset, the paper will be greatly improved by experiments to restrict and better define the specific octopinergic responsible for the phenotype. The authors should use restricted genetic manipulations and detailed neuronal characterisation. For example, using drivers specific for oviduct sensing (ppk) or efferent (Ilp7, oct+) neurons should allow them to establish the whether the IMD pathway acts in sensory, efferent and/or other endocrine cells to mediate the egg laying reduction.</p><p>2) Related to this point, the authors need to distinguish between a generic role for neurons in controlling egg laying, relaying the PGN-triggered signal or sensing it. In this regard, I see how presenting egg laying phenotypes as their ratio relative to control conditions makes comparisons visually straightforward, but can also mask &quot;constitutive&quot; phenotypes resulting from some genetic manipulations – especially those resulting from interfering with the activity of oviduct-innervating neurons. The authors should clarify which of their genetic manipulations have a strong effect on the constitutive egg laying ability of flies, and which are specific to septic injury responses.</p><p>3) Based on the data provided, it also seems conceivable that the main effect of PGN is to transiently reduce food intake, which can indirectly impact egg production. Do any of the described genetic manipulations affect one phenotype without affecting the other one?</p><p>4) The images of ovaries in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> would be more useful if they were stained with a DNA dye that better revealed the mostly translucent very early stage egg chambers, i.e. it's otherwise very difficult to see stage 7/8 and younger egg chamber. Nevertheless, from these few images it is clear that the ovaries 6h post clean injury have vast numbers of very early (stages 2-5/6) whereas 6h post septic injury these early stages are almost completely absent. Because the figure only presents one ovary and the quantitation does not measure earlier stages it is impossible to know what the fate of these earlier stage egg chambers is in response to infection. This is an important point because the authors suggest (Discussion, end of first paragraph) that infection does not trigger oogenesis checkpoints that utilize apoptosis to eliminate early stage oocytes while allowing continued development of stage 8 and older oocytes. This claim is not supported by their observations since the increase in stage 14 oocytes could result from a combination of continued development of stage 7/8 and older oocytes AND apoptotic elimination of some stage 7/8 and earlier oocytes. I suggest the authors consider this possibility and change their language with respect to the exact stage of oocyst development or do a simple DAPI/caspase staining at different times after infection to quantitate all stages of egg chambers and report amount of early and mid-oogenesis apoptotic events. I understand that this analysis may be outside the scope of the present study and not necessarily critical. The authors may wish not to do this if they change the language so as to consider the possibility that younger oocytes may be eliminated (unless there is some other compelling argument that excludes this possibility).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21937.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>In general, it is important to strengthen the genetic experiments concerning neuronal manipulations in order to clarify the neuronal contribution to the described phenotypes.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) There is some confusion re: the neuronal site of NF-ΚB activation.

Indeed, EE cells have been reported to express one TrpA1(A) transcript that is critical for uracil-dependent defecation and TrpA1 has also been shown to mediate the response to bacteria LPS. To test this hypothesis, we have inactivated the NF-κB pathway by overexpressing UAS Fadd- RNAi specifically in EE cells using the voila- or prospero- Gal4 drivers. The new data presented <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref> demonstrate that, in contrast to what is happening with the pLB1-Gal4 drivers, NF-κB pathway inactivation in EE cells does not prevent egg laying drop post-infection.</p><p>We then, as asked by the reviewers, tested the putative implication of the ppk neurons. Here again, inactivation of the NF-κB in ppk positive neurons did not prevent egg laying drop post infection (these data are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also tried to rescue the complete egg laying defect observed in a SPR mutant flies by overexpressing the SPR cDNA in pLB1 cells. As previously published, SPR overexpression under the ppk Gal4 driver was able to fully rescue the egg laying defect of SPR deficient females. This was not the case when we used the pLB1 Gal4 driver demonstrating that pLB1 and ppk cells are genetically different (these data are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we tested whether the ILP7 positive neurons that innervate the reproductive tract were implicated in the NF-κB dependent response to bacteria. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, contrary to pLB1 cells, NF-κB inactivation in these neurons have no effect on egg laying response to infection.</p><p><italic>2) Related to this point, the authors need to distinguish between a generic role for neurons in controlling egg laying, relaying the PGN-triggered signal or sensing it.

The authors should clarify which of their genetic manipulations have a strong effect on the constitutive egg laying ability of flies, and which are specific to septic injury responses.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the absolute number of eggs laid by females is an important parameter. We choose to show ratios rather than absolute numbers for the following reason. Although flies from a given genotypes are not always laying the same number of eggs over several independent experiments when not infected, the egg lay drop after infection (percentage) is consistent from one experiment to another. We have provided this data to the reviewers as a table showing the absolute number of eggs laid for two independent experiments with several genotypes prior to infection and following bacterial treatment.

Do any of the described genetic manipulations affect one phenotype without affecting the other one?</italic> </p><p>In order to respond to this concern, we have measured the food intake of wild type and NF-κB/Relish mutant 6 hours after bacterial infection by pricking. The results obtained, which are now included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>, show that bacterial infection has no significative effect on female feeding behavior. We therefore do not think that the reduction in egg laying is a consequence of a massive reduction in feeding of infected females. This has been added in the text.</p><p><italic>4) The images of ovaries in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> would be more useful if they were stained with a DNA dye that better revealed the mostly translucent very early stage egg chambers, i.e. it's otherwise very difficult to see stage 7/8 and younger egg chamber.

The authors may wish not to do this if they change the language so as to consider the possibility that younger oocytes may be eliminated (unless there is some other compelling argument that excludes this possibility).</italic> </p><p>To better characterize the impact of bacteria infection on oocytes we have performed new quantifications following clean injury and septic injury (6h) using DAPI to better identify specific stages including early ones. By focusing on stage 6, stages 7-9, stage 10 (post-checkpoint) and stage 14 (mature oocytes), we demonstrated that while the very early stages are not impacted by the treatment, there is an accumulation of mature oocytes. In addition, following septic injury, we quantified a significant drop in the amount of stage 10 oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C and 3D</xref>). We then tested whether this decrease of stage 10 oocytes might be due to apoptosis. For that, we performed anti cleaved-DCP1 antibody staining on ovaries from non-infected, injured only and bacterially infected females. Our data show that the amount of apoptotic events are not increased following septic injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C and 3D</xref>) Thus, bacterial infection transiently blocks ovulation, and especially the release of mature oocytes within the oviducts, without inducing a massive apoptosis in ovaries in contrast to other threat such as wasp.</p></body></sub-article></article>
