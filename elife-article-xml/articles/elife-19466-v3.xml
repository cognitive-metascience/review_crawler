transporter substrate specificities is linked to emergence of substrates via evolution of biosynthetic pathways. Transporter specificity towards the recently evolved glucosinolates characteristic of <italic>Brassicales</italic> is shown to evolve prior to emergence of glucosinolate biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that glucosinolate transporters belonging to the ubiquitous NRT1/PTR FAMILY (NPF) likely evolved from transporters of the ancestral cyanogenic glucosides found across more than 2500 species outside of the <italic>Brassicales</italic>. Biochemical characterization of orthologs along the phylogenetic lineage from cassava to <italic>A. thaliana,</italic> suggests that alterations in the electrogenicity of the transporters accompanied changes in substrate specificity. Linking the evolutionary path of transporter substrate specificities to that of the biosynthetic pathways, exemplify how transporter substrate specificities originate and evolve as new biosynthesis pathways emerge.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19466.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All living cells are surrounded by membranes that protect them from the external environment. The membrane contains proteins called transporters, which move nutrients and other molecules (known as substrates) across the membrane. A variety of transporters have evolved to move the hundreds of thousands of different substrates found in nature.</p><p>Plant cells make many different compounds to protect themselves from pests and diseases. A group of transporters known as the NPF family move some of these compounds across the cells outer membrane. The types of substrates they transport vary in different plants. In cassava, for example, NPF transporters move compounds called cyanogenic glucosides, which are poisonous to humans and other animals. On the other hand, NPF transporters in another plant called <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> can move bitter-tasting compounds called glucosinolates. The process that makes glucosinolates in plants evolved from the process that makes cyanogenic glucosides.</p><p>Can transporters evolve the ability to move a new substrate before or after that substrate first appears? To answer this question, Jørgensen et al. studied the NPF family in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, cassava and another plant called papaya that makes both cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates. The experiments suggest that NPF transporters able to move both cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates evolved before plants evolved the ability to make glucosinolates. Later in evolution, these multi-specific transporters specialized to only move glucosinolates. Jørgensen et al. also show that early glucosinolate transporters could move a broad variety of glucosinolates but later evolved to only transport particular types.</p><p>These findings show how transporters and the processes that make compounds in cells may evolve together. A future challenge will be to understand the molecular changes in a transporter that make it specific for a certain substrate. This may help researchers to develop new ways of controlling the amount of toxic compounds in crops we eat by manipulating how the compounds are transported.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>substrate specificity and electrogenicity</kwd><kwd>transporter evolution</kwd><kwd>metabolite transporters</kwd><kwd>indole glucosinolate transport</kwd><kwd>cyanogenic glucoside transport</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001732</institution-id><institution>Danish National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DNRF 99</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jørgensen</surname><given-names>Morten Egevang</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Deyang</given-names></name><name><surname>Crocoll</surname><given-names>Christoph</given-names></name><name><surname>Motawia</surname><given-names>Mohammed Saddik</given-names></name><name><surname>Olsen</surname><given-names>Carl Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phylogenetic and biochemical analyses reveals a shared evolutionary path between biosynthesis and transport of defense metabolites in plants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phospholipid-based cell membranes are the foundation for extant cellular life and with them arose the need for carrier proteins to shuttle metabolites across the semi-permeable membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mansy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deamer and Dworkin, 2005</xref>). New biosynthesis pathways continuously emerged throughout evolution, resulting in a vast diversity in metabolite chemical structures (&gt;200.000 structures tentatively identified in the plant kingdom alone), where some are restricted to certain taxa and others are found broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weng et al., 2012</xref>). Matching the vast structural diversity of metabolites, approximately 10% of coding sequences of contemporary genomes encode transport proteins with diverse substrate specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saier and Ren, 2006</xref>) that enable transport of metabolites and ions into and out of cells. However, the evolutionary path that leads to the rise of new transporter substrate specificity upon emergence of new metabolites is unknown. Classical evolution theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ohno, 2013</xref>) and several studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fani and Fondi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Prasad et al., 2012</xref>) support the hypothesis that new enzyme functions arise in duplicated genes if they are subject to unique selection pressure, - alternatively they rapidly become pseudogenes. A key example is found in the evolution of mineral corticoid and glucocorticoid receptors found in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bridgham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carroll et al., 2008</xref>). These two receptors evolved post duplication of a dual specificity aldosterone and cortisol receptor basal to the jawed vertebrate lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bridgham et al., 2006</xref>). However, aldosterone biosynthesis did not arise before the advent of tetrapods suggesting that the ancestral receptor evolved affinity towards aldosterone before the hormone was present, possibly as a by-product of the receptors’ affinity towards chemically similar ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bridgham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carroll et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, it appears that selection pressure enforced upon related but distinct ligands can drive the emergence of receptors’ affinity towards a new substrate. In comparison, it is not clear if new transporters evolve de novo with emergence of new substrates, or whether gene duplications allow ancestral multifunctional proteins to take on greater specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2010</xref>).</p><p>To answer this question, it is necessary to use a model system where the evolution of the biosynthetic pathway is known and where transporters have been identified. As a model system, we used the <italic>Brassicales</italic>-specific glucosinolate defense compounds with a biosynthetic pathway that diversified from the ancestral cyanogenic glucoside pathway found in more than 2500 plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sønderby et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Halkier and Gershenzon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bak et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clausen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mithen et al., 2010</xref>). The two pathways share the initial enzymatic amino acid to oxime conversion, but produce structurally different end products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clausen et al., 2015</xref>).

Also, two H<sup>+</sup>/glucosinolate symporters, GTR1 and GTR2, belonging to the NPF family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Léran et al., 2014</xref>) and with broad glucosinolate specificity (i.e. no discrimination against amino acid side chain) were identified in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nour-Eldin et al., 2012</xref>) that predominantly produces aliphatic and indole glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mithen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2003</xref>). Although transporters for cyanogenic glucosides are yet to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jørgensen et al., 2005</xref>), we set out to investigate whether the evolution of a new biosynthetic pathway (here glucosinolates from cyanogenic glucosides) promoted the co-evolution of transporter specificity, i.e. did glucosinolate transporters originate from cyanogenic glucoside transporters in the NPF family? Furthermore, <italic>in planta</italic> studies suggest the existence of an additional glucosinolate transporter with narrow specificity for the recently evolved indole glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2013</xref>) that are essential for innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sanchez-Vallet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bednarek et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore investigated if evolution within a biosynthetic pathway (here emergence of indole glucosinolates) is accompanied by evolution in transporter substrate specificity.</p><p>Here we identify the first cyanogenic glucoside transporter in cassava and the first indole-specific glucosinolate transporter in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. By characterizing substrate specificity and electrogenicity in orthologs along the phylogenetic lineage from cassava to <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, we provide a model for the evolutionary path of the substrate specificity of a plant specialized metabolite transporter. Surprisingly, we show that glucosinolate transport capacity likely occurred prior to the emergence of glucosinolate biosynthesis in dual-specificity transporters of cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates. With the emergence of glucosinolate biosynthesis, the transporters lost the capacity to transport cyanogenic glucosides. Moreover, we show that the first glucosinolate transporters had broad specificity and later subfunctionalized towards specific classes of glucosinolates. Our data suggests that changes in electrogenicity have accompanied the evolutionary changes in substrate specificity. Our results exemplify how new transporter substrate specificities evolve when new metabolites arise.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of an indole-specific glucosinolate transporter</title><p>To assess the evolutionary path of GTR transporters, we first set out to identify the putative indole-specific glucosinolate transporter. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nour-Eldin et al., 2012</xref>), we found that the glucosinolate transport capability of the NPF family is confined to the NPF2.8–2.14 transporters that cluster closely with AtGTR1 (NPF2.10) and AtGTR2 (NPF2.11). We thus hypothesized that the indole-specific glucosinolate transporter could be found in this NPF subclade in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Via heterologous expression in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, we screened six of the seven members within this subclade for transport of indol-3-yl-methyl glucosinolate (I3M, the simplest indole glucosinolate) and 4-methylthiobutyl glucosinolate (4MTB) – representing a highly abundant aliphatic glucosinolate in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). NPF2.9 (At1g18880, hereafter GTR3) - the closest homolog of GTR1 and GTR2 - transported I3M effectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Two Electrode Voltage Clamp (TEVC) electrophysiology and time-course uptake assays showed that I3M, but not 4MTB, induces negative currents in GTR3-expressing oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>) and that GTR3 can over-accumulate I3M, but not 4MTB, against a concentration gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Alternatively, an un-coupled conductance may accompany 4MTB transport in GTR3 resulting in non-electrogenic transport or transport rates may be below the electrophysiological detection level. In comparison, GTR1 over-accumulated both 4MTB and I3M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>) and elicited negative currents of similar amplitude for both glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19466.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of the indole-specific glucosinolate transporter GTR3 in the NPF family.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bayesian inference (MrBayes) tree (s.d.&lt; 0.01) of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> NPF family with reduced phylogenies of NPF1.x, NPF3.x, NPF4.x, NPF5.x, NPF6.x, NPF7.x, NPF8.x and NPF2.1–7 clades (x denotes the subfamily number) as previously annotated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Léran et al., 2014</xref>).

Analysis of heterografted plants with no glucosinolate biosynthesis in the root showed that only small amounts of indole glucosinolates are transported from rosette to root. Similarly, it was evident from the (qko/wt) heterografts that when all three GTRs are expressed in the root, the root to rosette transport is below detection levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, when all three GTRs are knocked out in roots, we see a dramatic increase in the rosette indole glucosinolate content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

All transporters described below were codon optimized for expression in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes and tested for transport activity in their native form (i.e. without tag). Additionally, we fused each gene to YFP in the C-terminus and confirmed its expression and localization to the plasmamembrane via confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the following, lack of transport can therefore likely be attributed to lack of activity rather than lack of expression. Within the GTR1 and GTR3 subclades, we tested one of the respective orthologs from <italic>B. rapa</italic> and showed a strong preference for I3M by the tested BrGTR3 ortholog (BrH02396), whereas the tested BrGTR1 ortholog (BrF01711) transported 4MTB and I3M with similar efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, the high preference for indole glucosinolates appears typical for GTR3 orthologs within the <italic>Brassicales</italic>-specific GTR3 subclade. Oocytes expressing GTR-like transporters from <italic>C. papaya</italic> over-accumulate both 4MTB and I3M relative to the assay media concentration and we named them <italic>CARICA PAPAYA</italic> Glucosinolate Transporter LIKE-1 (CpGTRL1) and −2 (CpGTRL2), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The ability of CpGTRL1 and −2 to transport both 4MTB and I3M is surprising as indole glucosinolates are found in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>B. rapa</italic>, but not in <italic>C. papaya</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mithen et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, CpGTRL2 from C. papaya transported 4MTB with a k<sub>m</sub> of 85 ± 12 µM at −60 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This indicates that the high affinity of GTRs towards glucosinolates evolved before the diversification of the <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> and <italic>Caricaceae</italic>. Moreover, the data imply that the common ancestor of the GTR transporters was originally broad-specific and that GTR3 lost the ability to over-accumulate aliphatic glucosinolates after the divergence of <italic>C. papaya</italic> and the ancestor of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Brassica</italic> (~72.1 MYA, median of 8 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hedges et al., 2006</xref>]).

Hence, as cassava does not synthesize glucosinolates, the ability to transport glucosinolate appears to have arisen in the NPF family prior to the evolution of the glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, the characterization of this potentially ancestral form of the glucosinolate transporters support that they first evolved with broad specificity towards aliphatic and indole glucosinolates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Co-evolution of transporter substrate specificity and substrate biosynthesis</title><p>Glucosinolates and cyanogenic glucosides are structurally distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), yet they share functional moieties (glucose moiety and amino acid-derived side chains) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bak et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clausen et al., 2015</xref>). Based on this and the existence of a transporter in cassava with glucosinolate transport capacity, we explored whether the glucosinolate NPF transporters may have evolved from cyanogenic glucoside transporters within the NPF family, much like glucosinolates evolved from cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bak et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clausen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mithen et al., 2010</xref>). To test this hypothesis we investigated the ability of selected GTRs and GTR-like homologs to transport representative cyanogenic glucosides, namely phenylalanine-derived prunasin and valine-derived linamarin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Notably, cassava produces only cyanogenic glucosides whereas <italic>C. papaya</italic> produces both cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates (derived from phenylalanine). Oocytes expressing the glucosinolate transporters from <italic>C. papaya</italic>, <italic>B. rapa</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> did not accumulate the tested cyanogenic glucosides above trace amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

This indicates that the substrate-binding cavity of this NPF transporter can accommodate both cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates. As Me14G074000 transports both compound classes, we propose that this transporter may represent a transition phase where specificity for cyanogenic glucosides is partially lost in favor of glucosinolate transport.

We tested this hypothesis by measuring transport activity of the six closest homologs of Me14G074000 from cassava (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The closest homolog, Me14G074100, appears truncated (data not shown) with only five transmembrane-spanning domains but was nevertheless included in our analysis. All six transporters were tested for transport activity in their native form. Additionally, we fused YFP to the C-terminus of each gene to validate expression. Native Me14G074100, Me01G191900, Me09G097200, and Me17G124600 did not result in uptake of 4MTB, I3M, prunasin or linamarin. Among the YFP-tagged transporters, only Me14G074100 and Me09G097200 did not express in the oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), and hence we cannot conclude whether these two transporters are inactive. Uptake of prunasin was detected in oocytes expressing Me15G176100 at levels similar to or slightly lower than the suggested ‘transition’ transporter (Me14G074000) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In contrast, Me15G180400 strongly over-accumulated prunasin and linamarin to more than 12 and 8 times the media level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) while uptake of both aliphatic and indole glucosinolates by this transporter was negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, Me15G180400 is specific towards cyanogenic glucosides. We named Me15G180400 MANIHOT ESCULENTA CYANOGENIC GLUCOSIDE TRANSPORTER-1 (MeCGTR1) and to the best of our knowledge, it represents the first identification of an importer of cyanogenic glucosides. TEVC electrophysiology assays showed that prunasin and linamarin induce negative currents in MeCGTR1-expressing oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Kinetic analysis of MeCGTR1 showed that this protein transports prunasin and linamarin with a K<sub>m</sub> of 80 ± 7 µM and 262 ± 15 µM, respectively, measured at a membrane potential clamped to −60 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). This indicates that MeCGTR1 is a high-affinity, cyanogenic glucoside-specific transporter and shows that it is capable of over-accumulating against a concentration gradient. The existence of MeCGTR1 supports our hypothesis that the dual-specific Me14G074000 represents a ‘transition’ transporter evolutionarily positioned between cyanogenic glucoside-specific (MeCGTR1) and glucosinolate-specific transporters (GTR1–3 and GTRL1–2). The identification and close phylogenetic relationship of glucosinolate-specific, dual-specific and cyanogenic glucoside-specific transporters within the NPF supports that glucosinolate transporters evolved from cyanogenic glucoside NPF transporters.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Is evolution of new substrate specificity in the NPF accompanied by changes in transporter electrogenicity?</title><p>Most characterized members of the SLC15/PepT/POT/NPF family are symporters that function by an electrogenic proton-coupled transport mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nour-Eldin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Parker and Newstead, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fei et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Steel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mackenzie et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fei et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Solcan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiang et al., 2004</xref>), that is, symport of protons generates a net influx of positive charge that can be measured as a negative current by TEVC. Characterization of the transporters identified in this study by both LCMS- and TEVC-based transport assays enabled us to investigate the evolution of electrogenicity of glucosinolate and cyanogenic glucoside transporters. Previously, we showed that AtGTR1 and −2 mediated transport of 4MTB induces negative currents as a result of net inward movement of protons during transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nour-Eldin et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, we show that negative currents are also induced by both AtGTR1 and −2 when exposed to I3M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This indicates that AtGTR1 and −2 transport 4MTB and I3M – two negatively charged glucosinolates with different amino acid side chains- via a similar electrogenic transport mechanism. Similarly, the tested GTR1 ortholog from <italic>B. rapa</italic> (BrGTR1) also induced negative currents when exposed to 4MTB or I3M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In comparison, AtGTR3 and the GTR3 ortholog from <italic>B. rapa</italic> (BrGTR3) only induced currents when exposed to I3M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). No detectable currents were induced by 4MTB in neither AtGTR3 nor BrGTR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, it appears that electrogenic transport of - and the ability to upconcentrate - 4MTB is a property that distinguishes the GTR1 clade from the GTR3 clade. Similarly, exposure to cyanogenic glucosides did not induce currents in the putative transition transporter, Me14G074000; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In comparison, MeCGTR1 induced negative currents when exposed to the non-charged prunasin and linamarin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This suggests that transport of these two cyanogenic glucosides by MeCGTR1 is coupled to a net influx of cationic species and that transport of cyanogenic glucosides by MeCGTR1 and Me14G074000 appears to differ with respect to electrogenicity.</p><p>Identification of the phylogenetically more basal glucosinolate transporters in <italic>C. papaya</italic> and cassava allowed us to investigate when electrogenic glucosinolate transport may have evolved. From the GTR-like clade, the glucosinolate transporting CpGTRL1 and CpGTRL2 induced currents when exposed to 4MTB or I3M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) whereas Me14G074000 from cassava did not induce detectable currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>). All three transporters were able to upconcentrate both glucosinolates against their respective concentration gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that the glucosinolate transport mechanism first arose as a non-electrogenic mechanism that later evolved to become electrogenic. Moreover, electrogenic transport appears not to be a prerequisite for the ability to over-accumulate glucosinolates. Previously, we showed that negative currents induced by AtGTR1 and AtGTR2 when exposed to the negatively charged glucosinolates, reflect a glucosinolate to proton stoichiometry of 1 ≤ 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nour-Eldin et al., 2012</xref>). Substrate-dependent variation in transport coupling stoichiometry between substrate and protons has been shown to depend on the length of the oligo-peptide substrate for PepT<sub>So</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Parker and Newstead, 2014</xref>). The non-electrogenic transport by Me14G074000 could indicate a different proton to glucosinolate stoichiometry compared to that of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> orthologs. For example, the lack of detectable currents may be caused by an equal amount of negative and positive charges moving across the membrane during the transport cycle. This would suggest that changes in transporter substrate specificity for a given substrate are accompanied by changes in transporter electrogenicity. However, we cannot exclude that the lack of currents for Me14G074000 is caused by currents below detection limits or that co-transport of other ions may be ´masking´ the coupled transport by Me14G074000. Nevertheless, the absence of induced currents by Me14G074000 indicates that transport of glucosinolates became electrogenic after the divergence of cassava and <italic>C. papaya</italic>.</p><p>We believe that these genes provide a suitable model system for future studies that will investigate if the observed changes in transporter electrogenicities are caused by changes in coupling stoichiometry. This will lead to a mechanistic understanding of how substrate specificity and coupling stoichiometries co-evolve within the NPF family.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A model for an evolutionary path of transporter substrate specificity</title><p>Based on our findings we propose a model for the evolutionary path of glucosinolate transporter substrate specificity in the NPF family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). By tracking the evolution of GTR transporter specificity towards glucosinolates, we propose that a duplication event introduced permissive mutations in a high affinity, electrogenic transporter of the ancestral cyanogenic glucosides (represented here by MeCGTR1) to generate a ‘transition’ transporter with broad, non-electrogenic glucosinolate specificity and non-electrogenic cyanogenic glucoside specificity (represented by Me14G074000) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). With the advent of glucosinolate biosynthesis and through further duplication and evolutionary divergence, our data suggests that the dual-specificity transporter lost its cyanogenic glucoside transport capacity and became a high affinity, electrogenic broad-specific glucosinolate transporter (represented by BrGTR1, AtGTRs, CpGTRL1 and CpGTRL2). The retainment of Me14G074000 in the cassava genome indicates that it may fulfill an important role in transport of cyanogenic glucosides despite its inferior transport properties compared to Me15G180400. Alternatively, its retainment could be explained by specificity towards other yet unidentified substrates. Presently, we can also not exclude that Me14G074000 represents an ancestral non-electrogenic, multi-specificity transporter, which through duplication and subfunctionalization gave rise to the electrogenic transporters with high affinity for cyanogenic glucosides (represented by MeCGTR1) and later for glucosinolates (represented by CpGTRL1, CpGTRL2, BrGTR1 and AtGTRs), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Further subfunctionalization within the GTR clade led to the evolution of the GTR3 subclade identified as transporters with preference and high affinity for indole glucosinolate. Thus, the subfunctionalization within the GTRs from broad to narrow specificity is contrary to the evolutionary dynamics proposed previously for substrate-transport evolution, where progenitor transporters had a narrow substrate specificity that expanded during evolution to become increasingly broad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lionarons et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19466.025</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of the evolution of the glucosinolate NPF transporter specificity.</title><p>We propose that diversification of an ancestral high-affinity cyanogenic glucoside transporter (exemplified by MeCGTR1) lead to a dual-specificity transporter capable of transporting both cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates (exemplified by Me14G074000).

Hence, it is possible to discuss the substrate specificities determined in the present study in a structural context by analysing the amino acid residues that are key for substrate interaction. We constructed an alignment comprising the sequence of AtNPF6.3, the crystalized bacterial POTs and the glucosinolate and cyanogenic glucoside transporters investigated in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). From the structural studies on bacterial POTs and NPF6.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Solcan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Parker and Newstead, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aduri et al., 2015</xref>), the key substrate interacting amino acid residues were compiled, numbered P1-P13 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and located in the alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we constructed homology models using the recent structure of NPF6.3 as a template and depicted amino acid positions P1-P13 within the models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> inserts). Analysis of AtGTR1, AtGTR3, Me14g074000 and MeCGTR1 homology models showed the P1-P13 residues to be exposed to the central substrate binding cavity of the transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and therefore to constitute candidates for substrate specificity determining residues. Five residues (P1-P3, P8 and P13) were conserved in all genes in the alignment. These constitute the EXXE[R/K] motif that has an indispensable role in proton coupling (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Solcan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aduri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jørgensen et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that the proton coupling mechanism is conserved regardless of the substrate specificity of a NPF transporter. Amino acid positions P7 and P9 are conserved respectively as asparagine and threonine across the GTR and cyanogenic glucoside transporters, whereas they are glycine and asparagine residues in POT transporters and phenylalanine and asparagine residues in NPF6.3. The only moiety shared between glucosinolates and cyanogenic glucosides is the glucose moiety. Thus, P7 and P9 could be involved in the interaction with the glucose moiety (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Amino acid positions P10-P12 are not conserved across the GTRs, NPF6.3 and the POT transporters and the mutational pattern does not correlate to the changes we have seen in substrate specificity. Consequently, the role of these residues remains unclear. In contrast, amino acid positions P4, P5 and P6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> inserts) show a conservation pattern that is consistent with the changes in substrate specificity shown in this study. This indicates that position P4, P5 and P6 may contribute to determining the substrate specificity of glucosinolate and cyanogenic glucoside transporters. Despite recent advances in understanding substrate specificity of peptide transporters (as outlined above), nothing is currently known about amino acid changes that determine transporter substrate specificity from an evolutionary perspective. Our work provides a framework for future studies to determine the amino acid changes that leads to substrate specificity changes during evolution of metabolite transporters.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19466.026</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Putative substrate binding site of GTR1, GTR3, Me14g74000 and MeCGTR1.</title><p>Homology modeling of GTR1, GTR3, Me14g74000 and MecGTR1 was carried out using NPF6.3 as template (see Materials and methods for details).

Towards understanding the evolutionary paths that lead to new transporter substrate specificities, we show that before a substrate emerges, transporter specificity for the substrate may be present in transporters of chemically similar, more ancient substrates. As new substrates emerges (in this case glucosinolates), gene duplications allows such multifunctional transporters to diversify through subfunctionalization into transporters with greater specificity for the new substrate.</p><p>Thus, our findings support one model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bridgham et al., 2006</xref>) to the problem posed by the classical evolution model – about how a new function (here transporter substrate specificity) can be selected for unless the substrate is there. We propose that redundant ancestral transporters created by gene duplication remain active due to a multifunctional specificity. When the new substrate emerges these ancestral transporters can be recruited and evolve into transporters with greater specificity for the new compound. Moreover, from a mechanistic perspective, our data suggests that the evolution of new substrate specificities in coupled secondary transporters is accompanied by changes in the electrogenic properties of the transport mechanism. Unraveling the structural determinants underpinning stoichiometry and binding of substrate constitutes a new frontier for understanding the birth and development of new transporter substrate specificities at the molecular level.

All homology models were validated using PROCHECK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laskowski et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Homology models were embedded into a pre-equilibrated phosphatidyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer in a periodic boundary condition box with pre-equilibrated Simple Point Charge (SPC) water molecules in addition to Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions corresponding to a 150 mM buffer. Each system was subjected to a conjugate gradient energy minimization and relaxed by short molecular dynamics simulations (MDs) using the default ‘Relax model system’ protocol implemented in Desmond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowers et al., 2006</xref>) followed by 20 ns of MDs with periodic boundary conditions. A restriction was applied to the secondary structure of the transporters using a spring constant force of 0.5 kcal × mol<sup>−1</sup> × Å<sup>−2</sup>. The simulation temperature was set to 300K, and both temperature and pressure were kept constant during the MDs (NPT ensemble simulation) using the Nose-Hoover chain thermostat method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martyna et al., 1992</xref>) and the Martyna-Tobias-Klein barostat method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martyna et al., 1994</xref>). Coordinates were stored every 2 fs. The MDs were run on a GPU computing cluster at the University of Talca, Chile, using 1 GPU GeForce GTX 980 for each simulation. The root-mean square deviations (RMSD) of the position for all backbone atoms of the models from their initial configuration as a function of simulation time are illustrated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. All models were equilibrated after 4 ns of MDs (except AtGTR3, which reached equilibrium around 7 ns). The RMSD values remain within 4 Å for all models, demonstrating the conformational stability of the transporter structures.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19466.029</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Root-mean square deviations (RMSD) of the position for all backbone atoms of the models 579 from their initial configuration as a function of simulation time.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19466-fig9-v3.tif"/></fig><p>To determine the intracellular cavity/channel we used 3V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Voss and Gerstein, 2010</xref>) via the web interface found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://3vee.molmovdb.org">http://3vee.molmovdb.org</ext-link>.</p><p>VMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>) was used for visualizing and displaying homology models and cavity/channel.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Prof. Michael Broberg Palmgren and Prof. Daniel J Kliebenstein are thanked for help with phylogenetic analyses, critical reading and constructive comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Markus Geisler (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In the manuscript, the authors explore potential evolution of substrate specificity in glucosinolate transporters (belonging to SLC15 family) in relation to the evolution of the corresponding metabolic pathways. They found that the evolution of the specificity for glucosinolates from earlier transporters of cyanogenic glucosides proceeded through a broad specificity transporter, capable of transporting both type of substrates. Once glucosinoalte specificity emerged, some of the family members became more narrowly specialized for specific glucosinolates. Interestingly, during evolutionary transition of the specificity from cyanogenic glucosides to glucosinolates, the broad-specificity transporter showed non-electrogenic transport of cyanogenic glucosides, which contrasts with both earlier and later members, which all showed proton-driven transport.</p><p>The reviewers found the work interesting, original and of considerable potential impact. High quality of experimental work was pointed out. Unfortunately, a number of significant issues have been identified that seem to be essential to for the conclusions that the authors draw.</p><p>Key issues:</p><p>1) The key point of the paper seems to be that Me14G074000 is the transition stage between transporters specific for cyanogenic gluocosides and glucosinlates. Could it be that Me14G074000 has an entirely different &quot;native&quot; substrate? It is odd that in a family of H-coupled transporters, there would be one that takes up relevant substrate, cyanogenic glucoside in a non-coupled manner. The authors suggest that cassava contains another transporter that would be specific for cyanogenic glucosides, while the Me14G074000 is a &quot;transition&quot; transporter. If so, a closely related specific transporter should be easily identified. The authors should attempt to find it.</p><p>2) At least negative (preferably all) transport data need to be confirmed by expression analyses, such as a simple western and/or confocal analyses. This is in the transport field standard as absence of transport can have many reasons (such as no expression or miss-targeting etc.), while high transport rates can be simply caused by higher expression levels. For example, an important conclusion that the transporter from cacao does not transport glucosinolates is based on simple lack of activity, which is not convincing in the absence of expression analysis or a positive control, showing that this transporter transports its native substrate.</p><p>3) The study includes phylogenetic analysis but omits any detail about specific residue changes between these transporters that could and should account for their biochemical differences. Given the recent structure of the NRT1.1 homologue and bacterial POT family members, the authors should examine the amino acid sequence changes between their characterized homologues and put these changes into structural perspective. They should discuss their findings in light of known conserved motifs.</p><p>4) The authors should interpret their results in structural perspective, perhaps mapping the amino acid differences on a structural model of the transporter and discuss potential substrate-binding site. We point out that in the NRT1.1 structural paper some of the key amino acids differing between NRT1.1 and distantly related bacterial peptide transporters were identified. Perhaps, these would be helpful in examining differences between GRTs and closely related transporters.</p><p>5) The proton coupling mechanism of GTR3 in uptake of 4MTB is unclear. From the apparent lack of currents it can be concluded that the uptake is coupled to 1 proton, but the substrate concentrations used in this experiment (Figure 2A) are very low. How will the currents look like at higher 4MTB concentrations, where the uptake is more significant? Substrate-dependent currents should be examined and coupling mechanism should be established as it is very surprising that the mechanism seems to be 1:1 yet there is no accumulation in Figure 2D. Could the reversal potentials be used to better establish the coupling stoichiometry in these and other transporters examined in the study?</p><p>6) The finding that GTRL1/2 from Carica papaya transports both 4MTB and I3M is surprising and used as argument for the concept that glucosinolate transporter specificity arose from broad to narrow. Also, analysis of Me14G074000 from Cassava that transport both 4MTB and I3M supports this assumption. While we understand why these organisms have been chosen, we feel hat their individual choice and the number of tested transporters and species (here only 1 each) is too small to fully support these very important conclusions. We suggest including at least a second transporter from a similar but distant organism.</p><p>7) A broader literature review is needed to discuss what is known in the field of evolution regarding development of novel specificities. This has previously been examined for hormone receptors, for example, in great detail.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Origin and evolution of transporter substrate specificity within the NPF family&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>After additional discussion, we feel that the authors have not sufficiently addressed the key issue 2) of the original review. We would argue that based on the data presented, it is not possible to make definitive statements about stoichiometry of transport. Specifically, we think that the presence of concentrative transport is clearly indicative of ion-coupled transport. Such concentrative transport is demonstrated for the uptake of glucosinolates by Me14G0176100 (Figure 5B) as well as by GTR1s and GTR3s (I3M). In contrast, transport of cyanogenic glucosides by Me14G0176100 is not concentrative (Figure 6 A and C). Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that it is not ion-coupled. However, the presence or absence of current is difficult to interpret based on the reported relatively preliminary electrophysiology experiments. For example, the observed current might be due to an uncoupled conductance that accompanies coupled transport and not due to stoichiometry of &gt;2H<sup>+</sup> per substrate. In that regard, we note that GTR1s and Me14G0176100 accumulate glucosinolates to a similar extent. Would not one expect GTR1s to concentrate substrates to a greater extent than Me14G0176100 if they operated with higher proton: substrate stoichiometry? Furthermore, the absence of current might be simply a consequence of slow rate of transport that would not allow detection of the ion flux. More detailed studies would need to be conducted to resolve these questions. We recognize that these go beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We urge the authors to re-evaluate their conclusions on the coupling mechanisms and to re-formulate them in more speculative, hypothetical terms.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>It seems to me the authors have not actually addressed key issue 1. This does weaken the strength of the implications made about the significance of the study and retention of Me14g74000 as a transition transporter.</p><p>Key issue 2. My hunch is that Me14g74000 is proton coupled, as it contains all the necessary residues identified in POT family transporters – namely P1, 2, 3 and P13 as described here. It is certainly possible that a change in substrate specificity would be accompanied by a change in stoichiometry. It would have been satisfying if further experimental evidence was provided to support this hypothesis, as this could be an important factor in the evolution of the binding site and transporters. However, I can see that this would increase the remit of the study beyond identification.</p><p>The inclusion of the structural comparison definately improves the manuscript and now allows the reader to appreciate the changes made to the binding site that differentiate the cyanogenic glucosides from the glucosinolates. It is frustrating that these cannot be narrowed further, but this is, again, likely beyond the scope of the present study. Incidently, P13 is likely not involved in peptide specificity but in proton translocation, as it is also essential for NRT1.1 function. The structural figures are perhaps a little confusing – I would have opted for an overlay.</p><p>Overall the manuscript is much improved, although I am not sure it provides certainty as to the ultimate conclusions drawn on the evolution of the NPF family. I have no major objections and think the study does explore an interesting aspect of transporter evolution.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for re-submitting your article &quot;Origin and evolution of transporter substrate specificity within the NPF family&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by the Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor feels that the concerns raised during the last round of review were not addressed. Specifically, the reviewers and the editor argued that the presence or absence of currents cannot be used conclusively to determine the stoichiometry of transport. They have suggested that the corresponding section of the manuscript was rewritten in more speculative terms. However, the revised manuscript contains more definitive description of stoichiometry, which the Reviewing Editor deems inappropriate. Moreover, the new version seems to contain erroneous statements. For example, in one case the authors write: &quot;[…]the apparent coupling stoichiometry changes specifically to 1:1 for aliphatic glucosinolates (no 4MTB over-accumulation, no induced currents)[…]&quot;. This does not seem to make sense. If there is 1:1 coupling, there should be concentrative transport and over-accumulation. We again urge the authors to rewrite the paragraph in less definitive more speculative terms and remove the corresponding stoichiometry table, which, in our opinion, over-interprets the data. If the authors disagree with us, we would like to hear their arguments as the letter accompanying the re-submitted manuscript does contain any discussion of the concerns raised by the reviewers and the Editor.</p><p>We ordinarily do not allow multiple rounds of review and revision thus this will be your final opportunity to provide an acceptable response to the Reviewing Editor's request.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19466.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers found the work interesting, original and of considerable potential impact.

Could it be that Me14G074000 has an entirely different &quot;native&quot; substrate?</italic> </p><p>Reviewer is correct in that Me14g74000 may transport other substrates and we acknowledge the need to explicitly state this in the text. We have added the following sentence: “It cannot be excluded that Me14g74000 also transports other substrates. An alternative substrate could explain why Me14g74000 is retained in the cassava genome.”</p><p><italic>It is odd that in a family of H-coupled transporters, there would be one that takes up relevant substrate, cyanogenic glucoside in a non-coupled manner.</italic> </p><p>We agree that alternative explanations for the lack of currents are possible. Our first explanation suggested that cyanogenic glucoside binding alone is enough to induce conformational changes that flip the transporter and release the substrate into the cytoplasm. Alternatively, it could be speculated that a proton (or another cation) and an unidentified anion are co-transported with the cyanogenic glucoside. This alternative explanation is now included in the text:</p><p>“However, we cannot exclude that a pair of cations and anions are co-transported along with the cyanogenic glucoside, which would result in non-electrogenic yet coupled transport of cyanogenic glucosides. Thus, our data suggests that the change in substrate specificity from cyanogenic glucosides to glucosinolates was accompanied by a change in coupling stoichiometry between cyanogenic glucosides to cations, possibly from 1≤1 to 1:0.”</p><p>The authors suggest that cassava contains another transporter that would be specific for cyanogenic glucosides, while the Me14G074000 is a &quot;transition&quot; transporter. If so, a closely related specific transporter should be easily identified. The authors should attempt to find it.</p><p>We indeed proposed this hypothesis, where it reads:</p><p>“If Me14G074000 represents such a transition phase from cyanogenic glucoside to glucosinolate transport, we hypothesized that the genome of the cyanogenic glucoside-producing cassava also encodes a GTR-like NPF transporter that is specific for cyanogenic glucosides. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the transport activity of the six closest homologs of Me14G074000 from cassava (Figure 6B-C and Figure 6—figure supplement 2)”</p><p>We identify and characterize this transporter in Figure 6C-E. However, when we re-read this section we realize that this information may have been too convoluted within a large amount of data described. To make the findings and conclusion clearer we have reorganized the section to read as follows:</p><p>“If Me14G074000 represents such a ‘transition’ transporter between cyanogenic glucoside-specific to glucosinolate-specific transporter, we hypothesized that the genome of the cyanogenic glucoside-producing cassava also encodes a GTR-like NPF transporter that is specific for cyanogenic glucosides. […] Thus, the identification and close phylogenetic relationship of glucosinolate-specific, dual-specific and cyanogenic glucoside-specific transporters within the NPF strongly supports that glucosinolate transporters evolved from cyanogenic glucoside NPF transporters.”</p><p><italic>2) At least negative (preferably all) transport data need to be confirmed by expression analyses, such as a simple western and/or confocal analyses. This is in the transport field standard as absence of transport can have many reasons (such as no expression or miss-targeting etc.), while high transport rates can be simply caused by higher expression levels. For example, an important conclusion that the transporter from cacao does not transport glucosinolates is based on simple lack of activity, which is not convincing in the absence of expression analysis or a positive control, showing that this transporter transports its native substrate.</italic> </p><p>To accommodate reviewer’s request we have YFP-tagged all transporters tested in figure 5 and 6 in the C-terminus and investigated expression using confocal microscopy. This data is included in two new figures: Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1. The new data shows that expression was detected in all but two transporters among the cassava genes tested for cyanogenic glucoside transport in Figure 6. Our main conclusions, however, are based on transporters that are expressed. We have incorporated the new data in several locations in the text.</p><p>In subsection “Rise and evolution of glucosinolate transport specificity” we added the following text:</p><p>“To track the rise and evolution of glucosinolate substrate specificity we tested a range of transporters for glucosinolate transport activity via expression in X. laevis oocytes. All transporters described below were expressed and tested for transport activity in their native form. Additionally, each gene was fused to YFP in the C-terminus and its expression and localization to the plasmamembrane confirmed via confocal microscopy (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). In the following, lack of transport is therefore likely attributed to lack of activity rather than lack of expression.”</p><p>In the same subsection we added the following text:</p><p>“Oocytes expressing Me14G074000 from cassava over-accumulated both 4MTB and I3M relative to external media, while the expressed GTR homolog from cacao did not transport any glucosinolates (Figure 5B, Figure 5—figure supplement 3 and Figure 5—figure supplement 2).”</p><p>Subsection “Co-evolution of transporter substrate specificity and substrate biosynthesis” we added the following text:</p><p>”All six transporters were tested for transport activity in their native form. Additionally, we fused YFP to the C-terminus of each gene to validate expression.”</p><p>In the same subsection we added the following text:</p><p>“Among the YFP-tagged transporters only Me14G074100 and Me09G097200 did not express in the oocytes (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), and hence we cannot conclude whether these two transporters are inactive. Uptake of prunasin was detected in oocytes expressing Me15G176100 at levels similar to or slightly inferior to the suggested ‘transition’ transporter (Me14G074000) (Figure 6C).”</p><p><italic>3) The study includes phylogenetic analysis but omits any detail about specific residue changes between these transporters that could and should account for their biochemical differences. Given the recent structure of the NRT1.1 homologue and bacterial POT family members, the authors should examine the amino acid sequence changes between their characterized homologues and put these changes into structural perspective. They should discuss their findings in light of known conserved motifs.</italic> </p><p>This issue is related to issue 6. We address them both in the answer under issue 6.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should interpret their results in structural perspective, perhaps mapping the amino acid differences on a structural model of the transporter and discuss potential substrate-binding site. We point out that in the NRT1.1 structural paper some of the key amino acids differing between NRT1.1 and distantly related bacterial peptide transporters were identified. Perhaps, these would be helpful in examining differences between GRTs and closely related transporters.</italic> </p><p>To address reviewers’ comments we have constructed homology models using the recent structure of NPF6.3 as a template. In addition, we compiled a list of amino acid residues predicted to be key for substrate binding in structural studies on bacterial POT transporters and NPF6.3. The corresponding residues were located and numbered P1-P13 in an alignment comprising NPF6.3, POT transporters and the glucosinolate and cyanogenic glucoside transporters investigated in this study (Table 1 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1). We use the models and the alignment to discuss the measured substrate specificities in the current study in a structure function context. This is described in a new paragraph that we suggest to insert as a last paragraph before the conclusion:</p><p>“Structural perspectives on glucosinolate and cyanogenic glucoside substrate specificity</p><p>The large plant NPF family is homologous to the SLC15/PepT/PTR/POT families in bacteria and animals (Mansy et al., 2008,, Deamer and Dworkin, 2005). Several bacterial POTs (Weng, Philippe and Noel, 2012; Saier and Ren, 2006 and Ohno, 2013) and one plant NPF homolog (AtNPF6.3) (Fani and Fondi, 2009 and Prasad et al., 2012) have been crystalized along with their substrates. […] Our work provides a framework for future studies that seek to determine the amino acid changes that leads to substrate specificity changes during evolution of metabolite transporters.”</p><p><italic>5) The proton coupling mechanism of GTR3 in uptake of 4MTB is unclear. From the apparent lack of currents it can be concluded that the uptake is coupled to 1 proton, but the substrate concentrations used in this experiment (Figure 2A) are very low. How will the currents look like at higher 4MTB concentrations, where the uptake is more significant? Substrate-dependent currents should be examined and coupling mechanism should be established as it is very surprising that the mechanism seems to be 1:1 yet there is no accumulation in Figure 2D. Could the reversal potentials be used to better establish the coupling stoichiometry in these and other transporters examined in the study?</italic> </p><p>We respectfully disagree with this comment stating that the substrate concentrations used in the experiment shown in Figure 2Ais very low. Actually it is high when compared to the Km. We determined the Km of AtGTR1 and AtGTR2 to be ~20µM towards both 4MTB and I3M (this study and (<italic>10</italic>)). Similarly, GTR3s Km towards I3M is ~20µM. Thus, the tested concentrations are 10-fold higher than the Km towards the known substrates. Furthermore, we see clearly defined substrate-induced currents (20% of maximal current) when the substrate concentrations are as low as 10µM for all three transporters. However, no currents are seen for GTR3 even at 200µM 4MTB. The glucosinolate concentrations measured in apoplastic fluid of wildtype Arabidopsis plants was previously estimated to be approximately 0.01 nmol/µl (<italic>11</italic>). Thus, at 200 µM we should be well above the physiological range of glucosinolate concentrations in the apoplastic space.</p><p>We previously explored the possibility of determining the reversal potentials as a means to determine the exact substrate to proton stoichiometry (supplemental data in (Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2010)). However, the theoretical reversal potential are calculated to be &gt; +200mV, making it not feasible to use this approach.</p><p><italic>6) The finding that GTRL1/2 from Carica papaya transports both 4MTB and I3M is surprising and used as argument for the concept that glucosinolate transporter specificity arose from broad to narrow. Also, analysis of Me14G074000 from Cassava that transport both 4MTB and I3M supports this assumption. While we understand why these organisms have been chosen, we feel hat their individual choice and the number of tested transporters and species (here only 1 each) is too small to fully support these very important conclusions. We suggest including at least a second transporter from a similar but distant organism.</italic> </p><p>We are happy that reviewer appreciates the experimental design and choice of organisms. We have in this study already shown that two transporters from Carica papaya (and not only one as indicated by reviewer) displayed broad specificity towards glucosinolates. In addition, we showed that a third transporter (Me14g74000) from a similar but distant (more basal) organism (cassava) also displayed broad specificity towards glucosinolates. We therefore believe that we already have provided the data requested by reviewer and that the substrate specificity of the selected transporters provide sufficiently strong evidence to support our claims. It should be noted that to generate these data we tested 6 homologs from <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, two homologs from B. rapa, 8 homologs from cassava, three from C. papaya and one from T. cacao (total of 20 genes tested).</p><p>Lastly, we would also like to emphasize that we are cautious in phrasing our claims regarding the evolution of the “narrowness” of substrate specificity towards glucosinolates. For example in of the manuscript:</p><p>“Thus, the data imply that the common ancestor of the GTR transporters was originally broad-specific and that GTR3 lost the ability to over-accumulate aliphatic glucosinolates after the divergence of C. papaya and the ancestor of Arabidopsis and Brassica (~ 72.1 MYA, median of 8 studies)”.</p><p><italic>7) A broader literature review is needed to discuss what is known in the field of evolution regarding development of novel specificities. This has previously been examined for hormone receptors, for example, in great detail.</italic> </p><p>We have included a broadened literature review of what is known in the field of substrate specificity evolution with emphasis on the evolution of hormone receptors. We added the following paragraph:</p><p>“However, the evolutionary path that leads to the rise of new transporter substrate specificity upon emergence of new metabolites is unknown. Classical evolution theory (Halkier and Gershenzon, 2006) and several studies (e.g. (Bak, Nielsen and Halkier, 1998),(Clausen et al., 2015))) support the hypothesis that new enzyme functions arise in duplicated genes if they are subject to unique selection pressure, – alternatively they rapidly become pseudogenes. […] It is, therefore, not clear if new transporters evolve de novo with emergence of new substrates, or whether gene duplications allow ancestral multifunctional proteins to take on greater specificity (Züst et al., 2012).”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>After additional discussion, we feel that the authors have not sufficiently addressed the key issue 2) of the original review. We would argue that based on the data presented, it is not possible to make definitive statements about stoichiometry of transport. Specifically, we think that the presence of concentrative transport is clearly indicative of ion-coupled transport. Such concentrative transport is demonstrated for the uptake of glucosinolates by Me14G0176100 (Figure 5B) as well as by GTR1s and GTR3s (I3M). In contrast, transport of cyanogenic glucosides by Me14G0176100 is not concentrative (Figure 6 A and C). Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that it is not ion-coupled. However, the presence or absence of current is difficult to interpret based on the reported relatively preliminary electrophysiology experiments. For example, the observed current might be due to an uncoupled conductance that accompanies coupled transport and not due to stoichiometry of &gt;2H<sup>+</sup> per substrate. In that regard, we note that GTR1s and Me14G0176100 accumulate glucosinolates to a similar extent. Would not one expect GTR1s to concentrate substrates to a greater extent than Me14G0176100 if they operated with higher proton: substrate stoichiometry? Furthermore, the absence of current might be simply a consequence of slow rate of transport that would not allow detection of the ion flux. More detailed studies would need to be conducted to resolve these questions. We recognize that these go beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We urge the authors to re-evaluate their conclusions on the coupling mechanisms and to re-formulate them in more speculative, hypothetical terms.</italic> </p><p>We thank the senior editor, reviewing editor and the reviewer for their positive comments and suggestions. We have reformulated the paragraph concerning the coupling mechanisms to highlight the more speculative and hypothetical nature of the data presented. We have included the new paragraph below in quotation marks.</p><p>“Are changes in transporter substrate specificity accompanied by changes in coupling stoichiometry?</p><p>Transporters of the SLC15/PepT/PTR/POT/NPF family couple substrate transport to the proton electrochemical gradient with varying coupling stoichiometry depending on substrate.[…] Future studies aimed at identifying the exact coupling stoichiometry for the cyanogenic glucoside and glucosinolate NPF transporters will unravel the mechanistic fine-tuning that accompanies evolution of substrate specificity.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The Reviewing Editor feels that the concerns raised during the last round of review were not addressed. Specifically, the reviewers and the editor argued that the presence or absence of currents cannot be used conclusively to determine the stoichiometry of transport. They have suggested that the corresponding section of the manuscript was rewritten in more speculative terms. However, the revised manuscript contains more definitive description of stoichiometry, which the Reviewing Editor deems inappropriate.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for not explaining more specifically in our reply letter about our reason for writing as we did in the previous revised version of the manuscript. We also thank editor for providing us with an additional opportunity to address these concerns.</p><p>We agree with the reviewing editor’s opinion that the exact stoichiometry cannot be determined based on the presence or absence of currents. We used the term “apparent stoichiometry” and substituted show with suggests/indicate to convey the uncertain nature of the measurements. However, in hindsight we see that this did not accommodate reviewer and editor’s concerns. Consequently, we have now completely rewritten the paragraph in more speculative terms.</p><p>We now strictly refer to whether or not detectable currents where measured when a given substrate was transported by the different transporters in our study. Rather than inferring stoichiometries from these observations, the potential underlying reasons for why we see differences in detectable currents are now conveyed in what we believe are speculative terms that are subject to future studies (see below).</p><p><italic>Moreover, the new version seems to contain erroneous statements. For example, in one case the authors write: &quot;…the apparent coupling stoichiometry changes specifically to 1:1 for aliphatic glucosinolates (no 4MTB over-accumulation, no induced currents)…&quot;. This does not seem to make sense. If there is 1:1 coupling, there should be concentrative transport and over-accumulation.</italic> </p><p>This part and these speculations have now been removed from the paper. We agree that relating the absence of current for the transporter in question here (AtGTR3) to a given glucosinolate to proton stoichiometry is premature. We expect to address these interesting findings in future studies.</p><p><italic>We again urge the authors to rewrite the paragraph in less definitive more speculative terms and remove the corresponding stoichiometry table, which, in our opinion, over-interprets the data.</italic> </p><p>We have removed:</p><p>– The stoichiometry table and references to it in the text</p><p>– The cation symbols and label from Figure 7 and edited figure legend</p><p>– Completely rewritten the paragraph previously talking about stoichiometries to avoid mentioning of deduced “apparent stoichiometries”. We report that the transport mechanism by which glucosinolates and cyanogenic glucosides are transported by the potential transition transporter Me14g074000 does not induce currents. This is in contrast to substrate transport by MeCGTR1 and At/Br/CpGTRs which all induce strong negative currents when exposed to their substrate. This indicates that there is a difference in the electrogenecity of the underlying transport mechanism. We then suggest that future studies should be aimed at unravelling whether the changes in electrogenicity are caused by changes in stoichiometry.</p><p>The new paragraph can be found in subsection “Is evolution of new substrate specificity in the NPF accompanied by changes in transporter electrogenicity?</p><p>We have further made changes that were required as a consequence of our changes to the rewrite of the paragraph discussed above as well as minor moderations of the Abstract to accommodate the 150 word max.</p><p><italic>If the authors disagree with us, we would like to hear their arguments as the letter accompanying the re-submitted manuscript does contain any discussion of the concerns raised by the reviewers and the Editor.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewing editor for the chance to moderate our response and for the continued dialog discussing this very interesting observation. I hope that we now have satisfactorily addressed the concerns raised and look forward to hearing from you.</p></body></sub-article></article>
