Many axonal growth cones follow the instruction of a set of guidance cues until they reach their intermediate targets; they then switch their responsiveness to follow new guidance cues which allow them to navigate to the next intermediate targets (or the final targets). The mechanisms of these important switches are not well understood. In the developing spinal cord, commissural axons arise from the dorsal margin, project along the dorsal–ventral axis and then turn anteriorly after they have reached and crossed the ventral midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bovolenta and Dodd, 1990</xref>). Wnts are expressed in a decreasing anterior-to-posterior gradient in the floor plate and direct the post-crossing commissural axons to turn anteriorly after midline crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lyuksyutova et al., 2003</xref>). Previous work showed that components of the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway mediates Wnt attraction and anterior turning of commissural axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lyuksyutova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shafer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zou, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Onishi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Onishi et al., 2014</xref>). We report here that Shh–Smoothened (Smo) signaling activates PCP signaling by inhibiting the expression of Shisa2, an inhibitor of Wnt signaling that blocks Frizzled3 (Fzd3) glycosylation and cell-surface presentation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increased Shisa2 expression in dorsal commissural neurons in Smoothened (Smo) conditional knockout mice</title><p>As Shh is a major signaling molecule in the ventral midline, we hypothesized that Shh signaling may regulate the expression of genes relevant to the switch of responsiveness of commissural neurons during midline crossing.

To localize commissural neuron cell bodies, we performed combined fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry with a dI1 neuronal marker, Lhx2. Lhx2 is expressed in dI1 neurons derived from Atoh1-positive pdI1 progenitors. The dI1 neurons, which express high levels of Lhx2 (Lhx2<sup>high</sup>) at E11.5, project axons contralaterally (dI1c), whereas the Lhx2<sup>low</sup> (and Lhx9<sup>high</sup>) dI1 neurons, which are located ventral to the Lhx2<sup>high</sup> neurons at E11.5, project axons ipsilaterally (dI1i) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ding et al., 2012</xref>).

We first tested whether mouse Shisa2 interacts with mouse Fzd3 by co-immunoprecipitation and found that Fzd3 and Shisa2 interact with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). As a control, we also tested interaction between Shisa2 and Insulin receptor β (IRβ), a cell-surface receptor unrelated to Fzd3, and found that IRβ was not co-immunoprecipitated with Shisa2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We previously reported that mouse Fzd3 is glycosylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Onishi et al., 2013</xref>). When expressed in HEK293 cells, Fzd3 shows three major bands, which correspond to ‘phosphorylated and glycosylated’, ‘glycosylated’ and ‘unphosphorylated and unglycosylated (unmodified)’ proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We found that Shisa2 reduced the amount of ‘phosphorylated and glycosylated’ and ‘glycosylated’ Fzd3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>); the major form of Fzd3 that co-immunoprecipitated with Shisa2 is the ‘unmodified’ form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We then analyzed the level of Fzd3 at the cell surface using a surface biotinylation assay and found that Shisa2 expression robustly decreased the amount of Fzd3 on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>); the cell surface level of IRβ is meanwhile unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). GAPDH is a cytoplasmic marker and IRβ is a cell surface marker, which allow assessment of fractionation. IRβ was detected both in cell surface fraction and in total cell extract, whereas GAPDH was only found in total extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Finally, we performed immunocytochemistry to characterize Fzd3 localization. In the absence of Shisa2, Fzd3–EGFP is localized diffusely in the membrane compartments of the entire cytoplasmic area and on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In Shisa2–myc-expressing cells, Fzd3–EGFP and Shisa2–myc are colocalized with Calnexin, an ER marker, suggesting that Shisa2 blocks Fzd3–EGFP transport from ER to Golgi and cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that Shisa2 may inhibit Wnt/PCP signaling by inhibiting Fzd3 glycosylation and trafficking to the cell surface.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25269.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Shisa2 inhibits Frizzled3 (Fzd3) glycosylation and translocation to the plasma membrane.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Shisa2 was pulled down by Fzd3 in a co-immunoprecipitation assay.

A recent co-crystal structure of xWnt8 and xFz8 revealed a glycosylation site in the cysteine rich domain (CRD) region of xFz8, which is conserved among all vertebrate Frizzle proteins and which may be important for binding to Wnt ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Janda et al., 2012</xref>). In mouse Fzd3, this site is N42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Fzd3 and Fzd6 have an additional putative glycosylation site (N356 in mouse Fzd3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) in their extracellular loop II. To test whether these putative sites are glycosylated, we made two point mutants, N42Q and N356Q, and the double mutant (2NQ [or N42Q + N356Q]). These Fzd3 mutants, N42Q, N356Q and 2NQ, showed faster mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), suggesting that N42 and N356 are indeed glycosylation sites.

Shisa2 inhibits Fzd3 trafficking to the cell surface by blocking its glycosylation, keeping Wnt/PCP signaling inactive. Consistent with this, Shisa2 expression using a heterologous promoter led to randomized turning of commissural axons along the A–P axis after midline crossing. Furthermore, Shisa2 knockdown induced Vangl2-dependent precocious anterior turning before midline crossing. At this stage of development, Shh is expressed only in the floor plate and other Hedgehogs are not expressed in or near the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). Secreted Shh has two different lipid modifications at its N-terminus and C-terminus (fatty-acid and cholesterol, respectively) that prevent it from diffusing over a long distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sloan et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we propose that Shh in the ventral midline is detected by commissural axons and signals retrogradely to inhibit Shisa2 expression in the cell body. This inhibition allows Fzd3 to be trafficked to the cell surface, resulting in the activation of Wnt/PCP signaling in commissural axon growth cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). We also showed here that <italic>Wls</italic>, an essential component of Wnt secretion, is required for A–P guidance of commissural axons, providing genetic evidence for the role of Wnts in A–P guidance of post-crossing commissural axons. This regulatory link between Shh and PCP signaling pathways may also be important in other developmental processes.</p><p>The mechanisms for axon responsiveness switches are not fully understood and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. The midline is an excellent model system for addressing this fundamental question. Spinal cord commissural neurons are first guided by Netrin1 to grow from the dorsal spinal cord to the ventral midline, where they cross to the contralateral side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kennedy et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Serafini et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Serafini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Podjaski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yung et al., 2015</xref>). After midline crossing, they lose responsiveness to Netrin1 and become responsive to repellents in the floor plate and the ventral spinal cord, such as Semaphorins and Slits, which turn their trajectory from the dorsal-ventral axis to the anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zou et al., 2000</xref>). Recent studies suggest that Netrin1 in the ventricular zone is sufficient to guide commissural axons to grow into the floor plate and that floor plate Netrin1 is not required, indicating that Netrin1 functions at a much shorter-range than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dominici et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Varadarajan et al., 2017</xref>). After midline crossing, commissural axons become responsive to the Wnts, which direct them to turn anteriorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lyuksyutova et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we show that Shh is a midline switch for Wnt/PCP signaling that operates by regulating the mRNA levels of <italic>Shisa2</italic>, which in turn regulates Fzd3 trafficking. We previously observed that it takes approximately 8 hr for commissural axons to cross the midline. This should be sufficient time to downregulate Shisa2 mRNA and protein levels and to allow Fzd3 to be glycosylated and trafficked to the cell surface. This switch mechanism may be optimal for the activation of PCP signaling after midline crossing, given the time it takes to cross the midline. We showed previously that Shh switches on repulsive responses to Semaphorin after midline crossing by inhibiting protein kinase A (PKA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Parra and Zou, 2010</xref>). Therefore, Shh is a switch for growth cone responsiveness to both Wnts and Semaphorins. In addition to Shh, other switches in the midline have been proposed. At the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midline, Frazzled/DCC, a Netrin receptor, transcriptionally activates the expression of Commissureless, allowing attraction to be coupled to the downregulation of repulsion in precrossing commissural axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Neuhaus-Follini and Bashaw, 2015</xref>). In the vertebrate midline, NrCAM and Gdnf activates Plexin-A1 to switch on responsiveness to Sema3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nawabi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Charoy et al., 2012</xref>). Floor-plate-derived neuropilin-2, probably functioning as a Semaphorin sink, was also proposed to be a switch mechanism for Semaphorin responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hernandez-Enriquez et al., 2015</xref>). In rodents, cell-intrinsic signaling proteins, namely the 14-3-3 proteins, were proposed to switch Shh-mediated attraction to repulsion during midline crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Yam et al., 2012</xref>). In chick, Shh binds Glypican 1 to induce the expression of Hhip, which was proposed to mediate repulsion by Shh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bourikas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wilson and Stoeckli, 2013</xref>). Our study here showed that Shh switches on Wnt/PCP signaling by removing an inhibitory mechanism involving Shisa2. Taken together, there may exist highly sophisticated and tightly regulated switch mechanisms to ensure proper changes of responsiveness for axons at intermediate targets. These switch mechanisms can involve gene expression, signal modulation and ligand distribution, which may function together to ensure fidelity.</p><p>Although a gene expression regulatory mechanism linking Shh, Tbx2/Tbx3, Shisa3 and canonical Wnt signaling has been observed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lüdtke et al., 2016</xref>), our study identified a link from Shh to Shisa2 and to non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling, which regulates cellular and tissue morphogenesis through cytoplasmic signaling. Therefore, Shh may determine the time and space of cell polarity signaling through PCP signaling, as well as by gene expression through the canonical Wnt pathway. Currently, we do not know whether Shisa2 is a direct target of Shh–Smo signaling. It is also possible that the <italic>Shisa2</italic> mRNA level is regulated by a posttranscriptional mechanism.</p><p>In this study, we identified two glycosylation sites of Fzd3, one is in the CRD region (N42) and another is in extracellular loop II (N356). It is possible that glycosylation at N42 might be important for the binding affinity with Wnts. Interestingly, the lowest band of the N42Q mutant showed faster mobility than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting the possibility that all Fzd3 protein is glycosylated at N42. We show that glycosylation at N356 is more crucial for cell surface expression of Fzd3, this is a unique glycosylation site for Fzd3 and Fzd6, which may also be important for regulating interactions between Fzd3 and other PCP components.</p><p>This study also presents the missing genetic evidence for Wnts as axon guidance molecules in vertebrates. Owing to the high redundancy of Wnt family members (there are 19 Wnts in mammals), it has been hard to demonstrate that mutations of individual Wnts lead to axon guidance defects in vertebrates. Here, we conditionally knocked out <italic>Wls</italic> from the floor plate and thus perturbed the secretion of all Wnts from the floor plate. We found that post-crossing commissural axons completely lost directionality along the A–P axis, suggesting that Wnts are the key A–P guidance cues for commissural axons in the ventral midline.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and inhibitors</title><p>Anti-GAPDH (MAB374; 1/250000; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2107445">AB_2107445</ext-link>) was purchased from Millipore.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Sonic Hedgehog is a midline switch for Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling in commissural axon guidance&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers and Reviewing Editor agree that your analysis of Wnt and Shh interactions on axon guidance at the spinal cord floor plate is a well-done study on how growth cones switch their response from one cue to another. The introduction of the signaling mechanisms involving a new player, Shisa2, brings together your lab's work on Wnt signaling in A-P projection of commissural neuron axons and sonic hedgehog influences at the ventral midline.</p><p>Your detailed analyses address how commissural growth cones become competent to respond to Wnt signalling as they cross the floor plate: Shh signaling down-regulates the expression of Shisa2 as commissural axons cross the floor plate. Shisa down-regulation in turn is needed to allow glycosylation and cell surface presentation of the Wnt receptor Fzd3, thereby rendering growth cones responsive to Wnt. Support for this idea includes that 1) Shisa and Fzd3 physically interact; maintenance of Shisa expression in commissural neurons randomizes the growth of commissural axons along the A-P axis, whereas its inhibition leads to premature turning; and conditional inactivation of floor plate-derived <italic>Wntless</italic>, a molecule responsible for the secretion of Wnt proteins, also randomizes the growth of commissural axons along the A-P axis.</p><p>The reviewers' positive comments are offset by requests for a number of analyses and controls that they view would strengthen the claims of the paper. None of these constitute new experiments outside of the scope of the current study, but are viewed as essential.<italic>eLife</italic></p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) More careful analysis of the timing and cell type specificity of Shisa2 expression, pre- and during floor plate crossing, since this is a key element of the 'gene expression switch' model:a) A comparison of Shisa2 levels before and after midline crossing would strengthen the role of midline Shh as a switch.b) Double labeling the Shisa2 in situs with a dorsal commissural neuron marker would more convincingly show that Shisa2 is up-regulated specifically in dorsal commissural neurons in the Smo conditional knock out.c) Better evaluation of changes in Fzd glycolsylation, Fzd3 protein localization, and visualization of myc-tagged Shisa2 to evaluate expression are also recommended.</p><p>2) Proper controls especially for the RNAi experiments, i.e. to rescue with an RNAi resistant Shisa2.</p><p>3) To further substantiate a link between Shisa2 and Shh/Wnt function in the in vivo experiments, knock down of Shisa2 in the <italic>Wntless</italic> knockout, which should suppress the premature anterior turning phenotype.</p><p>4) The reviewers struggled with comparing phenotypes with varying disruptions in anterior turning, given the difficulties with standardization of size and locus of DiI injections. The <italic>Wntless</italic> knock-out images are much more striking in terms of axons turning posteriorly than are the Smo knock outs, but the quantification works out to be the same. Please comment.</p><p>5) Textually, the paper is clearly written, but the tone and conclusions need to be modified:</p><p>– The conclusions are overstated and should more precisely reflect the experimental results.</p><p>– The claim that this is the first report of a gene-expression-based switch mechanism by a morphogen in axon guidance at an intermediate target is unfounded. Previous work on response switching at intermediate targets dependent on gene expression changes have been published by the Bashaw, Castellani and Charron labs, and their results compare to the present data.</p><p>– The evidence for a &quot;loop&quot; between Wnt-Shh signalling is thin. The signaling seems to be in one direction: Shh-smo signaling represses Shisa2, and Shisa2 prevents Frizzled3 cell surface expression.</p><p>– If Wnts are concluded to be the major the A-P guidance cue, complete loss of anterior turning should be expected but this is not the case, and in fact axons would be predicted to stall at the midline. Additional information, independent of Wnt, might be involved and should be acknowledged, especially with respect to the <italic>Wntless</italic> knockdown.</p><p>Reviewer # 2:</p><p>1) The main question is how Shisa2 is regulated by Shh/Smo signaling. It was suggested that this is a gene-expression-based mechanism. However, without direct evidence, it is not appropriate to say it is gene-expression based. As indicated in the discussion, Shisa2 mRNA levels could be regulated by many different mechanisms, and it may not be a Gli target.</p><p>2) The effect of Shisa2 and Shh on Fzd3 glycosylation is interesting. However, the western blot comparing endogenous Fzd3 levels used dorsal spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Although it reflects the levels of Fzd3 in the cell body of commissural neurons, it may not reflect the levels of Fzd3 in the growth cone. Is it possible to measure the Fzd3 levels in the axon/growth cone of commissural neurons?</p><p>3) The format of a reference in subsection “Knocking down Shisa2 causes precocious anterior turning of precrossing axons” is wrong.</p><p>Reviewer # 3</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: It is unclear what the significance is of including the Neuropilin data.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: In the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, better negative controls would increase confidence in the interaction. The only controls included are to show that the antibodies to the tags don't non-specifically pull down the target proteins, Ideally the authors could show that Shisa does not bind to some other membrane protein. (3E) There are insets included in the top row of images, but it's unclear why there are insets, and they're not significantly larger than the boxed area they are enlarging.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: (E) the 'changes' in ratio of glycosylated versus unglycosylated Fzd in the Smo knock-outs is not convincing.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>Your manuscript linking Shh signaling and non-canonical Wnt signaling has been improved. Reviewer 2 was satisfied with your revisions but there are some remaining issues cited by reviewers 1 and 3 in their formal review and the consultation that followed that need to be addressed before acceptance. These are summarized below:</p><p>Please note that <italic>eLife</italic> usually doesn't consider multiple revisions especially when it appears that the authors did not strive to address all of the original concerns and/or produce an easily readable manuscript. Needless to say, this will be your last opportunity to fix the manuscript to an acceptable level.</p><p>Reviewer 1, on details of experiments in text and figures:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows that in Smo mutants there is an increase of Shisa mRNA in a population of Lhx2-low neurons positioned dorsally to the dl1c population. Do these neurons project ipsilaterally? Why do they increase Shisa expression as well?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> is not very convincing as it is difficult to determine from where the segments of axons indicated by arrows come from. Can the authors replace this image for a more illustrative one?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, there are many green/flag puncta outside of the growth cones with the exception of the control one. Can the authors provide better images? Such strong background staining casts doubts on the real increase of surface Fzd3.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, there are several axons that seem to project abnormally at the pre-crossing side of the floor plate. This should be explained</p><p>Reviewer 1 and 3, and the Reviewing Editor, have multiple concerns about the text:</p><p>1) The manuscript is still extremely poorly written. It suffers from errors of syntax, usage and grammar throughout, and needs to be completely rewritten.</p><p>2) There is a pervasive lack scholarly acknowledgement of the literature. Reviewer 3 pointed out in his initial review that the paper is poorly referenced and discussed beyond the authors' own data and their interpretation, yet this has not been fully addressed in the revision:a) The authors argue in point 5 of the response to Reviewer 3's initial comments that the work of Charron, Castellani, and Bashaw did not constitute a genuine gene-expression-based switch mechanism by a morphogen in axon guidance at an intermediate target. We agree with Reviewer 3 and would like to see a more cogent discussion and comparison of the work from these three labs in reference to the present data.b) New, very relevant papers on netrin were not cited: two studies have shown that Netrin is actually required in the ventricular zone, not the floor plate and these two studies should be discussed with reference to the authors' findings. Dominici et al., 2017 and Varadarajan et al., 2017. How might these findings interface with the authors' datac) While it is true that the manuscript provides novel evidence for a link between Shh signaling and non-canonical Wnt signaling, as Reviewer 1 has pointed out, there are many examples for a similar relationship with canonical Wnt signaling and these should be referenced.</p><p>3) The conclusions have been largely tempered in the revised manuscript, yet there are remaining places where the claims have not been toned down, with a number of unclear and unsubstantiated claims given special emphasis. Reviewer 3 finds this problem persistent in the revised manuscript, citing an excerpt from the discussion: &quot;In this study, we also noticed that Shh also up regulates the mRNA level of a Semaphorin receptor Neuropilin2 (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), which may further sensitize commissural axon growth cones to Semaphorin. Therefore, Shh is a switch of growth cone responsiveness to both Wnts and Semaphorins.&quot; No experimental evidence is reported in support of this other than the change in Npn expression.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25269.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) More careful analysis of the timing and cell type specificity of Shisa2 expression, pre- and during floor plate crossing, since this is a key element of the 'gene expression switch' model:a) A comparison of Shisa2 levels before and after midline crossing would strengthen the role of midline Shh as a switch.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good suggestion to determine the timing of Shisa2 expression. However, we would like to point out the technical difficulty of distinguishing pre-crossing and post-crossing commissural neurons in the spinal cord. The cell bodies of pre- and post-crossing axons are all intermingled together in the dorsal spinal cord. There are no molecular markers for pre- and post-crossing commissural axons. It is not possible to use anatomical tracing for the following reason. It is true that we can label the postsynaptic axons and identify their cell bodies by injecting DiI to the post-crossing segment of the axons on the contralateral side. But we can’t selectively label the pre-crossing axons/cell bodies by injecting DiI on the ipsilateral side of the spinal cord because the post-crossing axons/cell bodies will also be labeled as the axons need to first go through pre-crossing segment. In addition, there is no good Shisa2 antibody to visualize endogenous Shisa2 protein levels. And even if there is a good Shisa2 antibody, DiI will also be diffused away when we do immunostaining, which needs detergent. Although we could not experimentally demonstrate the timing of Shisa2 protein expression, we would like to propose that Shh signaling is a switch of the Shisa2 protein level when commissural axons are crossing the midline: 1) Shisa2 mRNA is increased in the cell bodies of the dl1 commissural neurons (Lhx2-positive) in Smo cKO crossed with Wnt1-Cre (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) Shh is expressed only in the floor plate and other Hedgehogs are not expressed around the spinal cord at this stage of development (Zhang et al., 2001); 3) Secreted (cleaved N-terminal) Shh has two different lipid modification at its N-terminal and C-terminal (fatty-acid and cholesterol, respectively). Therefore, Shh is a sticky protein and cannot diffuse over a long distance from floor plate to affect gene expression in the dorsal spinal cord (Sloan et al., 2015). We have now emphasized these points in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Double labeling the Shisa2 in situs with a dorsal commissural neuron marker would more convincingly show that Shisa2 is up-regulated specifically in dorsal commissural neurons in the Smo conditional knock out.</p></disp-quote><p>For the suggestion to more carefully analyze the cell type specificity of Shisa2 expression, we were able to use a combination of in situ hybridization for Shisa2 (no Shisa2 antibody available) and immunostaining of Lhx2 (dl1 marker) to demonstrate that Shisa2 gene expression is increased in dl1 neurons in Smo cKO (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we also further tested whether the gene expression level of Shisa2 may affect Frizzled3 cell surface presentation as we proposed and found that Shisa2 knockdown did resulted in increased Frizzlzed3 cell surface level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we propose Shh is a midline switch, which down regulates Shisa2 expression and in turn, lead to the increased Frizzled3 level on the surface of the growth cone membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Better evaluation of changes in Fzd glycolsylation, Fzd3 protein localization, and visualization of myc-tagged Shisa2 to evaluate expression are also recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>As the glycosylated Frizzled3 band runs very close to the non-glycosylated band, it is hard to evaluate changes of glycosylation of Frizzled3. We purchased the “Glycoprotein Isolation Kit, WGA” from ThermoFisher to isolate and compare glycosylated Fzd3. And we found that Fzd3 glycosylation is significantly suppressed in Smoothened cKO. Please see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. To better visualize Fzd3 and Shisa2 localization (in old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), we prepared larger images to show their localization more clearly. Please see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Proper controls especially for the RNAi experiments, i.e. to rescue with an RNAi resistant Shisa2.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to avoid off-target artifacts, we used two different Shisa2 shRNAs and found that they gave rise to very similar phenotypes, suggesting that this phenotype is not because of off-target effect. To further eliminate the possibility of off-target effect, we developed Shisa2 rescue construct, which is insensitive to both shRNA#1 and #2. Then we electroporated shRNA-expressing vector and rescue vector into dorsal spinal cord to see how commissural axons turn. We found that Shisa2 rescue construct restored the precocious turning phenotype of Shisa2 knock down, suggesting that Shisa2 knock down phenotype is due to the reduction of Shisa2 expression level. Please see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To further substantiate a link between Shisa2 and Shh/Wnt function in the in vivo experiments, knock down of Shisa2 in the Wntless knockout, which should suppress the premature anterior turning phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>This would be an excellent experiment. However, due to the limited number of <italic>Wntless</italic> mice we have this experiment would take many more months to finish. To test whether Shisa2 knockdown leas to premature activation of the Wnt/PCP signaling in commissural axons, we decided to also knockdown a key PCP component, Vangl2, as we have shown before that Vangl2 is required for anterior turning of commissural axons (Shafer et al., 2011). We found that double knock down indeed restored the precocious turning phenotype by Shisa2 knock down. This result further supports our working hypothesis. Please see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The reviewers struggled with comparing phenotypes with varying disruptions in anterior turning, given the difficulties with standardization of size and locus of DiI injections.

Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that we quantify these phenotypes by scoring the percentage of injections sites of DiI whether these sites display normal anterior turning. The axons in Smo cKO appear shorter, probably because this spinal cord was younger and the axons did not have enough time to grow along the anterior-posterior axis after midline crossing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Textually, the paper is clearly written, but the tone and conclusions need to be modified:</p><p>– The conclusions are overstated and should more precisely reflect the experimental results.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the conclusions to more precisely reflect the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The claim that this is the first report of a gene-expression-based switch mechanism by a morphogen in axon guidance at an intermediate target is unfounded. Previous work on response switching at intermediate targets dependent on gene expression changes have been published by the Bashaw, Castellani and Charron labs, and their results compare to the present data.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer bringing this up. Bashaw lab did show that Frazzled/DCC regulates Comm transcription in a netrin-independent manner. “A Frazzled:DCC-dependent Transcriptional Switch Regulates Midline Axon Guidance” from Dr. Bashaw (Science 2009). So our paper is indeed not the first gene-expression based switch, although it is the first morphogen triggered gene expression switch. We will modify the conclusion to the first Shh morphogen triggered mRNA level change.</p><p>We would like to clarify that Castellani did not show gene-expression based switch. They showed proteolysis of PlexinA1 is inhibited by NrCAM and GDNF secreted from floor plate, turning on Sema-Plexin signaling after floor plate.</p><p>We would also like to clarify that Charron showed expression level of some 14-3-3 proteins changes during in vitro culture (2 DIV vs 3DIV). However, they didn’t show whether this is regulated transcriptionally or translationally.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The evidence for a &quot;loop&quot; between Wnt-Shh signalling is thin. The signaling seems to be in one direction: Shh-smo signaling represses Shisa2, and Shisa2 prevents Frizzled3 cell surface expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We really appreciate this. It was a misuse of the word. We meant to say “link”. We will remove the “loop” words from the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– If Wnts are concluded to be the major the A-P guidance cue, complete loss of anterior turning should be expected but this is not the case, and in fact axons would be predicted to stall at the midline. Additional information, independent of Wnt, might be involved and should be acknowledged, especially with respect to the Wntless knockdown.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that if Wnts are the main A-P guidance cues, the phenotype should be random turn along the anterior-posterior axis, half turning anterior and the other half turning posterior. This would be the true loss of guidance. Because there are still repulsive cues from the floor plate and the ventral spinal cord, which prevent straight elongation after exiting floor plate or recrossing the midline (Zou et al., 2000), axons turn both anteriorly and posteriorly along the floor plate. If there are other cues for A-P guidance, then axons should still turn anteriorly as the other cues should still work without Wnts. If all axons turn posteriorly, then it means that there are other cues that turn axons posteriorly and Wnts normally overcome that. The fact that axons turn randomly along A-P axis supports the proposal that Wnts are the main (or only) A-P guidance cues. This is what we observed. Our finding that Shh regulate PCP signaling suggests that Shh’s role in A-P guidance is indirect. We would like to mention that after we discovered that Wnts guide axons along the A-P axis in the spinal cord, a number of studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> showed that Wnts are A-P guidance cues and no other cues were implicated in those cases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer # 2:</p><p>1) The main question is how Shisa2 is regulated by Shh/Smo signaling.

As indicated in the discussion, Shisa2 mRNA levels could be regulated by many different mechanisms, and it may not be a Gli target.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the technical limitation (no good commercial antibody to do mouse Gli ChIP experiments), we could not conclude that our findings are dependent or independent of Gli. We will not say it is gene-expression based. Instead, we will say it is Shisa2 mRNA level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The effect of Shisa2 and Shh on Fzd3 glycosylation is interesting. However, the western blot comparing endogenous Fzd3 levels used dorsal spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Although it reflects the levels of Fzd3 in the cell body of commissural neurons, it may not reflect the levels of Fzd3 in the growth cone. Is it possible to measure the Fzd3 levels in the axon/growth cone of commissural neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>Because not only commissural neurons, but also many other cell types are expressed Fzd3, so it is difficult to visualize endogenous Fzd3 in the growth cone in vivo. This is why we could only show the glycosylation level of Fzd3 using dorsal spinal cord extract to show the overall level of Frizzled3 glycosylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The format of a reference in subsection “Knocking down Shisa2 causes precocious anterior turning of precrossing axons” is wrong.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this.

We tried IRβ, which is not sensitive to Shisa2 expression according to our result, and found that it was not co-immunoprecipitated with Shisa2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To visualize Fzd3 and Shisa2 localization (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), we prepared larger images to show their localization clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: (E) the 'changes' in ratio of glycosylated versus unglycosylated Fzd in the Smo knock-outs is not convincing.

Since Shisa2 is myc-tagged, what does shisa-myc expression look like in these neurons? Do the authors observe any difference in Fzd levels or localization in these conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion. In order to test whether endogenous Shisa2 regulates Fzd3 trafficking in the growth cones of commissural neurons, we utilized the construct in which Frizzled3 was tagged with tdTomato to the carboxyl domain and the FLAG epitope tag was engineered to the extracellular N-terminus (Onishi et al., 2013), and labeled cell surface Fzd3 using anti-Flag antibodies, while total Fzd3 can be detected by tdTomato signal. We electroporated this construct together with Shisa2 shRNA plasmid, and found that more Fzd3 is present on the cell surface when Shisa2 is knocked down. This further supports that Shisa2 indeed suppresses Fzd3 surface presentation in commissural neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: Shisa2 is knocked down with shRNA. The authors need to show that this phenotype can be rescued by over-expression of an RNAi-resistant Shisa2 construct.</p></disp-quote><p>Two different shRNAs showed very similar phenotype, suggesting that this phenotype is not because of off-target effect. To further eliminate the possibility of off-target effect, we constructed Shisa2 rescue construct, which is insensitive to both shRNA#1 and #2. We then electroporated the shRNA-expressing vector and the rescue vector into the dorsal spinal cord to see how commissural axons turn. We found that Shisa2 rescue construct restored the precocious turning phenotype of Shisa2 knock down, suggesting that Shisa2 knock down phenotype is due to the reduction of Shisa2 expression level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>: Can Frizzled3 protein localization be visualized by immunofluorescence?

In addition, the endogenous Frizzled3 level is very low. Therefore, we have tried to test exogenous Fzd3 in the commissural neuronal growth cones. However, overexpression of Fzd3 strongly suppressed axon elongation in ex vivo open book explants. All axons could not reach to the floor plate. Therefore, we tested the Frizzled3 localization in Shisa2 overepressing commissural neurons in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that Shisa2 does reduce the cell surface presentation of Frizzled3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>: a positive control for FGF inhibition is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this. Both inhibitors inhibit kinase activity, so we tested whether these can inhibit autophosphorylation of FGFR in our context, and found that only LY2874455 can blocks autophosphorylation (p-Y653/Y654) significantly, so we removed the data about CH-5183284.

Do these neurons project ipsilaterally? Why do they increase Shisa expression as well?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good question. These may be later-born Lhx2<sup>high</sup> dI1 neurons, whose expression of Lhx2 is still not fully activated. In this case, they should have increased Shisa2 level. However, our current goal is to test whether Shisa2 is indeed up regulated in Smo cKO and the Lhx2<sup>high</sup> dl1 neurons do show higher Shisa2 level. We have now included this discussion in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> is not very convincing as it is difficult to determine from where the segments of axons indicated by arrows come from. Can the authors replace this image for a more illustrative one?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for this suggestion. We have now replaced this image for more illustrative ones that show the crossing and post-crossing segments. These new images have fewer axons and thus are clearer. We should clarify that due to the thickness of the spinal cord open-book explant, we are not able to show the entire trajectory to include the pre-crossing segment, which are buried in the thick gray matter of the ventral spinal cord. But we have confirmed that all these are commissural axons originated from the dorsal spinal cord, an experimental system that my lab established and used in a number of publications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, there are many green/flag puncta outside of the growth cones with the exception of the control one. Can the authors provide better images? Such strong background staining casts doubts on the real increase of surface Fzd3.</p></disp-quote><p>We again appreciate this suggestion and provide new images with less background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, there are several axons that seem to project abnormally at the pre-crossing side of the floor plate. This should be explained</p></disp-quote><p>This is due to the intrinsic feature of DiI labeling technique as DiI sometimes diffuses to label other classes of neurons, usually more ventral to the dl1 neurons, that turn anterior-posterior before crossing. They tend to have a clear growth pattern and look different from misguided axons, which tend to show inconsistent wondering patterns and turn anterior-posterior randomly. We now explain this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1 and 3, and the Reviewing Editor, have multiple concerns about the text:</p><p>1) The manuscript is still extremely poorly written. It suffers from errors of syntax, usage and grammar throughout, and needs to be completely rewritten.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the alert. We have now rewritten the text throughout, hoping that it is much improved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is a pervasive lack scholarly acknowledgement of the literature. Reviewer 3 pointed out in his initial review that the paper is poorly referenced and discussed beyond the authors' own data and their interpretation, yet this has not been fully addressed in the revision:a) The authors argue in point 5 of the response to Reviewer 3's initial comments that the work of Charron, Castellani, and Bashaw did not constitute a genuine gene-expression-based switch mechanism by a morphogen in axon guidance at an intermediate target. We agree with Reviewer 3 and would like to see a more cogent discussion and comparison of the work from these three labs in reference to the present data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now expanded our Discussion to include more completely the work done about the midline guidance and have written a comprehensive review about all the switch mechanisms reported. In paragraph # 2 in the Discussion section, we added 16 new references. This helps to put our work in the context of others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) New, very relevant papers on netrin were not cited: two studies have shown that Netrin is actually required in the ventricular zone, not the floor plate and these two studies should be discussed with reference to the authors' findings. Dominici et al., 2017 and Varadarajan et al., 2017. How might these findings interface with the authors' data?</p></disp-quote><p>These two new papers about Netrin are not directly related to our paper as our paper does not deal with switch of responsiveness to Netrin. These two Netrin papers highlight the short-range nature of Netrin function, which is very important. The Wnt gradient along the anterior-posterior axis is created by graded levels of gene expression, not by diffusion. Wnts are not very diffusible and commissural axons turn at the border of the floor plate where Wnts are produced. Therefore, the newly found mechanism of Netrin action actually fits very well with how Wnts function (also short-range). We now cite the two new papers as they provide a more precise view about axon guidance mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) While it is true that the manuscript provides novel evidence for a link between Shh signaling and non-canonical Wnt signaling, as Reviewer 1 has pointed out, there are many examples for a similar relationship with canonical Wnt signaling and these should be referenced.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good point. Urged by the reviewer, we also found a recent paper (2016) that reports a link from Shh to Tbx2/Tbx3 to Shisa3 to canonical Wnt signaling. Therefore, we now point out that our work extends the connection from Shh to PCP (non-canonical signaling), which leads to cellular and tissue morphogenesis, instead of gene expression. This suggests that Shh may use this link to exert precise temporal and spatial control of cell polarity signaling in the cytoplasm that leads to cellular and tissue morphology. We have now revised this part of discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The conclusions have been largely tempered in the revised manuscript, yet there are remaining places where the claims have not been toned down, with a number of unclear and unsubstantiated claims given special emphasis. Reviewer 3 finds this problem persistent in the revised manuscript, citing an excerpt from the discussion: &quot;In this study, we also noticed that Shh also up regulates the mRNA level of a Semaphorin receptor Neuropilin2 (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), which may further sensitize commissural axon growth cones to Semaphorin. Therefore, Shh is a switch of growth cone responsiveness to both Wnts and Semaphorins.&quot; No experimental evidence is reported in support of this other than the change in Npn expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried again to tone down conclusion everywhere in the paper. “Shh is a switch of responsiveness to both Wnts and Semaphorins” refers to a previous paper from our lab (Parra and Zou, 2009). In this study, we found that Neuroplilin2 was down regulated in commissural neurons in Smo cKO and we were using Neuropilin2 as our internal control for our RNAseq and in situ hybridization. The activation of the expression regulation of Neuropilin2 is potentially relevant to the role of Shh in activating semophorin and would be consistent with our 2009 paper. However, we semaphoring switch is not the focus of this paper and we do not provide more direct test of the role of Neuropilin2. Therefore, including Neuropilin2 as a control and discussing Neuropilin2 causes confusion. Therefore, we have removed all data about Neuropilin2 in the paper.</p><p>References</p><p>Sloan, T.F.W., Qasaimeh, M.A., Juncker, D., Yam, P.T., and Charron, F.
